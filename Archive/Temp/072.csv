Considering that additional sensitization elicits more severe allergic reactions upon the next allergen challenge, suppression of the boosting phase represents an efficacious way to prevent and ameliorate allergic diseases. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of allergen-specific monoclonal IgA on allergic diseases. This antibody acts by decreasing immune responses upon exposure to allergens in mice previously sensitized by a monoclonal IgE that recognizes the allergen. The lack of inhibitory effects of anti-ovalbumin monoclonal IgA (OA-4) on either the binding of anti-ovalbumin monoclonal IgE (OE-1) to ovalbumin by ELISA or on ovalbumin-induced degranulation of rat basophilic leukemia RBL2H3 cells sensitized with OE-1 indicated that OA-4 and OE-1 recognized different epitopes on ovalbumin. Immune responses (anti-ovalbumin IgG1 production and cytokine release from splenocytes) induced by intravenous ovalbumin challenge in DBA/1J mice passively sensitized with OE-1 were inhibited by intravenous injection of OA-4 15 min before challenge without affecting anaphylaxis. Moreover, OA-4 injection 1 h after ovalbumin challenge also effectively suppressed immune responses. The achievement of immunosuppression by IgA injection occurred even after allergen challenge in mice in an epitope-independent fashion. These findings suggest that monoclonal IgA administered at the time of hospitalization of a patient with allergic symptoms, who was already exposed to the allergen in the presence of IgE recognizing an undefined epitope(s) on the allergen, should effectively relieve allergic disease through its immunosuppressive effects.","['Yamaki, Kouya', 'Yoshino, Shin']","['Yamaki K', 'Yoshino S']","['Department of Pharmacology, Kobe Pharmaceutical University , Kobe, Hyogo, Japan .']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Monoclon Antib Immunodiagn Immunother,Monoclonal antibodies in immunodiagnosis and immunotherapy,101590955,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,"['Adaptive Immunity', 'Animals', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'Female', 'Hybridomas', 'Hypersensitivity/immunology/*therapy', 'Immunoglobulin A/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Immunoglobulin E/*immunology', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Immunotherapy', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Protein Binding']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/mab.2014.0078 [doi]'],ppublish,Monoclon Antib Immunodiagn Immunother. 2015 Apr;34(2):83-9. doi: 10.1089/mab.2014.0078.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE DESCRIPTION: A 25-year-old man was diagnosed with CML in chronic phase. He first received treatment with hydroxyurea, achieving hematological remission and following imatinib mesylate for main treatment. A year later, he began to appear unexplained high fever with ineffective antibiotic treatment and bone morrow and blood tests indicated blast crisis. Both BCR/ABL 210 and BCR/ABL 190 fusion transcript were positive. Imatinib resistance was confirmed by a screening for ABL kinase domain E255K mutations, and dasatinib was administered. After two months, the patient went on to hematological remission. DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION: During medical treatment for CML, we experienced a relatively rare case with co-expression of the p210 and p190 encoding BCR-ABL transcripts in blastic phase. Imatinib resistance was confirmed and remission wasn't easily obtained, yet dasatinib was helpful. When resistance emerges, the treatment options include increasing the daily dose of imatinib, or combining imatinib with other agents. Of course, dasatinib, nilotinib and bone marrow transplantation are good choice as well. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of p-190 transcript in CML may be related to progression of the disease. Thus monitoring the resistance of imatinib in CML patients, especially for advanced phase CML and BCR-ABL ALL, may be meaningful to guide clinical treatment and predict the prognosis.","['Junmei, Zhao', 'Fengkuan, Yu', 'Yongping, Song', 'Baijun, Fang', 'Yuzhang, Liu', 'Lina, Liu', 'Qinglan, Zhang']","['Junmei Z', 'Fengkuan Y', 'Yongping S', 'Baijun F', 'Yuzhang L', 'Lina L', 'Qinglan Z']","['Henan Key Lab of Experimental Haematology, Henan Institute of Haematology, Henan Tumor Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, 127 Dongming Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province 450008 China.', 'Henan Key Lab of Experimental Haematology, Henan Institute of Haematology, Henan Tumor Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, 127 Dongming Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province 450008 China.', 'Henan Key Lab of Experimental Haematology, Henan Institute of Haematology, Henan Tumor Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, 127 Dongming Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province 450008 China.', 'Henan Key Lab of Experimental Haematology, Henan Institute of Haematology, Henan Tumor Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, 127 Dongming Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province 450008 China.', 'Henan Key Lab of Experimental Haematology, Henan Institute of Haematology, Henan Tumor Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, 127 Dongming Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province 450008 China.', 'Henan Key Lab of Experimental Haematology, Henan Institute of Haematology, Henan Tumor Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, 127 Dongming Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province 450008 China.', 'Henan Key Lab of Experimental Haematology, Henan Institute of Haematology, Henan Tumor Hospital affiliated to Zhengzhou University, 127 Dongming Road, Zhengzhou, Henan Province 450008 China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Springerplus,SpringerPlus,101597967,,,,2015/04/22 06:00,2015/04/22 06:01,['2015/04/22 06:00'],"['2014/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/22 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40064-015-0930-x [doi]', '930 [pii]']",epublish,Springerplus. 2015 Apr 9;4:170. doi: 10.1186/s40064-015-0930-x. eCollection 2015.,20150409,PMC4397260,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Ematinib', 'Rsistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the molecular mechanisms regulating noscapine activity remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that cylindromatosis (CYLD), a microtubule-associated tumor suppressor protein, modulates the activity of noscapine both in cell lines and in primary cells of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy reveal that CYLD increases the ability of noscapine to induce mitotic arrest and apoptosis. Examination of cellular microtubules as well as in vitro assembled microtubules shows that CYLD enhances the effect of noscapine on microtubule polymerization. Microtubule cosedimentation and fluorescence titration assays further reveal that CYLD interacts with microtubule outer surface and promotes noscapine binding to microtubules. These findings thus demonstrate CYLD as a critical regulator of noscapine activity and have important implications for ALL treatment.","['Yang, Yunfan', 'Ran, Jie', 'Sun, Lei', 'Sun, Xiaodong', 'Luo, Youguang', 'Yan, Bing', 'Tala', 'Liu, Min', 'Li, Dengwen', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Bao, Gang', 'Zhou, Jun']","['Yang Y', 'Ran J', 'Sun L', 'Sun X', 'Luo Y', 'Yan B', 'Tala', 'Liu M', 'Li D', 'Zhang L', 'Bao G', 'Zhou J']","['1.

Here, we show that Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) B lymphoma Moloney murine leukemia virus insertion region1 homolog (BMI1) POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX1 (PRC1) components participate in the repression of microRNA156 (miR156). Loss of AtBMI1 function leads to the up-regulation of the primary transcript of MIR156A and MIR156C at the time the levels of miR156 should decline, resulting in an extended juvenile phase and delayed flowering. Conversely, the PRC1 component EMBRYONIC FLOWER (EMF1) participates in the regulation of SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE and MIR172 genes. Accordingly, plants impaired in EMF1 function displayed misexpression of these genes early in development, which contributes to a CONSTANS-independent up-regulation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) leading to the earliest flowering phenotype described in Arabidopsis. Our findings show how the different regulatory roles of two functional PRC1 variants coordinate the acquisition of flowering competence and help to reach the threshold of FT necessary to flower.

Patient 1 was a 5-month-old female with clinical features typical of autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) and markedly elevated TCRalphabeta(+)CD4(-)CD8(-) T cell numbers. Genetic analyses failed to detect an ALPS-related gene mutation; however, whole exome sequencing and other genetic analyses revealed somatic mosaicism for the G13D NRAS mutation. These data were indivative of NRAS-associated RALD with highly elevated alphabeta-double-negative T cells. Patient 2 was a 12-month-old girl with recurrent fever who clearly met the diagnostic criteria for juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML). Genetic analyses revealed somatic mosaicism, again for the G13D NRAS mutation, suggesting RALD associated with somatic NRAS mosaicism. Notably, unlike most JMML cases, Patient 2 did not require steroids or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Genetic analysis of RAS should be performed in patients fulfilling the diagnostic criteria for ALPS in the absence of ALPS-related gene mutations if the patients have elevated alphabeta-double-negative-T cells and in JMML patients if autoimmunity is detected.

Imidazoacridinone C-1311, a DNA-reactive inhibitor of topoisomerase II, has been previously shown to be a potent and selective inhibitor of recombinant FLT3. Here, we expand those findings by studying its effect on leukemia cells with wild-type FLT3, FLT3-ITD mutant and no FLT3 receptor. While brief C-1311 exposure blocked wild-type and FLT3-ITD activity, profound and sustained inhibition was achieved only for FLT3-ITD mutants. C-1311 inhibited FLT3 downstream pathways (MAPK and AKT) independent of FLT3 status, yet translation to decreased viability was significant in FLT3-ITD cells. RNA interference against FLT3-ITD reduced cytotoxic effect and apoptosis induced by C-1311, indicating selective inhibition of FLT3-ITD crucial for high efficacy of drug against activated leukemia cells. Cellular responses in treated FLT3-ITD mutants included G1 and G2/M phase arrest, moderate inhibition of Bcl-2, caspase-3 activation, PARP cleavage, and depolarization of mitochondria. Consistent with selective decrease in FLT3-ITD activity, C-1311 remarkably reduced antiapoptotic survivin mRNA and protein expression, correlating well with enhanced apoptosis of FLT3-ITD cells. No survivin decrease and respectively lower level of apoptosis was found in wild-type and null-FLT3 cells. Combination of C-1311 with cytarabine or doxorubicin again showed distinct synergistic activity in FLT3-ITD-positive cells. The ability of C-1311 to selectively target constitutively active FLT3, suggests a favorable therapeutic index for AML carrying FLT3-ITD mutations. Thus further preclinical and clinical studies addressing its potency against FLT3-ITD kinase is well justified.","['Skwarska, Anna', 'Augustin, Ewa', 'Beffinger, Michal', 'Wojtczyk, Anita', 'Konicz, Sonia', 'Laskowska, Katarzyna', 'Polewska, Joanna']","['Skwarska A', 'Augustin E', 'Beffinger M', 'Wojtczyk A', 'Konicz S', 'Laskowska K', 'Polewska J']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Chemical Faculty, Gdansk University of Technology, Gdansk, Poland.

Here we show that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells from most patients with AML are deficient in a critical enzyme required for arginine synthesis, argininosuccinate synthetase-1 (ASS1). Thus, these ASS1-deficient AML cells are dependent on importing extracellular arginine. We therefore investigated the effect of plasma arginine deprivation using pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG 20) against primary AMLs in a xenograft model and in vitro. ADI-PEG 20 alone induced responses in 19 of 38 AMLs in vitro and 3 of 6 AMLs in vivo, leading to caspase activation in sensitive AMLs. ADI-PEG 20-resistant AMLs showed higher relative expression of ASS1 than sensitive AMLs. This suggests that the resistant AMLs survive by producing arginine through this metabolic pathway and ASS1 expression could be used as a biomarker for response. Sensitive AMLs showed more avid uptake of arginine from the extracellular environment consistent with their auxotrophy for arginine. The combination of ADI-PEG 20 and cytarabine chemotherapy was more effective than either treatment alone resulting in responses in 6 of 6 AMLs tested in vivo. Our data show that arginine deprivation is a reasonable strategy in AML that paves the way for clinical trials.","['Miraki-Moud, Farideh', 'Ghazaly, Essam', 'Ariza-McNaughton, Linda', 'Hodby, Katharine A', 'Clear, Andrew', 'Anjos-Afonso, Fernando', 'Liapis, Konstantinos', 'Grantham, Marianne', 'Sohrabi, Fareeda', 'Cavenagh, Jamie', 'Bomalaski, John S', 'Gribben, John G', 'Szlosarek, Peter W', 'Bonnet, Dominique', 'Taussig, David C']","['Miraki-Moud F', 'Ghazaly E', 'Ariza-McNaughton L', 'Hodby KA', 'Clear A', 'Anjos-Afonso F', 'Liapis K', 'Grantham M', 'Sohrabi F', 'Cavenagh J', 'Bomalaski JS', 'Gribben JG', 'Szlosarek PW', 'Bonnet D', 'Taussig DC']","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', ""Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, United Kingdom;"", 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', ""Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, United Kingdom;"", 'Department of Haemato-Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, United Kingdom;', 'Cytogenetics Department, Barts Health National Health Service Trust, Royal London Hospital, London, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Polaris Pharmaceuticals Inc., San Diego, CA;', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Centre for Molecular Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom; and.', ""Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Cancer Research UK London Research Institute, Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, United Kingdom;"", 'Department of Haemato-Oncology, Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, United Kingdom; The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.3.6 (ADI PEG20)', 'EC 6.3.4.5 (Argininosuccinate Synthase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arginine/metabolism', 'Argininosuccinate Synthase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/*pharmacology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polyethylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/04/22 06:00,2015/09/05 06:00,['2015/04/22 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31509-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-608133 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 25;125(26):4060-8. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-608133.

Prophylactic therapy is neurotoxic, and a third of the relapses involve the CNS. Increased expression of interleukin 15 (IL-15) in leukemic blasts is associated with increased risk for CNS-ALL. Using in vivo models for CNS leukemia caused by mouse T-ALL and human xenografts of ALL cells, we demonstrate that expression of IL-15 in leukemic cells is associated with the activation of natural killer (NK) cells. This activation limits the outgrowth of leukemic cells in the periphery, but less in the CNS because NK cells are excluded from the CNS. Depletion of NK cells in NOD/SCID mice enabled combined systemic and CNS leukemia of human pre-B-ALL. The killing of human leukemia lymphoblasts by NK cells depended on the expression of the NKG2D receptor. Analysis of bone marrow (BM) diagnostic samples derived from children with subsequent CNS-ALL revealed a significantly high expression of the NKG2D and NKp44 receptors. We suggest that the CNS may be an immunologic sanctuary protected from NK-cell activity. CNS prophylactic therapy may thus be needed with emerging NK cell-based therapies against hematopoietic malignancies.","['Frishman-Levy, Liron', 'Shemesh, Avishai', 'Bar-Sinai, Allan', 'Ma, Chao', 'Ni, Zhenya', 'Frenkel, Shahar', 'Muench, Vera', 'Bruckmueller, Hilke', 'Vokuhl, Christian', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Eckert, Cornelia', 'Stanulla, Martin', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Campbell, Kerry S', 'Loewenthal, Ron', 'Schewe, Denis M', 'Hochman, Jacob', 'Meyer, Lueder H', 'Kaufman, Dan', 'Cario, Gunnar', 'Porgador, Angel', 'Izraeli, Shai']","['Frishman-Levy L', 'Shemesh A', 'Bar-Sinai A', 'Ma C', 'Ni Z', 'Frenkel S', 'Muench V', 'Bruckmueller H', 'Vokuhl C', 'Debatin KM', 'Eckert C', 'Stanulla M', 'Schrappe M', 'Campbell KS', 'Loewenthal R', 'Schewe DM', 'Hochman J', 'Meyer LH', 'Kaufman D', 'Cario G', 'Porgador A', 'Izraeli S']","['Childhood Leukemia Research Section, Department of Pediatric Oncology and the Cancer Research Center, Edmond and Lily Safra Children Hospital and Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel; Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel;', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences and The National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel;', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel;', 'Department of Medicine and Stem Cell Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Medicine and Stem Cell Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Ocular Oncology Service, Department of Ophthalmology, Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel;', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany;', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Kiel, Germany;', 'Department of Pediatric Pathology, University Hospital Schleswig Hostein, Kiel, Germany;', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany;', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitats Medizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany;', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany;', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Kiel, Germany;', 'The Research Institute of Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA; and.', 'Tissue Typing Laboratory and National Laboratory for Solid Organ Transplants, Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Kiel, Germany;', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Alexander Silberman Institute of Life Sciences, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel;', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany;', 'Department of Medicine and Stem Cell Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein, Kiel, Germany;', 'The Shraga Segal Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Genetics, Faculty of Health Sciences and The National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel;', 'Childhood Leukemia Research Section, Department of Pediatric Oncology and the Cancer Research Center, Edmond and Lily Safra Children Hospital and Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Ramat Gan, Israel; Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Interleukin-15)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*immunology/metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-15/metabolism', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism/mortality/pathology']",2015/04/22 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/04/22 06:00'],"['2014/08/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31606-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-08-595108 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 28;125(22):3420-31. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-08-595108.

Undoubtedly, this experience has highlighted the value of antigen-specific immunotherapy in AML. A wide variety of therapeutics directed against several different antigens on AML cells are currently explored in preclinical and early clinical studies. On the one hand, these include passive strategies such as unconjugated antibodies targeting one or more antigens, antibodies armed with drugs, toxic proteins, or radionuclides, or adoptive immunotherapies, in particular utilizing T cells engineered to express chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) or modified T cell receptor (TCR) genes; on the other hand, these include active strategies such as vaccinations. With the documented benefit for GO and the emerging data with several classes of therapeutics in other leukemias, in particular small bispecific antibodies and CAR T cells, the future is bright. Nevertheless, a number of important questions related to the choice of target antigen(s), patient population, exact treatment modality, and supportive care needs remain open. Addressing such questions in upcoming studies will ultimately be required to optimize the clinical use of antigen-specific immunotherapies in AML and ensure that such treatments become an effective, versatile tool for this disease for which the outcomes have remained unsatisfactory in many patients.","['Buckley, Sarah A', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Buckley SA', 'Walter RB']","['Hematology/Oncology Fellowship Program, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)']",IM,"['Aminoglycosides/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Gemtuzumab', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/02/18 06:00,['2015/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11899-015-0250-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2015 Jun;10(2):65-75. doi: 10.1007/s11899-015-0250-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about its role in acute leukemia (AL). METHODS: We determined ADRM1 expression levels in both untreated AL samples and leukemia cell lines using real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot analysis. Growth curves, colony formation assays, cell cycle and apoptosis analyses, cell migration and invasion assays and NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation assays via Western blotting were used to examine the biological behavior of HL60 cells and the underlying mechanism. RESULTS: ADRM1 was upregulated in both untreated AL samples and leukemia cell lines. ADRM1 knockdown significantly suppressed HL60 cell proliferation (48.82 +/- 12.58%) and colony formation and caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, we confirmed that ADRM1 knockdown suppressed p65 nuclear translocation. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that ADRM1 was overexpressed in AL, especially in CD34+ leukemia stem and progenitor cells. ADRM1 may play a role in AL via the proteasome-ubiquitin pathway by potentially sustaining the activation of NF-kappaB signaling.","['Zheng, Xiaohui', 'Guo, Yafei', 'Chen, Yingying', 'Chen, Meilin', 'Lin, Zhenxin', 'Wu, Yong', 'Chen, Yuanzhong']","['Zheng X', 'Guo Y', 'Chen Y', 'Chen M', 'Lin Z', 'Wu Y', 'Chen Y']","['Union Clinical Medical College, Fujian Medical University, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (ADRM1 protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement', 'Cell Proliferation', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Leukemia/blood/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2015/04/22 06:00,2015/10/06 06:00,['2015/04/22 06:00'],"['2014/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/06 06:00 [medline]']","['000369916 [pii]', '10.1159/000369916 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2015;134(2):88-100. doi: 10.1159/000369916.

Here we found that resveratrol (RV) enhanced the anti-tumor effects of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor erlotinib in NSCLC cells. METHODS: Cell viability was measured by MTT assay and clonogenicity assay. Western blot was applied to assess the protein expression levels of target genes. Cell apoptosis was monitored by AnnexinV-FITC assay and sub-G1 population assay. Intracellular ROS were measured by flow cytometric analysis. Cell caspase activities were carried out by fluorometric assays. RESULTS: Exposure of H460, A549, PC-9 and H1975 cells to minimal or non-toxic concentrations of RV and erlotinib synergistically reduced cell viability, colony formation and induced cell apoptosis. Furthermore, RV synergistically enhanced erlotinib-induced apoptosis was involved in ROS production. Additionally, co-treatment with RV and erlotinib repressed the expressions of anti-apoptosis proteins, such as survivin and Mcl-1, whereas promoted p53 and PUMA expression and caspase 3 activity. Moreover, the combination was also more effective at inhibiting the AKT/mTOR/S6 kinase pathway. Subsequently, small interfering RNA (siRNA) depletion of PUMA and overexpression of survivin significantly attenuated NSCLC cells apoptosis induced by the combination of the two drugs. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that RV synergistically enhanced the anti-tumor effects of erlotinib in NSCLC cells were involved in decrease of survivin expression and induction of PUMA expression. In conclusion, based on the observations from our study, we indicated that the combined administration of these two drugs might be considered as a novel therapeutic regimen for treating NSCLC.","['Nie, Peipei', 'Hu, Weicheng', 'Zhang, Tao', 'Yang, Yiju', 'Hou, Benxin', 'Zou, Zhengzhi']","['Nie P', 'Hu W', 'Zhang T', 'Yang Y', 'Hou B', 'Zou Z']","['MOE Key Laboratory of Laser Life Science and Institute of Laser Life Science, College of Biophotonics, South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'Q369O8926L (Resveratrol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Caspase 3/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Resveratrol', 'Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Survivin', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/02/09 06:00,['2015/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['000374030 [pii]', '10.1159/000374030 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2015;35(6):2255-71. doi: 10.1159/000374030.

Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis gene family and chromosome passenger complex, is critical in a variety of human cancers, including ALL. A well-established suppressor of survivin has been the small molecule, YM155. Reports are identifying other mechanisms of action for YM155. Therefore, we sought to investigate the mode of action and role of YM155 for therapeutic use in the context of ALL. METHODS: Primary ALL samples and ALL cell lines were interrogated with YM155 to identify drug sensitivity. Ph(+)ALL harboring the BCR-ABL1 oncogene were tested for any interaction with YM155 and the multi-kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Representative ALL cell lines were tested to identify the response to YM155 using standard biochemical assays as well as RNA expression and phosphorylation arrays. RESULTS: ALL samples exhibited significant sensitivity to YM155, and an additive response was observed with dasatinib in the setting of Ph(+)ALL. ALL cells were more sensitive to YM155 during S phase during DNA replication. YM155 activates the DNA damage pathway leading to phosphorylation of Chk2 and H2AX. Interestingly, screening of primary patient samples identified unique and exquisite YM155 sensitivity in some but not all ALL specimens. CONCLUSION: These results are the first to have screened a large number of primary patient leukemic samples to identify individual variations of response to YM155. Our studies further support that YM155 in ALL induces DNA damage leading to S phase arrest. Finally, only subsets of ALL have exquisite sensitivity to YM155 presumably through both suppression of survivin expression and activation of the DNA damage pathway underscoring its potential for therapeutic development.","['Chang, Bill H', 'Johnson, Kara', 'LaTocha, Dorian', 'Rowley, Joelle S J', 'Bryant, Jade', 'Burke, Russell', 'Smith, Rebecca L', 'Loriaux, Marc', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Mullighan, Charles', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Tyner, Jeffrey W']","['Chang BH', 'Johnson K', 'LaTocha D', 'Rowley JS', 'Bryant J', 'Burke R', 'Smith RL', 'Loriaux M', 'Muschen M', 'Mullighan C', 'Druker BJ', 'Tyner JW']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. changb@ohsu.edu.', 'OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. changb@ohsu.edu.', 'OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. johnskar@ohsu.edu.', 'OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. dhl89@cornell.edu.', 'OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, 97239, USA. rowleyj@ohsu.edu.', 'OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, Portland, OR, 97239, USA.

Dissecting subunit composition and post-translational modifications of proteasome is one of the important milestones in understanding their functions and mechanisms of regulation in the cell. To this end a strategy we followed a strategy for affinity purification of proteasomes from human myeloid leukemia cells with subsequent mass spectrometric analysis. Proteasomes were purified from the stable cell line K562 expressing HTBH tag-labeled 20S proteasome subunit beta7 (PSMB4) by non-covalent affinity purification on biotin-avidin beads, followed by elution with TEV protease. We identified all known subunits of the 26S proteasome, as well as PA200 and regulators PA28gamma amongst the eluted proteins, using MALDI-ICR mass spectrometry. We have shown that the proteasomes are associated with heat shock proteins, components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system of some cytoskeleton proteins. A number of novel phosphorylation, ubiquitination and N-terminal modification of proteasome subunits were found for 16 proteasome subunits. Our results might be useful for further proteomic studies of proteasomes.","['Artamonova, T O', 'Khodorkovskii, M A', 'Tsimokha, A S']","['Artamonova TO', 'Khodorkovskii MA', 'Tsimokha AS']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Bioorg Khim,Bioorganicheskaia khimiia,7804941,"['0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (PSMB4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ATP dependent 26S protease)']",IM,"['Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', '*Proteomics']",2015/04/22 06:00,2015/05/09 06:00,['2015/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1134/s1068162014060041 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioorg Khim. 2014 Nov-Dec;40(6):720-34. doi: 10.1134/s1068162014060041.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two weeks before death, she had a fever of 39 degrees C, which subsided after the administration of a naturopathic herbal remedy. She developed jaundice 1 week before death, and her condition worsened on the day of death. Laboratory test results on admission showed a markedly elevated white blood cell count. Accordingly, the cause of death was suspected to be acute leukaemia. Forensic autopsy revealed the cause of death to be precursor B-cell ALL. With advancements in medical technology, the 5-year survival rate of children with ALL is nearly 90%. However, in this case, the deceased's parents preferred complementary and alternative medicine (i.e., naturopathy) to evidence-based medicine and had not taken her to a hospital for a medical check-up or immunisation since she was an infant. Thus, if she had received routine medical care, she would have a more than 60% chance of being alive 5 years after diagnosis. Therefore, we conclude that the parents should be accused of medical neglect regardless of their motives.","['Usumoto, Yosuke', 'Sameshima, Naomi', 'Tsuji, Akiko', 'Kudo, Keiko', 'Nishida, Naoki', 'Ikeda, Noriaki']","['Usumoto Y', 'Sameshima N', 'Tsuji A', 'Kudo K', 'Nishida N', 'Ikeda N']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Fukuoka Igaku Zasshi,Fukuoka igaku zasshi = Hukuoka acta medica,9423321,,IM,"['Autopsy', 'Child, Preschool', 'Complementary Therapies', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Herbal Medicine', 'Humans', 'Jaundice/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*pathology/therapy']",2015/04/22 06:00,2015/06/05 06:00,['2015/04/22 06:00'],"['2015/04/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Fukuoka Igaku Zasshi. 2014 Dec;105(12):234-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic aberrations can significantly affect CLL cell compartmentalization. Trisomy 12 (tri12) defines a CLL subgroup with specific clinical features and increased levels of the negative prognostic marker CD49d, the alpha4-subunit of the integrin VLA-4, which is a key regulator of CLL cell homing to bone marrow (BM). Chemokine-induced inside-out VLA-4 activation, particularly via the CXCL12-CXCR4 axis, increases the arrest of various cell types on VCAM-1 presenting endothelium. Here, we demonstrate that high CD49d expression in tri12 CLL is accompanied by decreased CXCR4 expression. Dissecting functional consequences of these alterations, we observed that tri12 CLL cell homing to murine BM is not affected by CXCR4-CXCL12 blockage using AMD3100 or olaptesed pegol/NOX-A12. In line, CCL21-CCR7 rather than CXCL12-CXCR4 interactions triggered VLA-4-mediated arrests of tri12 CLL cells to VCAM-1 under blood flow conditions. Concordantly, in real-time kinetic analyses we found CCL21 but not CXCL12 being capable to induce inside-out VLA-4 conformational changes in this CLL subgroup. Our results provide novel insights into the peculiar clinico-biological behaviour of tri12 CLL and emphasize its specific chemokine and integrin utilization during pathophysiologically and therapeutically relevant interactions with the microenvironment.","['Ganghammer, Sylvia', 'Hutterer, Evelyn', 'Hinterseer, Elisabeth', 'Brachtl, Gabriele', 'Asslaber, Daniela', 'Krenn, Peter William',

Arterial stiffness measured by pulse wave velocity (PWV) may be predictive of cardiovascular morbidity. Increased PWV has been seen in adults following chemotherapy. PURPOSE: To evaluate PWV in a cohort of CCS and healthy controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: All participants were >6 years old. CCS were >12 months off-therapy and free of cardiac disease, diabetes, and kidney dysfunction. Height, weight, blood pressure (BP), medications, cancer diagnosis, age at diagnosis, time off therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation exposures were recorded. PWV was measured on all participants. RESULTS: Sixty-eight CCS (mean 17.3 +/- 6 years, 52.9% male), and 51 controls (mean 18.4 +/- 5.5 years, 37.3% male) were evaluated. Among CCS, 34% had lymphoma, 44% leukemia, and 22% solid tumors, and 49% were exposed to radiation. CCS were off therapy 7 +/- 4.2 years. Both groups were statistically similar in age, BMI, and BP. CCS >/= 18 years old had significantly higher PWV compared to controls >/= 18 years old (6.37 +/- 0.89 vs. 5.76 +/- 0.88 m/sec, P = 0.012). The relationship persisted in a regression model adjusted for age, sex, and BMI z-score (beta = 0.52, 95%CI 0.051-0.979, P = 0.03). Seventy percent of CCS >/= 18 had elevated PWV compared to established norms. Radiation therapy, anthracycline dose, and chemotherapy exposures were not predictive of increased PWV in CCS. CONCLUSIONS: CCS >/= 18 demonstrated prematurely elevated PVW. Further studies are needed to determine the predictive value of PWV in this population and its utility as a screening modality.","['Krystal, Julie I', 'Reppucci, Marina', 'Mayr, Theresa', 'Fish, Jonathan D', 'Sethna, Christine']","['Krystal JI', 'Reppucci M', 'Mayr T', 'Fish JD', 'Sethna C']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Cohen Children's Medical Center, New Hyde Park, New York, 11040."", 'Hofstra Northshore-LIJ School of Medicine, Hempstead, New York.', ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Cohen Children's Medical Center, New Hyde Park, New York, 11040."", ""Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Cohen Children's Medical Center, New Hyde Park, New York, 11040."", ""Division of Pediatric Nephrology, Cohen Children's Medical Center, New Hyde Park, New York.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Pulse Wave Analysis', 'Survivors/statistics & numerical data', '*Vascular Stiffness']",2015/04/22 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2015/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25547 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Oct;62(10):1832-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25547.

It is presently unclear to what extent other signaling pathways modulate DDR function. Here we show that Notch receptor binds and inactivates ATM kinase and that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved in Caenorhabditis elegans, Xenopus laevis and humans. In C. elegans, the Notch pathway impairs DDR signaling in gonad germ cells. In mammalian cells, activation of human Notch1 leads to reduced ATM signaling in a manner independent of Notch1 transcriptional activity. Notch1 binds directly to the regulatory FATC domain of ATM and inhibits ATM kinase activity. Notch1 and ATM activation are inversely correlated in human breast cancers, and inactivation of ATM by Notch1 contributes to the survival of Notch1-driven leukemia cells upon DNA damage.","['Vermezovic, Jelena', 'Adamowicz, Marek', 'Santarpia, Libero', 'Rustighi, Alessandra', 'Forcato, Mattia', 'Lucano, Caterina', 'Massimiliano, Lucia', 'Costanzo, Vincenzo', 'Bicciato, Silvio', 'Del Sal, Giannino', ""d'Adda di Fagagna, Fabrizio""]","['Vermezovic J', 'Adamowicz M', 'Santarpia L', 'Rustighi A', 'Forcato M', 'Lucano C', 'Massimiliano L', 'Costanzo V', 'Bicciato S', 'Del Sal G', ""d'Adda di Fagagna F""]","['Istituto Fondazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro di Oncologia Molecolare, Milan, Italy.', 'Istituto Fondazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro di Oncologia Molecolare, Milan, Italy.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Unit, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Humanitas Clinical and Research Institute, Milan, Italy.', '1] Laboratorio Nazionale del Consorzio Interuniversitario per le Biotecnologie, Trieste, Italy.

The purpose of this study is thus to measure the extent of the weight gain in BAZ during the 150 first days of treatment and to identify factors associated with the weight gain. Furthermore, we wish to raise the question of whether changes in treatment protocols automatically should be followed by an evaluation of the nutritional guidelines. METHOD: In this retrospective study, the medical records of 51 children with ALL treated with the NOPHO ALL 2008 protocol at Copenhagen University Hospital were assessed. Patient characteristics were extracted, and height, weight, and age during the first 150 days of treatment were converted to BAZ. RESULTS: During 150 days of treatment, the proportion of overweight/obese patients increased significantly from 9.8 to 33.3 %. The mean change in BAZ (BAZ) was +1 standard deviation (0.02 +/- 1.16 vs. 1.12 +/- 1.44; p < 0.001) and BAZ increased significantly during periods with glucocorticoid (GC) treatment but not in periods without GC. DeltaBAZ was larger in boys compared to girls, and DeltaBAZ was higher in patients who were under/normal weight at diagnosis, compared to patients who were overweight/obese (1.26 +/- 1.29 vs. -0.04 +/- 0.41; p = 0.032). CONCLUSION: BAZ increased significantly in children with ALL during the initial treatment with the NOPHO ALL 2008 protocol. This is likely associated with the GC administration and influenced by gender and initial BAZ.","['Arpe, Marie-Louise Hyre', 'Rorvig, Sascha', 'Kok, Karin', 'Molgaard, Christian', 'Frandsen, Thomas Leth']","['Arpe ML', 'Rorvig S', 'Kok K', 'Molgaard C', 'Frandsen TL']","['Pediatric Nutrition Unit, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.', 'Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Pediatric Nutrition Unit, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.', 'Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Pediatric Nutrition Unit, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.', 'Pediatric Nutrition Unit, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.', 'Department of Nutrition, Exercise and Sports, Faculty of Science, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Child and Youth, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. thomas.leth.frandsen@regionh.dk.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Support Care Cancer,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,9302957,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Weight Gain']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/06/22 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2014/12/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s00520-015-2718-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s00520-015-2718-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Support Care Cancer. 2015 Dec;23(12):3573-80. doi: 10.1007/s00520-015-2718-5.

We investigated the association of race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) with survival. PROCEDURES: We analyzed 9,295 Californian children (3,251 Whites, 4,890 Hispanics, 796 Asians, and 358 Blacks) aged </= 19 years diagnosed with a first primary ALL during 1988-2011. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate survival at 1, 5, and 10 years after diagnosis for three calendar periods. Hazard ratios of death for race/ethnicity, SES, and clinical factors were estimated by Cox regression models. RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 7.4 years (range 0-25 years). Over time, survival after ALL improved steadily, but inequalities persisted across races/ethnicities. Five-year survival (95% confidence interval) was 85.0% (83.6-86.2) for White, 81.4% (78.3-84.0) for Asian, 79.0% (77.8-80.2) for Hispanic, and 74.4% (69.4-78.8) for Black children. In multivariable-adjusted models, the hazard of death was increased by 57% among Black, 38% among Hispanic, and 33% among Asian children compared with White children. Patients residing in the lowest SES neighborhoods at diagnosis had a 39% increased risk of death relative to those living in higher SES neighborhoods. CONCLUSION: Despite significant improvements in survival, non-White children and children residing in low SES neighborhoods experienced worse survival even after adjusting for potential confounders. Our findings highlight the need to capture specific information on disease biology, treatment, and treatment adherence to better understand the predictors of lower survival in minority and low SES groups.","['Abrahao, Renata', 'Lichtensztajn, Daphne Y', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Marina, Neyssa M', 'Keogh, Ruth H', 'Marcos-Gragera, Rafael', 'Glaser, Sally L', 'Keegan, Theresa H M']","['Abrahao R', 'Lichtensztajn DY', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Marina NM', 'Keogh RH', 'Marcos-Gragera R', 'Glaser SL', 'Keegan TH']","['Department of Non-Communicable Disease Epidemiology, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, California.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, California.', ""Department of Oncology, Leukemia and Lymphoma Division, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Lucile Packard Children's Hospital, Stanford, California."", 'Department of Medical Statistics, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK.', 'Epidemiology Unity and Cancer Registry of Girona, Institute for Biomedical Research of Girona, Girona, Spain.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, California.', 'Department of Health Research and Policy, Division of Epidemiology, Stanford, California.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, Fremont, California.', 'Department of Health Research and Policy, Division of Epidemiology, Stanford, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'California/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Healthcare Disparities/*statistics & numerical data/*trends', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/22 06:00,2015/11/03 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2015/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25544 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Oct;62(10):1819-25. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25544.

Recently, several studies reported that the efficiency of the simulation-extrapolation method (SIMEX) is slightly more accurate than the simple regression calibration method (RCAL). In the present paper, the SIMEX and RCAL methods have been used to address errors in atomic bomb survivor dosimetry on solid cancer and leukaemia mortality risk estimates. For instance, it is shown that using the SIMEX method, the ERR/Gy is increased by an amount of about 29 % for all solid cancer deaths using a linear model compared to the RCAL method, and the corrected EAR 10(-4) person-years at 1 Gy (the linear terms) is decreased by about 8 %, while the corrected quadratic term (EAR 10(-4) person-years/Gy(2)) is increased by about 65 % for leukaemia deaths based on a linear-quadratic model. The results with SIMEX method are slightly higher than published values. The observed differences were probably due to the fact that with the RCAL method the dosimetric data were partially corrected, while all doses were considered with the SIMEX method. Therefore, one should be careful when comparing the estimated risks and it may be useful to use several correction techniques in order to obtain a range of corrected estimates, rather than to rely on a single technique. This work will enable to improve the risk estimates derived from LSS data, and help to make more reliable the development of radiation protection standards.","['Allodji, Rodrigue S', 'Schwartz, Boris', 'Diallo, Ibrahima', 'Agbovon, Cesaire', 'Laurier, Dominique', 'de Vathaire, Florent']","['Allodji RS', 'Schwartz B', 'Diallo I', 'Agbovon C', 'Laurier D', 'de Vathaire F']","['Radiation Epidemiology Group/CESP - Unit 1018 INSERM, Gustave Roussy B2M, 114, rue Edouard Vaillant, 94805, Villejuif Cedex, France, Rodrigue.ALLODJI@gustaveroussy.fr.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Biostatistics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computer Simulation', 'Female', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*history/mortality', 'Linear Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*history/mortality', 'Nuclear Warfare/*history', 'Nuclear Weapons/*history', 'Radiometry', 'Risk Factors', 'Survivors/history']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2014/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00411-015-0594-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2015 Aug;54(3):273-83. doi: 10.1007/s00411-015-0594-5.

We evaluated to what extend prognostic scores as described for adults (e.g., Sokal, Hasford, EUTOS score) resulted in comparable risk group categorizations in a pediatric cohort. Parameters for score calculation were extracted from a data set of 90 patients enrolled into trial CML-PAED-II and treated by a standard dose of imatinib. At month 3 and at month 6, treatment response was analyzed based on the transcript ratio BCR-ABL1/ABL1. By the EUTOS, Hasford, and Sokal scores 81, 59, and 62 % of the patients were categorized as low risk, respectively; 19, 14, and 16 % of the patients as high risk, respectively; and by Hasford and Sokal scores 27 and 22 % of the patients, respectively, as intermediate risk. Twenty-seven out of 72 patients analyzable (38 %) exhibited a transcript ratio >10 % at month 3. We show that only the EUTOS score, but not the Sokal and Hasford score, correlates with this early outcome (p = 0.008). Analyzing the EUTOS score separately, we can demonstrate that lowering the cutoff from 87 to 48 points for categorization in low- and high-risk individuals increases the odds ratio from 2.4 (95 % CI 0.6 to 10.4) to 3.6 (95 % CI 1.3 to 10.9). Data are provided on the distribution of risk categories and resulting discrepancies when adult scores are applied on children and adolescents with CML at diagnosis.

The aim of this study was to meta-analyze currently available data comparing anagrelide to hydroxyurea for reduction of rates of thrombosis, bleeding and death among patients with ET. A literature search for randomized, controlled trials comparing anagrelide to hydroxyurea among patients with ET revealed two published studies. Statistical analysis was performed using fixed effects meta-analysis. Rates of thrombosis were similar between patients treated with hydroxyurea vs anagrelide (RR 0.86, 95 % CI 0.64-1.16). Rates of major bleeding were lower in patients treated with hydroxyurea (RR 0.37, 95 % CI 0.18-0.75). Rates of progression to acute myeloid leukemia were not statistically different (RR 1.50, 95 % CI 0.43-5.29). The composite of thrombosis, major bleeding and death favored hydroxyurea (RR 0.78, 95 % CI 0.63-0.97). In conclusion, our analysis supports use of hydroxyurea as a first-line cytoreductive agent for patients with ET, based largely on decreased rates of major bleeding. Anagrelide appears to be equally effective for protection against thrombotic events and may be an appropriate alternative for patients who are intolerant of hydroxyurea.","['Samuelson, Bethany', 'Chai-Adisaksopha, Chatree', 'Garcia, David']","['Samuelson B', 'Chai-Adisaksopha C', 'Garcia D']","['Department of Hematology, University of Washington, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D5-100, PO Box 19024, Seattle, WA, 98109-1024, USA. bts99@uw.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology, University of Washington, 1100 Fairview Ave N, D5-100, PO Box 19024, Seattle, WA, 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review']",Netherlands,J Thromb Thrombolysis,Journal of thrombosis and thrombolysis,9502018,"['0 (Quinazolines)', 'K9X45X0051 (anagrelide)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Hemorrhage/chemically induced/mortality', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Thrombosis/chemically induced/mortality']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/07/07 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11239-015-1218-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s11239-015-1218-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Thromb Thrombolysis. 2015 Nov;40(4):474-9. doi: 10.1007/s11239-015-1218-2.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Anagrelide', 'Essential thrombocythemia', 'Hydroxyurea', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasms']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a downregulation of miR-125b was observed in breast cancer cell lines, suggesting miR-125b is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer. Moreover, the miR-125b levels were significantly decreased in doxorubicin-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/DR) cells compared with MCF-7 cells. Transfection of miR-125b significantly enhanced the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin to MCF-7/DR cells. However, the overexpression of miR-125b did not influence the doxorubicin accumulation but downregulated the myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) levels, which may be the mechanism of apoptosis induction caused by doxorubicin combining with miR-125b in MCF-7/DR cells. Furthermore, luciferase reporter assay proved that Mcl-1 is the target of miR-125b. Importantly, we found that the sensitization of miR-125b to doxorubicin cytotoxicity is caspase-dependent in MCF-7/DR cells, which can be inhibited by zVAD-fmk. Finally, we indicated that the treatment of miR-125b plus doxorubicin leads to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondria outer membrane permeability (MOMP), which were interacted with the activation of caspases. Thus, this study revealed the role of miR-125b in doxorubicin resistance and therapy, which may provide novel approaches for the treatment of breast cancer.","['Xie, Xiaohong', 'Hu, Yuanyuan', 'Xu, Leilai', 'Fu, Yongqing', 'Tu, Jue', 'Zhao, Hong', 'Zhang, Shuo', 'Hong, Ri', 'Gu, Xidong']","['Xie X', 'Hu Y', 'Xu L', 'Fu Y', 'Tu J', 'Zhao H', 'Zhang S', 'Hong R', 'Gu X']","['Department of Breast Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Youdian Road 54#, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, 310006, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Youdian Road 54#, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, 310006, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Youdian Road 54#, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, 310006, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Youdian Road 54#, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, 310006, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Youdian Road 54#, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, 310006, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Youdian Road 54#, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, 310006, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Youdian Road 54#, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, 310006, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Youdian Road 54#, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, 310006, Zhejiang Province, China.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang Chinese Medical University, Youdian Road 54#, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou City, 310006, Zhejiang Province, China. hzxidonggu@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (MIRN125 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)']",IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Caspase 3/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'MicroRNAs/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Mitochondria/genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2015/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-3438-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-3438-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 Sep;36(9):7185-94. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-3438-7.

The benefits of exercise are surely mediated by many pathophysiological mechanisms interrelated in varying degrees, which have not yet been fully examined in their complexity. In the late 20th century it was positively proven that a working striated muscle really regulates the metabolic and physiological response in the other organs. These involve several hundred substances with autocrine, paracrine and endocrine effects. These proteins and peptides, if released into the blood stream, substantially affect the metabolism of distant organs. They were classified as ""myokines"" (cytokines produced by myocytes). The identified myokines include e.g. IL4, IL6, IL7, IL15, myostatin, LIF (leukemia inhibitory factor), BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor), IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor), FGF2 (fibroblast growth factor 2), FGF21, FSTL1 (follistatin-related protein 1), irisin, EPO (erythropoetin) and BAIBA (beta-aminoisobutyric acid). Myokines have first of all an immunoregulatory role in the human body. Another important effect of myokines is, coincidentally also in the interaction with adipose tissue, the regulation of energy homeostasis. They also affect the growth of muscle fibres and their regeneration, stimulate angiogenesis, they are involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism and have a proven effect on lipids. Considering their diverse function, myokines present a prospective therapeutic goal in the treatment of disorders of muscle growth and regeneration as well as obesity. Another recent research moves toward uncovering of the ""myokine resistance"" as a result of long-term muscle inactivity and its association with chronic subclinical inflammation.","['Stranska, Zuzana', 'Svacina, Stepan']","['Stranska Z', 'Svacina S']",,['cze'],['Journal Article'],Czech Republic,Vnitr Lek,Vnitrni lekarstvi,0413602,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Muscle, Skeletal/*metabolism']",2015/04/22 06:00,2015/10/31 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/31 06:00 [medline]']",['51885 [pii]'],ppublish,Vnitr Lek. 2015 Apr;61(4):365-8.,,,,,,,,,,Myokiny - hormony svalove tkane.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, inhibition of epigenetic regulators is emerging as a promising therapeutic strategy. The acetylation status of lysine residues in histone tails is one of a number of epigenetic post-translational modifications that alter DNA-templated processes, such as transcription, to facilitate malignant transformation. Although histone deacetylases are already being clinically targeted, the role of histone lysine acetyltransferases (KAT) in malignancy is less well characterized. We chose to study this question in the context of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where, using in vitro and in vivo genetic ablation and knockdown experiments in murine models, we demonstrate a role for the epigenetic regulators CBP and p300 in the induction and maintenance of AML. Furthermore, using selective small molecule inhibitors of their lysine acetyltransferase activity, we validate CBP/p300 as therapeutic targets in vitro across a wide range of human AML subtypes. We proceed to show that growth retardation occurs through the induction of transcriptional changes that induce apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in leukemia cells and finally demonstrate the efficacy of the KAT inhibitors in decreasing clonogenic growth of primary AML patient samples. Taken together, these data suggest that CBP/p300 are promising therapeutic targets across multiple subtypes in AML.","['Giotopoulos, G', 'Chan, W-I', 'Horton, S J', 'Ruau, D', 'Gallipoli, P', 'Fowler, A', 'Crawley, C', 'Papaemmanuil, E', 'Campbell, P J', 'Gottgens, B', 'Van Deursen, J M', 'Cole, P A', 'Huntly, B J P']","['Giotopoulos G', 'Chan WI', 'Horton SJ', 'Ruau D', 'Gallipoli P', 'Fowler A', 'Crawley C', 'Papaemmanuil E', 'Campbell PJ', 'Gottgens B', 'Van Deursen JM', 'Cole PA', 'Huntly BJ']","['Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'State Key laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macau.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK.', 'Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Molecular sciences, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute for Medical Research and Addenbrookes Hospital, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Wellcome Trust - Medical Research Council Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0', '(4-(4-((5-(4,5-dimethyl-2-nitrophenyl)-2-furanyl)methylene)-4,5-dihydro-3-methyl-', '5-oxo-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)benzoic acid)', '0 (Benzoates)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrazolones)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', '0 (bone sialoprotein (35-62), human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (E1A-Associated p300 Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (EP300 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoates/administration & dosage', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nitrobenzenes', 'Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage', 'Pyrazolones', 'Sialoglycoproteins/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/06/04 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2014/09/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/27 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/04 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201592 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.92 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Jan 21;35(3):279-89. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.92.

EML1 cells differentiate to mature B-cells following treatment with IL7; whereas EML-TA display an impaired differentiation capacity and remain blocked at an early stage of maturation. Global gene expression profiling of EML1 cells at different stages of B-lymphoid differentiation, compared with EML-TA, identified the interferon (IFN)alpha/beta pathway as a primary target of repression by TEL-AML1. In particular, expression and phosphorylation of interferon-regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) was decreased in EML-TA cells; strikingly, stable expression of IRF3 restored the capacity of EML-TA cells to differentiate into mature B-cells. Similarly, IRF3 silencing in EML1 cells by siRNA was sufficient to block B-lymphoid differentiation. The ability of TEL-AML1 to block B-cell differentiation and downregulate the IRF3-IFNalpha/beta pathway was confirmed in mouse and human primary hematopoietic precursor cells (Lin- and CD34+ cells, respectively), and in a patient-derived cell line expressing TEL-AML1 (REH). Furthermore, treatment of TEL-AML1 expressing cells with IFNalpha/beta was sufficient to overcome the maturation block. Our data provide new insight on TEL-AML1 function and may offer a new therapeutic opportunity for B-ALL.","['de Laurentiis, A', 'Hiscott, J', 'Alcalay, M']","['de Laurentiis A', 'Hiscott J', 'Alcalay M']","['Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Vaccine and Gene Therapy Institute of Florida, Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Europeo di Oncologia, Milan, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze della Salute, Universita di Milano, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (IRF3 protein, human)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-3)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factor-3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/03/29 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2014/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/16 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201550 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.50 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2015 Dec 3;34(49):6018-28. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.50.

Because juvenile hormone (JH) plays an important role in adult and nymphal development, we studied the final steps in JH biosynthesis in D. citri. A putative JH acid methyltransferase ortholog gene (jmtD) and its cognate cDNA were identified by searching D. citri genome database. Expression analysis shows expression in all life stages. In adults, it is expressed in the head-thorax, (containing the corpora allata), and the abdomen (containing ovaries and male accessory glands). A 3D protein model identified the catalytic groove with catalytically active amino acids and the S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-binding loop. The cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli cells and the purified enzyme showed high preference for farnesoic acid (FA) and homoFA (kcat of 0.752 x 10(-3) and 0.217 x 10(-3) s(-1), respectively) as compared to JH acid I (JHA I) (cis/trans/cis; 2Z, 6E, 10cis), JHA III (2E, 6E, 10cis), and JHA I (trans/cis/cis; 2E, 2Z, 10cis) (kcat of 0.081 x 10(-3), 0.013 x 10(-3), and 0.003 x 10(-3) s(-1), respectively). This suggests that this ortholog is a DcFA-o-methyl transferase gene (fmtD), not a jmtD, and that JH biosynthesis in D. citri proceeds from FA to JH III through methyl farnesoate (MF). DcFA-o-MT does not require Ca(2+), Mg(2+) or Zn(2+), however, Zn(2+) (1 mM) completely inhibits the enzyme probably by binding H115 at the active groove. This represents the first purified FA-o-MT from Hemiptera with preferred biological activity for FA and not JHA.","['Van Ekert, Evelien', 'Shatters, Robert G Jr', 'Rouge, Pierre', 'Powell, Charles A', 'Smagghe, Guy', 'Borovsky, Dov']","['Van Ekert E', 'Shatters RG Jr', 'Rouge P', 'Powell CA', 'Smagghe G', 'Borovsky D']","['USDA-ARS, Ft.

FeLV is known to undergo recombination with endogenous retroviruses already present in the host during FeLV-subgroup A infection. Such recombinant FeLVs, designated FeLV-subgroup B or FeLV-subgroup D, can be generated by transduced endogenous retroviral env sequences encoding the viral envelope. These recombinant viruses have biologically distinct properties and may mediate different disease outcomes. The generation of such recombinant viruses resulted in structural diversity of the FeLV particle and genetic diversity of the virus itself. FeLV env diversity through mutation and recombination has been studied, while gag diversity and its possible effects are less well understood. In this study, we investigated recombination events in the gag genes of FeLVs isolated from naturally infected cats and reference isolates. Recombination and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the gag genes often contain endogenous FeLV sequences and were occasionally replaced by entire endogenous FeLV gag genes. Phylogenetic reconstructions of FeLV gag sequences allowed for classification into three distinct clusters, similar to those previously established for the env gene. Analysis of the recombination junctions in FeLV gag indicated that these variants have similar recombination patterns within the same genotypes, indicating that the recombinant viruses were horizontally transmitted among cats. It remains to be investigated whether the recombinant sequences affect the molecular mechanism of FeLV transmission. These findings extend our understanding of gammaretrovirus evolutionary patterns in the field.","['Kawamura, Maki', 'Watanabe, Shinya', 'Odahara, Yuka', 'Nakagawa, So', 'Endo, Yasuyuki', 'Tsujimoto, Hajime', 'Nishigaki, Kazuo']","['Kawamura M', 'Watanabe S', 'Odahara Y', 'Nakagawa S', 'Endo Y', 'Tsujimoto H', 'Nishigaki K']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, 1677-1 Yoshida, Yamaguchi 753-8515, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, 1677-1 Yoshida, Yamaguchi 753-8515, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, 1677-1 Yoshida, Yamaguchi 753-8515, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Life Science, Tokai University School of Medicine, 143 Shimokasuya, Isehara, Kanagawa 259-1193, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Small Animal Internal Medicine, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Kagoshima University, 1-21-24 Korimoto, Kagoshima 890-0065, Japan.', 'Department of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 1-1-1 Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8657, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, The United Graduate School of Veterinary Science, Yamaguchi University, 1677-1 Yoshida, Yamaguchi 753-8515, Japan; Laboratory of Molecular Immunology and Infectious Disease, Joint Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Yamaguchi University, 1677-1 Yoshida, Yamaguchi 753-8515, Japan.

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 94% of the isolates clustered into genotype I and the remaining isolate into genotype III. Among genotype I, genetically distinct strains were spread at each farm, and cattle infected with less than 3 copies/100 cells did not transmit BLV to other cattle for more than thirty months. This is the first report of concrete data of viral load in relation to viral horizontal transmission under the field condition. The data facilitate farmers and veterinarians understanding the status of BLV infected cattle.

The current primary treatment for type 1 diabetes is insulin injections administered multiple times throughout the day. However, this treatment cannot provide sustained physiological release of insulin and the insulin amount is not finely tuned to the glycemia condition. Pancreatic transplantation or islet transplantation would be the preferred treatment strategy but the lack of donor tissue and immunoincompatibility has been shown to be a roadblock to their widespread use. Bioengineering strategies are poised to combat these challenges. Islet encapsulation is expected to offer both immunoisolation and immunomodulation effects by: (1) physically protecting islets from the attacks of immunoglobulins, complements, and host immune cells, and (2) delivering immune regulatory and immunomodulatory factors locally to the islets to protect those islets from immune rejection. Semi-permeable coatings using biocompatible biomaterials can be used for immunoisolating islets away from the host immune systems. Immunoisolation technology also provides an opportunity to use other cell sources for cell therapy to treat type 1 diabetes. Recently, some studies reported that co-transplantation of islets with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can control graft inflammation. MSCs have immunomodulatory property. They are able to secrete anti-inflammatory factors and repress the activity of various immune cells. Growth factors like interleukin 10 (IL-10) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) also have immune regulatory properties. Therefore immunoisolation and immunomodulation technologies can be integrated and applied to beta-cell encapsulation for the treatment of type 1 diabetes. Through engineering beta-cell islets or islet-like microtissues, the viability and function of transplanted beta-cells may be improved. In the meantime, the survival of transplanted beta-cells can be further improved by promoting vascular network formation surrounding the transplanted islets or microtissues.","['Liu, Xiaoyan', 'Li, Xiaowei', 'Zhang, Ning', 'Wen, Xuejun']","['Liu X', 'Li X', 'Zhang N', 'Wen X']","['StemCellLife LLC, Richmond, VA, 23219, USA.', 'Translational Tissue Engineering Center, Whitaker Biomedical Engineering Institute, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23284, USA.', 'Institute for Engineering and Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA 23284, USA.

Our studies demonstrate that the function of ULK1 is required for gene transcription mediated via IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) and IFNgamma activation site (GAS) elements and controls expression of key IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). We identify ULK1 as an upstream regulator of p38alpha mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and establish that the regulatory effects of ULK1 on ISG expression are mediated possibly by engagement of the p38 MAPK pathway. Importantly, we demonstrate that ULK1 is essential for antiproliferative responses and type I IFN-induced antineoplastic effects against malignant erythroid precursors from patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms. Together, these data reveal a role for ULK1 as a key mediator of type I IFNR-generated signals that control gene transcription and induction of antineoplastic responses.","['Saleiro, Diana', 'Mehrotra, Swarna', 'Kroczynska, Barbara', 'Beauchamp, Elspeth M', 'Lisowski, Pawel', 'Majchrzak-Kita, Beata', 'Bhagat, Tushar D', 'Stein, Brady L', 'McMahon, Brandon', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Kosciuczuk, Ewa M', 'Baker, Darren P', 'Jie, Chunfa', 'Jafari, Nadereh', 'Thompson, Craig B', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Fish, Eleanor N', 'Verma, Amit K', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Saleiro D', 'Mehrotra S', 'Kroczynska B', 'Beauchamp EM', 'Lisowski P', 'Majchrzak-Kita B', 'Bhagat TD', 'Stein BL', 'McMahon B', 'Altman JK', 'Kosciuczuk EM', 'Baker DP', 'Jie C', 'Jafari N', 'Thompson CB', 'Levine RL', 'Fish EN', 'Verma AK', 'Platanias LC']","['Robert H.

Mutations in Dis3 are associated with a number of human cancers including multiple myeloma and acute myeloid leukemia. In this work, we have assessed the effect of a Dis3 knockdown on Drosophila imaginal disc development and on expression of mature microRNAs. We find that Dis3 knockdown severely disrupts the development of wing imaginal discs in that the flies have a ""no wing"" phenotype. Use of RNA-seq to quantify the effect of Dis3 knockdown on microRNA expression shows that Dis3 normally regulates a small subset of microRNAs, with only 11 (10.1%) increasing in level >/= 2-fold and 6 (5.5%) decreasing in level >/= 2-fold. Of these microRNAs, miR-252-5p is increased 2.1-fold in Dis3-depleted cells compared to controls while the level of the miR-252 precursor is unchanged, suggesting that Dis3 can act in the cytoplasm to specifically degrade this mature miRNA. Furthermore, our experiments suggest that Dis3 normally interacts with the exosomal subunit Rrp40 in the cytoplasm to target miR-252-5p for degradation during normal wing development. Another microRNA, miR-982-5p, is expressed at lower levels in Dis3 knockdown cells, while the miR-982 precursor remains unchanged, indicating that Dis3 is involved in its processing. Our study therefore reveals an unexpected specificity for this ribonuclease toward microRNA regulation, which is likely to be conserved in other eukaryotes and may be relevant to understanding its role in human disease.","['Towler, Benjamin P', 'Jones, Christopher I', 'Viegas, Sandra C', 'Apura, Patricia', 'Waldron, Joseph A', 'Smalley, Sarah K', 'Arraiano, Cecilia M', 'Newbury, Sarah F']","['Towler BP', 'Jones CI', 'Viegas SC', 'Apura P', 'Waldron JA', 'Smalley SK', 'Arraiano CM', 'Newbury SF']","['a Brighton and Sussex Medical School; Medical Research Building; University of Sussex; Falmer , Brighton , UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,RNA Biol,RNA biology,101235328,"['0 (Dis3 protein, Drosophila)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exoribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Exosome Multienzyme Ribonuclease Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Drosophila/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Exoribonucleases/metabolism', 'Exosome Multienzyme Ribonuclease Complex/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Imaginal Discs/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Transcriptome', 'Tribolium', 'Wings, Animal/growth & development/metabolism']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/03/24 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15476286.2015.1040978 [doi]'],ppublish,RNA Biol. 2015;12(7):728-41. doi: 10.1080/15476286.2015.1040978.,,PMC4615222,['NOTNLM'],"['Dis3/Taz', 'Drosophila development', 'RNA degradation', 'RNA stability', 'exoribonuclease', 'imaginal discs', 'miRNAs']",,,,"['BB/I021345/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'MR/K001744/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'BB/G002754/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'G1000409/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G0900740/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/J500525/1/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of the BTB/POZ proteins associated with cancer biology are SUMOylated, which appears to play an important role in transcription regulation. We show that NACC1 is SUMOylated on a phylogenetically conserved lysine (K167) out of three consensus SUMOylation motif sites. Amino acid substitution in the SIM sequence (SIM/M) within the BTB/POZ domain partially reduced K167 SUMOylation activity of NACC1. Overexpression of GFP-NACC1 fusion protein leads to formation of discrete nuclear foci similar to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies (PML-NB), which colocalized with SUMO paralogues (SUMO1/2/3). Both NACC1 nuclear body formation and colocalization with SUMO paralogues were completely suppressed in the GFP-NACC1-SIM/M mutant, whereas they were partially maintained in the NACC1 K167R mutant. Confocal immunofluorescence analysis showed that endogenous and exogenous NACC1 proteins colocalized with endogenous PML protein. A pull-down assay revealed that the consensus motifs of the SUMO acceptor site at K167 and the SIM within the BTB/POZ domain were both necessary for efficient binding to PML protein. Our study demonstrates that NACC1 can be modified by SUMO paralogues, and cooperates with PML protein.","['Tatemichi, Yoshinori', 'Shibazaki, Masahiko', 'Yasuhira, Shinji', 'Kasai, Shuya', 'Tada, Hiroshi', 'Oikawa, Hiroki', 'Suzuki, Yuji', 'Takikawa, Yasuhiro', 'Masuda, Tomoyuki', 'Maesawa, Chihaya']","['Tatemichi Y', 'Shibazaki M', 'Yasuhira S', 'Kasai S', 'Tada H', 'Oikawa H', 'Suzuki Y', 'Takikawa Y', 'Masuda T', 'Maesawa C']","['Department of Tumor Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Iwate Medical University, Yahaba-cho, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Iwate Medical University, Yahaba-cho, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Iwate Medical University, Yahaba-cho, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Iwate Medical University, Yahaba-cho, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Iwate Medical University, Yahaba-cho, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Iwate Medical University, Morioka, Japan.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Iwate Medical University, Yahaba-cho, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (NACC1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC9)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Intranuclear Space/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Transport', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', '*Sumoylation', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Ubiquitin-Conjugating Enzymes/*metabolism']",2015/04/22 06:00,2015/10/07 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2015/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cas.12680 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2015 Jul;106(7):848-56. doi: 10.1111/cas.12680.

Here we show that PRDM12 is a key regulator of sensory neuronal specification in Xenopus. Modeling of human PRDM12 mutations that cause hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) revealed remarkable conservation of the mutated residues in evolution. Expression of wild-type human PRDM12 in Xenopus induced the expression of sensory neuronal markers, which was reduced using various human PRDM12 mutants. In Drosophila, we identified Hamlet as the functional PRDM12 homolog that controls nociceptive behavior in sensory neurons. Furthermore, expression analysis of human patient fibroblasts with PRDM12 mutations uncovered possible downstream target genes. Knockdown of several of these target genes including thyrotropin-releasing hormone degrading enzyme (TRHDE) in Drosophila sensory neurons resulted in altered cellular morphology and impaired nociception. These data show that PRDM12 and its functional fly homolog Hamlet are evolutionary conserved master regulators of sensory neuronal specification and play a critical role in pain perception. Our data also uncover novel pathways in multiple species that regulate evolutionary conserved nociception.","['Nagy, Vanja', 'Cole, Tiffany', 'Van Campenhout, Claude', 'Khoung, Thang M', 'Leung, Calvin', 'Vermeiren, Simon', 'Novatchkova, Maria', 'Wenzel, Daniel', 'Cikes, Domagoj', 'Polyansky, Anton A', 'Kozieradzki, Ivona', 'Meixner, Arabella', 'Bellefroid, Eric J', 'Neely, G Gregory', 'Penninger, Josef M']","['Nagy V', 'Cole T', 'Van Campenhout C', 'Khoung TM', 'Leung C', 'Vermeiren S', 'Novatchkova M', 'Wenzel D', 'Cikes D', 'Polyansky AA', 'Kozieradzki I', 'Meixner A', 'Bellefroid EJ', 'Neely GG', 'Penninger JM']","['IMBA-Institute of Molecular Biotechnology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, Vienna, Austria; UNSW Medicine, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Prdm12 protein, human)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Drosophila', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Neurogenesis/genetics', 'Neurons/metabolism/*pathology', '*Pain Perception', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Sensory Receptor Cells/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Xenopus laevis']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/04/20 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384101.2015.1036209 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2015;14(12):1799-808. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2015.1036209.,,PMC4613559,['NOTNLM'],"['BSA, bovine serum albumin', 'Brn3d, brain 3d', 'CGNL1, cyclin L1', 'ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation', ""DAPI, 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole"", 'DDK, DYKDDDDK epitope', 'Drgx, dorsal root ganglia homeobox', 'ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence', 'En1, engrailed-1', 'FDR, false discovery rate', 'FPKM, fragments per kilobase exon', 'GAPDH, glyceraldehyde 3-phospate dehydrogenase', 'GEO, gene expression omnibus', 'GFP, green fluorescent protein', 'HEK293, human embryonic kidney cell 293', 'HRP, horseraddish peroxidase', 'HSAN, hereditary and sensory autonomic neuropathy', 'Hamlet', 'Hmx3, H6 family homeobox 3', 'IL1R1, interleukin 1 receptor type 1', 'MO, morpholino oligonucleotide', 'NBT/BCIP, nitro blue tetrazolium / 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate', 'PBS, phosphate buffered saline', 'PDB, protein data base', 'PMID, pubmed identification.', 'PRDM12', 'PRDM12, PR homology domain-containing member 12', 'RA, retinoic acid', 'RT-qPCR, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction', 'S1PR1, Sphi8ngosine-1-phosphate receptor 1', ""SET, Su(var)3-9 and 'Enhancer of zeste'"", 'Sncg, Synuclein Gamma (Breast Cancer-Specific Protein 1)', 'TRH(DE), tryrotropin-releasing hormone degrading enzyme', 'TRHDE', 'TRHDE, tyrotropin-releasing hormone degrading enzyme', 'Tlx3, T-cell leukemia homeobox 3', 'nociception', 'pCMV6, plasmid cytomegalovirus', 'sensory neurons']",,,,,['Cell Cycle. 2015;14(19):3203.

Increasing evidence of clinical role of DNMT3A and IDH1/2 mutations highlights the need for a robust and inexpensive test to identify these mutations in routine diagnostic work-up. Herein, we compared routinely used direct sequencing method with high-resolution melting (HRM) assay for screening DNMT3A and IDH1/2 mutations in patients with AML. We show very high concordance between HRM and Sanger sequencing (100% samples for IDH2-R140 and DNMT3-R882 mutations, 99% samples for IDH1-R132 and IDH2-R172 mutations). HRM method reported no false-negative results, suggesting that it can be used for mutations screening. Moreover, HRM displayed much higher sensitivity in comparison with DNA sequencing in all assessed loci. With Sanger sequencing, robust calls were observed when the sample contained 50% of mutant DNA in the background of wild-type DNA. In marked contrast, the detection limit of HRM improved down to 10% of mutated DNA. Given the ubiquitous presence of wild-type DNA background in bone marrow aspirates and clonal variations regarding mutant allele burden, these results favor HRM as a sensitive, specific, labor-, and cost-effective tool for screening and detection of mutations in IDH1/2 and DNMT3A genes in patients with AML.","['Gorniak, Patryk', 'Ejduk, Anna', 'Borg, Katarzyna', 'Makuch-Lasica, Hanna', 'Nowak, Grazyna', 'Lech-Maranda, Ewa', 'Prochorec-Sobieszek, Monika', 'Warzocha, Krzysztof', 'Juszczynski, Przemyslaw']","['Gorniak P', 'Ejduk A', 'Borg K', 'Makuch-Lasica H', 'Nowak G', 'Lech-Maranda E', 'Prochorec-Sobieszek M', 'Warzocha K', 'Juszczynski P']","['Department of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Centre for Postgraduate Medical Education, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Diagnostic Hematology, Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

It exerts various biological effects, such as anti-inflammatory effects, and we have previously demonstrated that curcumin is a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerase lambda. Curcumin is characterized by poor bioavailability as it is water-insoluble, is poorly absorbed and is systemically eliminated. In order to increase the bioavailability of curcumin, in this study, we produced a curcumin-loaded lipid nanoemulsion of various particle sizes (50, 100 and 200 nm). The curcumin lipid nanoemulsion was prepared by a modified thin-film hydration method followed by sonication. To identify the optimal particle size which exhibits the strongest physiological activity, we investigated the inhibitory effects of the obtained nanoemulsions against inflammatory and allergic activities. In in vitro cell culture experiments, the 100-nm curcumin lipid nanoemulsion showed the most prominent inhibitory effect on the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in RAW264.7 murine macrophages, and on the release of beta-hexosaminidase induced by the calcium ionophore, A23187, in rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. In an in vivo experiment, in which mice were administered the curcumin-loaded lipid nanoemulsion of various particle sizes, the 100-nm curcumin lipid nanoemulsion showed the most prominent anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects, inhibiting 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced inflammatory ear edema and immunoglobulin E (IgE)-induced passive cutaneous anaphylactic (PCA) reaction. The effects of particle size on serum curcumin absorption were also assessed in mice, and the 100-nm lipid nanoemulsion showed the greatest absorption. The results from our study suggest that the physiological activities of curcumin lipid nanoemulsions differ depending on particle size. Our data indicate that the curcumin lipid nanoemulsion with a particle size of 100 nm has potential for use in enhancing the bioavailability and medical value of curcumin.","['Onodera, Takefumi', 'Kuriyama, Isoko', 'Andoh, Tooru', 'Ichikawa, Hideki', 'Sakamoto, Yuka', 'Lee-Hiraiwa, Eibai', 'Mizushina, Yoshiyuki']","['Onodera T', 'Kuriyama I', 'Andoh T', 'Ichikawa H', 'Sakamoto Y', 'Lee-Hiraiwa E', 'Mizushina Y']","['Laboratory of Food and Nutritional Sciences, Faculty of Nutrition, Kobe Gakuin University, Kobe, Hyogo 651-2180, Japan.', 'Cooperative Research Center of Life Sciences, Kobe Gakuin University, Kobe, Hyogo 651-8586, Japan.', 'Cooperative Research Center of Life Sciences, Kobe Gakuin University, Kobe, Hyogo 651-8586, Japan.', 'Cooperative Research Center of Life Sciences, Kobe Gakuin University, Kobe, Hyogo 651-8586, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Food and Nutritional Sciences, Faculty of Nutrition, Kobe Gakuin University, Kobe, Hyogo 651-2180, Japan.', 'Cooperative Research Center of Life Sciences, Kobe Gakuin University, Kobe, Hyogo 651-8586, Japan.', 'Cooperative Research Center of Life Sciences, Kobe Gakuin University, Kobe, Hyogo 651-8586, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Int J Mol Med,International journal of molecular medicine,9810955,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Emulsions)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'IT942ZTH98 (Curcumin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Anti-Inflammatory Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Curcumin/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Drug Carriers/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Edema/chemically induced/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Emulsions', 'Macrophages/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Particle Size', 'Rats', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/toxicity', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/04/21 06:00'],"['2015/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3892/ijmm.2015.2186 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Mol Med. 2015 Jun;35(6):1720-8. doi: 10.3892/ijmm.2015.2186.

Here, we review the potential for therapeutic targeting of the most common mutations associated with normal cytogenetics AML, focusing on those affecting the FLT3, NPM1 and epigenetic modifier genes (DNMT3A, IDH1/2, TET2). As compared to early compounds, second generation FLT3 inhibitors are more specific and have better pharmacokinetics. They also show higher anti-leukaemic activity, leading to about 50% of composite complete remissions in refractory/relapsed FLT3-internal tandem duplication-mutated AML. However, rapid relapses invariably occur due to various mechanisms of resistance to FLT3 inhibitors. This issue and the best way for using FLT3 inhibitors in combination with other therapeutic modalities are discussed. Potential approaches for therapeutic targeting of NPM1-mutated AML include: (i) reverting the aberrant nuclear export of NPM1 mutant using exportin-1 inhibitors; (ii) disruption of the nucleolus with drugs blocking the oligomerization of wild-type nucleophosmin or inducing nucleolar stress; and (iii) immunotherapeutic targeting of highly expressed CD33 and IL3RA (CD123) antigens. Finally, we discuss the role of demethylating agents (decitabine and azacitidine) and IDH1/2 inhibitors in the treatment of AML patients carrying mutations of genes (DNMT3A, IDH1/2 and TET2) involved in the epigenetic regulation of transcription.","['Falini, Brunangelo', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Brunetti, Lorenzo', 'Martelli, Maria Paola']","['Falini B', 'Sportoletti P', 'Brunetti L', 'Martelli MP']","['Institute of Haematology-CREO (Centro di Ricerche Emato-Oncologiche), Ospedale S.

Its physiological role is to catalyze the release of kinins and other vasoactive peptides. Several KLKs have been proposed as putative tumor biomarkers with significant diagnostic and/or prognostic value in human malignancies arising from solid tumors; the most prominent example is the worldwide use of KLK3 (prostate-specific antigen, PSA) in prostate cancer diagnostics. The aim of this study was to analyze KLKB1 mRNA expression in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients and to examine its diagnostic value as a novel molecular biomarker in CLL. DESIGN AND METHODS: Total RNA was isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of sixty-nine patients previously diagnosed with CLL and thirty-one healthy blood donors. After cDNA preparation, a sensitive and cost-effective quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) methodology was developed and applied for KLKB1 mRNA quantification. Last, we carried out a biostatistical analysis to assess the clinical significance of KLKB1 mRNA expression. RESULTS: According to our findings, KLKB1 mRNA expression is significantly higher in CLL patients than in healthy blood donors. Furthermore, KLKB1 mRNA levels are negatively correlated with CD38 expression, an established prognostic biomarker in CLL. Most importantly, KLKB1 mRNA expression possesses important diagnostic value, distinguishing very efficiently CLL patients from non-leukemic population. CONCLUSIONS: KLKB1 mRNA expression is a putative molecular biomarker in CLL, meriting investigation in large cohorts of CLL patients and non-leukemic controls.","['Adamopoulos, Panagiotis G', 'Kontos, Christos K', 'Papageorgiou, Sotirios G', 'Pappa, Vassiliki', 'Scorilas, Andreas']","['Adamopoulos PG', 'Kontos CK', 'Papageorgiou SG', 'Pappa V', 'Scorilas A']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Athens, Athens GR-15701, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Athens, Athens GR-15701, Greece.', 'Second Department of Internal Medicine, Propaedeutic, University of Athens, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Athens GR-12462, Greece.', 'Second Department of Internal Medicine, Propaedeutic, University of Athens, University General Hospital ""Attikon"", Athens GR-12462, Greece.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Athens, Athens GR-15701, Greece.

Genomic profiling in ALL has identified new prognostic markers, new therapeutic targets, and novel ALL subtypes. These may be amenable to future targeted therapies that can further improve outcomes. The early recognition of early precursor T-cell ALL, a distinct pathobiological entity with a poor prognosis, is essential for the development of an effective clinical management strategy. The role of monoclonal antibodies and cytotoxic T-cell therapies continues to be defined. Many of the approaches are currently being evaluated for ALL salvage.

These tumours usually develop in concurrence with or following acute leukemia. The breast is an uncommon site for presentation of this tumour, where it is often misdiagnosed as lymphoma or carcinoma.A 33- year-old female presented with a right breast lump in a private hospital, which was diagnosed as ductal carcinoma on lumpectomy. Subsequently she developed a lump in the left breast and a similar diagnosis of carcinoma was made on biopsy. A left mastectomy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a tumour composed of mononuclear cells arranged in sheets and cords with round to oval vesicular nuclei and occasional prominent nucleoli. IHC for CK was very weak and focal. The tumour cells were immunonegative for ER, PR, Her2neu,epithelial membrane antigen, e-cadherin, CD3 and CD20. Diffuse immunopositivity for myeloperoxidase, CD34 and CD117 established a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. A histopathological review of the right breast lesion, with immunohistochemistry, also confirmed the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma.

The patient was treated with high dose cytarabine (HDAC) regimen and was disease free during the 12-month follow-up.Although extremely rare, awareness of such a presentation is crucial. This case also illustrates that careful histopathological review along with an expanded panel of immunohistochemistry is extremely important for recognizing such cases as a misdiagnosis can lead to unnecessary surgery and inappropriate therapy.","['Nalwa, Aasma', 'Nath, Devajit', 'Suri, Vaishali', 'Jamaluddin, Mohamed Amjad', 'Srivastava, Anurag']","['Nalwa A', 'Nath D', 'Suri V', 'Jamaluddin MA', 'Srivastava A']","['All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Department of Pathology, First Floor, Teaching Block, New Delhi. 110029, India. surivaishali@yahoo.co.in.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Malaysia,Malays J Pathol,The Malaysian journal of pathology,8101177,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemistry/*pathology/therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mammography/methods', 'Mastectomy', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography, Mammary', 'Unnecessary Procedures']",2015/04/22 06:00,2017/01/18 06:00,['2015/04/20 06:00'],"['2015/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/18 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Malays J Pathol. 2015 Apr;37(1):63-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies on the differentiation of these cells to specific early differentiation stages has been aided by an ES cell line carrying the Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) targeted to the Brachyury (Bry) locus which marks mesoderm commitment. Furthermore, expression of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor receptor 2 (Flk1) along with Bry defines hemangioblast commitment. Isobaric-tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ(TM)) and phosphopeptide enrichment coupled to liquid chromatography separation and mass spectrometry allow the study of phosphorylation changes occurring at different stages of ES cell development using Bry and Flk1 expression respectively. We identified and relatively quantified 37 phosphoentities which are modulated during mesoderm-induced ES cells differentiation, comparing epiblast-like, early mesoderm and hemangioblast-enriched cells. Among the proteins differentially phosphorylated toward mesoderm differentiation were: the epigenetic regulator Dnmt3b, the protein kinase GSK3b, the chromatin remodeling factor Smarcc1, the transcription factor Utf1; as well as protein specifically related to stem cell differentiation, as Eomes, Hmga2, Ints1 and Rif1. As most key factors regulating early hematopoietic development have also been implicated in various types of leukemia, understanding the post-translational modifications driving their regulation during normal development could result in a better comprehension of their roles during abnormal hematopoiesis in leukemia.","['Piazzi, Manuela', 'Williamson, Andrew', 'Lee, Chia-Fang', 'Pearson, Stella', 'Lacaud, Georges', 'Kouskoff, Valerie', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Cocco, Lucio', 'Whetton, Anthony D']","['Piazzi M', 'Williamson A', 'Lee CF', 'Pearson S', 'Lacaud G', 'Kouskoff V', 'McCubrey JA', 'Cocco L', 'Whetton AD']","['Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Science (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Italy.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell Research Group, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell Biology Group Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Stem Cell Research Group, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine at East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.', 'Cell Signaling Laboratory, Department of Biomedical Science (DIBINEM), University of Bologna, Italy.', 'Stem Cell and Leukaemia Proteomics Laboratory, Manchester Academic Health Science Centre, The University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2)', 'EQ43SC3GDB (Brachyury protein)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Databases, Protein', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Fetal Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Hemangioblasts/*metabolism', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Mice', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', '*Proteomics/methods', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transfection', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor-2/genetics/metabolism']",2015/04/22 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/04/20 06:00'],"['2015/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['3454 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3454 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 May 10;6(13):10924-39. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3454.,,PMC4484429,['NOTNLM'],"['hemangioblast', 'iTRAQ', 'nucleus', 'phosphoproteomic']",,,,"['BB/F000499/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'BB/I001794/1/Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council/United', 'Kingdom', 'Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of LSCs drug resistance have not been fully defined. In this study, we attempted to elucidate the mechanisms of LSCs drug resistance. METHODS: We performed reverse phase protein arrays to analyze the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins in the LSC-enriched leukemia cell line KG-1a. Immuno-blotting, cell viability and clinical AML samples were evaluated to verify the micro-assay results. The characteristics and transcriptional regulation of survivin were analyzed with the relative luciferase reporter assay, mutant constructs, chromatin immuno-precipitation (ChIP), quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and western blotting. The levels of Sp1, c-Myc, phospho-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK), phospho-mitogen and stress-activated protein kinase (p-MSK) were investigated in paired CD34+ and CD34- AML patient samples. RESULTS: Survivin was highly over-expressed in CD34 + CD38- KG-1a cells and paired CD34+ AML patients compared with their differentiated counterparts. Functionally, survivin contributes to the drug resistance of LSCs, and Sp1 and c-Myc concurrently regulate levels of survivin transcription. Clinically, Sp1 and c-Myc were significantly up-regulated and positively correlated with survivin in CD34+ AML patients. Moreover, Sp1 and c-Myc were further activated by the ERK/MSK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, modulating survivin levels. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that ERK/MSK/Sp1/c-Myc axis functioned as a critical regulator of survivin expression in LSCs, offering a potential new therapeutic strategy for LSCs therapy.","['Zhang, Yi', 'Chen, Hai-xuan', 'Zhou, Shu-yan', 'Wang, Shao-xiang', 'Zheng, Kai', 'Xu, Dan-dan', 'Liu, Yu-ting', 'Wang, Xiao-yan', 'Wang, Xiao', 'Yan, Hai-Zhao', 'Zhang, Li', 'Liu, Qiu-ying', 'Chen, Wan-qun', 'Wang, Yi-fei']","['Zhang Y', 'Chen HX', 'Zhou SY', 'Wang SX', 'Zheng K', 'Xu DD', 'Liu YT', 'Wang XY', 'Wang X', 'Yan HZ', 'Zhang L', 'Liu QY', 'Chen WQ', 'Wang YF']","['College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R, China. scholarzy@163.com.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R China. scholarzy@163.com.', 'College of Medicine, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R China. chx00520@163.com.', 'Department of Pathological Physiology, Wan-nan Medical College, 241000, Wuhu, P.R China. zhoushuyan_xju2005@126.com.', 'College of Medicine, Shenzhen University, 518020, Shenzhen, P.R China. hackerwsx@163.com.', 'College of Medicine, Shenzhen University, 518020, Shenzhen, P.R China. y.k.zheng@163.com.', 'College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R, China. 496502190@qq.com.', 'College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R, China. ziziniu@163.com.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R China. wangxiaoyan_1016@163.com.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R China. wangxiao0719@163.com.', 'College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R, China. yanhaizhao@126.com.', 'College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R, China. 15692002254@163.com.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R China. qiuying_liu@126.com.', 'College of Medicine, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R China. tchwanq@jnu.edu.cn.', 'College of Life Science and Technology, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R, China. twang-yf@163.com.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, Jinan University, 510632, Guangzhou, P.R China. twang-yf@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cancer,Molecular cancer,101147698,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Sp1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Sp1 protein, human)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD34/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*genetics', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Sp1 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Survivin', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'U937 Cells', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/01/15 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12943-015-0326-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s12943-015-0326-0 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cancer. 2015 Mar 7;14:56. doi: 10.1186/s12943-015-0326-0.,20150307,PMC4357193,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our study attempted to develop two SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR (RT-PCR) assays for specific detection of ALV subgroup J (ALV-J) and multiplex detection of ALV subgroups A and B (ALV-A/B), respectively. RESULTS: The two assays showed high specificity for ALV-J and ALV-A/B and the sensitivity of the two assays was at least 100 times higher than that of the routine PCR assay. The minimum virus detection limit of virus culture, routine PCR and real-time PCR for detection of ALV-A strain was 10(3) TCID50 units, 10(2) TCID50 units and fewer than 10 TCID50 units, respectively. In addition, the coefficients of variation for intra- and inter-assay were both less than 5%. Forty clinical plasma samples were evaluated by real-time PCR, routine PCR, and virus culture with positive rates of 80% (32/40), 72.5% (29/40) and 62.5% (25/40), respectively. When the assay for detection of ALV-J was used to quantify the viral load of various organ tissues in chicken inoculated by ALV-J strains CHN06 and NX0101, the results exhibited that ALV-J genes could be detected in all organ tissues examined and the highest copies of ALV-J were mainly in heart and kidney samples at 30 weeks post-infection. Except in lung, the virus copies of CHN06 group were higher than that of NX0101 group in various organ tissues. CONCLUSIONS: The SYBR Green I-based real-time RT-PCR assay provides a powerful tool for the detection of ALV and study of virus replication and infection.","['Dai, Manman', 'Feng, Min', 'Liu, Di', 'Cao, Weisheng', 'Liao, Ming']","['Dai M', 'Feng M', 'Liu D', 'Cao W', 'Liao M']","[""College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. daimanman1229@163.com."", ""Key Laboratory of Veterinary Vaccine Innovation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. daimanman1229@163.com."", ""College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. hunanfengmin@163.com."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. jailart@foxmail.com."", ""Key Laboratory of Veterinary Vaccine Innovation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. jailart@foxmail.com."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, South China Agricultural University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. weishengcao@yahoo.com."", ""Key Laboratory of Veterinary Vaccine Innovation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. weishengcao@yahoo.com."", ""Key Laboratory of Veterinary Vaccine Innovation of the Ministry of Agriculture, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. mliao@scau.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Organic Chemicals)', '0 (Quinolines)', '163795-75-3 (SYBR Green I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/diagnosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/genetics', 'Benzothiazoles', 'Chickens', 'Diamines', 'Genes, Viral', '*Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Organic Chemicals', 'Quinolines', '*Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Reference Standards', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Viral Load']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/12/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-015-0291-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-015-0291-7 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2015 Apr 3;12:52. doi: 10.1186/s12985-015-0291-7.,20150403,PMC4403717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the predisposing risk factors, immunodeficiency plays an important role. Pyomyositis has a tendency to mimic more commonly considered diseases, and a lack of familiarity with it is a cause of delayed diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old South Asian man with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus was referred to our medical unit in an advanced stage of the disease, which was complicated by sepsis and acute kidney injury. Failure of the referring unit to provide prompt treatment, as well as their delay in coming to a diagnosis, led to the patient's complicated state. Antibiotic therapy was initiated, and clinical stabilization was achieved with supportive measures. Following the patient's recovery from sepsis, his persistent leukopenia and anemia was suggestive of an underlying immunodeficiency, and a subsequent bone marrow biopsy revealed acute myeloid leukemia, M2 variant. Multi-disciplinary care was initiated by the medical, surgical and oncological teams. CONCLUSION: Awareness of tropical pyomyositis is lacking. Common predisposing behaviors and conditions should always be sought and investigated. Immunosuppressive state is an important predisposing factor in the pathogenesis of pyomyositis. Early antibiotic treatment is pivotal in management, and surgical intervention, when relevant, should not be delayed. Identifying one cause should not halt the search for others, as pyomyositis may herald underlying sinister diseases.","['Navinan, Mitrakrishnan Rayno', 'Yudhisdran, Jevon', 'Kandeepan, Thambyaiah', 'Kulatunga, Aruna']","['Navinan MR', 'Yudhisdran J', 'Kandeepan T', 'Kulatunga A']","['National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Regent Street, Colombo, 10, Sri Lanka. rayno.navinan@gmail.com.', 'National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Regent Street, Colombo, 10, Sri Lanka. yudhishdran@yahoo.com.', 'National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Regent Street, Colombo, 10, Sri Lanka. kathambyaiah@yahoo.com.', 'National Hospital of Sri Lanka, Regent Street, Colombo, 10, Sri Lanka. kulatunga.aruna@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Delayed Diagnosis', 'Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyomyositis/drug therapy/*etiology']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/07/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-015-0513-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-015-0513-z [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2015 Feb 15;9:39. doi: 10.1186/s13256-015-0513-z.,20150215,PMC4340827,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These signal sequences usually contain an N-terminal basic amino acid followed by a stretch containing hydrophobic residues, although no consensus signal sequence has been identified. In this study, simple modeling of signal sequences was attempted using Gaussia princeps secretory luciferase (GLuc) in the yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus, which allowed comprehensive recombinant gene construction to substitute synthetic signal sequences. RESULTS: Mutational analysis of the GLuc signal sequence revealed that the GLuc hydrophobic peptide length was lower limit for effective secretion and that the N-terminal basic residue was indispensable. Deletion of the 16th Glu caused enhanced levels of secreted protein, suggesting that this hydrophilic residue defined the boundary of a hydrophobic peptide stretch. Consequently, we redesigned this domain as a repeat of a single hydrophobic amino acid between the N-terminal Lys and C-terminal Glu. Stretches consisting of Phe, Leu, Ile, or Met were effective for secretion but the number of residues affected secretory activity. A stretch containing sixteen consecutive methionine residues (M16) showed the highest activity; the M16 sequence was therefore utilized for the secretory production of human leukemia inhibitory factor protein in yeast, resulting in enhanced secreted protein yield. CONCLUSIONS: We present a new concept for the provision of secretory signal sequence ability in the yeast K. marxianus, determined by the number of residues of a single hydrophobic residue located between N-terminal basic and C-terminal acidic amino acid boundaries.","['Yarimizu, Tohru', 'Nakamura, Mikiko', 'Hoshida, Hisashi', 'Akada, Rinji']","['Yarimizu T', 'Nakamura M', 'Hoshida H', 'Akada R']","['Department of Applied Molecular Bioscience, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Tokiwadai, Ube, 755-8611, Japan. qqyg6rs9k@arion.ocn.ne.jp.', 'Present address: Environmental Biofunction Division, National Institute for Agro-Environmental Sciences, 3-1-3 Kan-nondai, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, 305-8604, Japan. qqyg6rs9k@arion.ocn.ne.jp.', 'Innovation Center, Yamaguchi University, 2-16-1 Tokiwadai, Ube, 755-8611, Japan. fukui@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Applied Molecular Bioscience, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Tokiwadai, Ube, 755-8611, Japan. hoshida@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp.', 'Department of Applied Molecular Bioscience, Yamaguchi University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-16-1 Tokiwadai, Ube, 755-8611, Japan. rinji@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Microb Cell Fact,Microbial cell factories,101139812,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Arthropod Proteins)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Sorting Signals)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Amino Acids/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Arthropod Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Copepoda/enzymology/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions', 'Kluyveromyces/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Luciferases/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Peptides/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Sorting Signals/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12934-015-0203-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12934-015-0203-y [pii]']",epublish,Microb Cell Fact. 2015 Feb 14;14:20. doi: 10.1186/s12934-015-0203-y.,20150214,PMC4347551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since latest generation immunotoxins are composed of a toxic domain genetically fused to antibody fragment(s) which confer on the IT target selective specificity, we rescued from the hydridoma 4KB128, a recombinant single-chain variable fragment (scFv) targeting CD22, a marker antigen expressed by B-lineage leukaemias and lymphomas. We constructed several ITs using two enzymatic toxins both able to block protein translation, one of bacterial origin (a truncated version of Pseudomonas exotoxin A, PE40) endowed with EF-2 ADP-ribosylation activity, the other being the plant ribosome-inactivating protein saporin, able to specifically depurinate 23/26/28S ribosomal RNA. PE40 was selected because it has been widely used for the construction of recombinant ITs that have already undergone evaluation in clinical trials. Saporin has also been evaluated clinically and has recently been expressed successfully at high levels in a Pichia pastoris expression system. The aim of the present study was to evaluate optimal microbial expression of various IT formats. RESULTS: An anti-CD22 scFv termed 4KB was obtained which showed the expected binding activity which was also internalized by CD22+ target cells and was also competed for by the parental monoclonal CD22 antibody. Several fusion constructs were designed and expressed either in E. coli or in Pichia pastoris and the resulting fusion proteins affinity-purified. Protein synthesis inhibition assays were performed on CD22+ human Daudi cells and showed that the selected ITs were active, having IC50 values (concentration inhibiting protein synthesis by 50% relative to controls) in the nanomolar range. CONCLUSIONS: We undertook a systematic comparison between the performance of the different fusion constructs, with respect to yields in E. coli or P. pastoris expression systems and also with regard to each constructs specific killing efficacy. Our results confirm that E. coli is the system of choice for the expression of recombinant fusion toxins of bacterial origin whereas we further demonstrate that saporin-based ITs are best expressed and recovered from P. pastoris cultures after yeast codon-usage optimization.","['Della Cristina, Pietro', 'Castagna, Monica', 'Lombardi, Alessio', 'Barison, Erika', 'Tagliabue, Giovanni', 'Ceriotti, Aldo', 'Koutris, Ilias', 'Di Leandro, Luana', 'Giansanti, Francesco', 'Vago, Riccardo', 'Ippoliti, Rodolfo', 'Flavell, Sopsamorn U', 'Flavell, David J', 'Colombatti, Marco', 'Fabbrini, Maria Serena']","['Della Cristina P', 'Castagna M', 'Lombardi A', 'Barison E', 'Tagliabue G', 'Ceriotti A', 'Koutris I', 'Di Leandro L', 'Giansanti F', 'Vago R', 'Ippoliti R', 'Flavell SU', 'Flavell DJ', 'Colombatti M', 'Fabbrini MS']","['Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. pietro.decri@gmail.com.', 'Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. monica.castagna@univr.it.', 'Istituto Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria, CNR, Milan, Italy. alessiolombardi64@yahoo.it.', 'Department of Pathology and Diagnostics, University of Verona, Verona, Italy. erika.barison@gmail.com.', 'Istituto Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria, CNR, Milan, Italy. giovannitagliabue@virgilio.it.', 'Istituto Biologia e Biotecnologia Agraria, CNR, Milan, Italy. ceriotti@ibba.cnr.it.', ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy. ikoutris@yahoo.com."", ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy. luana.dileandro@univaq.it."", ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy. francesco.giansanti@cc.univaq.it."", ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy. vago.riccardo@hsr.it."", ""Department of Life, Health and Environmental Sciences, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, Italy. rodolfo.ippoliti@univaq.it."", 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, (Leukaemia Busters), Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK. beef@leukaemiabusters.org.uk.', 'The Simon Flavell Leukaemia Research Laboratory, (Leukaemia Busters), Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK.

Immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory stimuli on DC such as the cytokine IL-10 suppress the activity of the transcription factor NF-kappaB what results in downregulation of costimulatory molecules, MHC and cytokine production. Glycoprotein NMB (GPNMB) is a transmembrane protein, which acts as a coinhibitory molecule strongly inhibiting T cell responses if present on APC. Interestingly, its expression on human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (moDC) is dramatically upregulated upon treatment with IL-10 but also by the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) imatinib, nilotinib or dasatinib used for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for GPNMB overexpression are yet unknown. RESULTS: The immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 and the BCR-ABL TKI imatinib or nilotinib, that were examined here, concordantly inhibit the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby activating the downstream serine/threonine protein kinase GSK3ss, and subsequently the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) that is phosphorylated and translocated into the nucleus. Treatment of moDC with a small molecule inhibitor of MITF activity reduced the expression of GPNMB at the level of mRNA and protein, indicating that GPNMB expression is in fact facilitated by MITF activation. In line with these findings, PI3K/Akt inhibition was found to result in GPNMB overexpression accompanied by reduced stimulatory capacity of moDC in mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLR) with allogeneic T cells that could be restored by addition of the GPNMB T cell ligand syndecan-4 (SD-4). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, imatinib, nilotinib or IL-10 congruently inhibit the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway thereby activating MITF in moDC, resulting in a tolerogenic phenotype. These findings extend current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms balancing activating and inhibitory signals in human DC and may facilitate the targeted manipulation of T cell responses in the context of DC-based immunotherapeutic interventions.","['Gutknecht, Michael', 'Geiger, Julian', 'Joas, Simone', 'Dorfel, Daniela', 'Salih, Helmut R', 'Muller, Martin R', 'Grunebach, Frank', 'Rittig, Susanne M']","['Gutknecht M', 'Geiger J', 'Joas S', 'Dorfel D', 'Salih HR', 'Muller MR', 'Grunebach F', 'Rittig SM']","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Oncology, Hematology, Immunology, Rheumatology and Pulmology, University of Tubingen, Otfried-Muller-Str. 10, 72076, Tubingen, Germany.

Thus, we hypothesized that 1) deregulation of the hedgehog (Hh) stem cell self-renewal and cell cycle regulatory pathway would promote dormant human LSC generation and 2) that PF-04449913, a clinical antagonist of the GLI2 transcriptional activator, smoothened (SMO), would enhance dormant human LSC eradication. METHODS: To test these postulates, whole transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), microarray, qRT-PCR, stromal co-culture, confocal fluorescence microscopic, nanoproteomic, serial transplantation and cell cycle analyses were performed on FACS purified normal, chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), blast crisis (BC) phase CML progenitors with or without PF-04449913 treatment. RESULTS: Notably, RNA-seq analyses revealed that Hh pathway and cell cycle regulatory gene overexpression correlated with leukemic progression. While lentivirally enforced GLI2 expression enhanced leukemic progenitor dormancy in stromal co-cultures, this was not observed with a mutant GLI2 lacking a transactivation domain, suggesting that GLI2 expression prevented cell cycle transit. Selective SMO inhibition with PF-04449913 in humanized stromal co-cultures and LSC xenografts reduced downstream GLI2 protein and cell cycle regulatory gene expression. Moreover, SMO inhibition enhanced cell cycle transit and sensitized BC LSC to tyrosine kinase inhibition in vivo at doses that spare normal HSC. CONCLUSION: In summary, while GLI2, forms part of a core HH pathway transcriptional regulatory network that promotes human myeloid leukemic progression and dormant LSC generation, selective inhibition with PF-04449913 reduces the dormant LSC burden thereby providing a strong rationale for clinical trials predicated on SMO inhibition in combination with TKIs or chemotherapeutic agents with the ultimate aim of obviating leukemic therapeutic resistance, persistence and progression.","['Sadarangani, Anil', 'Pineda, Gabriel', 'Lennon, Kathleen M', 'Chun, Hye-Jung', 'Shih, Alice', 'Schairer, Annelie E', 'Court, Angela C', 'Goff, Daniel J', 'Prashad, Sacha L', 'Geron, Ifat', 'Wall, Russell', 'McPherson, John D', 'Moore, Richard A', 'Pu, Minya', 'Bao, Lei', 'Jackson-Fisher, Amy', 'Munchhof, Michael', 'VanArsdale, Todd', 'Reya, Tannishtha', 'Morris, Sheldon R', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Messer, Karen', 'Mikkola, Hanna K A', 'Marra, Marco A', 'Hudson, Thomas J', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M']","['Sadarangani A', 'Pineda G', 'Lennon KM', 'Chun HJ', 'Shih A', 'Schairer AE', 'Court AC', 'Goff DJ', 'Prashad SL', 'Geron I', 'Wall R', 'McPherson JD', 'Moore RA', 'Pu M', 'Bao L', 'Jackson-Fisher A', 'Munchhof M', 'VanArsdale T', 'Reya T', 'Morris SR', 'Minden MD', 'Messer K', 'Mikkola HK', 'Marra MA', 'Hudson TJ', 'Jamieson CH']","['Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. asadarangani@ucsd.edu.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0820, USA. asadarangani@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. gpineda@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. klennon@ucsd.edu.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Center, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada. echun@bcgsc.ca."", 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. ashih@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. aschairer@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. acourtrecart@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. dgoff@ucsd.edu.', 'Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA. sprashad@ucla.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. igeron@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. rwall@ucsd.edu.', 'Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, Toronto, ON, Canada. john.mcpherson@oicr.on.ca.', ""Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Center, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada. rmoore@bcgsc.ca."", 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. mpu@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. lebao@AD.UCSD.EDU.', 'Pfizer, La Jolla, CA, USA. afisher@pfizer.com.', 'Pfizer, La Jolla, CA, USA. mMunchhof@pfizer.com.', 'Pfizer, La Jolla, CA, USA. tVanArsdale@pfizer.com.', 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. treya@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Stem Cell Program and Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, 3855 Health Sciences Drive, La Jolla, 92037, CA, USA. shmorris@ucsd.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.

The aim of this study is to develop the Malaysian Diagnosis Related Group (MY-DRG) case-mix pharmacy service weight in University Kebangsaan Malaysia-Medical Center (UKMMC) by identifying the actual cost of pharmacy services by MY-DRG groups in the hospital. METHODS: All patients admitted to UKMMC in 2011 were recruited in this study. Combination of Step-down and Bottom-up costing methodology has been used in this study. The drug and supplies cost; the cost of staff; the overhead cost; and the equipment cost make up the four components of pharmacy. Direct costing approach has been employed to calculate Drugs and supplies cost from electronic-prescription system; and the inpatient pharmacy staff cost, while the overhead cost and the pharmacy equipments cost have been calculated indirectly from MY-DRG data base. The total pharmacy cost was obtained by summing the four pharmacy components' cost per each MY-DRG. The Pharmacy service weight of a MY-DRG was estimated by dividing the average pharmacy cost of the investigated MY-DRG on the average of a specified MY-DRG (which usually the average pharmacy cost of all MY-DRGs). RESULTS: Drugs and supplies were the main component (86.0%) of pharmacy cost compared o overhead cost centers (7.3%), staff cost (6.5%) and pharmacy equipments (0.2%) respectively. Out of 789 inpatient MY-DRGs case-mix groups, 450 (57.0%) groups were utilized by the UKMMC. Pharmacy service weight has been calculated for each of these 450 MY-DRGs groups. MY-DRG case-mix group of Lymphoma & Chronic Leukemia group with severity level three (C-4-11-III) has the highest pharmacy service weight of 11.8 equivalents to average pharmacy cost of RM 5383.90. While the MY-DRG case-mix group for Circumcision with severity level one (V-1-15-I) has the lowest pharmacy service weight of 0.04 equivalents to average pharmacy cost of RM 17.83. CONCLUSION: A mixed approach which is based partly on top-down and partly on bottom up costing methodology has been recruited to develop MY-DRG case-mix pharmacy service weight for 450 groups utilized by the UKMMC in 2011.","['Ali Jadoo, Saad Ahmed', 'Aljunid, Syed Mohamed', 'Nur, Amrizal Muhammad', 'Ahmed, Zafar', 'Van Dort, Dexter']","['Ali Jadoo SA', 'Aljunid SM', 'Nur AM', 'Ahmed Z', 'Van Dort D']","['United Nations University-International Institute for Global Health (UNU-IIGH), Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. drsaadalezzi@gemail.com.', 'International Centre for Case-Mix and Clinical Coding (ITCC), University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Jalan Yaacob Latiff, 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. drsaadalezzi@gemail.com.', 'International Centre for Case-Mix and Clinical Coding (ITCC), University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Jalan Yaacob Latiff, 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. saljunid@gmail.com.', 'International Centre for Case-Mix and Clinical Coding (ITCC), University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Jalan Yaacob Latiff, 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. amrizal65@gmail.com.', 'International Centre for Case-Mix and Clinical Coding (ITCC), University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Jalan Yaacob Latiff, 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. zafar.he@gmail.com.', 'Pharmacy of Hospital University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Jalan Yaacob Latiff, 56000 Cheras, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. dexter@ppukm.uk.edu.my.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Daru,"Daru : journal of Faculty of Pharmacy, Tehran University of Medical Sciences",101125969,,IM,"['Diagnosis-Related Groups/*economics', 'Hospital Costs/organization & administration', 'Hospitalization/economics', 'Hospitals, University', 'Malaysia', 'Pharmaceutical Services/*economics', 'Retrospective Studies']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/08/30 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40199-014-0075-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s40199-014-0075-4 [pii]']",epublish,Daru. 2015 Feb 10;23:14. doi: 10.1186/s40199-014-0075-4.,20150210,PMC4337187,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Self-reports may suffer from recall bias and provide information only on broad pesticide categories. We compared parental self-reported home and garden pest treatments to pesticides measured in carpet dust. METHODS: Parents of 277 children with leukemia and 306 controls in Northern and Central California (2001-2007) were asked about insect and weed treatments during the previous year. Carpet dust samples were analyzed for 47 pesticides. We present results for the 7 insecticides (carbaryl, propoxur, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, permethrin), 5 herbicides (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid [2,4-D], chlorthal, dicamba, mecoprop, simazine), and 1 synergist (piperonyl butoxide) that were present in home and garden products during the study period and were detected in >/=25% of carpet dust samples. We constructed linear regression models for the relative change in pesticide concentrations associated with self-reported treatment of pest types in cases and controls separately and combined, adjusting for demographics, housing characteristics, and nearby agricultural pesticide applications. RESULTS: Several self-reported treatments were associated with pesticide concentrations in dust. For example, households with flea/tick treatments had 2.3 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.4, 3.7) times higher permethrin concentrations than households not reporting this treatment. Households reporting treatment for ants/cockroaches had 2.5 (95% CI: 1.5, 4.2) times higher cypermethrin levels than households not reporting this treatment. Weed treatment by a household member was associated with 1.9 (1.4, 2.6), 2.2 (1.6, 3.1), and 2.8 (2.1, 3.7) times higher dust concentrations of dicamba, mecoprop, and 2,4-D, respectively. Weed treatments by professional applicators were null/inversely associated with herbicide concentrations in dust. Associations were generally similar between cases and controls and were consistent with pesticide active ingredients in these products during the study time period. CONCLUSIONS: Consistency between self-reported pest treatments, concentrations in dust, and pesticides in products lends credibility to the exposure assessment methods and suggests that differential recall by case-control status is minimal.","['Deziel, Nicole C', 'Colt, Joanne S', 'Kent, Erin E', 'Gunier, Robert B', 'Reynolds, Peggy', 'Booth, Benjamin', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Ward, Mary H']","['Deziel NC', 'Colt JS', 'Kent EE', 'Gunier RB', 'Reynolds P', 'Booth B', 'Metayer C', 'Ward MH']","['Yale School of Public Health, Department of Environmental Health Sciences, 60 College St., New Haven, CT, 06510, USA. nicole.deziel@yale.edu.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 9609 Medical Center Dr., Rockville, MD, 20850, USA. nicole.deziel@yale.edu.', 'Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 9609 Medical Center Dr., Rockville, MD, 20850, USA. coltj@mail.nih.gov.', 'Outcomes Research Branch, Applied Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, 9609 Medical Center Dr., Rockville, MD, 20850, USA. erin.kent@nih.gov.', 'School of Public Health, University of California, 50 University Hall, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA. gunier@berkeley.edu.', 'Cancer Prevention Institute of California, 2201 Walnut Ave., Fremont, CA, 94538, USA.

Due to largely ineffective vaccines, new control measures are needed to be developed. RNA interference (RNAi) has been developed a promising measure for antivirus in poultry. METHODS: In this study, miRNA-embedded siRNA interference was designed and used to inhibit ALV-J replication in vitro and in vivo. Each sequence of target siRNA derived from the gag (p15), pol (p32), env (gp85) and LTR (U3) gene of ALV-J was embedded into mouse miR-155 backbone as a pre-miRNA hairpin oligonucleotide sequence. After annealing, they were cloned into pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR vector, respectively. For detecting the interference effect, recombinant vectors were introduced into DF-1 cells and day-old SPF chickens that infected with ALV-J. RESULTS: In vitro, single target interference showed effective inhibition of reducing 74% ~ 85% mRNA of ALV-J. Double targets showed more efficient inhibition of reducing 96% ~ 98% mRNA of ALV-J. In vivo, chicks were inoculated with each recombinant plasmid in peritoneal cavity at day of hatch, and monitored infection status at interval 1 day postinfection for 4 weeks. Delivery of single target or double targets miRNA significantly reduced viremia and pathogenicity caused by ALV-J in vivo, especially the double targets. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated that the miRNA-embedded siRNA interference is an efficient method for inhibition of ALV-J replication, especially double targets.","['Wei, Rongrong', 'Ma, Xiaoqian', 'Wang, Guihua', 'Guo, Huijun', 'Liu, Jianzhu', 'Fan, Lingxiao', 'Cheng, Ziqiang']","['Wei R', 'Ma X', 'Wang G', 'Guo H', 'Liu J', 'Fan L', 'Cheng Z']","[""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China. leng.lengaaa@163.com."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China. xiaoqianchen1014@163.com."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China. liujz@sdau.edu.cn."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China. hjguo@sdau.edu.cn."", ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China. liujz@sdau.edu.cn."", 'Xiangya School of Medicine, Changsha, 410013, China. gabrielle0731@gmail.com.', ""College of Veterinary Medicine, Shandong Agricultural University, Tai'an, 271018, China. czqsd@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Gene Products, pol)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/prevention & control/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/enzymology/*genetics/physiology', 'Chickens', 'Down-Regulation', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Products, pol/genetics/metabolism', 'Poultry Diseases/prevention & control/*virology', '*RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/*genetics/metabolism', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Virus Replication']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/01/23 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-015-0277-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-015-0277-5 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2015 Mar 21;12:45. doi: 10.1186/s12985-015-0277-5.,20150321,PMC4376366,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the catalytic mechanism and design novel HTLV-1 protease inhibitors, the protonation states of the two catalytic aspartic acid residues must be determined. Free energy simulations have been conducted to study the proton transfer reaction between the catalytic residues of HTLV-1 protease using a combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulation. The free energy profiles for the reaction in the apo-enzyme and in an enzyme - substrate complex have been obtained. In the apo-enzyme, the two catalytic residues are chemically equivalent and are expected to be both unprotonated. Upon substrate binding, the catalytic residues of HTLV-1 protease evolve to a singly protonated state, in which the OD1 of Asp32 is protonated and forms a hydrogen bond with the OD1 of Asp32', which is unprotonated. The HTLV-1 protease-substrate complex structure obtained from this simulation can serve as the Michaelis complex structure for further mechanistic studies of HTLV-1 protease while providing a receptor structure with the correct protonation states for the active site residues toward the design of novel HTLV-1 protease inhibitors through virtual screening.","['Ma, Shuhua', 'Vogt, Kimberly A', 'Petrillo, Natalie', 'Ruhoff, Alyce J']","['Ma S', 'Vogt KA', 'Petrillo N', 'Ruhoff AJ']","['Department of Chemistry, Fisher College of Science and Mathematics, Towson University, 8000 York Road, Towson, MD 21252, USA.

Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was successfully fused inside the SiO2 layer of SiO2 shell-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles, which was superior to the traditional Fe3O4@SiO2@FITC modification process. The as-synthesized fluorescent magnetic beads were then encapsulated with lipidosome to form cationic magnetic fluorescent nanoparticles (CMFNPs) for mast cell magnetofection. The CMFNPs were then characterized by SEM, TEM, VSM, FTIR, and XRD analyses, and transfected into RBL-2H3 cells through a highly efficient, lipid-mediated magnetofection procedure. Magnetic glassy carbon electrode (MGCE), which possesses excellent reproducibility and regeneration qualities, was then employed to adsorb the CMFNP-transfected RBL-2H3 cells activated by an allergen antigen for electrochemical assay. Results show that the exposure of model antigen-dinitrophenol-bovine serum albumin (DNP-BSA) to anti-DNP IgE-sensitized mast cells induced a robust and long-lasting electrochemical impedance signal in a dose-dependent manner. The detection limit was identified at 3.3x10(-4) ng/mL. To demonstrate the utility of this mast cell-based biosensor for detection of real allergens in foodstuffs, Anti-Pen a1 IgE and Anti-PV IgE-activated cells were employed to quantify both shrimp allergen tropomyosin (Pen a 1) and fish allergen parvalbumin (PV). Results show high detection accuracy for these targets, with a limit of 0.03 mug/mL (shrimp Pen a 1) and 0.16 ng/mL (fish PV), respectively. To this effect, we conclude the proposed method is a facile, highly sensitive, innovative electrochemical method for the evaluation of food allergens.","['Jiang, Donglei', 'Zhu, Pei', 'Jiang, Hui', 'Ji, Jian', 'Sun, Xiulan', 'Gu, Wenshu', 'Zhang, Genyi']","['Jiang D', 'Zhu P', 'Jiang H', 'Ji J', 'Sun X', 'Gu W', 'Zhang G']","['School of Food Science and Technology, State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Synergetic Innovation Center of Food Safety and Nutrition, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Dairy Biotechnology, Dairy Research Institute, Bright Dairy & Food Co., Ltd., Shanghai 200436, China.', 'School of Food Science and Technology, State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Synergetic Innovation Center of Food Safety and Nutrition, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, China.', 'School of Food Science and Technology, State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Synergetic Innovation Center of Food Safety and Nutrition, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, China.', 'School of Food Science and Technology, State Key Laboratory of Food Science and Technology, Synergetic Innovation Center of Food Safety and Nutrition, Jiangnan University, Wuxi, Jiangsu 214122, China.

Inflammation-associated activation of ADAR1 occurs in leukemia stem cells specifically in the advanced, often drug-resistant stage of CML known as blast crisis. However, detection of cancer stem cell-associated RNA editing by RNA sequencing in these rare cell populations can be technically challenging, costly and requires PCR validation. The objectives of this study were to validate RNA editing of a subset of cancer stem cell-associated transcripts, and to develop a quantitative RNA editing fingerprint assay for rapid detection of aberrant RNA editing in human malignancies. METHODS: To facilitate quantification of cancer stem cell-associated RNA editing in exons and intronic or 3'UTR primate-specific Alu sequences using a sensitive, cost-effective method, we established an in vitro RNA editing model and developed a sensitive RNA editing fingerprint assay that employs a site-specific quantitative PCR (RESSq-PCR) strategy. This assay was validated in a stably-transduced human leukemia cell line, lentiviral-ADAR1 transduced primary hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and in primary human chronic myeloid leukemia stem cells. RESULTS: In lentiviral ADAR1-expressing cells, increased RNA editing of MDM2, APOBEC3D, GLI1 and AZIN1 transcripts was detected by RESSq-PCR with improved sensitivity over sequencing chromatogram analysis. This method accurately detected cancer stem cell-associated RNA editing in primary chronic myeloid leukemia samples, establishing a cancer stem cell-specific RNA editing fingerprint of leukemic transformation that will support clinical development of novel diagnostic tools to predict and prevent cancer progression. CONCLUSIONS: RNA editing quantification enables rapid detection of malignant progenitors signifying cancer progression and therapeutic resistance, and will aid future RNA editing inhibitor development efforts.","['Crews, Leslie A', 'Jiang, Qingfei', 'Zipeto, Maria A', 'Lazzari, Elisa', 'Court, Angela C', 'Ali, Shawn', 'Barrett, Christian L', 'Frazer, Kelly A', 'Jamieson, Catriona H M']","['Crews LA', 'Jiang Q', 'Zipeto MA', 'Lazzari E', 'Court AC', 'Ali S', 'Barrett CL', 'Frazer KA', 'Jamieson CH']","['Division of Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center at University of California, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. lcrews@ucsd.edu.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA. lcrews@ucsd.edu.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center at University of California, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. q1jiang@ucsd.edu.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA. q1jiang@ucsd.edu.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center at University of California, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. mzipeto@ucsd.edu.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA. mzipeto@ucsd.edu.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center at University of California, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. elazzari@ucsd.edu.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA. elazzari@ucsd.edu.', 'Doctoral School of Molecular and Translational Medicine, Department of Health Sciences, University of Milan, Milan, Italy. elazzari@ucsd.edu.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center at University of California, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. acourtrecart@ucsd.edu.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA. acourtrecart@ucsd.edu.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center at University of California, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. sha003@ucsd.edu.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA. sha003@ucsd.edu.', 'Division of Genome Information Sciences, Department of Pediatrics, University of California, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. cbarrett@ucsd.edu.', 'Division of Genome Information Sciences, Department of Pediatrics, University of California, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. kafrazer@ucsd.edu.', 'Division of Regenerative Medicine, Department of Medicine, Moores Cancer Center at University of California, La Jolla, CA, 92093, USA. cjamieson@ucsd.edu.', 'Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine, La Jolla, CA, 92037, USA. cjamieson@ucsd.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,J Transl Med,Journal of translational medicine,101190741,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 3.5.4.4 (Adenosine Deaminase)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase/metabolism', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', '*Cellular Reprogramming', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Lentivirus/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'RNA Editing/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/01/14 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12967-014-0370-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12967-014-0370-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Transl Med. 2015 Feb 12;13:52. doi: 10.1186/s12967-014-0370-3.,20150212,PMC4341880,,,,,,"['P30 CA023100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA130445/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA023100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated this mode for TBI with the intention to test the feasibility and to establish it as a clinical routine method. Special foci were directed onto treatment planning, dosimetric accuracy and practical aspects. PATIENTS AND METHODS: TBI plans were calculated with TomoDirect for a Rando phantom and all patients with an intended fractionated total body irradiation between November 2013 and May 2014 (n = 8). Finally, four of these patients were irradiated with TomoDirect. Additionally we studied variations in the modulation factor, pitch, field width of Y-jaws and dose grid during optimization. Dose measurements were performed using thermoluminescent rods in the Rando phantom, with the Delta4(R) and with ionization chambers in a solid water phantom. RESULTS: For all eight calculated plans with a prescribed dose of 12 Gy Dmean was 12.09-12.33 Gy (12,25 +/- 0.08 Gy), D98 11.2-11.6 Gy (11.45 +/- 0.12 Gy) and D2 12.6-13.1 Gy (12.94 +/- 0.13 Gy). Dmean of inner lungs was 8.73 +/- 0.22 Gy on the left side and 8.69 +/- 0.27 Gy on the right side. When single planning parameters are varied with otherwise constant parameters, the modulation factor showed the greatest impact on dose homogeneity and treatment time. The impact of the pitch was marginally, and almost equal homogeneity can be obtained with field width of Y-jaws 5 cm and 2.5 cm. Measurements with thermoluminescent rods (n = 25) in the Rando phantom showed a mean dose deviation between measured and calculated dose of 0.66 +/- 2.26%. 18 of 25 TLDs had a deviation below 3%, seven of 25 TLDs between 3% and 5%. CONCLUSION: TBI with TomoDirect allows a superior homogeneity compared to conventional methods, where lung blocks are widely accepted. The treatment is performed only in supine position and is robust and comfortable for the patient. TomoDirect allows the implementation of organ-specific dose prescriptions. So the discussion about the balance between the need for aggressive treatment and limited toxicity can be renewed with the new potentials of TomoDirect - for children as well as for adults - and possibly yield a better clinical outcome in the future.","['Salz, Henning', 'Bohrisch, Babette', 'Howitz, Simon', 'Banz, Nico', 'Weibert, Kirsten', 'Wiezorek, Tilo', 'Wendt, Thomas G']","['Salz H', 'Bohrisch B', 'Howitz S', 'Banz N', 'Weibert K', 'Wiezorek T', 'Wendt TG']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Jena, Bachstr. 18, 07749, Jena, Germany. henning.salz@med.uni-jena.de.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Jena, Bachstr. 18, 07749, Jena, Germany. babette.bohrisch@student.uni-halle.de.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Jena, Bachstr. 18, 07749, Jena, Germany. simon.howitz@med.uni-jena.de.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Jena, Bachstr. 18, 07749, Jena, Germany. nico.banz@med.uni-jena.de.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Jena, Bachstr. 18, 07749, Jena, Germany. kirsten.weibert@med.uni-jena.de.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Jena, Bachstr. 18, 07749, Jena, Germany. tilo.wiezorek@med.uni-jena.de.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University Hospital Jena, Bachstr. 18, 07749, Jena, Germany. thomas.wendt@med.uni-jena.de.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Radiat Oncol,"Radiation oncology (London, England)",101265111,,IM,"['Adult', 'Algorithms', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Positioning', '*Phantoms, Imaging', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Radiometry', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted/*methods', 'Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated/*methods', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/01/29 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13014-015-0362-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s13014-015-0362-3 [pii]']",epublish,Radiat Oncol. 2015 Mar 6;10:58. doi: 10.1186/s13014-015-0362-3.,20150306,PMC4353674,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypermethylation of the inhibitor of DNA binding 4 (ID4) gene may play an important role in the initiation and development of MDS and AL. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess ID4 gene methylation in MDS and to establish if it could be an effective method of evaluating MDS disease progression. METHODS: We examined 142 bone marrow samples from MDS patients, healthy donors and MDS-AL patients using bisulfite sequencing PCR and quantitative real-time methylation-specific PCR. The ID4 methylation rates and levels were assessed. RESULTS: ID4 methylation occurred in 27 patients (27/100). ID4 gene methylation was more frequent and at higher levels in patients with advanced disease stages and in high-risk subgroups according to WHO (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively) and International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) (P = 0.002, P = 0.007, respectively) classifications. ID4 methylation levels changed during disease progression. Both methylation rates and methylation levels were significantly different between healthy donor, MDS patients and patients with MDS-AL (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis indicated that the level of ID4 methylation was an independent factor influencing overall survival. Patients with MDS showed decreased survival time with increased ID4 methylation levels (P = 0.011, hazard ratio (HR) = 2.371). Patients with ID4 methylation had shorter survival time than those without ID4 methylation (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that ID4 gene methylation might be a new biomarker for MDS monitoring and the detection of minimal residual disease.","['Kang, Huiyuan', 'Wang, Xinrong', 'Gao, Li', 'Cen, Jian', 'Li, Mianyang', 'Wang, Wei', 'Wang, Nan', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Wang, Lili', 'Yu, Li']","['Kang H', 'Wang X', 'Gao L', 'Cen J', 'Li M', 'Wang W', 'Wang N', 'Li Y', 'Wang L', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. lifehope666@126.com.', 'Department of Clinical Tests, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. lifehope666@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. wongxr@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. 13911864393@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. cenj@yeah.net.', 'Department of Clinical Tests, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. limianyang301@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. wwpku2000@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. wangnan2000200005@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. yonghuililab@yahoo.com.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. liliwang7644@126.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, 28 Fuxing Road, Beijing, 100853, China. ylmedsci@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,"['0 (ID4 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', '*DNA Methylation', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Proteins/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*genetics']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40001-015-0092-x [doi]', '10.1186/s40001-015-0092-x [pii]']",epublish,Eur J Med Res. 2015 Feb 20;20:16. doi: 10.1186/s40001-015-0092-x.,20150220,PMC4336702,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some contrasting evidence exists in the literature with regard to commonly reported risk factors. In this study, we investigated whether the known risk factors for FIV and FeLV infections have a stronger effect for either infection. This retrospective study included samples from 696 cats seropositive for FIV and 593 cats seropositive for FeLV from the United States and Canada. Data were collected during two cross sectional studies, where cats were tested using IDEXX FIV/FeLV ELISA kits. To compare the effect of known risk factors for FIV infection compared to FeLV, using a case-case study design, random intercept logistic regression models were fit including cats' age, sex, neuter status, outdoor exposure, health status and type of testing facility as independent variables. A random intercept for testing facility was included to account for clustering expected in testing practices at the individual clinics and shelters. RESULTS: In the multivariable random intercept model, the odds of FIV compared to FeLV positive ELISA results were greater for adults (OR = 2.09, CI: 1.50-2.92), intact males (OR = 3.14, CI: 1.85-3.76), neutered males (OR = 2.68, CI: 1.44- 3.14), cats with outdoor access (OR = 2.58, CI: 1.85-3.76) and lower for cats with clinical illness (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.52-0.90). The variance components obtained from the model indicated clustering at the testing facility level. CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors that have a greater effect on FIV seropositivity include adulthood, being male (neutered or not) and having access to outdoors, while clinical illness was a stronger predictor for FeLV seropositivity. Further studies are warranted to assess the implications of these results for the management and control of these infections.","['Chhetri, Bimal K', 'Berke, Olaf', 'Pearl, David L', 'Bienzle, Dorothee']","['Chhetri BK', 'Berke O', 'Pearl DL', 'Bienzle D']","['Department of Population Medicine, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada. bchhetri@uoguelph.ca.', 'Department of Population Medicine, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada. oberke@uoguelph.ca.', 'Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada. oberke@uoguelph.ca.', 'Institute of Biometry, Epidemiology and Information Processing, University of Veterinary Medicine Hanover (Foundation), Hanover, Germany. oberke@uoguelph.ca.', 'Department of Population Medicine, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada. dpearl@uoguelph.ca.', 'Department of Pathobiology, Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON, Canada. dbienzle@uoguelph.ca.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Vet Res,BMC veterinary research,101249759,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Cat Diseases/etiology/*virology', 'Cats', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Female', '*Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline', 'Lentivirus Infections/etiology/*veterinary', '*Leukemia Virus, Feline', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Infections/etiology/*veterinary', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Tumor Virus Infections/etiology/*veterinary']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12917-015-0339-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12917-015-0339-3 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Vet Res. 2015 Feb 10;11:30. doi: 10.1186/s12917-015-0339-3.,20150210,PMC4332748,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, monitoring life satisfaction (LS) of long-term survivors following alloSCT is becoming increasingly important for oncologists. The aim of the study was to evaluate individual survivor priority of various general and health-related domains of life and their satisfaction with these domains. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of general and health-related LS on resilience, anxiety, depression and quality of life in AML survivors following alloSCT. METHODS: Forty-one AML survivors (median age at time of assessment = 49.0 years) who had undergone alloSCT (median time since transplantation = 3.1 years) were enrolled in the study. Psychosocial parameters were assessed using the following instruments: FLZ(M) (Questions on Life Satisfaction), EORTC QLQ-C30, HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and the RS-25 (Resilience Scale-25 items). Correlation analyses were computed to reveal the associations between the different questionnaires. RESULTS: Independence from help or care, well-regulated living conditions and financial security contributed positively to LS, whereas being off work due to health-reasons and dissatisfaction with physical aspects were negatively associated to the subjective feelings of overall satisfaction. Moreover, a high quality of life was strongly positively correlated with LS (Spearman's rho general LS: 0.643 and health-related LS: 0.726, both p < 0.001). A high degree of resilience was also strongly positively correlated with better LS (general LS: 0.700, health-related LS: 0.675, both p < 0.001). Symptoms of anxiety and depression were associated with an impaired general LS (anxiety: -0.674, depression: -0.698, both p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LS should be considered an important key contributor to the survivors' well-being following alloSCT. Thus, identifying protective psychological and physical factors that relieve stressors is of high importance in order to support long-term AML survivors with their special needs.","['Amler, Susanne', 'Sauerland, Maria Cristina', 'Deiters, Christian', 'Buchner, Thomas', 'Schumacher, Andrea']","['Amler S', 'Sauerland MC', 'Deiters C', 'Buchner T', 'Schumacher A']","['Institute of Biostatistics and Clinical Research, University of Muenster, Albert-Schweitzer-Campus 1, D-48149, Muenster, Germany.

We present the case of a patient with a history of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and AML who presented with myeloid sarcoma causing acute spinal cord compression. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 20-year-old man who presented with acute onset weakness and numbness in his lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a thoracic dorsal epidural mass. Despite the history of AML, we elected to forego image-guided biopsy and up-front radiation due to the rapidly progressive nature of his myelopathy. Immediate surgical decompression was performed, but the patient had recurrence of tumor leading to further compression 13 days postoperatively. Subsequently, emergent radiation was performed, leading to resolution of cord compression and local disease control. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, there are no randomized controlled trials examining the appropriate timing for postoperative radiation. Because most typical neuro-oncologic cases have no need for immediate postoperative radiation, our practice has been to wait 14 days to initiate postoperative radiation to ensure wound healing. One unique feature of our case was the rapid recurrence of symptoms due to tumor progression. Given this observation, we believe that radiation therapy should be considered as soon as possible after confirmatory pathology diagnosis for patients presenting with neurological compromise due to myeloid sarcoma of the spine.","['Joseph, Jacob R', 'Wilkinson, D Andrew', 'Bailey, Nathanael G', 'Lieberman, Andrew P', 'Tsien, Christina I', 'Orringer, Daniel A']","['Joseph JR', 'Wilkinson DA', 'Bailey NG', 'Lieberman AP', 'Tsien CI', 'Orringer DA']","['Department of Neurosurgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.', 'Department of Neurosurgery, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.

Balanced chromosomal translocations typically found in de novo acute myeloid leukemia occur occasionally in CML, such as inv(3)/t(3;3), t(8;21), t(15;17), and inv(16). Translocations involving the 11q23, a relatively common genetic abnormality in acute leukemia, have been seldom reported in CML. In this study, we explored the prevalence and prognostic role of 11q23 in CML. METHODS: We searched our pathology archives for CML cases diagnosed in our institution from 1998 to present. Cases with 11q23 rearrangements were retrieved. The corresponding clinicopathological data were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 2,012 cases of CML with available karyotypes were identified. Ten (0.5%) CML cases had 11q23 rearrangement in Ph-positive cells, including 4 cases of t(9;11), 2 cases of t(11;19), and 1 case each of t(2;11), t(4;11), t(6;11), and t(4;9;11). Eight cases (80%) had other concurrent chromosomal abnormalities. There were 6 men and 4 women with a median age of 50 years (range, 21-70 years) at time of initial diagnosis of CML. 11q23 rearrangement occurred after a median period of 12.5 months (range, 0-172 months): 1 patient in chronic phase, 2 in accelerated phase, and 7 in blast phase. Eight of ten patients died after a median follow-up of 16.5 months (range, 8-186 months) following the initial diagnosis of CML, and a median of 6.7 months (range, 0.8-16.6 months) after the emergence of 11q23 rearrangement. The remaining two patients had complete remission at the last follow-up, 50.2 and 6.9 months, respectively. In addition, we also identified a case with 11q23/t(11;17) in Ph-negative cells in a patient with a history of CML. MLL involvement was tested by fluorescence in situ hybridization in 10 cases, and 7 cases (70%) were positive. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, chromosomal rearrangements involving 11q23 are rare in CML, frequently occurring in blast phase, and are often associated with other cytogenetic abnormalities. These patients had a low response rate to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and a poor prognosis.","['Wang, Wei', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Liu, Hui', 'Ai, Di', 'Yin, C Cameron', 'Li, Shaoying', 'Khoury, Joseph D', 'Bueso-Ramos, Carlos', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Hu, Shimin']","['Wang W', 'Tang G', 'Cortes JE', 'Liu H', 'Ai D', 'Yin CC', 'Li S', 'Khoury JD', 'Bueso-Ramos C', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Hu S']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. wwang13@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. gtang@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.

Based on this effect, we have utilized G-CSF-combined high-dose Ara-C in myeloablative conditioning for allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation from HLA-identical family donors since 1988. We report on the long-term outcomes of allogeneic HSCT using a conditioning regimen of 12Gy total body irradiation and G-CSF-combined high-dose Ara-C in 89 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. With a median follow-up of 135 months, the probability of overall survival and cumulative incidence of relapse at 5 years were 67.8% and 19.4%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, disease status at HSCT was associated with survival and relapse. These data demonstrate that G-CSF-combined myeloablative conditioning could be safely and effectively used for patients with myeloid malignancies.","['Konuma, Takaaki', 'Kato, Seiko', 'Ishii, Hiroto', 'Oiwa-Monna, Maki', 'Asano, Shigetaka', 'Tojo, Arinobu', 'Takahashi, Satoshi']","['Konuma T', 'Kato S', 'Ishii H', 'Oiwa-Monna M', 'Asano S', 'Tojo A', 'Takahashi S']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.

METHODS: Two genetic variants in the promoter of ADAM10 were selected to analyze the potential association with the risk of sepsis. A total of 440 sepsis patients and 450 matched healthy individuals in two independent Chinese Han population were enrolled. Pyrosequencing and polymerase chain reaction-length polymorphism was used to determine the genotypes of the rs514049 and rs653765. A real-time qPCR method was used to detect the mRNA level of ADAM10. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure the expression levels of substrates CX3CL1, interleukin (IL)-6R, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and IL-6. Luciferase assay was used to analyze the activities of the promoter haplotypes of ADAM10. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences between sepsis cases and controls in the genotype or allele frequencies were observed, suggesting that ADAM10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may not be risk factors for the occurrence of sepsis. A significant difference in the genotype and allele frequencies of the rs653765 SNP between patients with sepsis subtype and severe sepsis (P = 0.0014) or severe sepsis/sepsis shock (P = 0.0037) were observed. Moreover, the rs653765 CC genotype in severe sepsis showed a higher ADAM10 level compared to healthy groups, and the rs653765 CC polymorphism had a strong impact on the production of the ADAM10 substrates CX3CL1, IL-6R and TNF-alpha. Furthermore, the functional assay showed that ADAM10 C-A haplotype carriers exhibited significantly higher reporter activity compared with the T-A carriers and T-C carriers in human acute monocytic leukemia cell line. CONCLUSIONS: Our data initially indicated the ADAM10 rs653765 polymorphism was associated with the development of severe sepsis; the risk CC genotype could functionally affect the expression level of ADAM10 mRNA and was accompanied by the up-regulation of its substrates. Thus, ADAM10 might be clinically important and play a critical role in the pathogenesis of the development of sepsis, with potentially important therapeutic implications.","['Cui, Lili', 'Gao, Yan',

METHODS: In the present study, we investigated oral toxicity of OJS over 4 weeks through repeated administration to Crl:CD (SD) rats and its cytotoxicity against various cells as a part of safety evaluation. Animals were given a daily gavage treatment of OJS in daily dosages of 0, 500, 1000 or 2000 mg/kg for 4 weeks. Cytotoxicity assay was conducted at various concentrations in 23 different cell lines including neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, hepatocarcinoma, melanoma, leukemia, colon cancer, breast cancer, keratinocytes, phechromocytoma, prostate cancer, bronchial epithelial cells, and gastric adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: OJS did not induce significant changes in mortality, food consumption, organ weights, hematology, serum biochemistry, and urinalysis, except for decrease in number of white blood cells over 1000 mg/kg/day female group. Thus, the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) is more than 2000 mg/kg/day for male and 500 mg/kg/day for female rats. In addition, OJS had no cytotoxicity against all tested cells. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data indicate that OJS may be a safe drug although additional studies in the near future will be required before clinical trials can be taken.","['Jeong, Soo-Jin', 'Huh, Jung-Im', 'Shin, Hyeun-Kyoo']","['Jeong SJ', 'Huh JI', 'Shin HK']","['Herbal Medicine Formulation Research Group, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, 1672 Yuseong-daero, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea. sjijeong@kiom.re.kr.', 'Division of Non-clinical Studies, Korea Institute of Toxicology, PO Box 123, 100 Jangdong, Yusung-gu, Daejeon, 305-343, Republic of Korea. jihuh71@gmail.com.', 'Herbal Medicine Formulation Research Group, Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine, 1672 Yuseong-daero, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, Republic of Korea. hkshin@kiom.re.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Complement Altern Med,BMC complementary and alternative medicine,101088661,"['0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (ojeok-san)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'China', 'Female', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Medicine, Traditional/*adverse effects', 'No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level', 'Phytotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Plant Extracts/*adverse effects', 'Rats', 'Republic of Korea', 'Toxicity Tests']",2015/04/19 06:00,2015/11/11 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2013/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12906-015-0582-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12906-015-0582-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Complement Altern Med. 2015 Mar 1;15:38. doi: 10.1186/s12906-015-0582-y.,20150301,PMC4354991,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TAM usually presents and regresses within the first three months of life. In a subset of patients, myelopoiesis remains abnormal, and the persistence of elevated blasts after 6 months is considered ML of DS. Current tools including cytogenetics and flow cytometry fail to distinguish blasts of TAM that will regress from blasts of ML of DS. One gene expression profiling study suggested PRAME expression was significantly increased in ML of DS compared to TAM. To further investigate this finding, we studied PRAME protein expression by immunohistochemistry in cases of TAM and ML of DS. PRAME immunoreactivity was found in blasts, dysplastic megakaryocytes, and fibroblasts. Four cases of TAM and fourteen cases of ML of DS had interpretable staining, with PRAME cytoplasmic reactivity in megakaryoblasts. Of the four cases of TAM, two were positive for PRAME; of the two patients, one had follow-up demonstrating ML of DS and the other had fully regressing TAM. Of the fourteen cases of ML of DS, ten had at least a subset of cells with positive PRAME staining, while four were negative for PRAME. In summary, PRAME immunoreactivity in ML of DS is largely due to the non-blast components, while PRAME immunoreactivity in blasts of TAM is not restricted to cases that progress to ML of DS.","['Chisholm, Karen M', 'Rivetta, Claudia V', 'Heerema-McKenney, Amy']","['Chisholm KM', 'Rivetta CV', 'Heerema-McKenney A']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA karen.chisholm@childrens.harvard.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Clin Lab Sci,Annals of clinical and laboratory science,0410247,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (PRAME protein, human)', 'Myeloproliferative Syndrome, Transient']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemoid Reaction/complications/*metabolism/pathology', 'Placenta/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', '*Staining and Labeling']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/01/14 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/14 06:00 [medline]']",['45/2/121 [pii]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Lab Sci. 2015 Spring;45(2):121-7.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Down syndrome', 'PRAME', 'acute megakaryoblastic leukemia', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'transient abnormal myelopoiesis']","['(c) 2015 by the Association of Clinical Scientists, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Folate receptor beta (FRbeta) is a myeloid-lineage antigen expressed on 70% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patient samples. Here, we describe the development and evaluation of the first CARs specific for human FRbeta (m909) in vitro and in vivo. m909 CAR T cells exhibited selective activation and lytic function against engineered C30-FRbeta as well as endogenous FRbeta(+) AML cell lines in vitro. In mouse models of human AML, m909 CAR T cells mediated the regression of engrafted FRbeta(+) THP1 AML in vivo. In addition, we demonstrated that treatment of AML with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) enhanced FRbeta expression, resulting in improved immune recognition by m909 CAR T cells. Because many cell surface markers are shared between AML blasts and healthy hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSCs), we evaluated FRbeta expression and recognition of HSCs by CAR T cells. m909 CAR T cells were not toxic against healthy human CD34(+) HSCs in vitro. Our results indicate that FRbeta is a promising target for CAR T-cell therapy of AML, which may be augmented by combination with ATRA.","['Lynn, Rachel C', 'Poussin, Mathilde', 'Kalota, Anna', 'Feng, Yang', 'Low, Philip S', 'Dimitrov, Dimiter S', 'Powell, Daniel J Jr']","['Lynn RC', 'Poussin M', 'Kalota A', 'Feng Y', 'Low PS', 'Dimitrov DS', 'Powell DJ Jr']","['Ovarian Cancer Research Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Perelman School of Medicine, and.', 'Ovarian Cancer Research Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Perelman School of Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, Abramson Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA;', 'Protein Interactions Section, Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Cancer and Inflammation Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD;', 'Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN; and.', 'Protein Interactions Section, Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, Cancer and Inflammation Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, MD;', 'Ovarian Cancer Research Center, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Perelman School of Medicine, and Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Folate Receptor 2)', '0 (Mutant Chimeric Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Folate Receptor 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/immunology/*pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutant Chimeric Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*metabolism/pathology']",2015/04/19 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/11/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31611-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-11-612721 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 28;125(22):3466-76. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-11-612721.

The extension of ROC-based cut-point finding methods to the case of censored failure time outcome is of interest when we are in the presence of a biomarker, measured at baseline, used to identify whether there will be the development, or not, of some disease condition within a given time point tau of clinical interest. METHODS: Three widely used cut-point finding methods, namely the Youden index, the concordance probability and the point closest to-(0,1) corner in the ROC plane, are extended to the case of censored failure time outcome resorting to non-parametric estimators of the sensitivity and specificity that account for censoring. The performance of these methods in finding the optimal cut-point is compared under Normal and Gamma distributions of the biomarker (in subjects developing or not the disease condition). Normality ensures that estimators point theoretically to the same cut-point. Two motivating examples are provided in the paper. RESULTS: The point closest-to-(0,1) corner approach has the best performance from simulations in terms of mean square error and relative bias. CONCLUSIONS: We discuss the use of the Youden index or concordance probability associated to the cut-point identified through the closest-to-(0,1) corner approach to ease interpretability of the classification performance of the dichotomized biomarker. In addition, the achieved performance of the dichotomized biomarker classification associated to the estimated cut-point can be represented through a confidence interval of the point on the ROC curve.","['Rota, Matteo', 'Antolini, Laura', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Rota M', 'Antolini L', 'Valsecchi MG']","['Department of Health Sciences, Centre of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, University of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy. matteo.rota@unimib.it.', 'Department of Health Sciences, Centre of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, University of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy. laura.antolini@unimib.it.', 'Department of Health Sciences, Centre of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, University of Milan-Bicocca, Monza, Italy. grazia.valsecchi@unimib.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Med Res Methodol,BMC medical research methodology,100968545,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Biomarkers/*analysis', '*Computer Simulation', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/metabolism', 'Prognosis', '*ROC Curve', 'Receptors, Cytokine/analysis']",2015/04/19 06:00,2016/03/15 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12874-015-0009-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12874-015-0009-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Med Res Methodol. 2015 Mar 21;15:24. doi: 10.1186/s12874-015-0009-y.,20150321,PMC4430986,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Especially in complex eukaryotes, data generated by these methods, coupled with other genome-wide datasets, demonstrated that non-random chromatin folding correlates strongly with cellular processes such as gene expression and DNA replication. RESULTS: We describe a genome architecture assay, tethered multiple 3C (TM3C), that maps genome-wide chromatin contacts via a simple protocol of restriction enzyme digestion and religation of fragments upon agarose gel beads followed by paired-end sequencing. In addition to identifying contacts between pairs of loci, TM3C enables identification of contacts among more than two loci simultaneously. We use TM3C to assay the genome architectures of two human cell lines: KBM7, a near-haploid chronic leukemia cell line, and NHEK, a normal diploid human epidermal keratinocyte cell line. We confirm that the contact frequency maps produced by TM3C exhibit features characteristic of existing genome architecture datasets, including the expected scaling of contact probabilities with genomic distance, megabase scale chromosomal compartments and sub-megabase scale topological domains. We also confirm that TM3C captures several known cell type-specific contacts, ploidy shifts and translocations, such as Philadelphia chromosome formation (Ph+) in KBM7. We confirm a subset of the triple contacts involving the IGF2-H19 imprinting control region (ICR) using PCR analysis for KBM7 cells. Our genome-wide analysis of pairwise and triple contacts demonstrates their preference for linking open chromatin regions to each other and for linking regions with higher numbers of DNase hypersensitive sites (DHSs) to each other. For near-haploid KBM7 cells, we infer whole genome 3D models that exhibit clustering of small chromosomes with each other and large chromosomes with each other, consistent with previous studies of the genome architectures of other human cell lines. CONCLUSION: TM3C is a simple protocol for ascertaining genome architecture and can be used to identify simultaneous contacts among three or four loci. Application of TM3C to a near-haploid human cell line revealed large-scale features of chromosomal organization and multi-way chromatin contacts that preferentially link regions of open chromatin.","['Ay, Ferhat', 'Vu, Thanh H', 'Zeitz, Michael J', 'Varoquaux, Nelle', 'Carette, Jan E', 'Vert, Jean-Philippe', 'Hoffman, Andrew R', 'Noble, William S']","['Ay F', 'Vu TH', 'Zeitz MJ', 'Varoquaux N', 'Carette JE', 'Vert JP', 'Hoffman AR', 'Noble WS']","['Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, 98195, WA, USA. ferhatay@uw.edu.', 'Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto, 94304, CA, USA. thanvu@gmail.com.', 'Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto, 94304, CA, USA. mjzeitz@gmail.com.', 'Mines ParisTech, PSL-Research University, CBIO-Centre for Computational Biology, 35 rue St Honore, Fontainebleau, 77300, France. nelle.varoquaux@ensmp.fr.', 'Institut Curie, Paris, F-75248, France. nelle.varoquaux@ensmp.fr.', 'U900, INSERM, ParisF-75248, France. nelle.varoquaux@ensmp.fr.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, 94305, CA, USA. carette@stanford.edu.', 'Mines ParisTech, PSL-Research University, CBIO-Centre for Computational Biology, 35 rue St Honore, Fontainebleau, 77300, France. jean-philippe.vert@mines-paristech.fr.', 'Institut Curie, Paris, F-75248, France. jean-philippe.vert@mines-paristech.fr.', 'U900, INSERM, ParisF-75248, France. jean-philippe.vert@mines-paristech.fr.', 'Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System, Stanford University Medical School, Palo Alto, 94304, CA, USA. arhoffman@stanford.edu.', 'Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, 98195, WA, USA. william-noble@uw.edu.', 'Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Washington, Seattle, 98195, WA, USA. william-noble@uw.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,BMC Genomics,BMC genomics,100965258,['0 (Chromatin)'],IM,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin/*genetics', '*Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Restriction Mapping']",2015/04/19 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12864-015-1236-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12864-015-1236-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Genomics. 2015 Feb 25;16:121. doi: 10.1186/s12864-015-1236-7.,20150225,PMC4369351,,,,,,"['280032/European Research Council/International', 'U41 HG007000/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM09031/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, diverse cancer stem cell signatures are difficult for physicians to interpret and apply clinically. To connect the transcriptome and stem cell biology, with potential clinical applications, we propose a novel computational ""gene-to-function, snapshot-to-dynamics, and biology-to-clinic"" framework to uncover core functional gene-sets signatures. This framework incorporates three function-centric gene-set analysis strategies: a meta-analysis of both microarray and RNA-seq data, novel dynamic network mechanism (DNM) identification, and a personalized prognostic indicator analysis. This work uses complex disease acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as a research platform. RESULTS: We introduced an adjustable ""soft threshold"" to a functional gene-set algorithm and found that two different analysis methods identified distinct gene-set signatures from the same samples. We identified a 30-gene cluster that characterizes leukemic stem cell (LSC)-depleted cells and a 25-gene cluster that characterizes LSC-enriched cells in parallel; both mark favorable-prognosis in AML. Genes within each signature significantly share common biological processes and/or molecular functions (empirical p = 6e-5 and 0.03 respectively). The 25-gene signature reflects the abnormal development of stem cells in AML, such as AURKA over-expression. We subsequently determined that the clinical relevance of both signatures is independent of known clinical risk classifications in 214 patients with cytogenetically normal AML. We successfully validated the prognosis of both signatures in two independent cohorts of 91 and 242 patients respectively (log-rank p < 0.0015 and 0.05; empirical p < 0.015 and 0.08). CONCLUSION: The proposed algorithms and computational framework will harness systems biology research because they efficiently translate gene-sets (rather than single genes) into biological discoveries about AML and other complex diseases.","['Yang, Xinan Holly', 'Li, Meiyi', 'Wang, Bin', 'Zhu, Wanqi', 'Desgardin, Aurelie', 'Onel, Kenan', 'de Jong, Jill', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Chen, Luonan', 'Cunningham, John M']","['Yang XH', 'Li M', 'Wang B', 'Zhu W', 'Desgardin A', 'Onel K', 'de Jong J', 'Chen J', 'Chen L', 'Cunningham JM']","[""Department of Pediatrics, and Comer Children's Hospital, Section of Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, 900 East 57th Street, KCBD Room 5121, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA. xyang2@uchicago.edu."", 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. limeiyi@sibs.ac.cn.', ""Department of Pediatrics, and Comer Children's Hospital, Section of Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, 900 East 57th Street, KCBD Room 5121, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA. bwang@peds.bsd.uchicago.edu."", 'Laboratory Schools, The University of Chicago, Chicago, USA. 1213.ghs@gmail.com.', ""Department of Pediatrics, and Comer Children's Hospital, Section of Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, 900 East 57th Street, KCBD Room 5121, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA. adesgard@bsd.uchicago.edu."", ""Department of Pediatrics, and Comer Children's Hospital, Section of Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, 900 East 57th Street, KCBD Room 5121, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA. konel@peds.bsd.uchicago.edu."", ""Department of Pediatrics, and Comer Children's Hospital, Section of Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, 900 East 57th Street, KCBD Room 5121, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA. jdejong@peds.bsd.uchicago.edu."", 'Department of Medicine, The University of Chicago, Chicago, USA. jchen@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu.', 'Key Laboratory of Systems Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China. lnchen@sibs.ac.cn.', ""Department of Pediatrics, and Comer Children's Hospital, Section of Hematology/Oncology, The University of Chicago, 900 East 57th Street, KCBD Room 5121, Chicago, Illinois, 60637, USA. jmcunningham@uchicago.edu.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,,IM,"['Algorithms', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/mortality', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', '*Transcriptome']",2015/04/19 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-015-0510-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-015-0510-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2015 Mar 24;16:97. doi: 10.1186/s12859-015-0510-7.,20150324,PMC4376348,,,,,,"['UL1 TR000430/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA182528/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA167305-01A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA178454/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA167305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase 1 dose escalation study of danusertib was conducted in patients with accelerated or blastic phase chronic myeloid leukemia or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Two dosing schedules were studied: schedule A, in which danusertib was given by 3-hour intravenous infusion daily for 7 consecutive days (days 1-7) in a 14-day cycle, and schedule B, in which the danusertib was given by 3-hour intravenous infusion daily for 14 consecutive days (days 1-14) in a 21-day cycle. A total of 37 patients were treated, 29 with schedule A and eight with schedule B. The recommended phase 2 dose for schedule A was 180 mg/m(2). Enrollment to schedule B was stopped early because of logistical problems with the frequency of infusions. Febrile neutropenia and mucositis were dose-limiting toxicities in schedule A.

They belong to the rather small family of indigoids, which has nevertheless found an extreme importance in the fields of dyes and medicinal chemistry. Indirubin has been found to be the active ingredient of a traditional Chinese Medicine used to treat the symptoms of leukemia. Further biological explorations revealed the ability of indirubin to bind cyclin-dependent kinases and 6-bromoindirubin, extracted from mollusks, to bind glycogen synthase kinase-3. The high affinity displayed by the two natural products has opened a vast field of research and triggered the development of hundred of derivatives with biological activities. AREAS COVERED: The traditional use of indirubin for the treatment of leukemia has prompted different research groups to study the cytotoxic effect of indirubin derivatives on both solid tumors and leukemia. Moreover, the affinity of indirubins for kinases also allowed the exploration of their activity towards stem cells. EXPERT OPINION: The derivatives presented are in accordance with first discoveries and establish the close relation between activity and kinase inhibition. New derivatives have been patented and new interferences in signaling pathways are described. However, few in vivo studies have been performed and more efficient solutions are needed to unravel the major issue of solubility.","['Gaboriaud-Kolar, Nicolas', 'Vougogiannopoulou, Konstantina', 'Skaltsounis, Alexios-Leandros']","['Gaboriaud-Kolar N', 'Vougogiannopoulou K', 'Skaltsounis AL']","['University of Athens, Department of Pharmacognosy and Natural Products Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy , Panepistimiopolis Zografou, GR-15771, Athens , Greece skaltsounis@pharm.uoa.gr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Ther Pat,Expert opinion on therapeutic patents,9516419,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', 'V86L8P74GI (indirubin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Drug Design', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Medicine, Chinese Traditional', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/pathology', 'Patents as Topic', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Solubility']",2015/04/19 06:00,2015/12/23 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/13543776.2015.1019865 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Pat. 2015 May;25(5):583-93. doi: 10.1517/13543776.2015.1019865.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'derivatives', 'indirubin', 'kinases', 'leukemia', 'patents', 'stem cells']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The murine embryonic stem cell line CGR8 synthesizes and releases substantial amounts of ACh. Particularly during early differentiation - a period associated with multiple alterations in geno-/phenotype functions - synthesis and release of ACh are increased by 10-fold. In murine stem cells second messengers of the STAT-3, PI3K and cAMP/PKA pathways are involved in maintaining self-renewal and pluripotency. The present experiments were designed to test whether blockers of these signaling pathways enhance ACh cell content in the presence of LIF, i.e. when CGR8 is pluripotent. NSC74859, an inhibitor of STAT-3, affected neither the proliferation rate nor ACh cell content, whereas the more sensitive STAT-3 inhibitor FLLL31 reduced the proliferation rate and increased ACh cell content by about 3-fold. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced the proliferation rate but did not modify the ACh cell content, whereas the PKA inhibitor H89 produced effects comparable to FLLL31. Interestingly, in control experiments a strong inverse correlation was found between cell density and ACh cell content, which could explain the 3-fold increase in the ACh cell content observed in the presence of FLLL31 and H89. Forskolin, a PKA activator, had no effect. In conclusion, it appears unlikely that the 10-fold increase in ACh cell content induced by LIF removal, i.e. during early differentiation, is mediated by second messengers of the STAT-3, PI3K and cAMP/PKA pathways. However, the PI3K pathway appears to be involved in control of the inverse relation between cell density and ACh cell content, because this correlation was significantly attenuated in the presence of LY294002.","['Michel-Schmidt, Rosmarie', 'Kirkpatrick, Charles James', 'Wessler, Ignaz']","['Michel-Schmidt R', 'Kirkpatrick CJ', 'Wessler I']","['Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University, D-55101 Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University, D-55101 Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center, Johannes Gutenberg University, D-55101 Mainz, Germany.

Preclinical and clinical data have revealed that inhibiting the activity of prosurvival Bcl-2 proteins with BH3 mimetics (so-called because they mimic BH3-only proteins) is an attractive strategy for CLL therapy. Recent results suggest that the development of BH3 mimetics capable of directly activating the apoptosis effectors Bax and Bak may also be envisaged.","['Besbes, Samaher', 'Mirshahi, Massoud', 'Pocard, Marc', 'Billard, Christian']","['Besbes S', 'Mirshahi M', 'Pocard M', 'Billard C']","['INSERM U965, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France; Universite Paris Diderot-Paris 7, UMR S965, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U965, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France; Universite Paris Diderot-Paris 7, UMR S965, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U965, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France; Universite Paris Diderot-Paris 7, UMR S965, Paris, France.', 'INSERM U965, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France; Universite Paris Diderot-Paris 7, UMR S965, Paris, France.

Since acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by rapidly proliferating tissues that have a high requirement for DNA synthesis, it is possible that the presence of MTHFR polymorphisms could be linked to the multifactorial process of AML development. METHODS: We evaluated the role of MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in a case-control study comprising 98 AML patients and 2016 healthy controls in a Southern Chinese population. We further conducted a sub-study restricted to individuals who neither smoked nor drank alcohol (70 AML patients and 160 healthy controls). MTHFR polymorphisms in the patient and control groups were evaluated by SNaP shot genotype techniques and Illumina BeadChip, respectively. Logistic regression was used to assess the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). RESULTS: The MTHFR 1298AC genotype and the 677CC/1298AC haplotype were significantly associated with a decreased risk of AML compared with the AA genotype and 677CC/1298AA haplotype (OR=0.60, 95% CI: 0.38-0.95, P=0.03; OR=0.49, 95% CI: 0.27-0.90, P=0.02, respectively). In addition, the 677TT genotype was significantly associated with an increased risk of AML compared with the AA genotype only in non-smokers and non-drinkers (OR=4.78; 95% CI=1.38-16.61, P=0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results might suggest that MTHFR polymorphisms are significantly associated with AML risk. In addition, the role of MTHFR genetic susceptibility could be greater among non-smokers and non-drinkers.","['Huang, Lulu', 'Deng, Donghong', 'Peng, Zhigang', 'Ye, Fanghui', 'Xiao, Qiang', 'Zhang, Bing', 'Ye, Bingbing', 'Mo, Zengnan', 'Yang, Xiaobo', 'Liu, Zhenfang']","['Huang L', 'Deng D', 'Peng Z', 'Ye F', 'Xiao Q', 'Zhang B', 'Ye B', 'Mo Z', 'Yang X', 'Liu Z']","['Hematology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Hematology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Hematology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Hematology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Hematology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China; Center for Genomic and Personalized Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Center for Genomic and Personalized Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Center for Genomic and Personalized Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Center for Genomic and Personalized Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China; Institute of Urology and Nephrology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Center for Genomic and Personalized Medicine, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China; Department of Occupational Health and Environmental Health, School of Public Health, Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.', 'Hematology Department, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi, China.

Integrins, a central family of cellular ECM receptors, have been implicated in these processes but their specific role in ES cell self-renewal remains unclear. RESULTS: Here we have studied the effects of different ECM substrates and integrins in mouse ES cells in the absence of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) using short-term assays as well as long-term cultures. Removal of LIF from ES cell culture medium induced morphological differentiation of ES cells into polarized epistem cell-like cells. These cells maintained epithelial morphology and expression of key stemness markers for at least 10 passages in the absence of LIF when cultured on laminin, fibronectin or collagen IV substrates. The specific functional roles of alpha6-, alphaV- and beta1-integrin subunits were dissected using stable lentivirus-mediated RNAi methodology. beta1-integrins were required for ES cell survival in long-term cultures and for the maintenance of stem cell marker expression. Inhibition of alpha6-integrin expression compromised self-renewal on collagen while alphaV-integrins were required for robust ES cell adhesion on laminin. Analysis of the stemness marker expression revealed subtle differences between alpha6- and alphaV-depleted ES cells but the expression of both was required for optimal self-renewal in long-term ES cell cultures. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of LIF, long-term ES cell cultures adapt an epistem cell-like epithelial phenotype and retain the expression of multiple stem cell markers. Long-term maintenance of such self-renewing cultures depends on the expression of beta1-, alpha6- and alphaV-integrins.","['Cattavarayane, Sandhanakrishnan', 'Palovuori, Riitta', 'Tanjore Ramanathan, Jayendrakishore', 'Manninen, Aki']","['Cattavarayane S', 'Palovuori R', 'Tanjore Ramanathan J', 'Manninen A']","['Biocenter Oulu, Oulu Center for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Oulu, Aapistie 5, Oulu, 90220, Finland. sandhanakrishnan.cattavarayane@oulu.fi.', 'Biocenter Oulu, Oulu Center for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Oulu, Aapistie 5, Oulu, 90220, Finland. rpalovuo@gmail.com.', 'Biocenter Oulu, Oulu Center for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Oulu, Aapistie 5, Oulu, 90220, Finland. kishoredrtr@gmail.com.', 'Current address: Universite de Lorraine, CS 25233, Nancy, cedex, 54052, France. kishoredrtr@gmail.com.', 'Biocenter Oulu, Oulu Center for Cell-Matrix Research, Faculty of Biochemistry and Molecular Medicine, University of Oulu, Aapistie 5, Oulu, 90220, Finland. aki.manninen@oulu.fi.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cell Biol,BMC cell biology,100966972,"['0 (Integrin alpha6beta1)', '0 (Integrin alphaV)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Collagen/chemistry', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Integrin alpha6beta1/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Integrin alphaV/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Laminin/chemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/deficiency', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism']",2015/04/19 06:00,2015/11/14 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2014/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12860-015-0051-y [doi]', '10.1186/s12860-015-0051-y [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cell Biol. 2015 Feb 27;16:3. doi: 10.1186/s12860-015-0051-y.,20150227,PMC4348401,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The methylcytosine dioxygenase TET2 is frequently mutated in hematological disorders, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and has been suggested to protect CG dinucleotide (CpG) islands and promoters from aberrant DNA methylation. In this study, we present a novel Tet2-dependent leukemia mouse model that closely recapitulates gene expression profiles and hallmarks of human AML1-ETO-induced AML. Using this model, we show that the primary effect of Tet2 loss in preleukemic hematopoietic cells is progressive and widespread DNA hypermethylation affecting up to 25% of active enhancer elements. In contrast, CpG island and promoter methylation does not change in a Tet2-dependent manner but increases relative to population doublings. We confirmed this specific enhancer hypermethylation phenotype in human AML patients with TET2 mutations. Analysis of immediate gene expression changes reveals rapid deregulation of a large number of genes implicated in tumorigenesis, including many down-regulated tumor suppressor genes. Hence, we propose that TET2 prevents leukemic transformation by protecting enhancers from aberrant DNA methylation and that it is the combined silencing of several tumor suppressor genes in TET2 mutated hematopoietic cells that contributes to increased stem cell proliferation and leukemogenesis.","['Rasmussen, Kasper D', 'Jia, Guangshuai', 'Johansen, Jens V', 'Pedersen, Marianne T', 'Rapin, Nicolas', 'Bagger, Frederik O', 'Porse, Bo T', 'Bernard, Olivier A', 'Christensen, Jesper', 'Helin, Kristian']","['Rasmussen KD', 'Jia G', 'Johansen JV', 'Pedersen MT', 'Rapin N', 'Bagger FO', 'Porse BT', 'Bernard OA', 'Christensen J', 'Helin K']","['Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; The Danish Stem Cell Center (Danstem), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; The Danish Stem Cell Center (Danstem), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; The Danish Stem Cell Center (Danstem), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; The Finsen Laboratory, Rigshospitalet, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'INSERM U985, Institut Gustave Roussy, 94805 Villejuif, France.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; The Danish Stem Cell Center (Danstem), University of Copenhagen, 2200 Copenhagen, Denmark; kristian.helin@bric.ku.dk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Tet2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'DNA Methylation/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dioxygenases', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/*genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2015/04/19 06:00,2015/07/03 06:00,['2015/04/19 06:00'],"['2015/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/03 06:00 [medline]']","['gad.260174.115 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.260174.115 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2015 May 1;29(9):910-22. doi: 10.1101/gad.260174.115.

Notwithstanding, knowledge about the target genes mediating its biological and pathological functions remains limited. We therefore aimed to identify and characterize novel EVI1 target genes in human myeloid cells. METHODS: U937T_EVI1, a human myeloid cell line expressing EVI1 in a tetracycline regulable manner, was subjected to gene expression profiling. qRT-PCR was used to confirm the regulation of membrane-spanning-4-domains subfamily-A member-3 (MS4A3) by EVI1. Reporter constructs containing various parts of the MS4A3 upstream region were employed in luciferase assays, and binding of EVI1 to the MS4A3 promoter was investigated by chromatin immunoprecipitation. U937 derivative cell lines experimentally expressing EVI1 and/or MS4A3 were generated by retroviral transduction, and tested for their tumorigenicity by subcutaneous injection into severe combined immunodeficient mice. RESULTS: Gene expression microarray analysis identified 27 unique genes that were up-regulated, and 29 unique genes that were down-regulated, in response to EVI1 induction in the human myeloid cell line U937T. The most strongly repressed gene was MS4A3, and its down-regulation by EVI1 was confirmed by qRT-PCR in additional, independent experimental model systems. MS4A3 mRNA levels were also negatively correlated with those of EVI1 in several published AML data sets. Reporter gene assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that EVI1 regulated MS4A3 via direct binding to a promoter proximal region. Experimental re-expression of MS4A3 in an EVI1 overexpressing cell line counteracted the tumor promoting effect of EVI1 in a murine xenograft model by increasing the rate of apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal MS4A3 as a novel direct target of EVI1 in human myeloid cells, and show that its repression plays a role in EVI1 mediated tumor aggressiveness.","['Heller, Gerwin',

Psychosocial distress may be minimised by ensuring that patients are sufficiently involved in decision making, provided with tailored information and adequate preparation for potentially threatening procedures. To date, there are no published studies evaluating interventions designed to reduce psychosocial distress and unmet needs specifically in patients with haematological cancers and their Support Persons. This study will examine whether access to a web-based information tool and nurse-delivered telephone support reduces depression, anxiety and unmet information needs for haematological cancer patients and their Support Persons. METHODS/DESIGN: A non-blinded, parallel-group, multi-centre randomised controlled trial will be conducted to compare the effectiveness of a web-based information tool and nurse-delivered telephone support with usual care. Participants will be recruited from the haematology inpatient wards of five hospitals in New South Wales, Australia. Patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, Burkitt's lymphoma, Lymphoblastic lymphoma (B or T cell), or Diffuse Large B-Cell lymphoma and their Support Persons will be eligible to participate. Patients and their Support Persons will be randomised as dyads. Participants allocated to the intervention will receive access to a tailored web-based tool that provides accurate, up-to-date and personalised information about: cancer and its causes; treatment options including treatment procedures information; complementary and alternative medicine; and available support. Patients and Support Persons will complete self-report measures of anxiety, depression and unmet needs at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-recruitment. Patient and Support Person outcomes will be assessed independently. DISCUSSION: This study will assess whether providing information and support using web-based and telephone support address the major psychosocial challenges faced by haematological patients and their Support Persons. The approach, if found to be effective, has potential to improve psychosocial outcomes for haematological and other cancer patients, reduce the complexity and burden of meeting patients' psychosocial needs for health care providers with high potential for translation into clinical practice.

CLL clinical features and genetic abnormalities are well documented, but molecular details are still under investigation. MicroRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in several cellular processes and expressed in a tissue-specific manner. MicroRNAs regulate gene expression, and their deregulation can alter expression levels of genes involved in development/progression of tumors. In CLL, microRNAs can function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors and can also serve as markers for CLL onset/progression.

Recently, oridonin, a natural diterpenoid isolated from Rabdosia rubescens, was demonstrated to regulate RARalpha by increasing its protein level. However, the underlying molecular mechanism for this action has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: In the APL cell line, NB4, the effect of oridonin on RARalpha protein was analyzed by western blot and real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses. Flow cytometry was performed to detect intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The association between nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling and the effect of oridonin was assessed using specific inhibitors, shRNA gene knockdown, and immunofluorescence assays. In addition, primary leukemia cells were treated with oridonin and analyzed by western blot in this study. RESULTS: RARalpha possesses transcriptional activity in the presence of its ligand, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Oridonin remarkably stabilized the RARalpha protein, which retained transcriptional activity. Oridonin also moderately increased intracellular ROS levels, while pretreatment with the ROS scavenger, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), dramatically abrogated RARalpha stabilization by oridonin. More intriguingly, direct exposure to low concentrations of H2O2 also increased RARalpha protein but not mRNA levels, suggesting a role for ROS in oridonin stabilization of RARalpha protein. Further investigations showed that NAC antagonized oridonin-induced activation of NF-kappaB signaling, while the NF-kappaB signaling inhibitor, Bay 11-7082, effectively blocked the oridonin increase in RARalpha protein levels. In line with this, over-expression of IkappaBetaalpha (A32/36), a super-repressor form of IkappaBetaalpha, or NF-kappaB-p65 knockdown inhibited oridonin or H2O2-induced RARalpha stability. Finally, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), a classical activator of NF-kappaB signaling, modulated the stability of RARalpha protein. CONCLUSIONS: Oridonin stabilizes RARalpha protein by increasing cellular ROS levels, which causes activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway.","['Cao, Yang', 'Wei, Wei', 'Zhang, Nan', 'Yu, Qing', 'Xu, Wen-Bin', 'Yu, Wen-Jun', 'Chen, Guo-Qiang', 'Wu, Ying-Li', 'Yan, Hua']","['Cao Y', 'Wei W', 'Zhang N', 'Yu Q', 'Xu WB', 'Yu WJ', 'Chen GQ', 'Wu YL', 'Yan H']","['Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. yang9yue8ri@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. chubbywinnie@163.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. 755641678@qq.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. yq11267@rjh.com.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. francoisxu@hotmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. ywj_office@163.com.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. chengq@shsmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Pathophysiology, Chemical Biology Division of Shanghai Universities E-Institutes, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of National Ministry of Education, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. wuyingli@shsmu.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao-Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. yanhua_candy@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Diterpenes, Kaurane)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0APJ98UCLQ (oridonin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Diterpenes, Kaurane/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Protein Stability/drug effects', 'Protein Transport', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",2015/04/18 06:00,2016/01/07 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-015-1219-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-015-1219-8 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2015 Apr 10;15:248. doi: 10.1186/s12885-015-1219-8.,20150410,PMC4403721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2013, an infant born with HIV infection received anti-retroviral treatment shortly after birth, but was then lost to the health care system for the next six months. When tested for HIV upon return, the child (the 'Mississippi Baby') had no detectable viral load despite cessation of treatment. These remarkable clinical developments have helped reinvigorate the field of 'HIV cure' research. DISCUSSION: Although this research field is largely in a pre-clinical phase, talk about curing HIV has become a regular feature in the global mass media. This paper explores the language of HIV cure from philosophical, ethical and historical perspectives. Examination of currently influential definitions of 'functional' and 'sterilizing' HIV cure reveal that these conceptualizations are more complicated than they seem. Cure is often understood in narrowly biomedical terms in isolation from the social and psychological dimensions of illness. Contemporary notions of HIV cure also inherit some of the epistemic problems traditionally associated with cures for other health conditions, such as cancer. Efforts to gain greater conceptual clarity about cure lead to the normative question of how 'HIV cure research' ought to be talked about. SUMMARY: We argue that attention to basic concepts ethically matter in this context, and identify advantages as well as potential pitfalls of how different HIV/AIDS stakeholders may make use of the concept of cure. While concepts other than cure (such as remission) may be appropriate in clinical contexts, use of the word cure may be justified for other important purposes in the struggle against HIV/AIDS.","['Rennie, Stuart', 'Siedner, Mark', 'Tucker, Joseph D', 'Moodley, Keymanthri']","['Rennie S', 'Siedner M', 'Tucker JD', 'Moodley K']","['Center for Bioethics, Department of Social Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, USA. stuart_rennie@med.unc.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.

The transcription factor megakaryoblastic leukemia-1 (MKL1) mediates myofibroblast differentiation in response to several profibrotic stimuli, but the role it plays in mediating pulmonary fibrosis has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we utilized mice that had a germline deletion of MKL1 (MKL1 (-,-)) to determine the role that MKL1 plays in the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: Bleomycin or normal saline were intratracheally delivered to 9 to 12 week old female MKL1 (+,+) and MKL1 (-,-) mice. Mice were assessed for weight loss and survival to 28 days. Inflammatory responses were assessed through bronchoalveolar lavage at days 3 and 7 post-treatment. The development of pulmonary fibrosis was characterized using hydroxyproline assay and histological staining. MKL1 (+,+) and MKL1 (-,-) mouse lung fibroblasts were isolated to compare morphologic, gene expression and functional differences. RESULTS: MKL1 (-,-) mice demonstrated increased survival, attenuated weight loss, and decreased collagen accumulation compared to wild-type animals 28-days after intratracheal instillation of bleomycin. Histological analysis demonstrated decreased trichrome, smooth muscle alpha-actin, and fibronectin staining in MKL1(-,-) mice compared to MKL1 (+,+) controls. Differential cell counts from bronchoalveolar lavage demonstrated that there was attenuated neutrophilia 3 days after bleomycin administration, but no difference at day 7. Isolated mouse lung fibroblasts from MKL1 (-,-) mice had decreased contractility and deposited less fibronectin matrix compared to wild-type controls, suggesting a defect in key remodeling functions. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data demonstrate that MKL1 plays a significant role in mediating the fibrotic response to bleomycin injury. Loss of MKL1 attenuated early neutrophil influx, as well as myofibroblast-mediated remodeling. Targeting MKL1 activity may therefore be a useful strategy in treating pulmonary fibrosis.","['Bernau, Ksenija', 'Ngam, Caitlyn', 'Torr, Elizabeth E', 'Acton, Benjamin', 'Kach, Jacob', 'Dulin, Nickolai O', 'Sandbo, Nathan']","['Bernau K', 'Ngam C', 'Torr EE', 'Acton B', 'Kach J', 'Dulin NO', 'Sandbo N']","['Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. kbernau@medicine.wisc.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. caitlyn.ngam@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. eetorr@medicine.wisc.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. acton.benjamin@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. jakach@gmail.com.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. ndulin@medicine.bsd.uchicago.edu.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA. nsandbo@medicine.wisc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,Respir Res,Respiratory research,101090633,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Mrtfa protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bleomycin', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/chemistry', 'Cell Shape', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism/pathology', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Genotype', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Inflammation Mediators/metabolism', 'Lung/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neutrophil Infiltration', 'Phenotype', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis/*chemically induced/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/prevention & control', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism']",2015/04/18 06:00,2016/04/08 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2014/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/08 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12931-015-0206-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s12931-015-0206-6 [pii]']",epublish,Respir Res. 2015 Mar 27;16:45. doi: 10.1186/s12931-015-0206-6.,20150327,PMC4392778,,,,,,"['K08 HL093367/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '5K08HL093367/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-five compounds were defined as hits with activity in all leukemia subgroups (<50% cell survival compared with control) at 10 muM drug concentration. Only one of these compounds, quinacrine, showed low activity in normal PBMCs and was therefore selected for further preclinical evaluation. Mining the NCI-60 and the NextBio databases demonstrated leukemia sensitivity and the ability of quinacrine to reverse myeloid leukemia gene expression. Mechanistic exploration was performed using the NextBio bioinformatic software using gene expression analysis of drug exposed acute myeloid leukemia cultures (HL-60) in the database. Analysis of gene enrichment and drug correlations revealed strong connections to ribosomal biogenesis nucleoli and translation initiation. The highest drug-drug correlation was to ellipticine, a known RNA polymerase I inhibitor. These results were validated by additional gene expression analysis performed in-house. Quinacrine induced early inhibition of protein synthesis supporting these predictions. The results suggest that quinacrine have repositioning potential for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia by targeting of ribosomal biogenesis.","['Eriksson, A', 'Osterroos, A', 'Hassan, S', 'Gullbo, J', 'Rickardson, L', 'Jarvius, M', 'Nygren, P', 'Fryknas, M', 'Hoglund, M', 'Larsson, R']","['Eriksson A', 'Osterroos A', 'Hassan S', 'Gullbo J', 'Rickardson L', 'Jarvius M', 'Nygren P', 'Fryknas M', 'Hoglund M', 'Larsson R']","['Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/isolation & purification/therapeutic use', '*Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*drug effects', 'Quinacrine/*isolation & purification/therapeutic use']",2015/04/18 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201531 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2015.31 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2015 Apr 17;5:e307. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2015.31.,20150417,PMC4450329,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With considerable advances in therapy, including the introduction of ATRA initially as a single agent and then in combination with anthracyclines, and more recently by development of arsenic trioxide (ATO)-containing regimens, APL is now characterized by complete remission rates of 90% and cure rates of approximately 80%, even higher among low-risk patients. Furthermore, with ATRA-ATO combinations, chemotherapy may safely be omitted in low-risk patients. The disease is now considered to be the most curable subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in adults. Nevertheless, APL remains associated with a significant incidence of early death related to the characteristic bleeding diathesis. Early death, rather than resistant disease so common in all other subtypes of AML, has emerged as the major cause of treatment failure.","['Coombs, C C', 'Tavakkoli, M', 'Tallman, M S']","['Coombs CC', 'Tavakkoli M', 'Tallman MS']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Leukemia Service, New York, NY, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Leukemia Service, New York, NY, USA.', '1] Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Leukemia Service, New York, NY, USA [2] Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Oxides)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Anthracyclines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology', 'Oxides/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Failure', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2015/04/18 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201525 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2015.25 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2015 Apr 17;5:e304. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2015.25.,20150417,PMC4450325,,,,,,['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the results have been inconclusive. To ascertain the correlation between SLE and malignancy more comprehensively and precisely, we conducted a meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed, the Cochrane Library and Embase databases through June 2014, were searched to identify observational studies evaluating the association between SLE and malignancy. The outcomes from these studies were measured as relative risks (RRs). A random or fixed effects model was chosen to calculate the pooled RR according to heterogeneity test. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed by estimating I2 index. Publication bias was assessed by Egger's test. RESULTS: A total of 16 papers, including 59,662 SLE patients, were suitable for the meta-analysis. Of these papers, 15 reported RRs for overall malignancy, 12 for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and lung cancer, 7 for bladder cancer, 6 for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and leukemia, 5 for skin melanoma, and liver and thyroid cancers, 4 for multiple myeloma (MM), and esophageal and vaginal/vulvar cancers and 3 for laryngeal and non-melanoma skin cancers. The pooled RRs were 1.28 (95% CI, 1.17-1.41) for overall cancer, 5.40 (95% CI, 3.75-7.77) for NHL, 3.26(95% CI, 2.17-4.88) for HL, 2.01(95% CI, 1.61-2.52) for leukemia, 1.45(95% CI, 1.04-2.03) for MM, 4.19(95% CI, 1.98-8.87) for laryngeal cancer, 1.59 (95% CI, 1.44-1.76) for lung cancer, 1.86(95% CI, 1.21-2.88) for esophageal cancer, 3.21(95% CI, 1.70-6.05) for liver cancer, 3.67(95% CI, 2.80-4.81) for vaginal/vulvar cancer, 2.11(95% CI, 1.12-3.99) for bladder cancer, 1.51(95% CI, 1.12-2.03) for non-melanoma skin cancer, 1.78(95% CI, 1.35-2.33) for thyroid cancer, and 0.65(95% CI, 0.50-0.85) for skin melanoma. Only the meta-analyses of overall malignancy, NHL, and liver and bladder cancers produced substantial heterogeneity (I2, 57.6% vs 74.3% vs 67.7% vs 82.3%). No apparent publication bias was detected except for NHL studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support an association between SLE and malignancy, not only demonstrating an increased risk for NHL, HL, leukemia, and some non-hematologic malignancies, including laryngeal, lung, liver, vaginal/vulvar, and thyroid malignancies, but also a reduced risk for skin melanoma. Although an increased risk of MM, and esophageal, bladder and non-melanoma skin cancers was identified from the accumulated data in these studies, this observation requires confirmation.","['Cao, Lihong', 'Tong, Hongyan', 'Xu, Gaixiang', 'Liu, Ping', 'Meng, Haitao', 'Wang, Jinghan', 'Zhao, Xiaoying', 'Tang, Yongmin', 'Jin, Jie']","['Cao L', 'Tong H', 'Xu G', 'Liu P', 'Meng H', 'Wang J', 'Zhao X', 'Tang Y', 'Jin J']","[""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'School of Population Health, the University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia.', ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China; Institute of Hematology, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Databases, Factual', 'Hodgkin Disease/complications', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/complications', 'Lung Neoplasms/complications', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/complications/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/complications', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications', 'Risk', 'Skin Neoplasms/complications', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/complications', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/complications']",2015/04/18 06:00,2016/01/15 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2014/08/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0122964 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-36332 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 17;10(4):e0122964. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0122964. eCollection 2015.,20150417,PMC4401738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STAT5 is a BCR-ABL substrate and persistently activated by tyrosine phosphorylation in CML cells. Activated STAT5 (pSTAT5) drives proliferation and survival of leukemic cells and contributes to initial transformation and maintenance of the disease. In cytokine-induced STAT5 signaling, phosphorylation of STAT5A on Y694 leads to nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor, followed by DNA-binding and gene induction. However, Src-family kinases (SFK) mediate cytoplasmic retention of pSTAT5A leading to attenuated target gene expression and colony formation in CML cells. RESULTS: In this study we show that autophosphorylation of Y416 in the highly conserved activation loop of SFK generates a potent recruitment site for the SH2 domain of STAT5A. Binding of the SH2 domain to the activation loop is required for STAT5A(Y694) phosphorylation by SFK, but at the same time promotes the persistent cytoplasmic localization of the transcription factor as found in BCR-ABL(+) leukemia. As a consequence of the complex formation between tyrosine-phosphorylated SFK and the SH2 domain of STAT5A, the dimerization of STAT5A is impaired. We further demonstrate that constitutively active STAT5A(S710F) escapes from SFK-mediated cytoplasmic retention by enhancing STAT5A dimer stability.

Flow cytometric immunophenotyping is essential for the diagnosis of MPAL and the accurate diagnosis highly depends on the panel of markers used. The precise incidence of MPAL is uncertain as various institutions use different combinations of antibodies to assign the blasts to a particular lineage. AIM: The aim was to study the immunoprofile of acute leukemia including aberrant antigen expressions and to study the incidence, clinical features, laboratory findings, and immunophenotype of MPAL in our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All cases of acute leukemias in which flow cytometric analysis during 1-year period from July 2012 to July 2013 were included in this study. RESULTS: During the study period, flow cytometric analysis of 506 cases was performed. B lymphoblastic leukemia was the most common subtype of acute leukemia. CD13 was the most common aberrant antigen expression in acute lymphoblastic leukemia and CD7 was the most common aberrant antigen expression in acute myeloid leukemia. A diagnosis of MPAL was made in 15 cases, which accounted for 2.96% of all leukemias. 9 cases were diagnosed as T/myeloid, 5 cases as B/myeloid and 1 case as B/T. CONCLUSION: Mixed phenotype acute leukemia is a rare subset of acute leukemia. Flow cytometry is critical in establishing a diagnosis of MPAL. The panel of antibodies used is important in the identification of the ""mixed"" phenotype. Cytoplasmic markers (cytoplasmic MPO, cytoplasmic 79a, cytoplasmic 22 and cytoplasmic CD3) should be included in the primary flow cytometric panel.","['Sukumaran, Renu', 'Nair, Rekha A', 'Jacob, Priya Mary', 'Nair Anila, Kunjulekshmi Amma Raveendran', 'Prem, Shruthy', 'Binitha, Rajeswary', 'Kusumakumary, Parukuttyamma']","['Sukumaran R', 'Nair RA', 'Jacob PM', 'Nair Anila KA', 'Prem S', 'Binitha R', 'Kusumakumary P']","['Division of Pathology, Regional Cancer Centre, Trivandrum, Kerala, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Pathol Microbiol,Indian journal of pathology & microbiology,7605904,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Tertiary Care Centers', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/18 06:00,2016/04/19 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJPatholMicrobiol_2015_58_2_181_155309 [pii]', '10.4103/0377-4929.155309 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Pathol Microbiol. 2015 Apr-Jun;58(2):181-6. doi: 10.4103/0377-4929.155309.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is seen throughout growth, in wound healing, menses, and is important in cancer, where pro- and antiangiogenic signals can be released by cancer cells, endothelial cells, stromal cells, blood, and the extracellular matrix. Aim of the study is to use standardized method for counting blood vessels to verify the significance and prognostic value of assessing marrow angiogenesis at diagnosis of de novo acute leukemia. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included 70 newly diagnosed acute leukemia cases and a control group composed of 35 bone marrow biopsy sections obtained from breast cancer patients. Examination of CD34 immunohistochemically stained sections for the assessment of marrow angiogenesis by quantification of its microvessel density (MVD). RESULTS: MVD was significantly increased in acute leukemia patients in comparison to control group (P-value <0.001). Increased MVD was associated with unfavorable outcome. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated an evidence of increased angiogenesis in acute leukemia detected by high bone marrow MVD which may play a significant role in leukemic process. Understanding its role may help in designing new therapeutic strategies for acute leukemia.","['AbdElAal Asmaa, Ahmed', 'Afify, Reham Abdel Aleem', 'Zaher, Amr ElSayed', 'ElGammal, Mosaad Mahmoud', 'Atef, Asmaa M']","['AbdElAal Asmaa A', 'Afify RA', 'Zaher AE', 'ElGammal MM', 'Atef AM']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/blood supply/drug effects/*pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood supply/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Microvessels/drug effects/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/04/18 06:00,2016/07/13 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000012 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Oct;20(9):504-10. doi: 10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000012.

Localized tumors are easily treated by surgery, but advanced melanomas lack efficient treatment and are associated with very poor outcomes. Thus, understanding the processes underlying melanoma development and progression is critical. The Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFbeta) acts as a potent tumor suppressor in human melanoma, by inhibiting cell growth and preventing cellular migration and invasion. METHODS: In this study, we aimed at elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying TGFbeta-mediated tumor suppression. Human cutaneous melanoma cell lines, derived from different patients, were used to assess for cell cycle analysis, apoptosis/caspase activity and cell migration. Techniques involved immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, real time PCR and luciferase reporter assays. RESULTS: We found the leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to be strongly up-regulated by TGFbeta in melanoma cells, defining LIF as a novel TGFbeta downstream target gene in cutaneous melanoma. Interestingly, we also showed that TGFbeta-mediated LIF expression is required for TGFbeta-induced cell cycle arrest and caspase-mediated apoptosis, as well as for TGFbeta-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Moreover, we found that TGFbeta-mediated LIF expression leads to activation of transcription of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 in a STAT3-dependent manner, and further showed that p21 is required for TGFbeta/LIF-mediated cell cycle arrest and TGFbeta-induced gene activation of several pro-apoptotic genes. CONCLUSIONS: Together, our results define the LIF/p21 signaling cascade as a novel tumor suppressive-like pathway in melanoma, acting downstream of TGFbeta to regulate cell cycle arrest and cell death, further highlight new potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cutaneous melanoma.","['Humbert, Laure', 'Ghozlan, Mostafa', 'Canaff, Lucie', 'Tian, Jun', 'Lebrun, Jean-Jacques']","['Humbert L', 'Ghozlan M', 'Canaff L', 'Tian J', 'Lebrun JJ']","['Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada. laure.humbert@mail.mcgill.ca.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada. mostafa.ghozlan@mail.mcgill.ca.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada. lucie.canaff@gmail.com.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada. jun.tian3@mail.mcgill.ca.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada.

SCNP-evaluable patients from four SWOG AML trials were randomized between Training (N = 74 patients with CR, CRi or RD; BM set = 43; PB set = 57) and Validation Analysis Sets (N = 71; BM set = 42, PB set = 53). Cell survival, differentiation, and apoptosis pathway signaling were used as potential inputs for DXSCNP. Five DXSCNP classifiers were developed on the SWOG Training set and tested for prediction accuracy in an independent BM verification sample set (N = 24) from ECOG AML trials to select the final classifier, which was a significant predictor of CR/CRi (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUROC = 0.76, p = 0.01). The selected classifier was then validated in the SWOG BM Validation Set (AUROC = 0.72, p = 0.02). Importantly, a classifier developed using only clinical and molecular inputs from the same sample set (DXCLINICAL2) lacked prediction accuracy: AUROC = 0.61 (p = 0.18) in the BM Verification Set and 0.53 (p = 0.38) in the BM Validation Set. Notably, the DXSCNP classifier was still significant in predicting response in the BM Validation Analysis Set after controlling for DXCLINICAL2 (p = 0.03), showing that DXSCNP provides information that is independent from that provided by currently used prognostic markers. Taken together, these data show that the proteomic classifier may provide prognostic information relevant to treatment planning beyond genetic mutations and traditional prognostic factors in elderly AML.","['Cesano, Alessandra', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Kopecky, Kenneth J', 'Gayko, Urte', 'Putta, Santosh', 'Louie, Brent', 'Westfall, Matt', 'Purvis, Norman', 'Spellmeyer, David C', 'Marimpietri, Carol', 'Cohen, Aileen C', 'Hackett, James', 'Shi, Jing', 'Walker, Michael G', 'Sun, Zhuoxin', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Cripe, Larry D', 'Atwater, Susan', 'Appelbaum, Frederick R', 'Radich, Jerald P']","['Cesano A', 'Willman CL', 'Kopecky KJ', 'Gayko U', 'Putta S', 'Louie B', 'Westfall M', 'Purvis N', 'Spellmeyer DC', 'Marimpietri C', 'Cohen AC', 'Hackett J', 'Shi J', 'Walker MG', 'Sun Z', 'Paietta E', 'Tallman MS', 'Cripe LD', 'Atwater S', 'Appelbaum FR', 'Radich JP']","['Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'University of New Mexico Cancer Center, Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States of America.', 'SWOG Statistical Center, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'Nodality, Inc., South San Francisco, California, United States of America.', 'ECOG Coordinating Center, Frontier Science, Boston, Massachusetts, United States of America.', 'Montefiore Medical Center North Division, Bronx, New York, United States of America.', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Indiana University Simon Cancer Center, Indianapolis, Indiana, United States of America.', 'Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, United States of America.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Validation Study']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Blood Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Metabolic Networks and Pathways', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Remission Induction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single-Cell Analysis']",2015/04/18 06:00,2016/01/16 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2014/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/16 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0118485 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-16392 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 17;10(4):e0118485. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0118485. eCollection 2015.,20150417,PMC4401549,,,,,,"['CA14958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA014958/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA021115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA196172/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA049883/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA017145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180791/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA17145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA032102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180820/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12213/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA032102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01 CA038926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA020319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA038926/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49883/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['Dryad/10.5061/dryad.94R9S'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, given the large amount of available functional genomic data, it is possible to go beyond this and systematically study regulatory circuits in terms of logic elements. To this end, we present Loregic, a computational method integrating gene expression and regulatory network data, to characterize the cooperativity of regulatory factors. Loregic uses all 16 possible two-input-one-output logic gates (e.g. AND or XOR) to describe triplets of two factors regulating a common target. We attempt to find the gate that best matches each triplet's observed gene expression pattern across many conditions. We make Loregic available as a general-purpose tool (github.com/gersteinlab/loregic). We validate it with known yeast transcription-factor knockout experiments. Next, using human ENCODE ChIP-Seq and TCGA RNA-Seq data, we are able to demonstrate how Loregic characterizes complex circuits involving both proximally and distally regulating transcription factors (TFs) and also miRNAs. Furthermore, we show that MYC, a well-known oncogenic driving TF, can be modeled as acting independently from other TFs (e.g., using OR gates) but antagonistically with repressing miRNAs. Finally, we inter-relate Loregic's gate logic with other aspects of regulation, such as indirect binding via protein-protein interactions, feed-forward loop motifs and global regulatory hierarchy.","['Wang, Daifeng', 'Yan, Koon-Kiu', 'Sisu, Cristina', 'Cheng, Chao', 'Rozowsky, Joel', 'Meyerson, William', 'Gerstein, Mark B']","['Wang D', 'Yan KK', 'Sisu C', 'Cheng C', 'Rozowsky J', 'Meyerson W', 'Gerstein MB']","['Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America; Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.', 'Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America; Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.', 'Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America; Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.', 'Department of Genetics, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire, United States of America.', 'Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America; Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.', 'School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.', 'Program in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America; Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America; Department of Computer Science, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,PLoS Comput Biol,PLoS computational biology,101238922,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Animals', 'Computer Simulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation/genetics', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'Genes, Regulator/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', '*Logistic Models', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', '*Models, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation/*genetics']",2015/04/18 06:00,2016/04/07 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004132 [doi]', 'PCOMPBIOL-D-14-01941 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Comput Biol. 2015 Apr 17;11(4):e1004132. doi: 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004132. eCollection 2015 Apr.,20150417,PMC4401777,,,,,,"['MH103365-01/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HG007000-03/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'HG007355-02/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U41 HG007000/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U41 HG007355/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 MH103365/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy mediated by tumor-homing genetically engineered mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) represents a promising therapeutic modality for elimination of disseminated cells. Efficacy of gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy can be improved by combination of individual systems. We aimed to define the combination effect of two systems of gene therapy mediated by MSC, and evaluate the ability of systemically administered genetically engineered mesenchymal stromal cells to inhibit the growth of experimental metastases derived from human breast adenocarcinoma cells MDA-MB-231/EGFP. METHODS: Human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (AT-MSC) were retrovirally transduced with fusion yeast cytosine deaminase::uracil phosphoribosyltransferase (CD::UPRT) or with Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSVtk). Engineered MSC were cocultured with tumor cells in the presence of prodrugs 5-fluorocytosin (5-FC) and ganciclovir (GCV). Combination effect of these enzyme/prodrug approaches was calculated. SCID/bg mice bearing experimental lung metastases were treated with CD::UPRT-MSC, HSVtk-MSC or both in combination in the presence of respective prodrug(s). Treatment efficiency was evaluated by EGFP-positive cell detection by flow cytometry combined with real-time PCR quantification of human cells in mouse organs. Results were confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical examination. RESULTS: We demonstrated various extent of synergy depending on tested cell line and experimental setup. The strongest synergism was observed on breast cancer-derived cell line MDA-MB-231/EGFP. Systemic administration of CD::UPRT-MSC and HSVtk-MSC in combination with 5-FC and GCV inhibited growth of MDA-MB-231 induced lung metastases. CONCLUSIONS: Combined gene-directed enzyme/prodrug therapy mediated by MSC exerted synergic cytotoxic effect and resulted in high therapeutic efficacy in vivo.","['Matuskova, Miroslava', 'Kozovska, Zuzana', 'Toro, Lenka', 'Durinikova, Erika', 'Tyciakova, Silvia', 'Cierna, Zuzana', 'Bohovic, Roman', 'Kucerova, Lucia']","['Matuskova M', 'Kozovska Z', 'Toro L', 'Durinikova E', 'Tyciakova S', 'Cierna Z', 'Bohovic R', 'Kucerova L']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Research Institute of Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, Bratislava, 833 91, Slovakia. miroslava.matuskova@savba.sk.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Research Institute of Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, Bratislava, 833 91, Slovakia. zuzana.kozovska@savba.sk.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Research Institute of Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, Bratislava, 833 91, Slovakia. lenka.baranovicova@savba.sk.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Research Institute of Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, Bratislava, 833 91, Slovakia. erika.durinikova@savba.sk.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Research Institute of Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, Bratislava, 833 91, Slovakia. silvia.tyciakova@savba.sk.', 'Institute of Pathological Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University, Sasinkova 4, Bratislava, 813 72, Slovakia. ciernaz@gmail.com.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Research Institute of Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, Bratislava, 833 91, Slovakia. roman.bohovic@savba.sk.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Research Institute of Slovak Academy of Sciences, Vlarska 7, Bratislava, 833 91, Slovakia. lucia.kucerova@savba.sk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Ganciclovir/*pharmacology', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*pathology/secondary/therapy', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', '*Transduction, Genetic', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/04/18 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/03/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-015-0149-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-015-0149-2 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2015 Apr 9;34:33. doi: 10.1186/s13046-015-0149-2.,20150409,PMC4431639,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ALL often is refractory to or relapses after treatment; thus, novel targeted therapy for ALL is urgently needed. In the present study, we initially found that the level of SIRT1, a class III histone deacetylase, was higher in primary ALL cells from patients than in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. But it is not clear whether inhibition of SIRT1 by its selective small molecule inhibitor Tenovin-6 is effective against ALL cells. METHODS: We tested the effect of Tenovin-6 on ALL cell lines (REH and NALM-6) and primary cells from 41 children with ALL and 2 adult patients with ALL. The effects of Tenovin-6 on cell viability were determined by MTS assay; colony-forming assays were determined by soft agar in ALL cell lines and methylcellulose medium in normal bone marrow cells and primary ALL blast cells; cell apoptosis and cell cycling were examined by flow cytometry; the signaling pathway was determined by Western blotting; ALL stem/progenitor cells were seperated by using MACS MicroBead kit. RESULTS: The results showed that Tenovin-6 treatment activated p53, potently inhibited the growth of pre-B ALL cells and primary ALL cells, and sensitized ALL cells to frontline chemotherapeutic agents etoposide and cytarabine. Tenovin-6 induced apoptosis in REH and NALM-6 cells and primary ALL cells and diminished expression of Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in such cells. Furthermore, inhibition of SIRT1 by Tenovin-6 inhibited the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and eliminated ALL stem/progenitor (CD133 + CD19-) cells. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that Tenovin-6 may be a promising targeted therapy for ALL and clinical trials are warranted to investigate its efficacy in ALL patients.","['Jin, Yanli', 'Cao, Qi', 'Chen, Chun', 'Du, Xin', 'Jin, Bei', 'Pan, Jingxuan']","['Jin Y', 'Cao Q', 'Chen C', 'Du X', 'Jin B', 'Pan J']","[""Department of Pathophysiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, People's Republic of China. yanlijin2014@163.com."", ""Present address: Institute of Tumor Pharmacology, Jinan University College of Pharmacy, 601 West Huangpu Blvd., Guangzhou, 510632, People's Republic of China. yanlijin2014@163.com."", ""Department of Pathophysiology, Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, 510080, People's Republic of China.

We have recently reported the design of hybrid delivery vectors combining retrovirus-like particles with synthetic polymers or lipids that are efficient, provide sustained gene expression and are more stable compared to native retroviruses. To guide further development of this promising class of gene delivery vectors, we have investigated their mechanisms of intracellular trafficking. Moloney murine leukemia virus-like particles (M-VLPs) were complexed with chitosan (Chi) or liposomes (Lip) comprising DOTAP, DOPE and cholesterol to form the hybrid vectors (Chi/M-VLPs and Lip/M-VLPs, respectively). Transfection efficiency and cellular internalization of the vectors were quantified in the presence of a panel of inhibitors of various endocytic pathways. Intracellular transport and trafficking kinetics of the hybrid vectors were dependent on the synthetic component and used a combination of clathrin- and caveolar-dependent endocytosis and macropinocytosis. Chi/M-VLPs were slower to transfect compared to Lip/M-VLPs due to the delayed detachment of the synthetic component. The synthetic component of hybrid gene delivery vectors plays a significant role in their cellular interactions and processing and is a key parameter for the design of more efficient gene delivery vehicles.","['Keswani, Rahul K', 'Lazebnik, Mihael', 'Pack, Daniel W']","['Keswani RK', 'Lazebnik M', 'Pack DW']","['Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL 61801, USA.', 'Department of Chemical and Materials Engineering, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506, USA; Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506, USA.

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of imatinib interruption and prior hydroxyurea use on the outcome of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2010 and November 2013, patients with chronic phase who received imatinib at the Kasr Al-ainy Center of Clinical Oncology were included. RESULTS: Sixty patients were included in this study, thirty three patients (55%) received imatinib upfront, while 27 (45%) received imatinib post hydroxyurea. Imatinib was not given regularly in 50% of patients. In terms of response, only major molecular response and complete molecular response were statistically significant in favor of patients who were receiving imatinib regularly compared to those who had interruption (p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively) , while there was no difference in patients stratified according to prior hydroxyurea. The median progression free survival was 30.3 months (95% CI 24.3-36.3). Among the group of patients who received imatinib regularly, progression free survival was longer (p=0.049), there was no difference between those who received prior hydroxyurea versus those who did not (p=0.67). CONCLUSION: Duration of prior hydroxyurea had no impact on response or progression free survival, while patients regular on imatinib had statistically significant difference with respect to major molecular response, complete molecular response and progression free survival compared to those who had periods of drug interruption, thus we need more governmental support to supply the drug without interruption to improve the outcome of therapy.","['Edesa, Wael Abdelgawad', 'Abdel-malek, Raafat Ragaey']","['Edesa WA', 'Abdel-malek RR']","['Clinical Oncology Department, Cairo University, Egypt.

Studies in other cancers have demonstrated worse mortality among African American (AA) individuals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 database to identify HCL patients diagnosed between 1978 and 2011. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted to estimate OS. Univariate analysis using the life table method and multivariate Cox regression model were used to determine the independent effect of race on OS. RESULTS: The study population included 78% men and had a median age of 56 years. Race included 93% white, 3.5% Asian/Pacific Islander, and 3.5% AA. The 10-year OS was significantly less for AA as compared with white and Asian/Pacific Islander individuals (54% vs. 72% vs. 75%; P < .001). A Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a significantly worse OS for AA versus other races (P < .001). In a multivariate analysis, AA race remained an independent predictor for a worse OS (hazard ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-2.40; P < .001) after adjusting for age, sex, year of diagnosis, and marital status. CONCLUSION: In this population-based study, only half of AA patients but more than two-thirds of HCL patients from other racial groups were alive at 10 years. Such drastic racial differences in OS of HCL patients at the population level mandates further evaluation of the contributory biological, socioeconomic, health system, and other factors. Understanding and overcoming such racial disparities might close the racial differences in OS of this potentially curable disease.","['Giri, Smith', 'Shrestha, Rajesh', 'Pathak, Ranjan', 'Bhatt, Vijaya Raj']","['Giri S', 'Shrestha R', 'Pathak R', 'Bhatt VR']","['Department of Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN.', 'Department of Medicine, Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island, Brown University, Providence, RI.', 'Department of Medicine, Reading Health System, Reading, PA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE.

We compared outcomes after UCBT and Haplo in adults with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Median follow-up was 24 months. Analysis was performed separately for patients with AML, n=918 (Haplo=360, UCBT=558) and ALL, n=528 (Haplo=158 and UCBT=370). UCBT was associated with delayed engraftment and higher graft failure in both AML and ALL recipients. In multivariate analysis, UCBT was associated with lower incidence of chronic graft-vs-host disease both in the AML group (hazard ratio (HR)=0.63, P=0.008) and in the ALL group (HR=0.58, P=0.01). Not statistically significant differences were observed between Haplo and UCBT for relapse incidence (HR=0.95, P=0.76 for AML and HR=0.82, P=0.31 for ALL), non-relapse mortality (HR=1.16, P=0.47 for AML and HR=1.23, P=0.23 for ALL) and leukemia-free survival (HR 0.78, P=0.78 for AML and HR=1.00, P=0.84 for ALL). There were no statistically differences on main outcomes after unmanipulated Haplo and UCBT, and both approaches are valid for acute leukemia patients lacking a HLA matched donor. Both strategies expand the donor pool for patients in need.","['Ruggeri, A', 'Labopin, M', 'Sanz, G', 'Piemontese, S', 'Arcese, W', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Blaise, D', 'Bosi, A', 'Huang, H', 'Karakasis, D', 'Koc, Y', 'Michallet, M', 'Picardi, A', 'Sanz, J', 'Santarone, S', 'Sengelov, H', 'Sierra, J', 'Vincent, L', 'Volt, F', 'Nagler, A', 'Gluckman, E', 'Ciceri, F', 'Rocha, V', 'Mohty, M']","['Ruggeri A', 'Labopin M', 'Sanz G', 'Piemontese S', 'Arcese W', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Blaise D', 'Bosi A', 'Huang H', 'Karakasis D', 'Koc Y', 'Michallet M', 'Picardi A', 'Sanz J', 'Santarone S', 'Sengelov H', 'Sierra J', 'Vincent L', 'Volt F', 'Nagler A', 'Gluckman E', 'Ciceri F', 'Rocha V', 'Mohty M']","[""Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, Paris, France."", 'INSERM, UMRs 938, Paris, France.', 'Hopital Saint Louis, Eurocord, IUH University Paris VII, Paris, France.', ""Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, Paris, France."", 'Hopital Saint Antoine, Universite Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France.', 'Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Rome Transplant Network, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Ematologia, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Careggi University Hospital, Firenze, Italy.', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, China.', 'Evangelismos Hospital, Division of Hematology, BMT Unit, Athens, Greece.', 'Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Medical Park, Antalya, Turkey.', 'Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.', 'Rome Transplant Network, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Hospital Universitario y Politecnico La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Ospedale Civile, Dipartimento di Ematologia, BMT Unit, Pescara, Italy.', 'Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Hospital Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Jose Carreras Institute, Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, France.', 'Hopital Saint Louis, Eurocord, IUH University Paris VII, Paris, France.', 'Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.', ""ALWP Office Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, Paris, France."", 'Hopital Saint Louis, Eurocord, IUH University Paris VII, Paris, France.', 'Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Monaco, France.', 'Hematology and BMT Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Hopital Saint Louis, Eurocord, IUH University Paris VII, Paris, France.', 'Churchill Hospital, Oxford University, Oxford, UK.', ""Hopital Saint Antoine, Service d'Hematologie et Therapie Cellulaire, AP-HP, Paris, France."", 'INSERM, UMRs 938, Paris, France.', 'Hopital Saint Antoine, Universite Pierre and Marie Curie, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/18 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2014/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/01 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201598 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.98 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Sep;29(9):1891-900. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.98.

Avoiding apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer, and in DLBCL the redundantly functioning antiapoptotic proteins BCL2 and MCL1 are frequently expressed. Here we explore drugs that cause loss of MCL1, particularly the potent new cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor dinaciclib, which knocks down MCL1 by inhibiting CDK9. Dinaciclib induces apoptosis in DLBCL cells but is completely overcome by increased activity of BCL2. We find that clinical samples have frequent co-expression of MCL1 and BCL2, suggesting that therapeutic strategies targeting only one will lead to treatment failures owing to activity of the other. The BH3 mimetic ABT-199 potently and specifically targets BCL2. Single-agent ABT-199 had modest antitumor activity against most DLBCL lines and resulted in compensatory upregulation of MCL1 expression. ABT-199 synergized strongly, however, when combined with dinaciclib and with other drugs affecting MCL1, including standard DLBCL chemotherapy drugs. We show potent antitumor activities of these combinations in xenografts and in a genetically accurate murine model of MYC-BCL2 double-hit lymphoma. In sum, we reveal a rational treatment paradigm to strip DLBCL of its protection from apoptosis and improve outcomes for high-risk patients.","['Li, L', 'Pongtornpipat, P', 'Tiutan, T', 'Kendrick, S L', 'Park, S', 'Persky, D O', 'Rimsza, L M', 'Puvvada, S D', 'Schatz, J H']","['Li L', 'Pongtornpipat P', 'Tiutan T', 'Kendrick SL', 'Park S', 'Persky DO', 'Rimsza LM', 'Puvvada SD', 'Schatz JH']","['Bio5 Institute, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Bio5 Institute, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'College of Medicine, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.', '1] Bio5 Institute, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA [2] Department of Medicine, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA [3] Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '4V8ECV0NBQ (dinaciclib)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', '*Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Indolizines', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/drug therapy/metabolism/mortality/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridinium Compounds/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/04/18 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201599 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.99 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Aug;29(8):1702-12. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.99.

This study describes enrichment strategy and molecular and phenotypic characterization of human cord blood VSELs. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that a majority of VSELs (LIN(-)/CD45(-)/CD34(+)) were present in the red blood cell (RBC) pellet after Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation in contrast to the hematopoietic stem cells (LIN(-)/CD45(+)/CD34(+)) in the interphase layer. Thus, after lyses of RBCs, VSELs were enriched using CD133 and SSEA4 antibodies. These enriched cells were small in size (4-6 mum), spherical, exhibited telomerase activity and expressed pluripotent stem cell (OCT4A, OCT4, SSEA4, NANOG, SOX2, REX1), primordial germ cell (STELLA, FRAGILIS) as well as primitive hematopoietic (CD133, CD34) markers at protein and transcript levels. Heterogeneity was noted among VSELs based on subtle differences in expression of various markers studied. DNA analysis and cell cycle studies revealed that a majority of enriched VSELs were diploid, non-apoptotic and in G0/G1 phase, reflecting their quiescent state. VSELs also survived 5-fluorouracil treatment in vitro and treated cells entered into cell cycle. This study provides further support for the existence of pluripotent, diploid and relatively quiescent VSELs in cord blood and suggests further exploration of the subpopulations among them.","['Shaikh, A', 'Nagvenkar, P', 'Pethe, P', 'Hinduja, I', 'Bhartiya, D']","['Shaikh A', 'Nagvenkar P', 'Pethe P', 'Hinduja I', 'Bhartiya D']","['Stem Cell Biology Department, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Mumbai, India.', 'Stem Cell Biology Department, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Mumbai, India.', 'Stem Cell Biology Department, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Mumbai, India.', 'Jaslok Hospital & Research Centre, Mumbai, India.', 'Stem Cell Biology Department, National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health, Mumbai, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Stage-Specific Embryonic Antigens)', '0 (stage-specific embryonic antigen-4)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Lineage', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Peptides/*metabolism', '*Phenotype', 'Ploidies', 'Stage-Specific Embryonic Antigens/*metabolism']",2015/04/18 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/19 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu2015100 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.100 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Sep;29(9):1909-17. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.100.

To improve the phenotypic definition of familial TGCT (FTGCT), we studied an international cohort of multiple-case TGCT families to determine whether first-degree relatives of FTGCT cases are at increased risk of other types of cancer. We identified 1041 first-degree relatives of TGCT cases in 66 multiple-case TGCT families from Norway and 64 from the United States (combined follow-up of 31,556 person-years). We collected data on all cancers (except nonmelanoma skin cancers) reported by the family informant in these relatives, and we attempted to verify all reported cancer diagnoses through medical or cancer registry records. We calculated observed-to-expected (O/E) standardized incidence ratios, together with 95% confidence intervals (CI), for invasive cancers other than TGCT. We found no increase in risk of cancer overall (Norway O/E = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.6-1.1 and United States O/E = 0.9; 95% CI: 0.7-1.3). Site-specific analyses pooled across the two countries revealed a leukemia excess (O/E = 6.5; 95% CI: 3.0-12.3), deficit of female breast cancer (O/E = 0.0; 95% CI: 0.0-0.6) and increased risk of soft tissue sarcoma (O/E = 7.2; 95% CI: 2.0-18.4); in all instances, these results were based on small case numbers and statistically significant only in Norway. While limited by sample size and potential issues relating to completeness of cancer reporting, this study in multiple-case TGCT families does not support the hypothesis that cancers other than testis cancer contribute to the FTGCT phenotype.","['McMaster, Mary L', 'Heimdal, Ketil R', 'Loud, Jennifer T', 'Bracci, Janet S', 'Rosenberg, Philip S', 'Greene, Mark H']","['McMaster ML', 'Heimdal KR', 'Loud JT', 'Bracci JS', 'Rosenberg PS', 'Greene MH']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-9769.', 'Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, District of Columbia.', 'Section for Clinical Genetics, Department of Medical Genetics, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-9769.', 'Westat, Rockville, Maryland, 20850-3157.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-9769.', 'Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, 20892-9769.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,['Testicular Germ Cell Tumor'],IM,"['*Family', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal/*epidemiology', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'SEER Program', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2015/04/18 06:00,2016/04/07 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/20 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cam4.450 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2015 Jul;4(7):1069-78. doi: 10.1002/cam4.450.

In this study we have deepened the underlying mechanism of action of LUV-TRAIL in hematologic cells. Using histiocytic lymphoma U937 cells, we demonstrated that TRAIL signaling almost exclusively depends on DR5 despite these cells expressing high amounts of DR4, and proved that LUV-TRAIL's higher pro-apoptotic effect relies on its superior ability to induce DR5 clustering on cell surface, therefore enhancing DISC recruitment and triggering caspase activation more efficiently than the soluble form of TRAIL.","['De Miguel, Diego', 'Gallego-Lleyda, Ana', 'Anel, Alberto', 'Martinez-Lostao, Luis']","['De Miguel D', 'Gallego-Lleyda A', 'Anel A', 'Martinez-Lostao L']","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Biologia Molecular y Celular, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.

Inhibition of HSP90 holds promise for targeting multiple molecular abnormalities and is therefore an attractive target for heterogeneous malignancies such as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Ganetespib is a highly potent second generation HSP90 inhibitor which we show is significantly more effective against primary AML blasts at nanomolar concentrations when compared with cytarabine (p<0.001). Dose dependant cytotoxicity was observed with an apoptotic response coordinate with the loss of pro-survival signaling through the client protein AKT. Combination treatment of primary blasts with ganetespib and cytarabine showed good synergistic interaction (combination index (CI): 0.47) across a range of drug effects with associated reduction in HSP70 feedback and AKT signaling levels. In summary, we show ganetespib to have high activity in primary AMLs as a monotherapy and a synergistic relationship with cytarabine when combined. The combination of cytotoxic cell death, suppression of cytoprotective/drug resistance mechanisms such as AKT and reduced clinical toxicity compared to other HSP90 inhibitors provide strong rationale for the clinical assessment of ganetespib in AML.","['Lazenby, M', 'Hills, R', 'Burnett, A K', 'Zabkiewicz, J']","['Lazenby M', 'Hills R', 'Burnett AK', 'Zabkiewicz J']","['Cardiff Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC), Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK.', 'Cardiff Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC), Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK.', 'Cardiff Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC), Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK.', 'Cardiff Experimental Cancer Medicine Centre (ECMC), Department of Haematology, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff CF14 4XN, UK.

The cycloaddition reactions are highly stereo- or regioselective, according with the dipolarophiles nature. The structure of the new compounds was assigned unambiguously, X-ray analysis including. The primary antimycobacterial screening reveals that one of the thirteen tested compounds had a good activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv under aerobic conditions. The antiproliferative evaluation against a NCI 60 human tumor cell line panel, revealed that two indolizine with phenanthroline skeleton exhibit a selective and significant antitumor growth inhibitory activity against Breast Cancer (MCF7 and T-47D) and a slightly moderate activity against some forms of Leukemia, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, Renal Cancer and Breast Cancer (MDA-MB-468).

The pathogenetic role of PHOX2B in neuroblastoma (NB) is supported by mutations in familial, sporadic and syndromic cases of NB and overexpression of PHOX2B and its target ALK in tumor samples and NB cell lines. Starting from these observations, we have performed in vitro drug screening approaches targeting PHOX2B overexpression as a potential pharmacological means in NB. In particular, in order to identify molecules able to decrease PHOX2B expression, we have evaluated the effects of 70 compounds in IMR-32 cell line stably expressing the luciferase gene under the control of the PHOX2B promoter. Curcumin, SAHA and trichostatin A showed to down-regulate the PHOX2B promoter activity which resulted in a decrease of both protein and mRNA expressions. In addition, we have observed that curcumin acts by interfering with PBX-1/MEIS-1, NF-kappaB and AP-1 complexes, in this work demonstrated for the first time to regulate the transcription of the PHOX2B gene. Finally, combined drug treatments showed successful effects in down-regulating the expression of both PHOX2B and its target ALK genes, thus supporting the notion of the effectiveness of molecule combination in tumor therapy.","['Di Zanni, Eleonora', 'Fornasari, Diego', 'Ravazzolo, Roberto', 'Ceccherini, Isabella', 'Bachetti, Tiziana']","['Di Zanni E', 'Fornasari D', 'Ravazzolo R', 'Ceccherini I', 'Bachetti T']","['U.O.C.

Chlorambucil remains the standard of care in many countries. We aimed to investigate whether the addition of ofatumumab to chlorambucil could lead to better clinical outcomes than does treatment with chlorambucil alone, while also being tolerable for patients who have few treatment options. METHODS: We carried out a randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial for treatment-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 109 centres in 16 countries. We included patients who had active disease needing treatment, but in whom fludarabine-based treatment was not possible. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to receive oral chlorambucil (10 mg/m(2)) on days 1-7 of a 28 day treatment course or to receive chlorambucil by this schedule plus intravenous ofatumumab (cycle 1: 300 mg on day 1 and 1000 mg on day 8; subsequent cycles: 1000 mg on day 1) for three to 12 cycles. Assignment was done with a randomisation list that was computer generated at GlaxoSmithKline, and was stratified, in a block size of two, by age, disease stage, and performance status. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population and assessment was done by an independent review committee that was masked to group assignment. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00748189. FINDINGS: We enrolled 447 patients, median age 69 years (range 35-92). Between Dec 22, 2008, and May 26, 2011, we randomly assigned 221 patients to chlorambucil plus ofatumumab and 226 patients to chlorambucil alone. Median progression-free survival was 22.4 months (95% CI 19.0-25.2) in the group assigned to chlorambucil plus ofatumumab compared with 13.1 months (10.6-13.8) in the group assigned to chlorambucil only (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% CI 0.45-0.72; p<0.0001). Grade 3 or greater adverse events were more common in the chlorambucil plus ofatumumab group (109 [50%] patients; vs 98 [43%] given chlorambucil alone), with neutropenia being the most common event (56 [26%] vs 32 [14%]). Grade 3 or greater infections had similar frequency in both groups. Grade 3 or greater infusion-related adverse events were reported in 22 (10%) patients given chlorambucil plus ofatumumab. Five (2%) patients died during treatment in each group. INTERPRETATION: Addition of ofatumumab to chlorambucil led to clinically important improvements with a manageable side-effect profile in treatment-naive patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia who were elderly or had comorbidities.

Our previous study reported that TEMPO (2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl), a low molecular weight free radical, possesses pro-oxidative activity in L5178Y cells. In this study, we investigated and characterized the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in TEMPO-induced toxicity in L5178Y cells. We found that TEMPO induced time- and concentration-dependent intracellular ROS production and glutathione depletion. TEMPO also induced apoptosis as demonstrated by increased caspase-3/7 activity, an increased proportion of annexin V stained cells, and decreased expression of anti-apoptotic proteins including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. N-acetylcysteine, a ROS scavenger, attenuated the ROS production and apoptosis induced by TEMPO. Moreover, Western blot analyses revealed that TEMPO activated gamma-H2A.X, a hallmark of DNA damage, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), a key member in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Addition of SP600125, a JNK-specific inhibitor, blocked TEMPO-mediated JNK phosphorylation and also attenuated TEMPO-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that both ROS production and JNK activation are involved in TEMPO-induced apoptosis, and may contribute to the toxicity of TEMPO in L5178Y cells.","['Guo, Xiaoqing', 'Chen, Si', 'Zhang, Zhuhong', 'Dobrovolsky, Vasily N', 'Dial, Stacey L', 'Guo, Lei', 'Mei, Nan']","['Guo X', 'Chen S', 'Zhang Z', 'Dobrovolsky VN', 'Dial SL', 'Guo L', 'Mei N']","['Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR 72079, United States.', 'Division of Biochemical Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR 72079, United States.', 'Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR 72079, United States; Tianjin Medical University General Hospital, Tianjin 300052, China.', 'Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR 72079, United States.', 'Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR 72079, United States.', 'Division of Biochemical Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR 72079, United States.', 'Division of Genetic and Molecular Toxicology, National Center for Toxicological Research, Jefferson, AR 72079, United States.

Since its launch to the market, imatinib has proven to be very valuable in the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome (BCR/ ABL) - positive (Ph+) chronic myeloid leukemia and Kit (CD117) positive gastrointestinal stromal tumors. The drug is metabolized by cytochrome P450, and there are many clinically important pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions described in the literature. Frequent polypharmacy in oncological patients increases probability of such interactions, and also adherence may play its role during longterm treatment. Fixed dosing therapeutic regimens fail to respect known interindividual variability in pharmacokinetics of the drug and thus, some patients may not achieve sufficient plasma concentrations. Based on current evidence, there seems to be a relationship between plasma concentration and clinical response to imatinib. Therefore, imatinib appears to be suitable candidate for therapeutic drug monitoring. Here, we present an overview of pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions and current knowledge and suggestions on therapeutic drug monitor-ing of imatinib, its potential benefits and limitations.","['Turjap, M', 'Jurica, J', 'Demlova, R']","['Turjap M', 'Jurica J', 'Demlova R']",,['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Czech Republic,Klin Onkol,Klinicka onkologie : casopis Ceske a Slovenske onkologicke spolecnosti,9425213,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Benzamides/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', '*Drug Monitoring', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*blood/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",2015/04/18 06:00,2015/07/01 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['51844 [pii]', '10.14735/amko2015105 [doi]']",ppublish,Klin Onkol. 2015;28(2):105-11. doi: 10.14735/amko2015105.,,,,,,,,,,Mozny klinicky prinos terapeutickeho monitorovani hladin imatinibu v onkologii.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adult patients with refractory AML were enrolled in the study and received fludarabine, cytarabine, and idarubicin (FLAG-IDA) as cytoreductive chemotherapy followed by busulfan and fludarabine (Flu-BU) conditioning regimen and transfusion of mobilized peripheral stem cells from human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling or unrelated donor. The primary endpoint of the study was 2-year leukemia-free survival (LFS) and secondary endpoints included complete-remission rate, 2-year overall survival (OS), nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and relapse rate. A total of 16 patients were enrolled with median age of 36 (16-60), which included 9 primary induction failure, 2 early relapse, and 5 with relapse/refractory disease. The median cycles of previous chemotherapy were 4 (3-10) with a median of 55% (1%-90%) blasts in bone marrow. Six patients received transplantation from matched sibling and 10 from matched unrelated donors. After transplantation, 15 patients achieved bone marrow remission (11 complete remissions [CRs] and 4 bone marrow remissions without platelet recovery) at day +28. A total of 8 patients remained alive in CR with median LFS of 29.5 months (9.5-40.5 months). Four patients relapsed and 3 of them died of disease and another 4 patients died because of transplantation-related toxicity. The 2-year NRM and relapse rates were 25.0% +/- 10.8% and 33.4% +/- 13.8%, respectively with 2-year OS at 53.5% +/- 13.1% and LFS at 50.0% +/- 12.5%. Based on the Simon 2-stage design, 5 out of first eligible 14 patients remained leukemia-free for more than 2 years after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; thus, the null hypothesis of the study will be rejected and the study protocol is accepted as being warranted for further study. Based on the above data, our phase II study demonstrated that the sequential FLAG-IDA cytoreduction chemotherapy followed by Flu-BU conditioning regimen given at the hematological nadir was feasible and has sufficient activity to warrant further investigation prospectively with a larger patient sample (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01496547).","['Tang, Wei', 'Fan, Xing', 'Wang, Ling', 'Hu, Jiong']","['Tang W', 'Fan X', 'Wang L', 'Hu J']","['From the Department of Hematology (WT, XF, LW, JH); and Department of Hematology, Blood & Marrow Transplantation Center, Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China (LW, JH).']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/18 06:00,2015/06/27 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000000706 [doi]', '00005792-201504030-00015 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2015 Apr;94(15):e706. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000000706.,,PMC4602511,,,,,,,,,,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01496547'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine whether sweet potato can alleviate constipation in leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: Leukemia patients receiving their first chemotherapy were randomized to an intervention group (n = 57) or a control group (n = 63). The control and intervention groups were managed by using routine nursing methods and routine methods plus dietary sweet potato consumption (eating sweet potato 200 g/d, from admission to discharge), respectively. Related data regarding patients' defecation were collected on the second and fifth days after chemotherapy initiation, which included rates of constipation, frequency and duration of purgative usage, constipation status assessed by Rome III criteria, and scores on defecation satisfaction. RESULTS: On the second day, the rate of constipation and the rate of having first defecation within 24 hours after chemotherapy initiation were significantly improved in the intervention group, but the difference of the defecation satisfaction and ""almost no loose stools without purgative use"" in Rome III criteria were not significantly changed. On the fifth day, except for ""the sensation of anorectal obstruction"" and ""requirement of manual assistance"" in Rome III criteria, other items regarding defecation were significantly improved. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that sweet potato had a positive impact on the prevention of constipation and the defecation satisfaction in leukemia patients receiving their first chemotherapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: As sweet potato is inexpensive, abundant, tasty, and easy to prepare, it can be widely used in leukemia patients undergoing chemotherapy.","['Zou, Jing-Ying', 'Xu, Yi', 'Wang, Xiao-Hua', 'Jiang, Qing', 'Zhu, Xia-Ming']","['Zou JY', 'Xu Y', 'Wang XH', 'Jiang Q', 'Zhu XM']","['Author Affiliations: Suzhou Health College (Ms Zou); School of Nursing, Soochow University (Ms Xu and Dr Wang); and Departments of Cardiology (Dr Wang and Ms Jiang) and Hematology (Ms Zhu), the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,"['Adult', 'Constipation/*prevention & control', 'Defecation', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Ipomoea batatas', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Satisfaction']",2015/04/18 06:00,2017/06/06 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/06/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/NCC.0000000000000257 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2016 May-Jun;39(3):181-6. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000257.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: The present study was designed to assess and compare the PK parameters, bioavailability, and bioequivalence of the new imatinib 400-mg formulation (test) versus the conventional 100-mg formulation (reference) administered as a single 400-mg dose in healthy adult male volunteers. METHODS: This randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-way crossover study was conducted in healthy Korean male volunteers. Eligible subjects were randomly assigned in a 1 : 1 ratio to receive 400 mg of the test (one 400-mg tablet) or reference (four 100-mg tablets) formulation, followed by a 2-week washout period and administration of the alternate formulation. Serial blood samples were collected at 0 (predose), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after administration. Plasma imatinib concentrations were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The formulations were to be considered bioequivalent if the 90% confidence intervals (CIs) of the adjusted geometric mean ratios for Cmax, AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity) were within the predetermined range of 0.80 - 1.25. RESULTS: In total, 35 subjects completed the study. No serious adverse event was reported during the study. The 90% CIs of the adjusted geometric mean ratios of the test formulation to the reference formulation for C(max), AUC(0-t) and AUC(0-infinity) of imatinib were all within the bioequivalence criteria range of 0.8 - 1.25. CONCLUSIONS: The test formulation of imatinib met the Korean regulatory requirements for bioequivalence. Both imatinib formulations were well-tolerated in all subjects.","['Lee, Hae Won', 'Seong, Sook Jin', 'Park, Sung Min', 'Lee, Joomi', 'Gwon, Mi-Ri', 'Kim, Hyun-Ju', 'Lim, Sung Mook', 'Lim, Mi-Sun', 'Kim, Woomi', 'Yang, Dong Heon', 'Yoon, Young-Ran']","['Lee HW', 'Seong SJ', 'Park SM', 'Lee J', 'Gwon MR', 'Kim HJ', 'Lim SM', 'Lim MS', 'Kim W', 'Yang DH', 'Yoon YR']",,['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther,International journal of clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,9423309,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Tablets)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Area Under Curve', 'Asians', 'Benzamides/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Half-Life', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/blood/*pharmacokinetics', 'Republic of Korea', 'Tablets', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Therapeutic Equivalency', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/18 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/04/18 06:00'],"['2015/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['13237 [pii]', '10.5414/CP202267 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2015 Jun;53(6):480-7. doi: 10.5414/CP202267.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study investigated mRNA and protein expression for LIF, as well as the low-affinity LIF receptor (LIFR) and interleukin-6 signal transducer (IL6ST), in equine endometrium, trophoblast and histotroph during early pregnancy and in the endometrium during the oestrous cycle. Endometrial LIF mRNA expression was upregulated after Day 21 of pregnancy, whereas LIF immunoreactivity increased in the endometrium on Day 28. Expression of LIF mRNA in the yolk sac membrane increased from Day 21 of pregnancy, whereas LIF immunoreactivity increased from Day 28 in the trophoblast. LIFR and IL6ST mRNA was expressed in the endometrium during both the oestrous cycle and early pregnancy and, although LIFR and IL6ST protein were localised to the glandular epithelium during the cycle and first 14 days of pregnancy, from Day 21 they were located in the luminal epithelium. Trophoblast expression of LIFR and IL6ST increased as pregnancy proceeded. In conclusion, LIF expression increased at the conceptus-maternal interface during capsule attenuation. Because contemporaneous upregulation of both LIFR and IL6ST was also observed in the trophoblast, we propose that LIF plays an important role in the development of endometrial receptivity for trophoblast growth, apposition and adhesion in mares.","['de Ruijter-Villani, M', 'Deelen, C', 'Stout, T A E']","['de Ruijter-Villani M', 'Deelen C', 'Stout TA']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Reprod Fertil Dev,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",8907465,,,,2015/04/17 06:00,2015/04/17 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2014/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['RD14334 [pii]', '10.1071/RD14334 [doi]']",aheadofprint,Reprod Fertil Dev. 2015 Apr 17. pii: RD14334. doi: 10.1071/RD14334.,20150417,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, this study aimed to demonstrate the quiescence property and molecular signature of leukemia stem cell and their clinicopathological implications. METHODS: Single cell sorting and culture were performed in the various sets of hematopoietic stem cells including CD34+CD38- acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell population (ASCs) from a total of 60 patients with AML, and 11 healthy controls. Their quiescence related-molecular signatures and clinicopathological parameters were evaluated in AML patients. RESULTS: Single cell plating efficiency of ASCs was significantly lower (8.6%) than those of normal hematopoietic stem cells i.e.: cord blood, 79.0%; peripheral blood, 45.3%; and bone marrow stem cell, 31.1%. Members of the TGFbeta super-family signaling pathway were most significantly decreased; as well as members of the Wnt, Notch, pluripotency maintenance and hedgehog pathways, compared with non ASC populations. mtDNA copy number of ASCs was significantly lower than that of corresponding other cell populations. However, our data couldn't support the prognostic value of the ASCs in AML. CONCLUSIONS: ASCs showed remarkable lower plating efficiency and slower dividing properties at the single cell level. This quiescence is represented as a marked decrease in the mtDNA copy number and also linked with down-regulation of genes in various molecular pathways.","['Won, Eun Jeong', 'Kim, Hye-Ran', 'Park, Ra-Young', 'Choi, Seok-Yong', 'Shin, Jong Hee', 'Suh, Soon-Pal', 'Ryang, Dong-Wook', 'Szardenings, Michael', 'Shin, Myung-Geun']","['Won EJ', 'Kim HR', 'Park RY', 'Choi SY', 'Shin JH', 'Suh SP', 'Ryang DW', 'Szardenings M', 'Shin MG']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chonnam National University Medical School and Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, South Korea. dana_clinic@naver.com.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Dongshin University, Naju, South Korea.

Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is a relatively new swarm intelligence method. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid gene selection method, namely Genetic Bee Colony (GBC) algorithm. The proposed algorithm combines the used of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) along with Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. The goal is to integrate the advantages of both algorithms. The proposed algorithm is applied to a microarray gene expression profile in order to select the most predictive and informative genes for cancer classification. In order to test the accuracy performance of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments were conducted. Three binary microarray datasets are use, which include: colon, leukemia, and lung. In addition, another three multi-class microarray datasets are used, which are: SRBCT, lymphoma, and leukemia. Results of the GBC algorithm are compared with our recently proposed technique: mRMR when combined with the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (mRMR-ABC). We also compared the combination of mRMR with GA (mRMR-GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (mRMR-PSO) algorithms. In addition, we compared the GBC algorithm with other related algorithms that have been recently published in the literature, using all benchmark datasets. The GBC algorithm shows superior performance as it achieved the highest classification accuracy along with the lowest average number of selected genes. This proves that the GBC algorithm is a promising approach for solving the gene selection problem in both binary and multi-class cancer classification.","['Alshamlan, Hala M', 'Badr, Ghada H', 'Alohali, Yousef A']","['Alshamlan HM', 'Badr GH', 'Alohali YA']","['Computer Science Department, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Thus screening for BCR-ABL1 mutations is recommended particularly in patients experiencing poor response to treatment. Herein we describe a novel approach for the detection and surveillance of BCR-ABL1 mutations in CML patients. METHODS: To detect mutations in the BCR-ABL1 transcript we developed an assay based on the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing technology, which allows for single-molecule long-read sequencing of BCR-ABL1 fusion transcript molecules. Samples from six patients with poor response to therapy were analyzed both at diagnosis and follow-up. cDNA was generated from total RNA and a 1,6 kb fragment encompassing the BCR-ABL1 transcript was amplified using long range PCR. To estimate the sensitivity of the assay, a serial dilution experiment was performed. RESULTS: Over 10,000 full-length BCR-ABL1 sequences were obtained for all samples studied. Through the serial dilution analysis, mutations in CML patient samples could be detected down to a level of at least 1%. Notably, the assay was determined to be sufficiently sensitive even in patients harboring a low abundance of BCR-ABL1 levels. The PacBio sequencing successfully identified all mutations seen by standard methods. Importantly, we identified several mutations that escaped detection by the clinical routine analysis. Resistance mutations were found in all but one of the patients. Due to the long reads afforded by PacBio sequencing, compound mutations present in the same molecule were readily distinguished from independent alterations arising in different molecules. Moreover, several transcript isoforms of the BCR-ABL1 transcript were identified in two of the CML patients. Finally, our assay allowed for a quick turn around time allowing samples to be reported upon within 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: In summary the PacBio sequencing assay can be applied to detect BCR-ABL1 resistance mutations in both diagnostic and follow-up CML patient samples using a simple protocol applicable to routine diagnosis. The method besides its sensitivity, gives a complete view of the clonal distribution of mutations, which is of importance when making therapy decisions.","['Cavelier, Lucia', 'Ameur, Adam', 'Haggqvist, Susana', 'Hoijer, Ida', 'Cahill, Nicola', 'Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla', 'Hermanson, Monica']","['Cavelier L', 'Ameur A', 'Haggqvist S', 'Hoijer I', 'Cahill N', 'Olsson-Stromberg U', 'Hermanson M']","['Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. lucia.cavelier@igp.uu.se.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. adam.ameur@igp.uu.se.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. susana.haggqvist@igp.uu.se.', 'Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Science for Life Laboratory, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.

At day 100, patients receiving posaconazole had a significantly lower incidence of total IFD (0.9% vs. 10.8%, P < 0.01), invasive aspergillosis (0% vs. 5.7%, P = 0.02) and invasive candidiasis (0% vs. 4.0%, P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in overall survival, neither at day 100 (87% in the posaconazole group vs. 85% in the fluconazole group) nor at end of follow-up (78% vs. 77%). CONCLUSIONS: Posaconazole prophylaxis decreased the incidence of IFD but did not improve short-term overall survival. Improved treatment efficacy of manifest IFD is likely to explain the lack of survival benefit.","['Dahlen, Torsten', 'Kalin, Mats', 'Cederlund, Kerstin', 'Nordlander, Anna', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Ljungman, Per', 'Blennow, Ola']","['Dahlen T', 'Kalin M', 'Cederlund K', 'Nordlander A', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Ljungman P', 'Blennow O']","['Department of Medicine Solna, Division of Hematology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Solna, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Division of Medical Imaging and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine Solna, Division of Hematology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Unit of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Triazoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/etiology/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use']",2015/04/17 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2015/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12565 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2016 Feb;96(2):175-80. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12565.

Downregulation of miR-223 has been recently reported to have prognostic significance in CLL. However, there is no evidence of the pathogenetic mechanism of this miRNA in CLL patients. METHODS: By applying next-generation sequencing techniques we have detected a common polymorphism (rs2307842), in 24% of CLL patients, which disrupts the binding site for miR-223 in HSP90B1 3'UTR. We investigated whether miR-223 directly targets HSP90B1 through luciferase assays and ectopic expression of miR-223. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot were used to determine HSP90B1 expression in CLL patients. The relationship between rs2307842 status, HSP90B1 expression and clinico-biological data were assessed. RESULTS: HSP90B1 is a direct target for miR-223 by interaction with the putative miR-223 binding site. The analysis in paired samples (CD19+ fraction cell and non-CD19+ fraction cell) showed that the presence of rs2307842 and IGHV unmutated genes determined HSP90B1 overexpression in B lymphocytes from CLL patients. These results were confirmed at the protein level by western blot. Of note, HSP90B1 overexpression was independently predictive of shorter time to the first therapy in CLL patients. By contrast, the presence of rs2307842 was not related to the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: HSP90B1 is a direct target gene of miR-223. Our results provide a plausible explanation of why CLL patients harboring miR-223 downregulation are associated with a poor outcome, pointing out HSP90B1 as a new pathogenic mechanism in CLL and a promising therapeutic target.","['Rodriguez-Vicente, Ana E', 'Quwaider, Dalia', 'Benito, Rocio', 'Misiewicz-Krzeminska, Irena', 'Hernandez-Sanchez, Maria', 'de Coca, Alfonso Garcia', 'Fisac, Rosa', 'Alonso, Jose-Maria', 'Zato, Carolina', 'de Paz, Juan Francisco', 'Garcia, Juan Luis', 'Sarasquete, Ma Eugenia', 'Hernandez, Jose Angel', 'Corchado, Juan M', 'Gonzalez, Marcos', 'Gutierrez, Norma C', 'Hernandez-Rivas, Jesus-Maria']","['Rodriguez-Vicente AE', 'Quwaider D', 'Benito R', 'Misiewicz-Krzeminska I', 'Hernandez-Sanchez M', 'de Coca AG', 'Fisac R', 'Alonso JM', 'Zato C', 'de Paz JF', 'Garcia JL', 'Sarasquete ME', 'Hernandez JA', 'Corchado JM', 'Gonzalez M', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM']","['Servicio de Hematologia, IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain. anaerv@hotmail.com.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain. dalia@usal.es.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain. beniroc@usal.es.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain. irenamk@usal.es.', 'National Medicines Institute, Warsaw, Poland. irenamk@usal.es.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain. mahesa2504@hotmail.com.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Valladolid, Spain. agarciadecoca@aehh.org.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital General de Segovia, Segovia, Spain. rfisac@saludcastillayleon.es.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Rio Carrion, Palencia, Spain. hematologia.hrc@saludcastillayleon.es.', 'Departamento de Informatica y Automatica, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain. carol_zato@usal.es.', 'Departamento de Informatica y Automatica, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain. fcofds@usal.es.', 'Instituto de Estudios de Ciencias de la Salud de Castilla y Leon, (IECSCYL)-HUSAL, Castilla y Leon, Spain. jlgarcia@usal.es.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain. sarasquete@hotmail.com.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain. jahr_jahr2006@yahoo.es.', 'Departamento de Informatica y Automatica, Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain. corchado@usal.es.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain. margondi@usal.es.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain. normagu@usal.es.', 'Servicio de Hematologia, IBSAL, IBMCC, CIC, Universidad de Salamanca, CSIC, Hospital Universitario, Salamanca, Spain. jmhr@usal.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (MIRN223 microRNA, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (endoplasmin)']",IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods']",2015/04/17 06:00,2016/04/29 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2014/09/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-015-1212-2 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-015-1212-2 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2015 Apr 8;15:238. doi: 10.1186/s12885-015-1212-2.,20150408,PMC4404064,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter effect is caused by Navitoclax directly inducing the apoptotic death of platelets, which are dependent on BCL-XL for survival. Recently, ABT-199, a selective BCL-2 antagonist, was developed. It has shown promising anti-leukaemia activity in patients whilst sparing platelets, suggesting that the megakaryocyte lineage does not require BCL-2. In order to elucidate the role of BCL-2 in megakaryocyte and platelet survival, we generated mice with a lineage-specific deletion of Bcl2, alone or in combination with loss of Mcl1 or Bclx. Platelet production and platelet survival were analysed. Additionally, we made use of BH3 mimetics that selectively inhibit BCL-2 or BCL-XL. We show that the deletion of BCL-2, on its own or in concert with MCL-1, does not affect platelet production or platelet lifespan. Thrombocytopaenia in Bclx-deficient mice was not affected by additional genetic loss or pharmacological inhibition of BCL-2. Thus, BCL-2 is dispensable for thrombopoiesis and platelet survival in mice.","['Debrincat, M A', 'Pleines, I', 'Lebois, M', 'Lane, R M', 'Holmes, M L', 'Corbin, J', 'Vandenberg, C J', 'Alexander, W S', 'Ng, A P', 'Strasser, A', 'Bouillet, P', 'Sola-Visner, M', 'Kile, B T', 'Josefsson, E C']","['Debrincat MA', 'Pleines I', 'Lebois M', 'Lane RM', 'Holmes ML', 'Corbin J', 'Vandenberg CJ', 'Alexander WS', 'Ng AP', 'Strasser A', 'Bouillet P', 'Sola-Visner M', 'Kile BT', 'Josefsson EC']","['1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', 'The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Division of Newborn Medicine, Boston, MA, USA."", '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.', '1] The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia [2] Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Bcl2l1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '114100-40-2 (Bcl2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/*cytology/pathology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*deficiency', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/pathology', 'Thrombopoiesis/*physiology', 'bcl-X Protein/deficiency']",2015/04/17 06:00,2016/09/30 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2015/02/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/25 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201597 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.97 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 Apr 16;6:e1721. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2015.97.,20150416,PMC4650559,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, to date, there have been few studies regarding Korean BLV since 1980s. Thus, the purpose of this study is to perform a diagnosis and molecular characterization of BLV strains circulating in Korea and to estimate genetic diversity of different genotypes of BLV. METHOD: To investigate the distribution of BLV variants in the world and assess the evolutionary history of Korean BLV isolates, a comprehensive molecular analysis of the BLV env gp51 gene was conducted using recent worldwide BLV isolates. The isolates included 50 samples obtained from two cattle farms in southeastern Korea in 2014. RESULTS: Sequence and phylogenetic analyses of partial 444-nt fragment sequences and complete gp51 sequences of BLV revealed eight distinct genotypes of BLV showing geographic distribution of the world. Most Korean BLV isolates were found to belong to genotype 1 which is a major genotype prevailed throughout the world, and only four isolates from one farm were classified as genotype 3 related to the US and Japan isolates. Analysis of amino acids of Korean BLV isolates showed several sequence substitutions in the leader peptide, conformational epitope, and neutralizing domain regions. The observations suggest the possibility of affecting on viral infectivity and formation. CONCLUSION: Korean BLV isolates showed the close relationship to genotype 1 and 3. Further study to identify the diversity of BLV circulating in Korea is necessary with samples collected nationwide because this study is the first report of BLV genotype 3 being in circulation in Korea.","['Lee, EunJung', 'Kim, Eun-Ju', 'Joung, Ha-Kyung', 'Kim, Bo-Hye', 'Song, Jae-Young', 'Cho, In-Soo', 'Lee, Kyoung-Ki', 'Shin, Yeun-Kyung']","['Lee E', 'Kim EJ', 'Joung HK', 'Kim BH', 'Song JY', 'Cho IS', 'Lee KK', 'Shin YK']","['Viral Disease Division, Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 175 Anyangro, Anyang, Gyeonggido, 430-757, Republic of Korea. sys305@korea.kr.', 'Viral Disease Division, Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 175 Anyangro, Anyang, Gyeonggido, 430-757, Republic of Korea. happylion00@korea.kr.', 'Viral Disease Division, Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 175 Anyangro, Anyang, Gyeonggido, 430-757, Republic of Korea. immalra@korea.kr.', 'Viral Disease Division, Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 175 Anyangro, Anyang, Gyeonggido, 430-757, Republic of Korea. lordpraiser@korea.kr.', 'Veterinary Drugs and Biologics Division, Anyang, 430-757, Gyeonggido, Republic of Korea. songjysong@korea.kr.', 'Viral Disease Division, Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 175 Anyangro, Anyang, Gyeonggido, 430-757, Republic of Korea. chois38@korea.kr.', 'Animal Disease Diagnostic Division, Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, Anyang, 430-757, Gyeonggido, Republic of Korea. naturelkk@korea.kr.', 'Viral Disease Division, Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency, 175 Anyangro, Anyang, Gyeonggido, 430-757, Republic of Korea. shinyk2009@korea.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Virol J,Virology journal,101231645,['0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)'],IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/diagnosis/*virology', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genotype', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Phylogeny', 'Republic of Korea', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",2015/04/17 06:00,2016/01/23 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2015/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12985-015-0286-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12985-015-0286-4 [pii]']",epublish,Virol J. 2015 Apr 15;12:64. doi: 10.1186/s12985-015-0286-4.,20150415,PMC4405874,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many cases, however, a gene set-based interpretation of genomic data is desired in the absence of a phenotype variable. Although methods exist for unsupervised gene set testing, they predominantly compute enrichment relative to clusters of the genomic variables with performance strongly dependent on the clustering algorithm and number of clusters. RESULTS: We propose a novel method, spectral gene set enrichment (SGSE), for unsupervised competitive testing of the association between gene sets and empirical data sources. SGSE first computes the statistical association between gene sets and principal components (PCs) using our principal component gene set enrichment (PCGSE) method. The overall statistical association between each gene set and the spectral structure of the data is then computed by combining the PC-level p-values using the weighted Z-method with weights set to the PC variance scaled by Tracy-Widom test p-values. Using simulated data, we show that the SGSE algorithm can accurately recover spectral features from noisy data. To illustrate the utility of our method on real data, we demonstrate the superior performance of the SGSE method relative to standard cluster-based techniques for testing the association between MSigDB gene sets and the variance structure of microarray gene expression data. CONCLUSIONS: Unsupervised gene set testing can provide important information about the biological signal held in high-dimensional genomic data sets. Because it uses the association between gene sets and samples PCs to generate a measure of unsupervised enrichment, the SGSE method is independent of cluster or network creation algorithms and, most importantly, is able to utilize the statistical significance of PC eigenvalues to ignore elements of the data most likely to represent noise.","['Frost, H Robert', 'Li, Zhigang', 'Moore, Jason H']","['Frost HR', 'Li Z', 'Moore JH']","['Institute of Quantitative Biomedical Sciences, Geisel School of Medicine, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA. rob.frost@dartmouth.edu.', 'Section of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Department of Community and Family Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA. rob.frost@dartmouth.edu.', 'Department of Genetics, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, 03755, USA. rob.frost@dartmouth.edu.', 'Institute of Quantitative Biomedical Sciences, Geisel School of Medicine, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA. zhigang.li@dartmouth.edu.', 'Section of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Department of Community and Family Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA. zhigang.li@dartmouth.edu.', 'Institute of Quantitative Biomedical Sciences, Geisel School of Medicine, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA. jason.h.moore@dartmouth.edu.', 'Section of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, Department of Community and Family Medicine, Geisel School of Medicine, Lebanon, NH, 03756, USA. jason.h.moore@dartmouth.edu.', 'Department of Genetics, Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH, 03755, USA. jason.h.moore@dartmouth.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,BMC Bioinformatics,BMC bioinformatics,100965194,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Genomics/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/*genetics', 'Microarray Analysis/*methods']",2015/04/17 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2014/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12859-015-0490-7 [doi]', '10.1186/s12859-015-0490-7 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Bioinformatics. 2015 Mar 3;16:70. doi: 10.1186/s12859-015-0490-7.,20150303,PMC4365810,,,,,,"['R01 EY022300/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103534/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103506/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM103506/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA023108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 LM011360/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM103534/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 LM010098/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 LM009012/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, an increased exFeLV transcription has been detected in lymphomas compared to non-malignant tissues. The possible mechanisms of lymphoma development by exFeLV are insertional mutagenesis or persistent stimulation of host immune cells by viral antigens, bringing them at risk for malignant transformation. Vaccination of cats against exFeLV has in recent years decreased the overall infection rate in most countries. Nevertheless, an increasing number of lymphomas have been diagnosed among exFeLV-negative cats. Endogenous feline leukemia virus (enFeLV) is another retrovirus for which transcription has been observed in cat lymphomas. EnFeLV provirus elements are present in the germline of various cat species and share a high sequence similarity with exFeLV but, due to mutations, are incapable of producing infectious viral particles. However, recombination between exFeLV and enFeLV could produce infectious particles. RESULTS: We examined the FeLV expression in cats that have developed malignant lymphomas and discussed the possible mechanisms that could have induced malignant transformation. For expression analysis we used next-generation RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and for validation reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). First, we showed that there was no expression of exFeLV in all samples, which eliminates the possibility of recombination between exFeLV and enFeLV. Next, we analyzed the difference in expression of three enFeLV genes between control and lymphoma samples. Our analysis showed an average of 3.40-fold decreased viral expression for the three genes in lymphoma compared to control samples. The results were confirmed by RT-qPCR. CONCLUSIONS: There is a decreased expression of enFeLV genes in lymphomas versus control samples, which contradicts previous observations for the exFeLV. Our results suggest that a persistent stimulation of host immune cells is not an appropriate mechanism responsible for malignant transformation caused by feline endogenous retroviruses.","['Krunic, Milica', 'Ertl, Reinhard', 'Hagen, Benedikt', 'Sedlazeck, Fritz J', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina', 'von Haeseler, Arndt', 'Klein, Dieter']","['Krunic M', 'Ertl R', 'Hagen B', 'Sedlazeck FJ', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'von Haeseler A', 'Klein D']","['Center for Integrative Bioinformatics Vienna, Max F.

Noticeably, the RIP140 gene has been implicated in the control of energy expenditure, behavior, cognition, mammary gland development and intestinal homeostasis. RIP140 is also involved in the regulation of various oncogenic signaling pathways and participates in the development and progression of solid tumors. During the past years, several papers have reported evidences linking RIP140 to hematologic malignancies. Among them, two recent studies with correlative data suggested that gene expression signatures including RIP140 can predict survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This review aims to summarize the literature dealing with the expression of RIP140 in CLL and to explore the potential impact of this factor on transcription pathways which play key roles in this pathology.","['Lapierre, Marion', 'Castet-Nicolas, Audrey', 'Gitenay, Delphine', 'Jalaguier, Stephan', 'Teyssier, Catherine', 'Bret, Caroline', 'Cartron, Guillaume', 'Moreaux, Jerome', 'Cavailles, Vincent']","['Lapierre M', 'Castet-Nicolas A', 'Gitenay D', 'Jalaguier S', 'Teyssier C', 'Bret C', 'Cartron G', 'Moreaux J', 'Cavailles V']","['IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. marion.lapierre@inserm.fr.', 'INSERM, U1194, Montpellier, F-34298, France. marion.lapierre@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. marion.lapierre@inserm.fr.', 'Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. marion.lapierre@inserm.fr.', 'IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. audrey-castet@chu-montpellier.fr.', 'INSERM, U1194, Montpellier, F-34298, France. audrey-castet@chu-montpellier.fr.', 'Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. audrey-castet@chu-montpellier.fr.', 'Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. audrey-castet@chu-montpellier.fr.', 'Pharmacie, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. audrey-castet@chu-montpellier.fr.', 'IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. delphine.gitenay@inserm.fr.', 'INSERM, U1194, Montpellier, F-34298, France. delphine.gitenay@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. delphine.gitenay@inserm.fr.', 'Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. delphine.gitenay@inserm.fr.', 'IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. stephan.jalaguier@inserm.fr.', 'INSERM, U1194, Montpellier, F-34298, France. stephan.jalaguier@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. stephan.jalaguier@inserm.fr.', 'Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. stephan.jalaguier@inserm.fr.', 'IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. catherine.teyssier@inserm.fr.', 'INSERM, U1194, Montpellier, F-34298, France. catherine.teyssier@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. catherine.teyssier@inserm.fr.', 'Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. catherine.teyssier@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. c-bret@chu-montpellier.fr.', ""Departement d'Hematologie Biologique, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. c-bret@chu-montpellier.fr."", 'Institut de Genetique Humaine, CNRS UPR 1142, Montpellier, F-34298, France. c-bret@chu-montpellier.fr.', 'Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. g-cartron@chu-montpellier.fr.', ""Departement d'Hematologie Clinique, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. g-cartron@chu-montpellier.fr."", 'UMR-CNRS 5235, Montpellier, F-34298, France. g-cartron@chu-montpellier.fr.', 'Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. jerome.moreaux@inserm.fr.', ""Departement d'Hematologie Biologique, CHU Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. jerome.moreaux@inserm.fr."", 'Institut de Genetique Humaine, CNRS UPR 1142, Montpellier, F-34298, France. jerome.moreaux@inserm.fr.', 'IRCM, Institut de Recherche en Cancerologie de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. vincent.cavailles@inserm.fr.', 'INSERM, U1194, Montpellier, F-34298, France. vincent.cavailles@inserm.fr.', 'Universite de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. vincent.cavailles@inserm.fr.', 'Institut regional du Cancer de Montpellier, Montpellier, F-34298, France. vincent.cavailles@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (NRIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Interacting Protein 1)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Receptor Interacting Protein 1']",2015/04/17 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-015-0116-6 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-015-0116-6 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2015 Mar 4;8:20. doi: 10.1186/s13045-015-0116-6.,20150304,PMC4354752,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL is supposedly driven by exogenous and/or endogenous (auto)antigen(s) and there is increasing evidence that CLL cells receive microenvironmental signals which support their growth, survival and expansion in vivo. We have previously shown that powerful signals are received by CLL cells through CD180 orphan toll-like receptor. Additional accessory signals could be generated through FcgammaRII (CD32), since both are expressed on CLL cells as well as on control B cells. Here we studied correlation of the expression of CD32 and CD180 on CLL cells as well as on MEC1 cell line. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from CLL patients and age-matched healthy volunteers were separated, stained with appropriate antibodies to CD19, CD32 and CD180 and analysed by flow cytometry. CD32 and CD180 expression on MEC1 cells was studied at different time-points. The data was statistically analysed using the Mann-Whitney non-parametrical test. Our data indicates that expression of CD32 is significantly increased on CLL cells compared to control B cells as well as in long-term MEC1 cell culture. In contrast, CD180 expression on MEC1 cells significantly decreased throughout 0-96h of MEC1 cell culture. We have recently shown that CD180 ligation can redirect sIgM-mediated signaling from pro-survival to pro-apoptotic. This data indicates that a drop in the expression of CD180 on cycling CLL cells might lead to a weakening of this effect and enhance further survival and expansion of CLL cells in proliferative centres of lymphoid tissues. Since MEC1 cells are derived from a CLL patient with mutated IGVH genes (M-CLL) negative correlation between CD180 and CD32 expression on cycling MEC1 cells could be limited to M-CLL.","['Tsertsvadze, T', 'Mitskevich, N', 'Ghirdaladze, D', 'Porakishvili, N']","['Tsertsvadze T', 'Mitskevich N', 'Ghirdaladze D', 'Porakishvili N']","['1Iv.

One is a reduced susceptibility of hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells to apoptosis, while the other one is an increased activity within the hematopoietic progenitor cell population. The aim of the study was to identify specific features of functional activity, proliferation rates and differentiation potential of CML hematopoietic progenitor cells of patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) by identifying number of Ki-67, Bcl-2 and CD34 positive cells in bone marrow, as well as in vitro colony-forming unit assay in patients with different response to the TKI therapy. Our results indicated that there was a significant decline in proliferation activity of HSCs and HPCs in group of patients with optimal response to the TKI therapy. Correlation analysis, performed on individual basis for patients independently of response to the TKI therapy demonstrated that there was a negative correlation (rho=0.7648) between the number of Ki67+ and CD34+ cells. As to colony to cluster ratio our results showed, that there is a correlation (rho=0.6783) between CCR index and number of bone marrow cells with Philadelphia chromosome. It was indicated, that index of maturation correlates with level of bone marrow cells, containing Philadelphia chromosome, so as with percentage of CD34+, Bcl-2+, Pgp-170+ and Ki67+ cells in bone marrow of CML patients. In summary, obtained results suggest that different mechanisms (bcr-abl dependent and independent) may be involved in CML progression process in the same time.

Thus, successful new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AML should aim at eradicating LSCs. The identification of targets on the cell surface of LSCs is getting more and more attention. Among these, CD123, also known as the interleukin-3 (IL3)-receptor alpha chain, has been identified as a potential immunotherapeutic target due to its overexpression on LSCs in AML as well as on AML blasts, rather than normal hematopoietic stem cells. METHODS: We constructed a CD123-targeted fusion protein antiCD3Fv-IL3, with one binding site for T cell antigen receptor (TCRCD3) and the other for CD123, by recombinant gene-engineering technology. Cysteine residues were introduced into the V domains of the antiCD3Fv segment to enhance its stability by locking the two chains of Fv together with disulfide covalent bonds. The stability and cytotoxicity of the two fusion proteins were detected in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Both fusion proteins were produced and purified from Escherichia coli 16C9 cells with excellent yields in fully active forms. High-binding capability was observed between these two fusion proteins and human IL3R, leading to the specific lysis of CD123-expressing cell lines KG1a; also, mononuclear cells from primary AML patients were inhibited in a colony forming assay in vitro, presumably by redirecting T lymphocytes in vitro. In addition, they displayed an antileukemic activity against KG1a xenografts in non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice, especially disulfide-stabilized (ds)-antiCD3Fv-IL3 for its improved stability. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that both fusion proteins display the antileukemic activity against CD123-expressing cell lines as well as leukemic progenitors in vitro and in vivo, especially ds-antiCD3Fv-IL3. They could be the promising candidates for future immunotherapy of AML.","['Fan, Dongmei', 'Li, Zhenzhen', 'Zhang, Xiaolong', 'Yang, Yuqi', 'Yuan, Xiangfei', 'Zhang, Xiuli', 'Yang, Ming', 'Zhang, Yizhi', 'Xiong, Dongsheng']","['Fan D', 'Li Z', 'Zhang X', 'Yang Y', 'Yuan X', 'Zhang X', 'Yang M', 'Zhang Y', 'Xiong D']","[""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China. fdm19691217@163.com."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China. lizhenvvv@163.com."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China. zhxlongmu@126.com."", ""School of Pharmacy, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin, 300070, People's Republic of China. yangyvjian@gmail.com."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China. xfyuanca@sohu.com."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China. zxlics@yeah.net."", ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China. my1970@sina.com."", 'Central Hospital of Karamay, Karamay, Xinjiang, 834000, China. yz5168813@sohu.com.', ""State Key Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology & Hospital of Blood Diseases, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, 300020, People's Republic of China. dsxiong@ihcams.ac.cn.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (IL3RA protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interleukin-3 Receptor alpha Subunit/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/04/17 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-015-0109-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-015-0109-5 [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2015 Feb 28;8:18. doi: 10.1186/s13045-015-0109-5.,20150228,PMC4389834,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current therapeutics are mostly non-selective and may induce harmful side effects. It has been reported that NOTCH1 activation mutations frequently associate T-LPN. Because anti-Notch1 based therapies such as gamma-secretase inhibitors (GSI) are less efficient and induce considerable side effects, we hypothesized that combining low concentrations of GSI and the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (BTZ) may provide an effective and tolerable approach to treat T-LPN. Hence, we analyzed the in vitro and in vivo effects of GSI-I and BTZ, alone or in combination, against T-LPN. GSI-I and BTZ synergistically decreased cell viability, proliferation, and colony formation, and induced apoptosis in T-LPN cell lines. Furthermore, combining GSI-I and BTZ decreased the viability of primary T-LPN cells from patients. These effects were accompanied by deregulation of Notch1, AKT, ERK, JNK, p38 MAPK, and NF-kappaB survival pathways. Moreover, combination treatment inhibited T-LPN tumor growth in nude mice. In all experiments, combining low concentrations of GSI-I and BTZ was superior to using a single agent. Our data support that a synergistic antitumor activity exists between GSI-I and BTZ, and provide a rationale for successful utilization of dual Notch1 and proteasome inhibition to treat T-LPN.","['Yang, Lujun', 'Zhang, Shuangfeng', 'George, Suraj Konnath', 'Teng, Rong', 'You, Xuefen', 'Xu, Mengqi', 'Liu, Hong', 'Sun, Xiaoping', 'Amin, Hesham M', 'Shi, Wenyu']","['Yang L', 'Zhang S', 'George SK', 'Teng R', 'You X', 'Xu M', 'Liu H', 'Sun X', 'Amin HM', 'Shi W']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of The University of Nantong, Jiangsu 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of The University of Nantong, Jiangsu 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of The University of Nantong, Jiangsu 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of The University of Nantong, Jiangsu 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of The University of Nantong, Jiangsu 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of The University of Nantong, Jiangsu 226001, China.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.', 'The University of Texas Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Houston, Texas, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of The University of Nantong, Jiangsu 226001, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bortezomib/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Oligopeptides/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/*metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2015/04/17 06:00,2016/04/27 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2015/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/27 06:00 [medline]']","['3621 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3621 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Jun 20;6(17):14953-69. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3621.,,PMC4558128,['NOTNLM'],"['Notch1', 'T-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms', 'bortezomib', 'proteasome', 'gamma-secretase inhibitors']",,,,['R01 CA151533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A multicenter study for the evaluation of adherence to oral 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) maintenance chemotherapy for childhood ALL in Egypt to identify contributing factors and possible steps to promote adherence. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 129 children with ALL in complete remission receiving 6-MP single daily oral dose in the evening. Evaluation was done through specific questionnaires for the patients as well as serum 6-MP measurements. RESULTS: Nonadherence was detected in around 56% by questionnaires and around 50% by serum 6-MP level measurement. There was a highly significant correlation between nonadherence as found by the questionnaire and 6-MP level (P - 0.001). Nonadherence was significantly associated with low socioeconomic standard, noneducation and low educational level and large family size by both methods. High cost to come for follow-up visits was significant by questionnaire but not by 6-MP measurement. Adolescent age, the higher number of siblings, lack of written instructions, long time spent per visit, were all associated with higher rates of nonadherence, although none reached statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Nonadherence is a real problem in pediatric patients. Specific questionnaires can be an excellent reliable method for the routine follow-up of these children, and drug level assay can be requested only for confirmation. This protocol is especially effective in developing countries where financial resources may be limited. Every effort should be made to uncover its true incidence, contributing factors, and best methods of intervention.","['Khalek, Elhamy Rifky Abdel', 'Sherif, Laila M', 'Kamal, Naglaa Mohamed', 'Gharib, Amal F', 'Shawky, H M']","['Khalek ER', 'Sherif LM', 'Kamal NM', 'Gharib AF', 'Shawky HM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Egypt/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Remission Induction', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2015/04/17 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2015_11_1_54_147698 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.147698 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2015 Jan-Mar;11(1):54-8. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.147698.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRPs) are members of a superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which can transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there was a correlation between MRP4 and primary ADM resistance in osteosarcoma cells. In this paper, we chose the human osteosarcoma cell line MG63, ADM resistant cell line MG63/DOX, and the patient's primary cell GSF-0686. We checked the ADM sensitivity and cytotoxicity of all the three cells by cell proliferation assay. The intracellular drug concentrations were measured by using LC-MS/MS. We also examined MRP4 gene expression by RT-PCR and Western Blot. We found that the intracellular ADM concentration of the parent osteosarcoma cell line MG63 was higher than the ADM resistant osteosarcoma MG63/DOX cell line or the GSF-0686 cell after ADM treatment (P < 0.05). In addition, MRP4 mRNA and protein levels in ADM resistant osteosarcoma cells were higher than in MG63 cell (P < 0.05). Taking together, this work suggests that overexpression of MRP4 may confer ADM resistance in osteosarcoma cells.","['He, Zhonghui', 'Hu, Beibei', 'Tang, Lina', ""Zheng, Shui'er"", 'Sun, Yuanyu', 'Sheng, Zan', 'Yao, Yang', 'Lin, Feng']","['He Z', 'Hu B', 'Tang L', 'Zheng S', 'Sun Y', 'Sheng Z', 'Yao Y', 'Lin F']","[""Department of Oncology, 6th People's Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200233, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",India,J Cancer Res Ther,Journal of cancer research and therapeutics,101249598,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*genetics', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry']",2015/04/17 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['JCanResTher_2015_11_1_18_143334 [pii]', '10.4103/0973-1482.143334 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cancer Res Ther. 2015 Jan-Mar;11(1):18-23. doi: 10.4103/0973-1482.143334.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, the LIF structure, signaling pathway, and primary roles in the development and function of an organism are reviewed, and the effects of LIF on stem cell growth and differentiation, which are important for its use in cell culturing, are described. The focus is on the roles of LIF in central nervous system development and on the modulation of its physiological functions as well as the involvement of LIF in the pathogenesis of brain diseases and injuries.

Fractionation of these extracts potentiated the anti-TNF-alpha effect, which was shown to concentrate in polar fractions, mainly composed by polyphenols. Significant CCL2 inhibition was elicited by Lippia sidoides and Terminalia glabrescens extracts, whose fractionation resulted in highly active low polar fractions. All assayed extracts showed strong radical scavenging activity, but antioxidant activity did not correlate with inhibition of TNF-alpha or CCL2 production.

But other causes of dysphonia should also not be forgotten, including the possibility of new malignancies, especially due to the fact that these patients have genomic instability that predisposes to appearance of a second or even a third cancer. We present the case of a patient who developed dysphonia during chronic lymphocytic leukemia evolution. Its etiology was a mediastinal compression through lymph nodes, not linked to leukemia, but produced by metastases of a bronchopulmonary cancer, appeared recently. Dysphonia condition due to vocal cord dysfunction must include diseases of the mediastinum, the neck and the brain stem. The rapid and correct diagnosis and the prompt start of an appropriate treatment are of paramount importance for clinician who manage their care and for patient survival.","['Gavrila, Gabriela-Ariadna', 'Mihaila, Romeo-Gabriel', 'Manitiu, Ioan']","['Gavrila GA', 'Mihaila RG', 'Manitiu I']","['Gabriela-Ariadna Gavrila, MD, Emergency County Clinical Hospital Sibiu, Corneliu Coposu Avenue, No 2-4, 550245, Sibiu, Romania.', 'Romeo-Gabriel Mihaila, MD, PhD, ""Lucian Blaga"" University of Sibiu, Faculty of Medicine, Str.

25878120,NLM,MEDLINE,20150825,20210202,1528-0020 (Electronic) 0006-4971 (Linking),125,24,2015 Jun 11,Randomized study of reduced-intensity chemotherapy combined with imatinib in adults with Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,3711-9,10.1182/blood-2015-02-627935 [doi],"In this study, we randomly compared high doses of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib combined with reduced-intensity chemotherapy (arm A) to standard imatinib/hyperCVAD (cyclophosphamide/vincristine/doxorubicin/dexamethasone) therapy (arm B) in 268 adults (median age, 47 years) with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The primary objective was the major molecular response (MMolR) rate after cycle 2, patients being then eligible for allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) if they had a donor, or autologous SCT if in MMolR and no donor. With fewer induction deaths, the complete remission (CR) rate was higher in arm A than in arm B (98% vs 91%; P = .006), whereas the MMolR rate was similar in both arms (66% vs 64%). With a median follow-up of 4.8 years, 5-year event-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated at 37.1% and 45.6%, respectively, without difference between the arms. Allogeneic transplantation was associated with a significant benefit in relapse-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; P = .036) and OS (HR, 0.64; P = .02), with initial white blood cell count being the only factor significantly interacting with this SCT effect. In patients achieving MMolR, outcome was similar after autologous and allogeneic transplantation. This study validates an induction regimen combining reduced-intensity chemotherapy and imatinib in Ph+ ALL adult patients and suggests that SCT in first CR is still a good option for Ph+ ALL adult patients.

In addition, the type II antibody binding characteristics of obinutuzumab to CD20 lead to an efficient induction of direct non-apoptotic cell death. Preclinical data demonstrated more efficient B-cell depletion in whole blood and superior antitumor activity in xenograft models of obinutuzumab as compared to the type I CD20 antibody rituximab. In previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and comorbidities, obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil increased response rates and prolonged progression-free survival compared with rituximab plus chlorambucil. Obinutuzumab had an acceptable and manageable safety profile, with infusion-related reactions during the first infusion as the most common adverse event. Further phase I/II clinical trials have also shown promising activity in other CD20-positive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Therefore, several clinical studies are planned or ongoing to investigate obinutuzumab with different combination partners in both untreated and relapsed/refractory patients with different B-cell NHL entities, which in addition to CLL include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma.

Minimizing or preventing the toxicity of MS drugs represents a major clinical objective. The science of pharmacogenomics is used to identify genetic variants associated with a high or low risk of experiencing a specific adverse drug reaction or therapeutic response. Combined with clinical and demographic factors, pharmacogenomics holds promise to better optimize a drugs' risk/benefit profile. The application of pharmacogenomics for MS therapies is currently focused on finding markers of drug response. This review highlights the potential for pharmacogenomics to assist in predicting and/or preventing some of the more severe adverse reactions associated with MS therapies. We reviewed the literature surrounding seven serious adverse drug reactions associated with MS therapies, to serve as a springboard for future research: interferon-beta associated liver injury; lipoatrophy related to glatiramer acetate; progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy associated with natalizumab, mitoxantrone associated cardiotoxicity and leukemia; and viral infections and cardiac effects associated with fingolimod. Predictive genetic testing for adverse drug reactions in the MS clinic could lead to a better risk profiling of patients before an MS therapy is initiated.","['Kowalec, Kaarina', 'Carleton, Bruce', 'Tremlett, Helen']","['Kowalec K', 'Carleton B', 'Tremlett H']","[""Neuroscience Program, University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, Canada; Child & Family Research Institute, Vancouver, Canada; Pharmaceutical Outcomes Programme, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada."", ""Child & Family Research Institute, Vancouver, Canada; Pharmaceutical Outcomes Programme, BC Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada; Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, UBC, Vancouver, Canada."", 'Neuroscience Program, University of British Columbia (UBC), Vancouver, Canada; Division of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, UBC, Vancouver, Canada.

METHODS: The growth inhibition effects of different concentrations of ITC, ADM or ITC (2, 6, 15 micromol/L) plus ADM (0.30, 0.75 micromol/L) were detected by CCK8 assay in KG1alpha and primary adult acute leukemia cells. Different concentrations of ITC for 7, 14 and 21 days were applied for observing the effect on colony formation. After 48 h treatments with 6 micromol/L ITC, 0.75 micromol/L ADM or ITC (6 micromol/L) plus ADM (0.75 micromol/L), the morphological changes of cells were observed by Wright staining. Flow cytometry was used to detect cell apoptotic rate, mitochondrial membrane potential and cell cycle arrest. And the expression levels of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) signal pathway-related proteins Shh and glima-associated oncogene homdog1 (Gli1) were determined by Western blot. RESULTS: ITC and ADM inhibited the proliferation of KG1alpha and primary adult acute leukemia cells and ITC reduced the colony-formation ability of KG1alpha cells both in dose-dependent manners. Compared with control or single drug group, the changes of cell morphology were more apparent in combined group. Weeb coefficient test revealed a synergistic effect (D </= 70%C) of 0.75 micromol/L ADM plus 6 micromol/L ITC. When KG1alpha cells were treated with 6 micromol/L ITC plus 0.75 micromol/L ADM, the apoptotic rate was 31.72% +/- 1.58%. And it was significantly higher than that in control, ITC and ADM groups (4.17% +/- 0.74%, 4.33% +/- 1.12%, 9.53% +/- 1.15%, P < 0.01). Detection of mitochondrial membrane potential showed that low red-fluorescent cells (P3) of combined group were obviously higher than that in control, ADM and ITC single drug groups (18.80% +/- 0.96% vs 5.00% +/- 0.38%, 9.70% +/- 0.43%, 7.10% +/- 0.77%, P < 0.01) . KG1alpha cells were obviously arrested in G2 phase in combined group and it showed no statistical significance compared with control or single drug group. Western blot showed that the expression levels of Shh and Gli1 decreased with rising concentration of ITC. CONCLUSIONS: ITC plus ADM can obviously inhibit cell proliferation and increase KG1alpha cell apoptotic rate, mitochondrial damage and G2 phase retardation.

However, the effect on hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) complicated by DIC remains unclear. We treated three HPS patients with rTM in addition to chemotherapy for the underlying diseases including nasal NK/T cell lymphoma, angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma and refractory acute myeloid leukemia post cord blood transplantation. Although being refractory to medical management was suspected in our cases, clinical status rapidly came under control including not only amelioration of the blood coagulation disorder but also inflammatory reactions, such as serum ferritin and lactic acid dehydrogenase abnormalities, which represent HPS activity. These observations suggest that rTM might exert marked synergistic effects on HPS with DIC. Given the results obtained in these three cases, administration of rTM appears to offer a promising method of treating HPS complicated by DIC.","['Yamazaki, Hiroyuki', 'Kondo, Tadakazu', 'Tatsumi, Goichi', 'Kotani, Shin-Ichi', 'Arai, Yasuyuki', 'Shirakawa, Kotaro', 'Kitano, Toshiyuki', 'Hishizawa, Masakatsu', 'Kadowaki, Norimitsu', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi']","['Yamazaki H', 'Kondo T', 'Tatsumi G', 'Kotani S', 'Arai Y', 'Shirakawa K', 'Kitano T', 'Hishizawa M', 'Kadowaki N', 'Takaori-Kondo A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (THBD protein, human)', '0 (Thrombomodulin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphohistiocytosis, Hemophagocytic/complications/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Thrombomodulin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/17 06:00,2015/11/10 06:00,['2015/04/17 06:00'],"['2015/04/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.11406/rinketsu.56.312 [doi]'],ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 2015 Mar;56(3):312-6. doi: 10.11406/rinketsu.56.312.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The patient's demographics include age, gender, and race, as well as visual acuity, ophthalmic examination, and surgical intervention were extracted from the medical record. For immunohistochemistry studies, a sample of normal human retina from an enucleated specimen was obtained from the Pathology laboratory. A leukemia inhibitory factor receptor/CD118 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. RESULTS: A 13-year-old Hispanic boy with known history of Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome (confirmed by genetic testing) presented with bilateral rhegmatogenous retinal detachments secondary to bilateral giant retinal tears. He underwent multiple surgical repairs in both eyes, resulting in successful reattachment in the right eye and an intractable closed funnel detachment in the left eye. CONCLUSION: This is the first case of vitreoretinal pathology reported in Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome.

CLINICAL FINDINGS: On physical examination, mild splenomegaly and prominent submandibular and popliteal lymph nodes were detected. Complete blood cell count revealed a high WBC count, characterized by a moderate lymphocytosis with 62% unclassified cells and severe thrombocytopenia with macroplatelets. On cytologic evaluation, the unclassified cells were described as large, neoplastic lymphoid cells containing a large nucleus with lacy chromatin and a large amount of blue vacuolated cytoplasm containing sparse, very fine azurophilic granules. A diagnosis of acute large granular lymphocytic leukemia of splenic origin was made. TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Following induction chemotherapy, the affected dog underwent allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation with dog leukocyte antigen-matched CD34+ cells harvested from a sibling of the same litter. Chimerism analysis revealed full donor engraftment within 2 weeks after transplantation that remained stable for at least 2 years, with the dog remaining apparently healthy at home. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Acute leukemias in dogs are rapidly fatal diseases.

The molecule exhibits good manufacturability and stability properties. AFM11 has 2 binding sites for CD3 and 2 for CD19, an antigen that is expressed from early B cell development through differentiation into plasma cells, and is an attractive alternative to CD20 as a target for the development of therapeutic antibodies to treat B cell malignancies. Comparison of the binding and cytotoxicity of AFM11 with those of a tandem scFv bispecific T cell engager (BiTE) molecule targeting the same antigens revealed that AFM11 elicited more potent in vitro B cell lysis. Though possessing high affinity to CD3, the TandAb mediates serial-killing of CD19(+) cells with little dependence of potency or efficacy upon effector:target ratio, unlike the BiTE. The advantage of the TandAb over the BiTE was most pronounced at lower effector:target ratios. AFM11 mediated strictly target-dependent T cell activation evidenced by CD25 and CD69 induction, proliferation, and cytokine release, notwithstanding bivalent CD3 engagement. In a NOD/scid xenograft model, AFM11 induced dose-dependent growth inhibition of Raji tumors in vivo, and radiolabeled TandAb exhibited excellent localization to tumor but not to normal tissue. After intravenous administration in mice, half-life ranged from 18.4 to 22.9 h. In a human ex vivo B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia study, AFM11 exhibited substantial cytotoxic activity in an autologous setting. Thus, AFM11 may represent a promising therapeutic for treatment of CD19(+) malignancies with an advantageous safety risk profile and anticipated dosing regimen.","['Reusch, Uwe', 'Duell, Johannes', 'Ellwanger, Kristina', 'Herbrecht, Carmen', 'Knackmuss, Stefan Hj', 'Fucek, Ivica', 'Eser, Markus', 'McAleese, Fionnuala', 'Molkenthin, Vera', 'Gall, Fabrice Le', 'Topp, Max', 'Little, Melvyn', 'Zhukovsky, Eugene A']","['Reusch U', 'Duell J', 'Ellwanger K', 'Herbrecht C', 'Knackmuss SH', 'Fucek I', 'Eser M', 'McAleese F', 'Molkenthin V', 'Gall FL', 'Topp M', 'Little M', 'Zhukovsky EA']","['a Affimed Therapeutics AG ; Heidelberg , Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (Single-Chain Antibodies)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/chemistry/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/chemistry/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD19/*immunology', 'CD3 Complex/*immunology', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Cricetulus', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/immunology/pathology', 'Single-Chain Antibodies/chemistry/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/04/16 06:00,2016/03/24 06:00,['2015/04/16 06:00'],"['2015/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/19420862.2015.1029216 [doi]'],ppublish,MAbs. 2015;7(3):584-604. doi: 10.1080/19420862.2015.1029216.,,PMC4622993,['NOTNLM'],"['ALL', 'AUCtot, total area under the curve', 'B-ALL, B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'BBB, blood-brain barrier', 'BiTE, bispecific T cell engager', 'CAR, chimeric antigen receptor', 'CCS, cell culture supernatant', 'CD, cluster of differentiation', 'CD3', 'CDR, complementarity determining region', 'CHO, Chinese hamster ovary', 'CL, clearance', 'CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'CNS, central nervous system', 'Cmax, maximal concentration', 'DMSO, dimethyl sulfoxide', 'E:T, effector:target', 'EC50, half maximal effective concentration', 'ECL, electrochemiluminescence', 'F, fluorescence', 'FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting', 'FCS, fetal calf serum', 'FR, framework region', 'Fab, fragment antigen-binding', 'Fc, fragment crystallizable', 'FcRn, neonatal Fc receptor', 'FcgR, Fc gamma receptor', 'Fv, variable fragment', 'HMF, high molecular weight forms', 'HSA, human serum albumin', 'His, histidine', 'IFN, interferon', 'IL, interleukin', 'IgG, immunoglobulin G', 'KD, dissociation constant', 'LMF, low molecular weight forms', 'MSD, MesoScale Discovery', 'MWCO, molecular weight cut-off', 'NHL, non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'NK, natural killer', 'NOD/scid, nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency', 'Non-Hodgkin lymphoma', 'ORR, overall response rate', 'PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell', 'PBS, phosphate buffered saline', 'PES, polyethersulfone', 'PHA, phytohemagglutinin', 'PI, propidium iodide', 'SABC, standardized antibody binding capacity', 'SD, standard deviation', 'SDS-PAGE, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis', 'SE-HPLC, size exclusion high-pressure liquid chromatography', 'SEC, size exclusion chromatography', 'SPR, surface plasmon resonance', 'T cells', 'TNF, tumor necrosis factor', 'TandAb, tandem diabody', 'VH, variable heavy', 'VL, variable light', 'Vss, volume of distribution at steady state', 'WBA, whole body autoradiography', 'bispecific antibodies', 'ctrl., control', 'i.v., intravenous', 'ka, association rate constant', 'kd, dissociation rate constant', 's.c., subcutaneous', 'scFv, single-chain variable fragment', 't1/2, terminal elimination half-life', 'w/o, without']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fullerenes and their soluble forms, fullerols, are nanocomposites with a closed symmetrical structure with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties. The present study evaluated the effects of treatment with the fullerol (C60(OH)18-20) in the development and pathogenesis of GVHD in a murine model. Mice with experimental GVHD that were treated with the fullerol showed reduced clinical signs of disease and mortality compared with untreated mice. Treatment with the fullerol decreased the hepatic damage associated with reduced hepatic levels of reactive oxygen species, pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IFN-gamma TNF-alpha, CCL2, CCL3 and CCL5) and reduced leukocyte accumulation. The amelioration of GVHD after treatment with the fullerol was also associated with reduced intestinal lesions and consequent bacterial translocation to the blood, liver and peritoneal cavity. Moreover, the fullerol treatment alleviated the GVHD while preserving effects of the graft against a leukemia cell line (GFP+P815). In summary, the fullerol was effective in reducing the GVHD inflammatory response in mice and may suggest novel ways to treat this disease.","['Bernardes, Priscila T T', 'Rezende, Barbara M', 'Resende, Carolina B', 'De Paula, Talles P', 'Reis, Alesandra C', 'Goncalves, William A', 'Vieira, Elias G', 'Pinheiro, Mauricio V B', 'Souza, Danielle G', 'Castor, Marina G M', 'Teixeira, Mauro M', 'Pinho, Vanessa']","['Bernardes PT', 'Rezende BM', 'Resende CB', 'De Paula TP', 'Reis AC', 'Goncalves WA', 'Vieira EG', 'Pinheiro MV', 'Souza DG', 'Castor MG', 'Teixeira MM', 'Pinho V']","['Laboratorio de Resolucao da Resposta Inflamatoria, Departamento de Morfologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Resolucao da Resposta Inflamatoria, Departamento de Morfologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Resolucao da Resposta Inflamatoria, Departamento de Morfologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Interacao Microorganismo e Hospedeiro, Departamento de Microbiologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Resolucao da Resposta Inflamatoria, Departamento de Morfologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Resolucao da Resposta Inflamatoria, Departamento de Morfologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Ressonancia Paramagnetica, Departamento de Fisica Instituto de Ciencias Exatas,Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Ressonancia Paramagnetica, Departamento de Fisica Instituto de Ciencias Exatas,Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Interacao Microorganismo e Hospedeiro, Departamento de Microbiologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Resolucao da Resposta Inflamatoria, Departamento de Morfologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Imunofarmacologia, Departamento de Bioquimica e Imunologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Resolucao da Resposta Inflamatoria, Departamento de Morfologia, Instituto de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fullerenes)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Fullerenes/*chemistry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*therapy', 'Inflammation', 'Liver/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Nanocomposites/*chemistry', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2015/04/16 06:00,2016/01/29 06:00,['2015/04/16 06:00'],"['2014/06/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/29 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0123004 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-21342 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 13;10(4):e0123004. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0123004. eCollection 2015.,20150413,PMC4395348,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They most commonly show rhabdomyosarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, enteric adenocarcinoma, and leukemia transformation. In teratomas showing malignant transformation, the clinical course is aggressive; and survival of patients with metastatic disease is very low. The primary treatment of teratomas with malignant transformations is surgical.

CK2 overexpression has been demonstrated in hematological malignancies, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and multiple myeloma. CX-4945, also known as Silmitasertib, is an orally administered, highly specific, ATP-competitive inhibitor of CK2. CX-4945 induces cytotoxicity and apoptosis and is currently being evaluated in clinical trials for treatment of many cancer types. In the past 2 years, the focus on the therapeutic potential of CX-4945 has shifted from solid tumors to hematological malignancies. CX-4945 exerts anti-proliferative effects in hematological tumors by downregulating CK2 expression and suppressing activation of CK2-mediated PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. Furthermore, combination of CX-4945 with other inhibitors yielded synergistic effects in cell death induction. These new findings demonstrate that CK2 overexpression contributes to blood cancer cell survival and resistance to chemotherapy.

This translocation results in an abnormal fusion called BCR-ABL oncogene which encodes a chimeric BCR-ABL protein. This protein is the underlying cause of CML. Nilotinib is a newly licensed drug for CML in adults. Structurally, it is similar to imatinib (the older tyrosine kinase inhibitor), but it is much more potent in inhibiting BCR-ABL due to its much increased affinity for its binding site. Specific guidelines for CML treatment in children have yet to be determined. In our patient, nilotinib was used as an off-label drug because it is not licensed for children. According to the pharmacokinetic response to drugs, children cannot be considered small adults irrespective of their weight. Off-label drug use based on evidence that it is the best treatment available is an important tool in the hands of expert treating physicians.","['Al-Jafar, Hassan A', 'Al-Mulla, Ali', 'AlDallal, Salma', 'Buhamad, Jaber H', 'Askar, Haifa']","['Al-Jafar HA', 'Al-Mulla A', 'AlDallal S', 'Buhamad JH', 'Askar H']","['Amiri Hospital, Kuwait City, Shuwaikh, Kuwait.', 'Leukemia Center, Sabah Hospital, Shuwaikh, Kuwait.', 'Amiri Hospital, Kuwait City, Shuwaikh, Kuwait.', 'Shuwaikh Residential Center, Kuwait City, Kuwait.', 'Amiri Hospital, Kuwait City, Shuwaikh, Kuwait.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Switzerland,Case Rep Oncol,Case reports in oncology,101517601,,,,2015/04/16 06:00,2015/04/16 06:01,['2015/04/16 06:00'],"['2015/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1159/000380905 [doi]', 'cro-0008-0122 [pii]']",epublish,Case Rep Oncol. 2015 Mar 3;8(1):122-7. doi: 10.1159/000380905. eCollection 2015 Jan-Apr.,20150303,PMC4376925,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Nilotinib', 'Off-label drug use', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we evaluate BI-847325, an ATP-competitive inhibitor of MEK and Aurora kinases, in treatment-naive and drug-resistant BRAF-mutant melanoma models. BI-847325 potently inhibited growth and survival of melanoma cell lines that were both BRAF inhibitor naive and resistant in 2D culture, 3D cell culture conditions, and in colony formation assays. Western blot studies showed BI-847325 to reduce expression of phospho-ERK and phospho-histone 3 in multiple models of vemurafenib resistance. Mechanistically, BI-847325 decreased the expression of MEK and Mcl-1 while increasing the expression of the proapoptotic protein BIM. Strong suppression of MEK expression was observed after 48 hours of treatment, with no recovery following >72 hours of washout. siRNA-mediated knockdown of Mcl-1 enhanced the effects of BI-847325, whereas Mcl-1 overexpression reversed this in both 2D cell culture and 3D spheroid melanoma models. In vivo, once weekly BI-847325 (70 mg/kg) led to durable regression of BRAF-inhibitor naive xenografts with no regrowth seen (>65 days of treatment). In contrast, treatment with the vemurafenib analog PLX4720 was associated with tumor relapse at >30 days. BI-847325 also suppressed the long-term growth of xenografts with acquired PLX4720 resistance. Analysis of tumor samples revealed BI-847325 to induce apoptosis associated with suppression of phospho-ERK, total MEK, phospho-Histone3, and Mcl-1 expression. Our studies indicate that BI-847325 is effective in overcoming BRAF inhibitor resistance and has long-term inhibitory effects upon BRAF-mutant melanoma in vivo, through a mechanism associated with the decreased expression of both MEK and Mcl-1.","['Phadke, Manali S', 'Sini, Patrizia', 'Smalley, Keiran S M']","['Phadke MS', 'Sini P', 'Smalley KS']","['Department of Tumor Biology, The Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.', 'Boehringer Ingelheim RCV GmbH & Co KG, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Tumor Biology, The Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, Florida.

Four genetic loci, tva, tvb, tvc and tvj, encode for corresponding receptors that determine the susceptibility to the ASLV subgroups. The prevalence of ASLV in hosts may have imposed strong selection pressure toward resistance to ASLV infection, and the resistant alleles in all four receptor genes have been identified. In this study, two new alleles of the tva receptor gene, tva(r5) and tva(r6), with similar intronic deletions were identified in Chinese commercial broilers. These natural mutations delete the deduced branch point signal within the first intron, disrupting mRNA splicing of the tva receptor gene and leading to the retention of intron 1 and introduction of premature TGA stop codons in both the longer and shorter tva isoforms. As a result, decreased susceptibility to subgroup A ASLV in vitro and in vivo was observed in the subsequent analysis. In addition, we identified two groups of heterozygous allele pairs which exhibited quantitative differences in host susceptibility to ASLV-A. This study demonstrated that defective splicing of the tva receptor gene can confer genetic resistance to ASLV subgroup A in the host.","['Chen, Weiguo', 'Liu, Yang', 'Li, Hongxing', 'Chang, Shuang', 'Shu, Dingming', 'Zhang, Huanmin', 'Chen, Feng', 'Xie, Qingmei']","['Chen W', 'Liu Y', 'Li H', 'Chang S', 'Shu D', 'Zhang H', 'Chen F', 'Xie Q']","['College of Animal Science, South China Agricultural University &Guangdong Provincial Key Lab of Agro-Animal Genomics and Molecular Breeding, Guangzhou, 510642, P.

To further investigate the role of Fbxl10 in leukemogenesis, we generated transgenic (Tg) mice that overexpress Fbxl10 in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Interestingly, Fbxl10 Tg mice developed myeloid or B-lymphoid leukemia with complete penetrance. HSCs from the Tg mice exhibited an accelerated G0/G1-to-S transition with a normal G0 to G1 entry, resulting in pleiotropic progenitor cell expansion. Fbxl10 Tg HSCs displayed enhanced expression of neuron-specific gene family member 2 (Nsg2), and forced expression of Nsg2 in primary bone marrow cells resulted in expansion of immature cells. In addition, the genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation were markedly enriched in Fbxl10 Tg HSCs, coupled with increased cellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate levels. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing analysis demonstrated that Fbxl10 directly binds to the regulatory regions of Nsg2 and oxidative phosphorylation genes. These findings define Fbxl10 as a bona fide oncogene, whose deregulated expression contributes to the development of leukemia involving metabolic proliferative advantage and Nsg2-mediated impaired differentiation.","['Ueda, Takeshi', 'Nagamachi, Akiko', 'Takubo, Keiyo', 'Yamasaki, Norimasa', 'Matsui, Hirotaka', 'Kanai, Akinori', 'Nakata, Yuichiro', 'Ikeda, Kenichiro', 'Konuma, Takaaki', 'Oda, Hideaki', 'Wolff, Linda', 'Honda, Zen-ichiro', 'Wu, Xudong', 'Helin, Kristian', 'Iwama, Atsushi', 'Suda, Toshio', 'Inaba, Toshiya', 'Honda, Hiroaki']","['Ueda T', 'Nagamachi A', 'Takubo K', 'Yamasaki N', 'Matsui H', 'Kanai A', 'Nakata Y', 'Ikeda K', 'Konuma T', 'Oda H', 'Wolff L', 'Honda Z', 'Wu X', 'Helin K', 'Iwama A', 'Suda T', 'Inaba T', 'Honda H']","['Department of Disease Model and.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute of Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan;', 'Department of Cell Differentiation, The Sakaguchi Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Disease Model and.', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute of Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan;', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute of Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan;', 'Department of Disease Model and.', 'Department of Disease Model and.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', ""Department of Pathology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan;"", 'Laboratory of Cellular Oncology, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD;', 'Health Care Center and Graduate School of Humanities and Sciences, Institute of Environmental Science for Human Life, Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, Japan; and.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC) and Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Biotech Research and Innovation Centre (BRIC) and Centre for Epigenetics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Graduate School of Medicine, Chiba University, Chiba, Japan;', 'Department of Cell Differentiation, The Sakaguchi Laboratory of Developmental Biology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan;', 'Department of Molecular Oncology, Research Institute of Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan;', 'Department of Disease Model and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (F-Box Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nsg2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.27 (Kdm2b protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'F-Box Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Jumonji Domain-Containing Histone Demethylases/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oncogenes', 'Up-Regulation/genetics']",2015/04/16 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/04/16 06:00'],"['2014/03/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31608-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-03-562694 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 28;125(22):3437-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-03-562694.

Here, we evaluated a novel compound AKI603 against oncogenic Aurora kinase A (Aur-A) in imatinib-resistant CML cells. We found that Aur-A was highly activated in imatinib-resistant KBM5-T315I cells. AKI603 significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of Aur-A kinase at Thr288, while had little inhibitory effect on BCR-ABL kinase in both KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells. AKI603 inhibited cell viability, and induced cell cycle arrest with polyploidy accumulation in KBM5 and KBM5-T315I cells. Moreover, inhibition of Aur-A kinase by AKI603 suppressed colony formation capacity without promoting obvious apoptosis. Importantly, AKI603 promoted cell differentiation in both CML cell types. Thus, our study suggested the potential clinical use of small molecule Aurora kinase inhibitor AKI603 to overcome imatinib resistance in CML treatment.","['Long, Zi-Jie', 'Wang, Le-Xun', 'Zheng, Fei-Meng', 'Chen, Jia-Jie', 'Luo, Yu', 'Tu, Xi-Xiang', 'Lin, Dong-Jun', 'Lu, Gui', 'Liu, Quentin']","['Long ZJ', 'Wang LX', 'Zheng FM', 'Chen JJ', 'Luo Y', 'Tu XX', 'Lin DJ', 'Lu G', 'Liu Q']","['Department of Hematology, The Third Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Sun Yat-sen Institute of Hematology, Guangzhou 510630, P.R.

However, conditioning, shipping and long lasting storage of nucleic acid controls remain problematic. Therefore, we evaluated the minicapsule-based innovative process developed by Imagene (Evry, France) for implementing DNA and RNA controls designed for clonality assessment of lymphoproliferations and BCR-ABL1 mRNA quantification, respectively. DESIGN & METHODS: DNA samples were extracted from 12 cell lines selected for giving specific amplifications with most BIOMED-2 PCR tubes. RNA samples were extracted from 8 cell line mixtures expressing various BCR-ABL1 transcript levels. DNA and RNA were encapsulated by Imagene and shipped at room temperature to participating laboratories. Biologists were asked to report quality data of recovered nucleic acids as well as PCR results. RESULTS: Encapsulated nucleic acids samples were easily and efficiently recovered from minicapsules. The expected rearrangements at immunoglobulin, T-cell receptor and BCL2 loci were detected in DNA samples by all laboratories. Quality of RNA was consistent between laboratories and met the criteria requested for quantification of BCR-ABL1 transcripts. Expression levels measured by the 5 laboratories were within +/-2 fold interval from the corresponding pre-encapsulation reference value. Moreover aging studies of encapsulated RNA simulating up to 100 years storage at room temperature show no bias in quantitative outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, Imagene minicapsules are suitable for storage and distribution at room temperature of genetic material designed for proficiency control of molecular diagnostic methods based on end point or real-time quantitative PCR.","['Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Maute, Carole', 'Fabre, Anne-Lise', 'Nibourel, Olivier', 'Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Villarese, Patrick', 'Hayette, Sandrine', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle', 'Macintyre, Elizabeth']","['Cayuela JM', 'Maute C', 'Fabre AL', 'Nibourel O', 'Dulucq S', 'Delabesse E', 'Villarese P', 'Hayette S', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Macintyre E']","['Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, Paris, France; EA3518, University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.

In this study, we aimed to assess the prognostic importance and clinical associations of neutrophil and platelet recovery rates and rebound thrombocytosis (RT) or neutrophilia (RN) in the postchemotherapy period for newly diagnosed AML patients. De novo AML patients diagnosed between October 2002 and December 2013 were evaluated retrospectively. One hundred patients were suitable for inclusion. Cox regression analysis using need for reinduction chemotherapy as a stratification parameter revealed RT as the only parameter predictive of OS, with borderline statistical significance (p = 0.06, OR = 7; 95% CI 0.92-53), and it was the only parameter predictive of DFS (p = 0.024, OR = 10; 95% CI 1.3-75). In order to understand whether RT or RN was related to a better marrow capacity or late consolidation, we considered neutrophil recovery time and platelet recovery time and nadir-first consolidation durations in all patients in the cohort. Both the marrow recovery duration and the time between marrow aplasia and first consolidation were shorter in RT and RN patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a correlation between RT/RN and prognosis in AML.","['Malkan, Umit Yavuz', 'Gunes, Gursel', 'Isik, Ayse', 'Eliacik, Eylem', 'Etgul, Sezgin', 'Aslan, Tuncay', 'Balaban, Muruvvet Seda', 'Haznedaroglu, Ibrahim Celalettin', 'Demiroglu, Haluk', 'Goker, Hakan', 'Ozcebe, Osman Ilhami', 'Sayinalp, Nilgun', 'Aksu, Salih', 'Buyukasik, Yahya']","['Malkan UY', 'Gunes G', 'Isik A', 'Eliacik E', 'Etgul S', 'Aslan T', 'Balaban MS', 'Haznedaroglu IC', 'Demiroglu H', 'Goker H', 'Ozcebe OI', 'Sayinalp N', 'Aksu S', 'Buyukasik Y']","['Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Count', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Thrombocytosis/blood/diagnosis/drug therapy']",2015/04/15 06:00,2015/07/04 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2014/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/04 06:00 [medline]']","['000369917 [pii]', '10.1159/000369917 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2015;134(1):32-7. doi: 10.1159/000369917.

A Retrospective Analysis of the Outcomes of BFM and Hyper-CVAD Chemotherapy in Two Centers.,219-23,10.1159/000375258 [doi],"Multiple induction regimens have been developed for adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, there have been no prospective randomized trials that directly compare these regimens. In this study, we wanted to evaluate the outcome of 50 adult ALL patients treated with BFM (i.e. Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster, n = 20) and hyper-CVAD (n = 30) protocols between March 2006 and October 2012. The median age was 25 years in the BFM group and 30.5 years in the hyper-CVAD group with a male/female ratio of 15:5 and 17:13, respectively. Forty-five percent of the patients in the BFM group and 30.3% in the hyper-CVAD group were <25 years old. The majority of cases were B cell in origin (80% in the BFM group and 70% in the hyper-CVAD group). Complete remission after induction therapy was achieved in 95 and 96% of the patients, respectively. The median follow-up time was 37 months. The 5-year survival rate was higher in the BFM group than in the hyper-CVAD group (59 vs. 34%). There were also no complications which could cause a delay during the hyper-CVAD regimen. Both chemotherapies were well tolerated. None of the patients died from drug-related toxicity. Only mild liver enzyme elevations were seen as toxicity in the BFM group; these did not cause any delay in therapy. The BFM regimen seems to be feasible for adult patients with ALL in terms of tolerability and efficacy, especially in young adults.","['Alacacioglu, Inci', 'Medeni, Serife S', 'Ozsan, Guner H', 'Payzin, Bahriye', 'Sevindik, O Gokmen', 'Acar, Celal', 'Katgi, Abdullah', 'Ozdemirkan, Fusun', 'Piskin, Ozden', 'Ozcan, Mehmet A', 'Undar, Bulent', 'Demirkan, Fatih']","['Alacacioglu I', 'Medeni SS', 'Ozsan GH', 'Payzin B', 'Sevindik OG', 'Acar C', 'Katgi A', 'Ozdemirkan F', 'Piskin O', 'Ozcan MA', 'Undar B', 'Demirkan F']","['Division of Hematology, Dokuz Eylul University Faculty of Medicine, Izmir, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'CVAD protocol', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/15 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2014/07/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['000375258 [pii]', '10.1159/000375258 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2014;60(4):219-23. doi: 10.1159/000375258.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively evaluate the association between serum 25(OH)D levels and prognosis of patients with hematological malignancies. METHODS: We searched Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Google Scholar for studies evaluating the association between serum 25(OH)D levels and prognosis of patients with hematological malignancies. The hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for overall survival (OS) or relapse-free survival (RFS) were pooled using meta-analysis. RESULTS: Seven studies with a total of 2,643 patients with hematological cancer were finally included into the meta-analysis. Overall, compared with normal serum 25(OH)D levels, low serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with both poorer OS (HR = 1.85, 95% CI 1.54-2.23, P <0.001) and poorer RFS (HR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.70, P <0.001) in hematological malignancies. Subgroup analysis further showed that low serum 25(OH)D levels were significantly associated with poorer OS and RFS in both lymphoma and leukemia. CONCLUSION: Low serum 25(OH)D levels are significantly associated with poorer prognosis in patients with hematological malignancies including lymphoma and leukemia.","['Wang, Wei', 'Li, Guangyun', 'He, Xiaoyan', 'Gao, Jian', 'Wang, Robin', 'Wang, Yangang', 'Zhao, Wenjuan']","['Wang W', 'Li G', 'He X', 'Gao J', 'Wang R', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao W']","['Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', 'A288AR3C9H (25-hydroxyvitamin D)']",IM,"['Databases, Factual', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/blood/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Humans', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/blood']",2015/04/15 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['000374007 [pii]', '10.1159/000374007 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2015;35(5):1999-2005. doi: 10.1159/000374007.

These LNs incorporated a deoxycholate-polyethylenimine (DOC-PEI) conjugate, which has shown significant activity to facilitate oligonucleotide delivery. Anti-CD33 scFv (aCD33) was added as a targeting ligand. The delivery efficiency of this system was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. When cells were treated with aCD33LN/GTI-2040, significant uptake was observed in CD33 positive Kasumi-1 cells. aCD33LNs loaded with GTI-2040 induced significant down-regulation of R2 mRNA and protein levels in AML cells. Moreover, aCD33LN/GTI-2040 showed a 15-fold reduction in the IC50 of antileukemic drug Ara-C in Kasumi-1 cells. In Kasumi-1 xenograft model, aCD33LN/GTI-2040 showed significant R2 downregulation compared to LN/GTI-2040. Furthermore, aCD33LN/GTI-2040 coadministered with Ara-C was shown to be highly effective in tumor growth inhibition and to greatly increase survival time of mice bearing Kasumi-1 xenograft tumors. The conjugate DOC-PEI has shown an ability to include calcein release from lipid nanoparticles, suggesting a potential mechanism contributing to efficient endosome release by DOC-PEI2K. These results indicate that aCD33LNs are a highly effective vehicle for the therapeutic delivery of antisense agents to AML.","['Li, Hong', 'Xu, Songlin', 'Quan, Jishan', 'Yung, Bryant C', 'Pang, Jiuxia', 'Zhou, Chenguang', 'Cho, Young-Ah', 'Zhang, Mengzi', 'Liu, Shujun', 'Muthusamy, Natarajan', 'Chan, Kenneth K', 'Byrd, John C', 'Lee, L James', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Lee, Robert J']","['Li H', 'Xu S', 'Quan J', 'Yung BC', 'Pang J', 'Zhou C', 'Cho YA', 'Zhang M', 'Liu S', 'Muthusamy N', 'Chan KK', 'Byrd JC', 'Lee LJ', 'Marcucci G', 'Lee RJ']","['daggerDivision of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, double daggerDivision of Hematology-Oncology, section signMolecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, and parallelDepartment of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'daggerDivision of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, double daggerDivision of Hematology-Oncology, section signMolecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, and parallelDepartment of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'daggerDivision of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, double daggerDivision of Hematology-Oncology, section signMolecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, and parallelDepartment of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'perpendicularPharmacy College, Yanbian University, Yanji, Jilin 133002, China.', 'daggerDivision of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, double daggerDivision of Hematology-Oncology, section signMolecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, and parallelDepartment of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'daggerDivision of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, double daggerDivision of Hematology-Oncology, section signMolecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, and parallelDepartment of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'daggerDivision of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, double daggerDivision of Hematology-Oncology, section signMolecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, and parallelDepartment of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'daggerDivision of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, double daggerDivision of Hematology-Oncology, section signMolecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, and parallelDepartment of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.', 'daggerDivision of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, double daggerDivision of Hematology-Oncology, section signMolecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology Program, and parallelDepartment of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Mol Pharm,Molecular pharmaceutics,101197791,"['0 (Lipids)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '236391-66-5 (GTI2040)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lipids/*chemistry', 'Liposomes/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Nanoparticles/*chemistry', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/*chemistry', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/04/15 06:00,2016/03/24 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/mp5008212 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Pharm. 2015 Jun 1;12(6):2010-8. doi: 10.1021/mp5008212.

E3 activity-disrupting human Cbl mutations are associated with myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) that are reproduced in mice with Cbl RING finger mutant knock-in or hematopoietic Cbl and Cbl-b double knockout. However, the role of Cbl proteins in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) homeostasis, especially in the context of MPD is unclear. Here we demonstrate that HSC expansion and MPD development upon combined Cbl and Cbl-b deletion are dependent on HSCs. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that DKO HSCs exhibit reduced quiescence associated with compromised reconstitution ability and propensity to undergo exhaustion. We show that sustained c-Kit and FLT3 signaling in DKO HSCs promotes loss of colony-forming potential, and c-Kit or FLT3 inhibition in vitro protects HSCs from exhaustion. In vivo, treatment with 5-fluorouracil hastens DKO HSC exhaustion and protects mice from death due to MPD. Our data reveal a novel and leukemia therapy-relevant role of Cbl and Cbl-b in the maintenance of HSC quiescence and protection against exhaustion, through negative regulation of tyrosine kinase-coupled receptor signaling.","['An, Wei', 'Nadeau, Scott A', 'Mohapatra, Bhopal C', 'Feng, Dan', 'Zutshi, Neha', 'Storck, Matthew D', 'Arya, Priyanka', 'Talmadge, James E', 'Meza, Jane L', 'Band, Vimla', 'Band, Hamid']","['An W', 'Nadeau SA', 'Mohapatra BC', 'Feng D', 'Zutshi N', 'Storck MD', 'Arya P', 'Talmadge JE', 'Meza JL', 'Band V', 'Band H']","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Departments of Genetics, Cell Biology & Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Departments of Genetics, Cell Biology & Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Departments of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology & Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Departments of Genetics, Cell Biology & Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology & Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'College of Public Health, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Departments of Genetics, Cell Biology & Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Fred & Pamela Buffet Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Departments of Genetics, Cell Biology & Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Departments of Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Departments of Pathology & Microbiology, College of Medicine, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.', 'Fred & Pamela Buffet Cancer Center, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (Cbl protein, mouse)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/*deficiency/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2015/04/15 06:00,2016/03/15 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2015/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['3403 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3403 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Apr 30;6(12):10498-509. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3403.,,PMC4496370,['NOTNLM'],"['Cbl', 'HSC', 'quiescence', 'tyrosine kinase', 'ubiquitin ligase']",,,,"['R01 CA087986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA105489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA096844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA96844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA116552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA116552/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA144027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105489/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA036727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA99163/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA099163/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA144027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An important feature of the incurable plasma cell malignancy Multiple Myeloma (MM) is immune dysfunction. MDSC were previously identified to be present and active in MM patients, however little is known about the MDSC-inducing and -activating capacity of MM cells. In this study we investigated the effects of the tumor microenvironment on MDSC survival. During MM progression in the 5TMM mouse model, accumulation of MDSC in the bone marrow was observed in early stages of disease development, while circulating myeloid cells were increased at later stages of disease. Interestingly, in vivo MDSC targeting by anti-GR1 antibodies and 5-Fluorouracil resulted in a significant reduced tumor load in 5TMM-diseased mice. In vitro generation of MDSC was demonstrated by increased T cell immunosuppressive capacity and MDSC survival was observed in the presence of MM-conditioned medium. Finally, increased Mcl-1 expression was identified as underlying mechanism for MDSC survival. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that soluble factors from MM cells are able to generate MDSC through Mcl-1 upregulation and this cell population can be considered as a possible target in MM disease.","['De Veirman, Kim', 'Van Ginderachter, Jo A', 'Lub, Susanne', 'De Beule, Nathan', 'Thielemans, Kris', 'Bautmans, Ivan', 'Oyajobi, Babatunde O', 'De Bruyne, Elke', 'Menu, Eline', 'Lemaire, Miguel', 'Van Riet, Ivan', 'Vanderkerken, Karin', 'Van Valckenborgh, Els']","['De Veirman K', 'Van Ginderachter JA', 'Lub S', 'De Beule N', 'Thielemans K', 'Bautmans I', 'Oyajobi BO', 'De Bruyne E', 'Menu E', 'Lemaire M', 'Van Riet I', 'Vanderkerken K', 'Van Valckenborgh E']","['Laboratory of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Immunology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Myeloid Cell Immunology Laboratory, VIB, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Immunology-Physiology, Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Therapy, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Gerontology & Frailty in Ageing Departments, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Cellular & Structural Biology and Cancer Therapy and Research Center, The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, USA.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Immunology, Myeloma Center Brussels, Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB), Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Survival Analysis']",2015/04/15 06:00,2016/03/15 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [medline]']","['3300 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3300 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Apr 30;6(12):10532-47. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3300.,,PMC4496373,['NOTNLM'],"['generation', 'mechanism', 'multiple myeloma', 'myeloid-derived suppressor cells', 'targeting']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, targeting PI3Ks is a promising innovative approach for T-ALL treatment, however at present no definitive evidence indicated which is the better therapeutic strategy between pan or selective isoform inhibition, as all the four catalytic subunits might participate in leukemogenesis. Here, we demonstrated that in both PTEN deleted and PTEN non deleted T-ALL cell lines, PI3K pan-inhibition exerted the highest cytotoxic effects when compared to both selective isoform inhibition or dual p110gamma/delta inhibition. Intriguingly, the dual p110gamma/delta inhibitor IPI-145 was effective in Loucy cells, which are representative of early T-precursor (ETP)-ALL, a T-ALL subtype associated with a poor outcome. PTEN gene deletion did not confer a peculiar reliance of T-ALL cells on PI3K activity for their proliferation/survival, as PTEN was inactivated in PTEN non deleted cells, due to posttranslational mechanisms. PI3K pan-inhibition suppressed Akt activation and induced caspase-independent apoptosis. We further demonstrated that in some T-ALL cell lines, autophagy could exert a protective role against PI3K inhibition. Our findings strongly support clinical application of class I PI3K pan-inhibitors in T-ALL treatment, with the possible exception of ETP-ALL cases.","['Lonetti, Annalisa', 'Cappellini, Alessandra', 'Sparta, Antonino Maria', 'Chiarini, Francesca', 'Buontempo, Francesca', 'Evangelisti, Camilla', 'Evangelisti, Cecilia', 'Orsini, Ester', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Martelli, Alberto Maria']","['Lonetti A', 'Cappellini A', 'Sparta AM', 'Chiarini F', 'Buontempo F', 'Evangelisti C', 'Evangelisti C', 'Orsini E', 'McCubrey JA', 'Martelli AM']","['Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Human, Social and Health Sciences, University of Cassino, Cassino, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Muscoloskeletal Cell Biology Laboratory, IOR, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council-Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Muscoloskeletal Cell Biology Laboratory, IOR, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute of Molecular Genetics, National Research Council-Rizzoli Orthopedic Institute, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Survival Analysis']",2015/04/15 06:00,2016/03/16 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [medline]']","['3295 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3295 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Apr 30;6(12):10399-414. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3295.,,PMC4496363,['NOTNLM'],"['PI3K isoforms', 'PTEN', 'T-ALL', 'autophagy', 'targeted therapy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified the compound [(E)-1-(5'-Chloro-2'-oxoindolin-3'-ylidene)-6-ethyl-2,3,6,9-tetrahydro-2,9-dioxo- 1H-pyrrolo[3,2-f] quinoline-8-carboxylic acid], abbreviated as 5'-Cl, which shows selective antiproliferative activities against various cancer cell lines mediated through apoptosis. Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the apoptotic activity of 5'-Cl in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. METHODS: We employed different methods to determine the apoptotic pathways triggered by 5'-Cl in HL-60 cells, using flow cytometry, nuclear staining, caspases activation, mitochondria functioning, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Western blotting techniques. RESULTS: Low concentrations (1-8 microM) of 5'-Cl inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells in a dose and time-dependent manner. Cytotoxicity of this compound is found to be mediated by a caspase-dependent apoptosis. Also, there were indications of caspase independent apoptosis as z-VAD-FMK failed to fully rescue the cells from 5'-Cl-induced apoptosis. In addition, the compound triggered generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), caused depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane, decreased the level of cellular ATP, modulated the expression and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 leading to loss of its association with Bax and increased the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol of treated cells. The effects of 5'-Cl on mitochondria and apoptosis were substantially blocked in the presence of a combination between z-VAD-FMK and either of the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC). CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that the growth inhibitory effects of 5'-Cl in HL-60 cells involve multiple pathways of apoptosis and dysregulation of mitochondrial functions.","['Saleh, Ayman M', 'Aljada, Ahmad', 'El-Abadelah, Mustafa M', 'Sabri, Salim S', 'Zahra, Jalal A', 'Nasr, Amre', 'Aziz, Mohammad A']","['Saleh AM', 'Aljada A', 'El-Abadelah MM', 'Sabri SS', 'Zahra JA', 'Nasr A', 'Aziz MA']","['Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), National Guard Health Affairs, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cell Physiol Biochem,"Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology",9113221,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyridones)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', '6UE33XXJ1Y (isoindigotin)', '9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytochromes c/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyridones/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Thiocarbamates/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2015/04/15 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2015/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']","['000374004 [pii]', '10.1159/000374004 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Physiol Biochem. 2015;35(5):1958-74. doi: 10.1159/000374004.

This study aimed to find convenient clinical indexes, rather than plasma trough levels of IM, to define the appropriate IM dosage. METHODS: Seventy CML CP patients who experienced an IM dose reduction, or a temporary cessation, were enrolled from 2002 to 2010. The IM treatment was resumed and maintained at either >/=400 mg in 25 patients (35.7%; group >/=400 mg) or at </=300 mg in 45 patients (64.3%; group </=300 mg). The various clinical characteristics of these patients were evaluated. The plasma trough level of IM was monitored in 20 patients from group </=300 mg. RESULTS: Via multivariate analysis, the IM dosage divided by the body surface area (BSA) was an important index, presupposing a complete cytogenetic response at 12 months (CCyR12). Patients with IM/BSA >206.7 mg/m2 showed a higher probability of CCyR12 than others. The IM/BSA (221.7 mg/m2) in group </=300 mg was higher than in group >/=400 mg (207.6 mg/m2). The sustained response and survival rate of group </=300 mg was comparable to that of group >/=400 mg. The plasma trough level of IM was significantly correlated with the IM/BSA.

We have recently synthesized a novel group of pyridone-annelated isoindigos and identified the derivative 5'-Cl that is cytotoxic to various cancer cell lines. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of this compound on cell cycle of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60. METHODS: HL-60 cells were treated with 5'-Cl and its effect on cell cycle stages were determined by flow cytometry. Expression of cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and cyclin kinase inhibitors (CKIs) were determined by Western blotting, and activation of CDKs was studied using kinase assays. RESULTS: 5'-Cl remarkably arrested cell cycle in HL-60 cells at the G0/G1 phase in a dose and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, 5'-Cl treatment significantly inhibited expression of D-cyclins, CDK2 and CDK4 and suppressed phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein Rb, whereas it increased the level of CKI p21. Molecular modelling experiments show that 5'-Cl may compete with ATP for binding to the catalytic subunit of CDK2 and CDK4 that could lead to inhibition of these enzymes. Indeed, 5'-Cl inhibited the kinase activity of CDK2 and CDK4 both in cell free systems and in treated cells. 5'-Cl also inhibited cell cycle progression in several other tumor cell lines.

The cytogenetic hallmark of CML is Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. This study aimed to diagnose suspected CML patients, to monitor CML patients under therapy using cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to analyze their bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) samples, and finally to compare their obtained results for both specimens. This study was conducted during one-year period (2012-2013). The participants were recruited from the Hematology and Oncology Clinic of Shahid Gazi (Emam Reza) Hospital of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, East Azerbaijan Province, Iran. We analyzed 90 samples from 60 suspected CML patients (30 BM and 60 PB samples). All samples were analyzed using G-banding, 5 samples using dual fusion FISH (DF-FISH) probes, as well as 30 samples using both FISH and G-banding. Among the 90 analyzed samples of 60 patients, 25 (41.66%) were Ph+ using karyotyping, whereas five cases were not analyzable, so FISH was applied and the results confirmed that only two individuals were BCR-ABL+. In the comparison between 25 BM and 25 PB samples using karyotyping, 15 (60%) and 10 (40%) were ph+, respectively. The comparison of FISH and karyotyping on 30 samples showed that 9 (30%) and 8 (26.66%) were Ph+, respectively, and only 18.18% of Ph+ patients showed atypical patterns. In the comparison between BM-cytogenetic and PB- interphase-FISH (I-FISH), BM-cytogenetic was more reliable than PB-I-FISH in detecting Ph. Our data demonstrate that FISH analysis is a rapid, reliable and sensitive technique. The comparison between BM and PB showed that PB can not be replaced by BM, even in detecting by FISH.","['Manaflouyan Khajehmarjany, Soheila', 'Rahmani, Seyed Ali', 'Chavoshi, Seyed Hadi', 'Esfahani, Ali', 'Movassaghpour Akbari, Ali Akbar']","['Manaflouyan Khajehmarjany S', 'Rahmani SA', 'Chavoshi SH', 'Esfahani A', 'Movassaghpour Akbari AA']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Islamic Azad University, Ahar Branch, East Azerbaijan, Iran ; Dr. Rahmani Medical Genetic Lab, Tabriz, East Azerbaijan, Iran.', 'Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Islamic Azad University, Ahar Branch, East Azerbaijan, Iran ; Dr. Rahmani Medical Genetic Lab, Tabriz, East Azerbaijan, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, East Azerbaijan, Iran ; Emam Reza Hospital, Tabriz, East Azerbaijan, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, East Azerbaijan, Iran ; Emam Reza Hospital, Tabriz, East Azerbaijan, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, East Azerbaijan, Iran ; Emam Reza Hospital, Tabriz, East Azerbaijan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Cell J,Cell journal,101566618,,,,2015/04/15 06:00,2015/04/15 06:01,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2014/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.22074/cellj.2015.525 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell J. 2015 Spring;17(1):171-80. doi: 10.22074/cellj.2015.525.

CD44, a multifunctional cell surface glycoprotein, is a receptor for HA. In addition, CD44 is known to interact with other receptors and ligands, and to mediate a number of cellular functions as well as disease progression. Studies have shown that binding of HA to CD44 in cancer cells activates survival pathways resulting in cancer cell survival. This effect can be blocked by anti-CD44 monoclonal antibodies. A6 is a capped, eight l-amino acid peptide (Ac-KPSSPPEE-NH2) derived from the biologically active connecting peptide domain of the serine protease, human urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). A6 neither binds to the uPA receptor (uPAR) nor interferes with uPA/uPAR binding. A6 binds to CD44 resulting in the inhibition of migration, invasion, and metastasis of tumor cells, and the modulation of CD44-mediated cell signaling. A6 has been shown to have no dose-limiting toxicity in animal studies. A6 has demonstrated efficacy and an excellent safety profile in Phase 1a, 1b, and 2 clinical trials. In animal models, A6 has also exhibited promising results for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy and wet age-related macular degeneration through the reduction of retinal vascular permeability and inhibition of choroidal neovascularization, respectively. Recently, A6 has been shown to be directly cytotoxic for B-lymphocytes obtained from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia expressing the kinase, ZAP-70. This review will discuss the activity of A6, A6 modulation of HA and CD44, and a novel strategy for therapeutic intervention in disease.","['Finlayson, Malcolm']",['Finlayson M'],"['Angstrom Pharmaceuticals Inc. , Solana Beach, CA , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,,,2015/04/15 06:00,2015/04/15 06:01,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2014/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/15 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2015.00135 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2015 Mar 30;6:135. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2015.00135. eCollection 2015.,20150330,PMC4378311,['NOTNLM'],"['A6', 'CD44', 'CLL', 'HA', 'metastasis', 'ocular', 'recurrence', 'resistant']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study including 145 030 admissions of patients with cancer from 13 EORTC centers. Incidence, clinical characteristics, and outcome of fungemia were analyzed. RESULTS: Fungemia occurred in 333 (0.23%; 95% confidence interval [CI], .21-.26) patients, ranging from 0.15% in patients with solid tumors to 1.55% in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients. In 297 evaluable patients age ranged from 17 to 88 years (median 56 years), 144 (48%) patients were female, 165 (56%) had solid tumors, and 140 (47%) had hematological malignancies. Fungemia including polymicrobial infection was due to: Candida spp. in 267 (90%), C. albicans in 128 (48%), and other Candida spp. in 145 (54%) patients. Favorable overall response was achieved in 113 (46.5%) patients by week 2. After 4 weeks, the survival rate was 64% (95% CI, 59%-70%) and was not significantly different between Candida spp. Multivariable logistic regression identified baseline septic shock (odds ratio [OR] 3.04, 95% CI, 1.22-7.58) and tachypnoea as poor prognostic factors (OR 2.95, 95% CI, 1.66-5.24), while antifungal prophylaxis prior to fungemia (OR 0.20, 95% CI, .06-.62) and remission of underlying cancer (OR, 0.18; 95% CI, .06-.50) were protective. CONCLUSIONS: Fungemia, mostly due to Candida spp., was rare in cancer patients from EORTC centers but was associated with substantial mortality. Antifungal prophylaxis and remission of cancer predicted better survival.","['Cornely, Oliver A', 'Gachot, Bertrand', 'Akan, Hamdi', 'Bassetti, Matteo', 'Uzun, Omrun', 'Kibbler, Christopher', 'Marchetti, Oscar', 'de Burghgraeve, Peter', 'Ramadan, Safaa', 'Pylkkanen, Liisa', 'Ameye, Lieveke', 'Paesmans, Marianne', 'Donnelly, J Peter']","['Cornely OA', 'Gachot B', 'Akan H', 'Bassetti M', 'Uzun O', 'Kibbler C', 'Marchetti O', 'de Burghgraeve P', 'Ramadan S', 'Pylkkanen L', 'Ameye L', 'Paesmans M', 'Donnelly JP']","['Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases (CECAD), University of Cologne Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Cologne Clinical Trials Centre Cologne, ZKS Koln, BMBF 01KN1106, and German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF), partner site Bonn-Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Institut Gustave Roussy Departement de Soins Aigus, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'Ankara University School of Medicine, Turkey.', 'Santa Maria Misericordia Hospital, Udine, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Infectious Diseases, Hacettepe University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey.', 'University College London, United Kingdom.', 'Infectious Diseases Service, Department of Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, Switzerland.', 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).', 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).', 'European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC).', 'Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.', 'Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.', 'University Medical Centre St Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Infect Dis,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,9203213,['0 (Antifungal Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antifungal Agents', 'Candida', 'Female', 'Fungemia/*complications/*epidemiology/microbiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia/*complications/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Shock, Septic', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/15 06:00,2016/04/22 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/22 06:00 [medline]']","['civ293 [pii]', '10.1093/cid/civ293 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Infect Dis. 2015 Aug 1;61(3):324-31. doi: 10.1093/cid/civ293.

Activation of the PI3K pathway has been suggested as one mechanism of glucocorticoid resistance in T-ALL, and patients harboring mutations in the PI3K negative regulator PTEN may be at increased risk of induction failure and relapse. By gene expression microarray analysis of T-ALL cells treated with the PI3K inhibitor AS605240, we identified Myc as a prominent downstream target of the PI3K pathway. A significant association was found between the AS605240 gene expression signature and that of glucocorticoid resistance and relapse in T-ALL. AS605240 showed anti-leukemic activity and strong synergism with glucocorticoids both in vitro and in a NOD/SCID xenograft model of T-ALL. In contrast, PI3K inhibition showed antagonism with methotrexate and daunorubicin, drugs that preferentially target dividing cells. This antagonistic interaction, however, could be circumvented by the use of correct drug scheduling schemes.

Despite this medical breakthrough, mortality rates remain high. Our purpose was to evaluate labour productivity losses associated with premature mortality due to blood cancer in recipients of stem cell transplantations. METHODS: We collected primary data from the clinical histories of blood cancer patients who had undergone stem cell transplantation between 2006 and 2011 in two Spanish hospitals. We carried out a descriptive analysis and calculated the years of potential life lost and years of potential productive life lost. Labour productivity losses due to premature mortality were estimated using the Human Capital method. An alternative approach, the Friction Cost method, was used as part of the sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Our findings suggest that, in a population of 179 transplanted and deceased patients, males and people who die between the ages of 30 and 49 years generate higher labour productivity losses. The estimated loss amounts to over euro31.4 million using the Human Capital method (euro480,152 using the Friction Cost method), which means an average of euro185,855 per death. The highest labour productivity losses are produced by leukaemia. However, lymphoma generates the highest loss per death. CONCLUSIONS: Further efforts are needed to reduce premature mortality in blood cancer patients undergoing transplantations and reduce economic losses.","['Ortega-Ortega, Marta', 'Oliva-Moreno, Juan', 'Jimenez-Aguilera, Juan de Dios', 'Romero-Aguilar, Antonio', 'Espigado-Tocino, Ildefonso']","['Ortega-Ortega M', 'Oliva-Moreno J', 'Jimenez-Aguilera Jde D', 'Romero-Aguilar A', 'Espigado-Tocino I']","['Applied Economic Department, University of Granada, Granada, Spain.

Galectin-3 (Lgals3) is a multifunctional galactose-binding lectin with reported location in the nucleus, cytoplasm and extracellular space in different cell types. We previously reported that ALL cells co-cultured with stroma contain high levels of Galectin-3. We here establish that, in contrast to more mature B-lineage cancers, Galectin-3 detected in and on the ALL cells originates from stromal cells, which express it on their surface, secrete it as soluble protein and also in exosomes. Soluble and stromal-bound Galectin-3 is internalized by ALL cells, transported to the nucleus and stimulates transcription of endogenous LGALS3 mRNA. When human and mouse ALL cells develop tolerance to different drugs while in contact with protective stromal cells, Galectin-3 protein levels are consistently increased. This correlates with induction of Galectin-3 transcription in the ALL cells. Thus Galectin-3 sourced from stroma becomes supplemented by endogenous Galectin-3 production in the pre-B ALL cells that are under continuous stress from drug treatment. Our data suggest that stromal Galectin-3 may protect ALL cells through auto-induction of Galectin-3 mRNA and tonic NFkappaB pathway activation. Since endogenously synthesized Galectin-3 protects pre-B ALL cells against drug treatment, we identify Galectin-3 as one possible target to counteract the protective effects of stroma.","['Fei, Fei',

We have found a synergistic interaction between 1 muM ATO and 5 muM fludarabine that significantly enhanced the cytotoxic effect of the individual drugs. Importantly, ATO sensitized fludarabine-resistant cells to the action of this drug. The mechanism behind this effect included the downregulation of phospho-Akt, phospho-ERK, and the Mcl-1/Bim and Bcl-2/Bax ratios. The combination of ATO and fludarabine partially overcame the survival effect induced by co-culturing CLL cells with stromal cells.

We analyzed 149 young and 61 elderly adults who achieved morphological CR after induction course of EORTC/GIMEMA protocols. Elderly patients reached a postconsolidation MRD negative status less frequently than younger ones (11 vs 28 %, p = 0.009). MRD negativity resulted in a longer 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) both in elderly (57 vs 13 %, p = 0.0197) and in younger patients (56 vs 31 %, p = 0.0017). Accordingly, 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) of both elderly (83 vs 42 %, p = 0.045) and younger patients (59 vs 24 % p = NS) who were MRD positive doubled that of MRD negative ones. Nevertheless, CIR of MRD negative elderly patients was twofold higher than that of younger MRD negative ones (42 vs 24 %, p = NS). In conclusion, elderly patients in whom chemotherapy yields a MRD negative CR have duration of DFS and rate of CIR significantly better than those who remain MRD positive. Nonetheless, the high CIR rate observed in the elderly suggests that MRD negativity might have different therapeutic implications in this population than in the younger counterpart.","['Buccisano, F', 'Maurillo, L', 'Piciocchi, A', 'Del Principe, M I', 'Sarlo, C', 'Cefalo, M', 'Ditto, C', 'Di Veroli, A', 'De Santis, G', 'Irno Consalvo, M', 'Fraboni, D', 'Panetta, P', 'Palomba, P', 'Attrotto, C', 'Del Poeta, G', 'Sconocchia, G', 'Lo-Coco, F', 'Amadori, S', 'Venditti, A']","['Buccisano F', 'Maurillo L', 'Piciocchi A', 'Del Principe MI', 'Sarlo C', 'Cefalo M', 'Ditto C', 'Di Veroli A', 'De Santis G', 'Irno Consalvo M', 'Fraboni D', 'Panetta P', 'Palomba P', 'Attrotto C', 'Del Poeta G', 'Sconocchia G', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Amadori S', 'Venditti A']","['Ematologia, Dipartimento di Biomedicina e Prevenzione, Universita di Roma ""Tor Vergata"", Roma, Italia, francesco.buccisano@uniroma2.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Remission Induction', 'Secondary Prevention/methods', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/15 06:00,2015/09/10 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2015/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-015-2364-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Aug;94(8):1319-26. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2364-5.

Arsenic is clinically approved for leukemia treatment; however, studies are not enough to support its role in the management of solid tumors. In the present study, we observed that silibinin (100 microM) modulated the oxidative status of human PCa DU145 cells exposed to arsenic (0.5 or 5 microM) and inhibited cell growth and survival by primarily inducing autophagy and apoptosis. The silibinin-arsenic combination also inhibited the growth, survival, and clonogenic potential of 22Rv1 PCa cells. Silibinin with 0.5 or 5 microM arsenic induced G1 or G2/M phase arrest, respectively, and decreased the protein levels of CDK2, -4, and -6 and cyclin D1, D3, and E and increased CDK inhibitors p21 and p27. Arsenic alone increased cyclin B1 level and Cdc2 kinase activity which were reduced in silibinin combination. Cell motility and invasiveness along with expression of MMP-2 and vimentin were suppressed. Together, these in vitro findings suggest that in presence of arsenic, silibinin strongly inhibits tumorigenic and metastatic potential of PCa cells.","['Prajapati, Vandana', 'Kale, Raosaheb K', 'Singh, Rana P']","['Prajapati V', 'Kale RK', 'Singh RP']","['a Cancer Biology Laboratory, School of Life Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University , New Delhi , India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Silymarin)', '0 (Vimentin)', '4RKY41TBTF (Silybin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (MMP2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Arsenic/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Silybin', 'Silymarin/*pharmacology', 'Vimentin/genetics/metabolism']",2015/04/15 06:00,2016/02/24 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2015.1019635 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2015;67(4):647-58. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2015.1019635.

STUDY DESIGN: Female Kunming mice were randomly allocated into 4 groups: group I, normal control; group II, injury procedure control; and group III and group IV, the mice being scratched with a blunt syringe on the right uterine horn or both, respectively. All the mice were mated with the males during the next estrus phase. The number of implanted embryos on each side of uterus was calculated on day 8 of pregnancy. The endometrial samples were taken on day 4 of pregnancy, and the local morphological changes and cytokine expressions were examined. RESULTS: Compared to group II, our results showed that in group IV (1) there were significantly higher numbers of implanted embryos, (2) the endometrial glands and vasculatures in stroma were obviously increased and the pinopodes were abundant and well developed, and (3) the local levels of cytokines leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and oncostatin M (OSM) messenger RNA and protein expression were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: Local mechanical injury on mouse uteri enhanced endometrial receptivity and improved embryo implantation, which were correlated with the characteristic changes in endometrial morphology and the upregulation of LIF and OSM gene and protein expression.","['Zhang, Xiao-Hui', 'Liu, Zhao-Zhao', 'Tang, Mao-Xing', 'Zhang, Yong-Hong', 'Hu, Lian', 'Liao, Ai-Hua']","['Zhang XH', 'Liu ZZ', 'Tang MX', 'Zhang YH', 'Hu L', 'Liao AH']","[""Family Planning Research Institute, Center for Reproductive Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Family Planning Research Institute, Center for Reproductive Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Family Planning Research Institute, Center for Reproductive Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Family Planning Research Institute, Center for Reproductive Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Family Planning Research Institute, Center for Reproductive Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China."", ""Family Planning Research Institute, Center for Reproductive Medicine, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, People's Republic of China aihua_liao@sina.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Reprod Sci,"Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)",101291249,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Osm protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/injuries/*metabolism/physiopathology/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gestational Age', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oncostatin M/genetics/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Up-Regulation', 'Wounds, Penetrating/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/physiopathology']",2015/04/15 06:00,2016/10/07 06:00,['2015/04/15 06:00'],"['2015/04/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['1933719115580999 [pii]', '10.1177/1933719115580999 [doi]']",ppublish,Reprod Sci. 2015 Nov;22(11):1377-86. doi: 10.1177/1933719115580999.

Moreover, hearing loss has detrimental effects on quality of life and communication, outcomes that are central to palliative care. Despite its high prevalence, there is remarkably little written on the impact of hearing loss in the palliative care literature. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to emphasize its importance and the need for further study. We use a case as a springboard for discussing what is known and unknown about the epidemiology, presentation, screening methodologies, and treatment strategies for age-related hearing loss in palliative care. DISCUSSION: The case describes a 65-year-old man with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) that has progressed despite treatment. No concerns are raised about communication challenges during conversations between the palliative care team and the patient in his quiet room. However, in the midst of a family meeting, shortly after discussing prognosis, the patient reports that he cannot hear what anyone is saying. CONCLUSION: We describe simple methods of screening patients for hearing loss, and suggest that practical approaches should be used universally in patient encounters. These include facing the patient, pitching one's voice low, using a pocket talker, and creating a hearing-friendly environment when planning a family or group meeting.","['Smith, Alexander K', 'Jain, Nelia', 'Wallhagen, Margaret L']","['Smith AK', 'Jain N', 'Wallhagen ML']","['1Division of Geriatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', '2Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.', '1Division of Geriatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.', '2Geriatrics, Palliative, and Extended Care, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, California.', '3Department of Physiological Nursing, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, California.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Palliat Med,Journal of palliative medicine,9808462,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Hearing Loss/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*nursing', 'Male', '*Palliative Care']",2015/04/14 06:00,2016/02/09 06:00,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/jpm.2014.0367 [doi]'],ppublish,J Palliat Med. 2015 Jun;18(6):559-62. doi: 10.1089/jpm.2014.0367.

Assumed risks of toxicities and associated delays in treatment have played a role in setting upper age limits. The aim of this study was to examine the toxicity profile and treatment delays in NOPHO ALL2008 comparing children and adults. METHODS: We collected information on 19 treatment-related toxicities, systematically captured at 3-month intervals throughout therapy, and time intervals between 12 consecutive treatment phases for 1076 patients aged 1-45 yrs treated according to the Nordic/Baltic ALL2008 protocol. RESULTS: No adults died during induction. The duration of induction therapy and postinduction treatment phases did not differ between children and adults, except for patients 18-45 yrs being significantly delayed during two of nine high-risk blocks (median number of days for patients 1-9, 10-17, and 18-45 yrs; the glucocorticosteroid/antimetabolite-based block B1: 24, 26, and 29 d, respectively, P = 0.001, and Block 5 (in most cases also a B block): 29, 29, and 37 d, respectively, P = 0.02). A higher incidence of thrombosis with increasing age was found; highest odds ratio 5.4 (95% CI: (2.6;11.0)) for patients 15-17 yrs compared with children 1-9 yrs (P < 0.0001). Risk of avascular osteonecrosis was related to age with the highest OR for patients 10-14 yrs (OR = 10.4 (95% CI: (4.4;24.9)), P < 0.0001).

In a phase 1/2 investigation, we treated 45 AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/CML patients (34 AML, 7 MDS and 4 CML) with G-CSF (10 mug/kg daily for 6 days starting on day -9) plus plerixafor (doses of 0, 80, 160 or 240 mug/kg daily for 4 days starting on day -7) along with the busulfan-fludarabine (Bu-Flu) conditioning regimen.

We compared the clinical effects and outcomes of AML/MDS study patients (n=40) with 164 patients from a historical data set who received Bu-Flu alone before allo-SCT by stratifying on cytogenetics and disease status to correct for bias. Study patients had increased myeloid chimerism and lower rates of GvHD. There was no significant difference in relapse-free survival or overall survival. The G-CSF plus plerixafor combination increased circulating WBCs, CD34+ cells and CXCR4+ cells, and preferentially mobilized FISH+ leukemic cells.","['Konopleva, Marina', 'Benton, Christopher B', 'Thall, Peter F', 'Zeng, Zhihong', 'Shpall, Elizabeth', 'Ciurea, Stefan', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Alousi, Amin', 'Popat, Uday', 'Anderlini, Paolo', 'Nieto, Yago', 'Parmar, Simrit', 'Qiao, Wei', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'McMullin, Becky', 'Wang, Rui-Yu', 'Lu, Hongbo', 'Schober, Wendy', 'Woodworth, Glenda', 'Gulbis, Alison', 'Cool, Rita', 'Andreeff, Michael', 'Champlin, Richard']","['Konopleva M', 'Benton CB', 'Thall PF', 'Zeng Z', 'Shpall E', 'Ciurea S', 'Kebriaei P', 'Alousi A', 'Popat U', 'Anderlini P', 'Nieto Y', 'Parmar S', 'Qiao W', 'Chen J', 'Rondon G', 'McMullin B', 'Wang RY', 'Lu H', 'Schober W', 'Woodworth G', 'Gulbis A', 'Cool R', 'Andreeff M', 'Champlin R']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation, The University of Texas M.

The role of HDT in the front-line consolidation setting in CLL is uncertain. Literature search of PUBMED and Cochrane until 14 November 2014 and the last 2 years of abstracts from relevant conferences was undertaken. End points included benefits (overall survival; OS, PFS, event-free survival; EFS) and harms (adverse events, secondary malignancies, treatment-related mortality). The search identified 495 references of which four studies met inclusion criteria. Altogether, 301 patients were randomized to the HDT/auto-HCT arm and 299 patients to the control arm. Offering front-line HDT/auto-HCT did not result in statistically significant improvement in OS (Hazard ratio (HR)=0.91; 95% confidence interval (CI)= 0.62, 1.33) or PFS (HR=0.70; 95% CI= 0.32, 1.52). There was a statistically significant advantage favoring HDT/auto-HCT for EFS (HR=0.46; 95% CI= 0.26, 0.83). Moreover, HDT/auto-HCT did not result in higher rate of secondary malignancy (risk ratio=1.06; 95% CI=0.55, 2.05) or treatment-related mortality (risk ratio=1.32; 95% CI= 0.43, 4.06). Offering HDT/auto-HCT as front-line consolidation in patients with CLL does not improve OS.

Extracranial solid tumor cancer patients lacking such risk factors have historically been expected to have normal school performance. We examined the medical records of 58 young pediatric extracranial solid tumor patients who lacked CNS-directed therapy or other known risk factors for cognitive impairment to evaluate the incidence of reported difficulties or abnormalities in neuropsychological testing. Thirty-one percent of patients were found to have at least one reported difficulty or abnormality.

A novel tartary buckwheat lectin (TBL) protein, purified from tartary buckwheat seeds, showed a single band with a molecular mass of 65 kDa in SDS-PAGE. The purified TBL hemagglutinated both human and animal erythrocytes and showed preference for blood type O and the rabbit blood type. TBL is active at up to 60 degrees C, and it is acid- and alkali-stable. TBL (25 mug/mL) combined with 5 x 10(-5) M rhIL-4 promotes maturation and proliferation of peripheral blood dendritic cells (DCs), which is stronger than that promoted by rhTNF-alpha (20 ng/mL). Exposure of DCs to 50 mug/mL TBL for 48 h resulted in extensive upregulation of maturation markers CD83 and CD40. These TBL-DCs were capable of producing several pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-10 (IL-10) and interleukin-12 (IL-12). The results of the treatment of human leukemia U937 cells with TBL in doses of 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mug/mL showed that tartary buckwheat-derived lectin induces apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Our results encourage the use of tartary buckwheat and tartary buckwheat-derived lectins as immunopotentiating foods, targeted to strengthen immune responses and display a potential dietary supplement for cancer prevention.","['Bai, C Z', 'Ji, H J', 'Feng, M L', 'Hao, X L', 'Zhong, Q M', 'Cui, X D', 'Wang, Z H']","['Bai CZ', 'Ji HJ', 'Feng ML', 'Hao XL', 'Zhong QM', 'Cui XD', 'Wang ZH']","['Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology and Molecular Engineering of Ministry of Education, Institute of Biotechnology, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Chinese Medicine Hospital of Shanxi Province, Taiyuan, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Chinese Medicine Hospital of Shanxi Province, Taiyuan, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Chinese Medicine Hospital of Shanxi Province, Taiyuan, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Chinese Medicine Hospital of Shanxi Province, Taiyuan, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology and Molecular Engineering of Ministry of Education, Institute of Biotechnology, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China.', 'Key Laboratory for Chemical Biology and Molecular Engineering of Ministry of Education, Institute of Biotechnology, Shanxi University, Taiyuan, China wangzhuanhua_l@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Brazil,Genet Mol Res,Genetics and molecular research : GMR,101169387,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Plant Lectins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Dendritic Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Fagopyrum/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Plant Lectins/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Seeds/chemistry', 'U937 Cells']",2015/04/14 06:00,2016/03/10 06:00,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/10 06:00 [medline]']","['gmr5734 [pii]', '10.4238/2015.March.27.3 [doi]']",epublish,Genet Mol Res. 2015 Mar 27;14(1):2162-75. doi: 10.4238/2015.March.27.3.,20150327,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cancer registry data were used to identify 112 cancer cases diagnosed during 1999-2011 in a cohort of 24 917 Norwegian men reporting offshore work between 1965 and 1999. Analyses were conducted according to a stratified case-cohort design with a reference subcohort of 1661 workers. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals, adjusted for other benzene exposure and smoking. RESULTS: Most workers were exposed to benzene for <15 years. The upper range values of average intensity and cumulative exposure were estimated to 0.040 p.p.m. and 0.948 p.p.m.-years, respectively. Risks were consistently elevated among exposed workers for all LH cancers combined and for most subgroups, although case numbers were small and yielded imprecise risk estimates. There was evidence of dose-related risk patterns according to cumulative exposure for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), multiple myeloma (MM) (P trends 0.052 and 0.024, respectively), and suggestively so for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) according to average intensity (P trend 0.094). CONCLUSIONS: Our results support an association between cumulative and intensity metrics of low-level benzene exposure and risk for AML, MM, and suggestively for CLL.","['Stenehjem, J S', 'Kjaerheim, K', 'Bratveit, M', 'Samuelsen, S O', 'Barone-Adesi, F', 'Rothman, N', 'Lan, Q', 'Grimsrud, T K']","['Stenehjem JS', 'Kjaerheim K', 'Bratveit M', 'Samuelsen SO', 'Barone-Adesi F', 'Rothman N', 'Lan Q', 'Grimsrud TK']","['Department of Research, Cancer Registry of Norway, P.O.

To date, TLR2, which recognizes a broad range of bacterial pathogens through TLR1 or TLR6 heterodimerization, has not been fully evaluated for direct effects on ALL. Studies investigating TLR2 signaling in other tumor cell types utilizing single ligands have yielded contradictory results, and comparative, heterodimer-specific analyses of TLR2 stimulation are lacking. In this study, we report that two well-characterized heterodimer-specific TLR2 ligands, Pam3 CSK4 (TLR2/1), and Pam2 CSK4 (TLR2/6), induce ALL cell lines and primary ALL samples to upregulate CD40 expression. However, only Pam3 CSK4 triggers Caspase-8-mediated apoptosis and sensitizes cells to vincristine-mediated cytotoxicity. Consistent with this result, stimulation of ALL cells through TLR2/1 or TLR2/6 activates Mal, p38 and the NF-kappaB and PI3K signaling pathways with divergent kinetics that may underlie their distinct downstream effects. Our results reveal a novel branching in downstream responses to heterodimer-specific TLR2 stimulation in ALL cells and emphasize the need for comparative studies to determine differential biological effects observed in specific tumor cells. Based on our results, TLR2/1 ligand Pam3 CSK4 possesses potential for generating anti-ALL activity through its direct effects on leukemic blasts.","['Rolf, Nina', 'Kariminia, Amina', 'Ivison, Sabine', 'Reid, Gregor S', 'Schultz, Kirk R']","['Rolf N', 'Kariminia A', 'Ivison S', 'Reid GS', 'Schultz KR']","['The Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, Child and Family Research Institute and Division of Pediatric Hem/Onc/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'The Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, Child and Family Research Institute and Division of Pediatric Hem/Onc/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'The Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, Child and Family Research Institute and Division of Pediatric Hem/Onc/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'The Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, Child and Family Research Institute and Division of Pediatric Hem/Onc/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.', 'The Michael Cuccione Childhood Cancer Research Program, Child and Family Research Institute and Division of Pediatric Hem/Onc/BMT, Department of Pediatrics, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', '0 (Pam(3)CSK(4) peptide)', '0 (TLR2 protein, human)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/*immunology', 'CD40 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Lipopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/agonists/*immunology']",2015/04/14 06:00,2015/09/16 06:00,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2014/05/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201444874 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2015 Jul;45(7):1980-90. doi: 10.1002/eji.201444874.

In addition, these cells show differences in cellular adhesion behavior whose molecular basis is not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that RE epigenetically silences the gene encoding P-Selectin Glycoprotein Ligand-1 (PSGL-1) and downregulates PSGL-1 expression in human CD34+ and murine lin- hematopoietic progenitor cells. Levels of PSGL-1 inversely and dose-dependently correlate with RE oncogene levels. However, a DNA-binding defective mutant fails to downregulate PSGL-1. We show by ChIP experiments that the PSGL-1 promoter is a direct target of RE and binding is accompanied by high levels of the repressive chromatin mark histone H3K27me3. In t(8;21)+ Kasumi-1 cells, PSGL-1 expression is completely restored at both the mRNA and cell surface protein levels following RE downregulation with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) or RE inhibition with tetramerization-blocking peptides, and at the promoter H3K27me3 is replaced by the activating chromatin mark H3K9ac as well as by RNA polymerase II. Upregulation of PSGL-1 restores the binding of cells to P- and E-selectin and re-establishes myeloid-specific cellular adhesion while it fails to bind to lymphocyte-specific L-selectin. Overall, our data suggest that the RE oncoprotein epigenetically represses PSGL-1 via binding to its promoter region and thus affects the adhesive behavior of t(8;21)+ AML cells.","['Ponnusamy, K', 'Kohrs, N', 'Ptasinska, A', 'Assi, S A', 'Herold, T', 'Hiddemann, W', 'Lausen, J', 'Bonifer, C', 'Henschler, R', 'Wichmann, C']","['Ponnusamy K', 'Kohrs N', 'Ptasinska A', 'Assi SA', 'Herold T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Lausen J', 'Bonifer C', 'Henschler R', 'Wichmann C']","['1] Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology, Ludwig-Maximilian University Hospital, Munich, Germany [2] Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, Ludwig-Maximilian University Hospital, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine 3, Ludwig-Maximilian University Hospital, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK.', '1] Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology, Ludwig-Maximilian University Hospital, Munich, Germany [2] Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Immunohematology, Goethe University, Frankfurt, Germany.', '1] Department of Transfusion Medicine, Cell Therapeutics and Hemostaseology, Ludwig-Maximilian University Hospital, Munich, Germany [2] Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Georg-Speyer-Haus, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,2015/04/14 06:00,2015/04/14 06:01,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2014/11/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/08 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/14 06:01 [medline]']","['oncsis20156 [pii]', '10.1038/oncsis.2015.6 [doi]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2015 Apr 13;4:e146. doi: 10.1038/oncsis.2015.6.,20150413,PMC5399174,,,,,,['MR/M009157/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recruitment of adults into clinical trials has historically been low. OBJECTIVE: To survey adult cancer patients who reside in New York state to better understand their participation in and attitudes about clinical trials. METHODS: From January 2012-April 2013, we conducted a one-time survey about clinical trials in 8 cancer-treatment or cancer-patient support organizations in the state. Surveys were offered in person and online to adults with a past or current cancer diagnosis. Analysis was limited to adults who resided in the state and provided a self-reported status of previous participation in clinical trials. RESULTS: Of the 1,832 participants who completed the survey, 1,475 were included in the analysis. Our sample represented all regions of the state. Most of the respondents (68.1%) had never participated in a clinical trial. Almost 32% said they had never received information about research studies. Most (84%) felt that patients should be asked to participate in clinical trials, but fewer (70%) were willing to be approached about participation. LIMITATIONS: The sample is predominantly white and female and overrepresents breast and hematologic cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Increased outreach coupled with a team approach to educate and enroll patients in clinical trials may be the necessary first steps to increase participation in trials and ensure a diverse sample of participants.","['Crookes, Danielle M', 'Wang, Chang', 'DeMairo, Karen R', 'Killackey, Maureen', 'LePere, Jean C', 'McFarlane, Anita', 'Somayaji, Darryl', 'Allen, Patti', 'Bily, Linda', 'Brundage, Beth Ann', 'Canosa, Rosalie', 'Crean, Diana', 'Jandorf, Lina']","['Crookes DM', 'Wang C', 'DeMairo KR', 'Killackey M', 'LePere JC', 'McFarlane A', 'Somayaji D', 'Allen P', 'Bily L', 'Brundage BA', 'Canosa R', 'Crean D', 'Jandorf L']","['Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Hauppauge, New York, USA.', 'Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'The Greater New York City Affiliate of Susan G Komen for the Cure, New York, New York, USA.', 'Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York, USA.', 'American Cancer Society, Manasquan, New Jersey, USA.', 'Stony Brook Cancer Center, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York, New York, USA.', 'Bassett Cancer Institute, Cooperstown, New York, USA.', 'CancerCare, New York, New York, USA.', 'CR Wood Cancer Center at Glens Falls Hospital, Glens Falls, New York, USA.', 'Department of Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, USA.

We report an essential role for the trithorax group gene absent, small, or homeotic 1-like (Ash1l) at this developmental transition. Emergence and expansion of Ash1l-deficient fetal/neonatal HSCs were preserved; however, in young adult animals, HSCs were profoundly depleted. Ash1l-deficient adult HSCs had markedly decreased quiescence and reduced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1b/c (Cdkn1b/1c) expression and failed to establish long-term trilineage bone marrow hematopoiesis after transplantation to irradiated recipients. Wild-type HSCs could efficiently engraft when transferred to unirradiated, Ash1l-deficient recipients, indicating increased availability of functional HSC niches in these mice. Ash1l deficiency also decreased expression of multiple Hox genes in hematopoietic progenitors. Ash1l cooperated functionally with mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (Mll1), as combined loss of Ash1l and Mll1, but not isolated Ash1l or Mll1 deficiency, induced overt hematopoietic failure. Our results uncover a trithorax group gene network that controls quiescence, niche occupancy, and self-renewal potential in adult HSCs.","['Jones, Morgan', 'Chase, Jennifer', 'Brinkmeier, Michelle', 'Xu, Jing', 'Weinberg, Daniel N', 'Schira, Julien', 'Friedman, Ann', 'Malek, Sami', 'Grembecka, Jolanta', 'Cierpicki, Tomasz', 'Dou, Yali', 'Camper, Sally A', 'Maillard, Ivan']","['Jones M', 'Chase J', 'Brinkmeier M', 'Xu J', 'Weinberg DN', 'Schira J', 'Friedman A', 'Malek S', 'Grembecka J', 'Cierpicki T', 'Dou Y', 'Camper SA', 'Maillard I']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Men1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Ash1l protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'Bone Marrow failure syndromes']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic', 'Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Bone Marrow Diseases', 'Bone Marrow Failure Disorders', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Division/genetics', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Fluorouracil/toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/genetics/pathology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Liver/cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Liver Transplantation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Multipotent Stem Cells/cytology', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/deficiency/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/deficiency/physiology', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Stem Cell Niche']",2015/04/14 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2014/07/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['78124 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI78124 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2015 May;125(5):2007-20. doi: 10.1172/JCI78124.

A new misdirecting ""leukemogenic"" signaling network appears, composed by three types of participants which are encoded by (1) genes implicated in determined stages of T cell development but deregulated by translocations or mutations, (2) genes which normally do not participate in T cell development but are upregulated, and (3) nondifferentially expressed genes which become highly interconnected with genes expressed differentially. It appears that each of three groups may contain genes coding ion channels. In T cells, ion channels are implicated in regulation of cell cycle progression, differentiation, activation, migration, and cell death. In the present review we are going to reveal a relationship between different genetic defects, which drive the T cell neoplasias, with calcium signaling and ion channels. We suggest that changes in regulation of various ion channels in different types of the T leukemias may provide the intracellular ion microenvironment favorable to maintain self-renewal capacity, arrest differentiation, induce proliferation, and enhance motility.","['Dobrovinskaya, Oxana', 'Delgado-Enciso, Ivan', 'Quintero-Castro, Laura Johanna', 'Best-Aguilera, Carlos', 'Rojas-Sotelo, Rocio Monserrat', 'Pottosin, Igor']","['Dobrovinskaya O', 'Delgado-Enciso I', 'Quintero-Castro LJ', 'Best-Aguilera C', 'Rojas-Sotelo RM', 'Pottosin I']","['Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, 28045 Colima, COL, Mexico.', 'School of Medicine, University of Colima, 28045 Colima, COL, Mexico.', 'Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, 28045 Colima, COL, Mexico ; School of Medicine, University of Colima, 28045 Colima, COL, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Hematologia, Hospital General de Occidente, 45170 Guadalajara, JAL, Mexico.', 'Departamento de Hematologia, Hospital General de Occidente, 45170 Guadalajara, JAL, Mexico.', 'Center for Biomedical Research, University of Colima, 28045 Colima, COL, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,['0 (Ion Channels)'],IM,"['Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Ion Channels/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Thymocytes/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics']",2015/04/14 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2014/08/14 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/750203 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:750203. doi: 10.1155/2015/750203.

The drug was granted accelerated approval in October 2005 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) given the efficacy (induction of complete responses) noted in 2 single-arm trials (one in pediatric setting and one in adult patient population). The main spectra of toxicities that have been reported in these clinical trials and subsequent studies are hematological and neurological. Nelarabine induced rhabdomyolysis and increased creatinine phosphokinase (CK; CPK) levels apparently have been reported and this side effect has been added as an adverse reaction in the product monograph from the drug company during postmarketing surveillance. However, the true extent and incidence of the myotoxicity from the drug are unclear. In this paper we report a grade IV CK elevation and rhabdomyolysis in a patient with T-ALL treated with nelarabine.

IL-35, as a novel inhibitory cytokine, is produced by Tregs specially and regulates functions of Tregs in murine. However, IL-35 expression of Tregs in human is still disputed, and its role in AML is yet to be elucidated. In this study, we found that IL-35 was expressed highly in peripheral blood plasma of adult patients with AML and significantly correlated with the clinical stages of malignancy. Tregs-derived from adult AML patients produced IL-35 in a stimulation-dependent manner. IL-35 promoted AML blasts immune escape by expanding Tregs and inhibiting CD4+CD25-effector T cells (Teffs). Furthermore, IL-35 directly promoted the proliferation of AML blasts and reduced the apoptosis of AML blasts. Together, our study demonstrates that IL-35-derived from Tregs promotes the growth of adult AML blasts, suggesting that IL-35 has an important role in the pathogenesis of AML.","['Tao, Qianshan', 'Pan, Ying', 'Wang, Yiping', 'Wang, Huiping', 'Xiong, Shudao', 'Li, Qing', 'Wang, Jia', 'Tao, Lili', 'Wang, Zhitao', 'Wu, Fan', 'Zhang, Rui', 'Zhai, Zhimin']","['Tao Q', 'Pan Y', 'Wang Y', 'Wang H', 'Xiong S', 'Li Q', 'Wang J', 'Tao L', 'Wang Z', 'Wu F', 'Zhang R', 'Zhai Z']","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Centre of Transplantation and Renal Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, Sydney University, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Provincial Hospital affiliated to Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Fourth Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Hematology Research Center, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (interleukin-35, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Escape']",2015/04/14 06:00,2015/12/24 06:00,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/31 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ijc.29563 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2015 Nov 15;137(10):2384-93. doi: 10.1002/ijc.29563.

We describe the prescribing and the clinical and biological consequences of two such inhibitors, imatinib and erlotinib, in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in a practice setting over a period of more than 10 years. METHODS: All patients who received at least one TKI for chronic phase CML between 2001 and 2012 in our university hospital were included in the study. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Of the 139 patients, with a median age of 57 years, who were surveyed, imatinib and nilotinib were prescribed as the first TKI in 131 (94%) and 8 (6%) patients, respectively. With a median follow-up of 6 years, 342 treatment modifications were observed: 113 (33%) increased doses, 109 (32%) decreased doses, 89 (26%) TKI changes, 14 (4%) definitive discontinuations, 13 (4%) temporary discontinuations and 4 (1%) additions of IFN-alpha. The main reasons for the 342 treatment modifications were adverse events (n = 112, 33%), long-term optimal response (n = 58, 17%) and failure (n = 57, 17%). Eighty-five (61%), 31 (22%), 18 (13%) and 5 (4%) patients had no, 1, 2 and 3 TKI changes, respectively. Imatinib was the most prescribed TKI (75%). Adverse events resulting in treatment modifications occurred in 18% of patients for imatinib, 49% for nilotinib and 41% for dasatinib (P < 0.001). Median time to TKI change whatever the reason was >50 months (not achieved) for imatinib, 22 months for nilotinib and 27 months for dasatinib (log-rank test, P < 0.001). WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: Imatinib was the most prescribed TKI both in the first and in subsequent therapeutic lines for chronic phase CML. Our study showed a very good efficacy-safety profile for imatinib at a median follow-up of 6 years in an unselected French population.","['Lang, A-S', 'Mounier, M', 'Roques, M', 'Chretien, M L', 'Boulin, M']","['Lang AS', 'Mounier M', 'Roques M', 'Chretien ML', 'Boulin M']","['Pharmacy Department, University Hospital, Dijon, France.', 'Hematological Malignancies Registry, Burgundy University, Dijon, France.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital, Dijon, France.', 'Hematology Department, University Hospital, Dijon, France.', 'Pharmacy Department, University Hospital, Dijon, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pharm Ther,Journal of clinical pharmacy and therapeutics,8704308,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'DA87705X9K (Erlotinib Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Erlotinib Hydrochloride/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/14 06:00,2016/04/01 06:00,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2015/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jcpt.12273 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pharm Ther. 2015 Aug;40(4):391-7. doi: 10.1111/jcpt.12273.

The purpose of this study is to examine HSCT outcomes for patients with CML who failed TKI therapy or presented in advanced phase and to identify predictors of survival, relapse, and nonrelapse mortality (NRM). Fifty-one patients with CML underwent HSCT for advanced disease at diagnosis (n = 15), TKI resistance as defined by the European LeukemiaNet guidelines (n = 30), TKI intolerance (n = 2), or physician preference (n = 4). At a median follow-up of 71.9 months, the 8-year overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), relapse, and NRM were 68%, 46%, 41%, and 23%, respectively. In univariate analysis, predictors of OS included first chronic phase (CP1) disease status at HSCT (P = .0005), European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation score 1 to 4 (P = .04), and complete molecular response (CMR) to HSCT (P < .0001). Donor (female) to patient (male) gender combination (P = .02) and CMR to HSCT (P < .0001) predicted lower relapse. In multivariate analysis, CMR to HSCT remained an independent predictor of OS (odds ratio [OR], 43), EFS (OR, 56) and relapse (OR, 29). This report indicates that the outlook is excellent for those patients who remain in CP1 at the time of HSCT and achieve a CMR after HSCT. However, only approximately 50% of those in advanced phase at HSCT are long-term survivors. This highlights the ongoing need to try to identify patients earlier, before disease progression, who are destined to fail this treatment to optimize transplantation outcomes.","['Nair, Anish P', 'Barnett, Michael J', 'Broady, Raewyn C', 'Hogge, Donna E', 'Song, Kevin W', 'Toze, Cynthia L', 'Nantel, Stephen H', 'Power, Maryse M', 'Sutherland, Heather J', 'Nevill, Thomas J', 'Abou Mourad, Yasser', 'Narayanan, Sujaatha', 'Gerrie, Alina S', 'Forrest, Donna L']","['Nair AP', 'Barnett MJ', 'Broady RC', 'Hogge DE', 'Song KW', 'Toze CL', 'Nantel SH', 'Power MM', 'Sutherland HJ', 'Nevill TJ', 'Abou Mourad Y', 'Narayanan S', 'Gerrie AS', 'Forrest DL']","['Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Division of Hematology, Vancouver General Hospital, British Columbia Cancer Agency, and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

However, their therapeutic response seldom occurs without some evidence of hypersensitivity and other toxic side effects. l-Asparaginase is also of prospective use in food industry to reduce the formation of acrylamide in fried, roasted or baked food products. This review is an attempt to compile information on the properties of l-asparaginases obtained from different microorganisms. The complications involved with the therapeutic use of the currently available l-asparaginases, and the enzyme's potential application as a food processing aid to mitigate acrylamide formation have also been reviewed. Further, avenues for searching alternate sources of l-asparaginase have been discussed, highlighting the prospects of endophytic microorganisms as a possible source of l-asparaginases with varied biochemical and pharmacological properties.","['Krishnapura, Prajna Rao', 'Belur, Prasanna D', 'Subramanya, Sandeep']","['Krishnapura PR', 'Belur PD', 'Subramanya S']","['a Department of Chemical Engineering , National Institute of Technology Karnataka , Surathkal, Mangalore , Karnataka , India and.', 'a Department of Chemical Engineering , National Institute of Technology Karnataka , Surathkal, Mangalore , Karnataka , India and.', 'b Department of Physiology , United Arab Emirates University , Al Ain , United Arab Emirates.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Crit Rev Microbiol,Critical reviews in microbiology,8914274,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Asparaginase/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Bacteria/*enzymology/genetics', 'Bacterial Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Therapy', 'Humans']",2015/04/14 06:00,2017/01/20 06:00,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/1040841X.2015.1022505 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Rev Microbiol. 2016 Sep;42(5):720-37. doi: 10.3109/1040841X.2015.1022505.

Thrombin cleaved osteopontin (tcOPN) contains a cryptic binding site for alpha4 beta1 and alpha9 beta1 integrins. We have previously shown that hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) bind to tcOPN via this site resulting in a decrease in their proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, tcOPN and the factors required for its generation are important components of the HSC niche. Herein we show mature megakaryocytes (MM, >/=8N) contain FV, FX, and PT mRNA and protein. Furthermore, we show 8N, 16N, 32N, and 64N MM all release the required factors to enable thrombin cleavage of OPN. Importantly, mice devoid of the myeloproliferative leukemia protein (Mpl), c-Mpl(-/-) mice, contain only approximately 10% of normal megakaryocyte numbers, showed significantly reduced FX and tcOPN protein levels in endosteal bone marrow (BM). In addition, WT hematopoietic progenitors and HSC showed reduced homing to the BM of c-Mpl(-/-) mice. This is the first report identifying MM as a key cellular component in the production of tcOPN in situ, allowing the BM microenvironment to self regulate HSC biology via tcOPN.","['Storan, Melonie J', 'Heazlewood, Shen Y', 'Heazlewood, Chad K', 'Haylock, David N', 'Alexander, Warren S', 'Neaves, Rebecca J', 'Oteiza, Ana', 'Nilsson, Susan K']","['Storan MJ', 'Heazlewood SY', 'Heazlewood CK', 'Haylock DN', 'Alexander WS', 'Neaves RJ', 'Oteiza A', 'Nilsson SK']","['Manufacturing Flagship, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Manufacturing Flagship, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Manufacturing Flagship, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Manufacturing Flagship, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Cancer and Hematology Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Manufacturing Flagship, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Anatomy and Developmental Cell Biology, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Department of Medical Biology, University of Tromso, Tromso, Norway.', 'Manufacturing Flagship, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.', 'Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,"['106441-73-0 (Osteopontin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Movement', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Osteopontin/*metabolism', 'Stem Cell Niche', 'Thrombin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",2015/04/14 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/stem.2038 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2015 Jul;33(7):2351-7. doi: 10.1002/stem.2038.

Comprehension of the extent of protein acetylation has raised expectations that this alternate post-transcriptional modification will be shown to rival phosphorylation in its importance in mediating cellular responses. However, limited instances have been identified. Here we show that signalling from Toll-like or TNF-alpha receptors triggers the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK2) to activate histone acetyltransferase-1 (HAT1), which then acetylates the transcriptional regulator PLZF. Acetylation of PLZF promotes the assembly of a repressor complex incorporating HDAC3 and the NF-kappaB p50 subunit that limits the NF-kappaB response. Accordingly, diminishing the activity of CaMK2, the expression levels of PLZF or HAT1, or mutating key residues that are covalently modified in PLZF and HAT1, curtails control of the production of inflammatory cytokines. These results identify a central role for acetylation in controlling the inflammatory NF-kappaB transcriptional programme.","['Sadler, Anthony J', 'Suliman, Bandar A', 'Yu, Liang', 'Yuan, Xiangliang', 'Wang, Die', 'Irving, Aaron T', 'Sarvestani, Soroush T', 'Banerjee, Ashish', 'Mansell, Ashley S', 'Liu, Jun-Ping', 'Gerondakis, Steve', 'Williams, Bryan R G', 'Xu, Dakang']","['Sadler AJ', 'Suliman BA', 'Yu L', 'Yuan X', 'Wang D', 'Irving AT', 'Sarvestani ST', 'Banerjee A', 'Mansell AS', 'Liu JP', 'Gerondakis S', 'Williams BR', 'Xu D']","['1] Hudson Institute of Medical Research, 27-31 Wright Street, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia [2] Department of Molecular and Translational Science, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3168, Australia.', 'Hudson Institute of Medical Research, 27-31 Wright Street, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia.', '1] Hudson Institute of Medical Research, 27-31 Wright Street, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia [2] Department of Molecular and Translational Science, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3168, Australia.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Xin Hua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, 1665 Kongjiang Road, Shanghai 200092, China.', '1] Hudson Institute of Medical Research, 27-31 Wright Street, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia [2] Department of Molecular and Translational Science, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3168, Australia.', 'Hudson Institute of Medical Research, 27-31 Wright Street, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia.', 'Hudson Institute of Medical Research, 27-31 Wright Street, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia.', '1] Hudson Institute of Medical Research, 27-31 Wright Street, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia [2] Department of Molecular and Translational Science, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3168, Australia.', '1] Hudson Institute of Medical Research, 27-31 Wright Street, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia [2] Department of Molecular and Translational Science, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3168, Australia.', 'Institute of Ageing Research, Hangzhou Normal University School of Medicine, 1378 Wenyi Road West, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 311121, China.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, School of Biomedical Sciences, Monash University Clayton Campus, Wellington Road, Clayton, Victoria 3800, Australia.', '1] Hudson Institute of Medical Research, 27-31 Wright Street, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia [2] Department of Molecular and Translational Science, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3168, Australia.', '1] Hudson Institute of Medical Research, 27-31 Wright Street, Clayton, Victoria 3168, Australia [2] Department of Molecular and Translational Science, Monash University, Melbourne, Victoria 3168, Australia [3] Institute of Ageing Research, Hangzhou Normal University School of Medicine, 1378 Wenyi Road West, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 311121, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nat Commun,Nature communications,101528555,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Histone Acetyltransferases)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (histone acetyltransferase type B complex)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Camk2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (histone deacetylase 3)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2/genetics/immunology', 'Histone Acetyltransferases/*genetics/immunology', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/immunology', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Inflammation/chemically induced/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/deficiency/*genetics/immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'NF-kappa B/*genetics/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics/immunology', 'Signal Transduction', '*Transcription, Genetic']",2015/04/14 06:00,2016/01/09 06:00,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [medline]']","['ncomms7795 [pii]', '10.1038/ncomms7795 [doi]']",epublish,Nat Commun. 2015 Apr 13;6:6795. doi: 10.1038/ncomms7795.,20150413,,,,,['ORCID: 0000000201961570'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, metabolites that can promote tumorigeneis by altering the epigenome have been identified. These 'oncometabolites' include the tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites succinate and fumarate, whose levels are elevated in rare tumours with succinate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase mutations, respectively. 2-Hydroxyglutarate is another oncometabolite; it is produced de novo as a result of the mutation of isocitrate dehydrogenase, and is commonly found in gliomas and acute myeloid leukaemia. Interestingly, the structural similarity of these oncometabolites to their precursor metabolite, alpha-ketoglutarate, explains the tumorigenic potential of these metabolites, by competitive inhibition of a superfamily of enzymes called the alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases. These enzymes utilize alpha-ketoglutarate as a cosubstrate, and are involved in fatty acid metabolism, oxygen sensing, collagen biosynthesis, and modulation of the epigenome. They include enzymes that are involved in regulating gene expression via DNA and histone tail demethylation. In this review, we will focus on the link between metabolism and epigenetics, and how we may target oncometabolite-induced tumorigenesis in the future.","['Nowicki, Stefan', 'Gottlieb, Eyal']","['Nowicki S', 'Gottlieb E']","['Cancer Research UK, Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.', 'Cancer Research UK, Beatson Institute, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,FEBS J,The FEBS journal,101229646,,IM,"['Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/therapy']",2015/04/14 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2015/04/14 06:00'],"['2015/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/14 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/febs.13295 [doi]'],ppublish,FEBS J. 2015 Aug;282(15):2796-805. doi: 10.1111/febs.13295.

Belinostat (Bel, PXD101), a hydroxamate-type HDACi, has proved to be a promising cure in clinical trials for solid tumours and haematological malignancies. However, insight into molecular effects of Bel on APL, is still lacking. In this study, we investigated the effect of Bel alone and in combination with differentiation inducer retinoic acid (RA) on human promyelocytic leukaemia NB4 and HL-60 cells. We found that treatment with Bel, depending on the dosage used, inhibits cell proliferation, whereas in combination with RA enhances and accelerates granulocytic leukaemia cell differentiation. We also evaluated the effect of used treatments with Bel and RA on certain epigenetic modifiers (HDAC1, HDAC2, PCAF) as well as cell cycle regulators (p27) gene expression and protein level modulation. We showed that Bel in combination with RA up-regulates basal histone H4 hyperacetylation level more strongly compared to Bel or RA alone. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay indicated that Bel induces the accumulation of hyperacetylated histone H4 at the p27 promoter region. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that in control NB4 cells, hyperacetylated histone H4 is mainly found in association with proteins involved in DNA replication and transcription, whereas after Bel treatment it is found with proteins implicated in pro-apoptotic processes, in defence against oxidative stress and tumour suppression.

In this study, we investigated the effects of daucosterol on the survival of cultured cortical neurons after neurons were subjected to oxygen and glucose deprivation and simulated reperfusion (OGD/R)(2), and determined the corresponding molecular mechanism. The results showed that post-treatment of daucosterol significantly reduced neuronal loss, as well as apoptotic rate and caspase-3 activity, displaying the neuroprotective activity. We also found that daucosterol increased the expression level of IGF1 protein, diminished the down-regulation of p-AKT(3) and p-GSK-3beta(4), thus activating the AKT(5) signal pathway. Additionally, it diminished the down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1(6) and Bcl-2(7), and decreased the expression level of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax(8), thus raising the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax. The neuroprotective effect of daucosterol was inhibited in the presence of picropodophyllin (PPP)(9), the inhibitor of insulin-like growth factor I receptors (IGF1R)(10). Our study provided information about daucosterol as an efficient and inexpensive neuroprotectants, to which the IGF1-like activity of daucosterol contributes.

Serum albumin is the most abundant of the proteins in blood plasma and is the major transporter for delivering several drugs in vivo. The current study was designed to evaluate the potential ability of human and bovine serum albumin for delivering arsenic trioxide. Therefore, interaction of arsenic trioxide with HSA and BSA was investigated in aqueous solution at physiological conditions using a constant protein concentration and various drug contents. FTIR and UV-Vis spectroscopic methods were used to analyze arsenic trioxide and protein binding modes, the binding constants and the effect of drug complexation on HSA and BSA stability and conformation. Results of this study showed that drug complexation altered protein conformation by major reduction of alpha-helix and increase of turn structure which is indicative of a partial protein destabilization. Structural analysis revealed that arsenic trioxide bind HSA and BSA with overall binding constants of KATO-HSA=1.07 (+/-0.01)x10(4) M(-1) and KATO-BSA=1.27(+/-0.02)x10(4) M(-1). It could be concluded that serum albumins can be considered as good carriers for delivering arsenic trioxide to target tissue.","['Shooshtary, Sara', 'Behtash, Sima', 'Nafisi, Shohreh']","['Shooshtary S', 'Behtash S', 'Nafisi S']","['Department of Chemistry, IAU, Central Tehran Branch (IAUCTB), Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, IAU, Central Tehran Branch (IAUCTB), Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, IAU, Central Tehran Branch (IAUCTB), Tehran, Iran; Department of Dermatology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Our objective was to determine whether baseline differences in circulating immunologic and nonimmunologic biomarkers may help to identify patients more likely to respond to intramyocardial injection of CD34(+)-based SCT. METHODS AND RESULTS: We enrolled from January 3, 2011 to March 5, 2012 37 patients with longstanding DCM (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] <40%, New York Heart Association functional class III) who underwent peripheral CD34(+) stem cell mobilization with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and collection by means of apheresis. CD34(+) cells were labeled with (99m)Tc-hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime to allow assessment of stem cell retention at 18 hours. Response to SCT was predefined as an increase in LVEF of >/=5% at 3 months. The majority (84%) of patients were male with an overall mean LVEF of 27 +/- 7% and a median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) level of 2,774 pg/mL. Nineteen patients (51%) were responders to SCT. There was no significant difference between responders and nonresponders regarding to age, sex, baseline LVEF, NT-proBNP levels, or 6-minute walking distance. With the use of a partial least squares (PLS) predictive model, we identified 9 baseline factors that were associated with both stem cell response and stem cell retention (mechanistic validation). Among the baseline factors positively associated with both clinical response and stem cell retention were G-CSF, SDF-1, LIF, MCP-1, and MCP-3. Among baseline factors negatively associated with both clinical response and retention were IL-12p70, FASL, ICAM-1, and GGT. A decrease in G-CSF at 3-month follow-up was also observed in responders compared with nonresponders (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: If further validated, baseline immunologic and nonimmunologic biomarkers may help to identify patients with DCM who are more likely to respond to CD34(+)-based SCT.","['Haddad, Francois', 'Sever, Matjaz', 'Poglajen, Gregor', 'Lezaic, Luka', 'Yang, Philip', 'Maecker, Holden', 'Davis, Mark', 'Kuznetsova, Tatiana', 'Wu, Joseph C', 'Vrtovec, Bojan']","['Haddad F', 'Sever M', 'Poglajen G', 'Lezaic L', 'Yang P', 'Maecker H', 'Davis M', 'Kuznetsova T', 'Wu JC', 'Vrtovec B']","['Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford, California; Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation Center, University Medical Center, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Hematology, University Medical Center, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation Center, University Medical Center, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Medical Center, Ljubljana, Slovenia.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford, California.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford, California.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford, California.', 'Department of Cardiovascular Sciences, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford, California.', 'Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford Cardiovascular Institute, Stanford, California; Advanced Heart Failure and Transplantation Center, University Medical Center, Ljubljana, Slovenia.

For instance, the metabolic reaction involving XO and the pro-drug 6-mercaptopurine, a drug used in the treatment maintenance of acute lymphatic leukemia, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis, is often modified through the use of inhibitors, which varies the kinetic parameters associated with this reaction. Methods that provide fast and accurate determination of these kinetic constants can help in understanding the mechanism of these reactions. Herein, sequential and time-delayed electrokinetic injections of unpurified and unquenched samples containing xanthine oxidase, 6-mercaptopurine, and the inhibitor allopurinol are evaluated using capillary electrophoresis (CE). Using progress curve analysis, the Michaelis constant, apparent Michaelis constant, and inhibition constant are estimated to be 43.8 +/- 2.0 muM, 143.0 +/- 3.7 muM and 13.2 +/- 1.4 muM, respectively. In addition, a turnover number of 7.9 +/- 0.2 min(-1) is quantified. These values are consistent with some previously published values but were obtained without user intervention for reaction monitoring. This unique application of CE enzyme assays offers substantial advantages over traditional methods by determining kinetic parameters for enzymatic reactions with minimal (nL) sample volumes, short (<30 min) reaction analysis times, without any sample quenching or purification, and minimal user intervention.","['Lu, Grace', 'Goodman, Amanda M', 'Ayres, Brennan', 'Builta, Zac', 'Haes, Amanda J']","['Lu G', 'Goodman AM', 'Ayres B', 'Builta Z', 'Haes AJ']","['University of Iowa, Department of Chemistry, 204 IATL, Iowa City, IA 52242, United States.', 'University of Iowa, Department of Chemistry, 204 IATL, Iowa City, IA 52242, United States; Rice University, Department of Chemistry, 6100 Main Street, Houston, TX 77005, United States.', 'University of Iowa, Department of Chemistry, 204 IATL, Iowa City, IA 52242, United States.', 'University of Iowa, Department of Chemistry, 204 IATL, Iowa City, IA 52242, United States.', 'University of Iowa, Department of Chemistry, 204 IATL, Iowa City, IA 52242, United States.

It is hypothesized that antioxidants would reduce, whereas pro-oxidants would enhance, cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Molt-4 human leukemia cells were incubated with vitamins C, E, D3, dexamethasone, or hydrogen peroxide alone or in combination with dihydroartemisinin (DHA). Concentrations of these compounds studied were similar to those achievable by oral administration. Viable cell counts were performed before (0 h) and at, 24 and 48 h after treatment. RESULTS: Vitamin C, vitamin D3, dexamethasone, and H2O2 caused significant Molt-4 cell death. Vitamin E caused an increase in Molt-4 cell growth. Vitamin C and vitamin D3 significantly interacted with DHA at the 48-h time point and with H2O2 at both 24-h and 48-h time points. CONCLUSION: Cellular oxidative status could alter the potency of artemisinin in killing cancer cells.","['Gerhardt, Thomas', 'Jones, Ross', 'Park, Jungsoo', 'Lu, Rui', 'Chan, Ho Wing', 'Fang, Qingxi', 'Singh, Narendra', 'Lai, Henry']","['Gerhardt T', 'Jones R', 'Park J', 'Lu R', 'Chan HW', 'Fang Q', 'Singh N', 'Lai H']","['Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, U.S.A.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, U.S.A. narendra@u.washington.edu.', 'Department of Bioengineering, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, U.S.A.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Artemisinins)', '0 (Chromans)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '6A9O50735X (artenimol)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'S18UL9710X (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid)']",IM,"['Antioxidants/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Artemisinins/*administration & dosage', 'Ascorbic Acid/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cholecalciferol/administration & dosage', 'Chromans/administration & dosage', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism']",2015/04/12 06:00,2015/10/01 06:00,['2015/04/12 06:00'],"['2015/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/01 06:00 [medline]']",['35/4/1867 [pii]'],ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2015 Apr;35(4):1867-71.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['Artemisinin', 'Molt-4 cells', 'Trolox', 'dexamethasone', 'hydrogen peroxide', 'sodium ascorbate', 'vitamin D3']","['Copyright(c) 2015 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.', 'Delinassios), All rights reserved.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Binding of Ag to the BCR induces phosphorylation of immune receptor tyrosine-based activation motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of the CD79a and CD79b signaling subunits, which subsequently bind and activate the Syk protein tyrosine kinase. Earlier work with the DT40 chicken B cell leukemia cell line showed that Syk was required to transduce BCR signals to proximal activation events, suggesting that Syk also plays an important role in the activation and differentiation of primary B cells during an immune response. In this study, we show that Syk-deficient primary mouse B cells have a severe defect in BCR-induced activation, proliferation, and survival. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Syk is required for both T-dependent and T-independent Ab responses, and that this requirement is B cell intrinsic. In the absence of Syk, Ag fails to induce differentiation of naive B cells into germinal center B cells and plasma cells. Finally, we show that the survival of existing memory B cells is dependent on Syk. These experiments demonstrate that Syk plays a critical role in multiple aspects of B cell Ab responses.","['Ackermann, Jochen A', 'Nys, Josquin', 'Schweighoffer, Edina', 'McCleary, Scott', 'Smithers, Nicholas', 'Tybulewicz, Victor L J']","['Ackermann JA', 'Nys J', 'Schweighoffer E', 'McCleary S', 'Smithers N', 'Tybulewicz VL']","['Division of Immune Cell Biology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom; and.', 'Division of Immune Cell Biology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom; and.', 'Division of Immune Cell Biology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom; and.', 'Immuno-Inflammation Therapy Area Unit, GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage SG1 2NY, United Kingdom.', 'Immuno-Inflammation Therapy Area Unit, GlaxoSmithKline, Stevenage SG1 2NY, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Immune Cell Biology, MRC National Institute for Medical Research, London NW7 1AA, United Kingdom; and Victor.T@crick.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Survival/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Immunologic Memory/*immunology', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*immunology', 'Syk Kinase']",2015/04/12 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2015/04/12 06:00'],"['2015/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1500461 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1500461 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 May 15;194(10):4650-6. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1500461.

Its relevance in cancer is rapidly emerging as demonstrated by spliceosome mutations that determine the prognosis of patients with hematologic malignancies. We report studies using FD-895 and pladienolide-B in primary leukemia cells derived from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and leukemia-lymphoma cell lines. We found that FD-895 and pladienolide-B induce an early pattern of mRNA intron retention - spliceosome modulation. This process was associated with apoptosis preferentially in cancer cells as compared to normal lymphocytes. The pro-apoptotic activity of these compounds was observed regardless of poor prognostic factors such as Del(17p), TP53 or SF3B1 mutations and was able to overcome the protective effect of culture conditions that resemble the tumor microenvironment. In addition, the activity of these compounds was observed not only in vitro but also in vivo using the A20 lymphoma murine model. Overall, these findings give evidence for the first time that spliceosome modulation is a valid target in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and provide an additional rationale for the development of spliceosome modulators for cancer therapy.","['Kashyap, Manoj K', 'Kumar, Deepak', 'Villa, Reymundo', 'La Clair, James J', 'Benner, Chris', 'Sasik, Roman', 'Jones, Harrison', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Burkart, Michael D', 'Castro, Januario E']","['Kashyap MK', 'Kumar D', 'Villa R', 'La Clair JJ', 'Benner C', 'Sasik R', 'Jones H', 'Ghia EM', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Burkart MD', 'Castro JE']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Integrative Genomics and Bioinformatics Core, Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Center for Computational Biology, Institute for Genomic Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA CLL Research Consortium, and Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA CLL Research Consortium, and Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA CLL Research Consortium, and Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA, USA jecastro@ucsd.edu mburkart@ucsd.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '0 (FD 895)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Splicing Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear)', '0 (SF3B1 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (pladienolide B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epoxy Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Macrolides/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mutation', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing/drug effects', 'RNA Splicing Factors', 'RNA, Messenger/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoprotein, U2 Small Nuclear/genetics/metabolism', 'Spliceosomes/*drug effects', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/04/12 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/04/12 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.122069 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.122069 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Jul;100(7):945-54. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.122069.

To test whether the increased sensitivity of next-generation sequencing (NGS)-MRD better identifies pre- and post-HCT relapse risk, we performed immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) variable, diversity, and joining (V[D]J) DNA sequences J NGS-MRD on 56 patients with B-cell ALL enrolled in Children's Oncology Group trial ASCT0431. NGS-MRD predicted relapse and survival more accurately than MFC-MRD (P < .0001), especially in the MRD negative cohort (relapse, 0% vs 16%; P = .02; 2-year overall survival, 96% vs 77%; P = .003). Post-HCT NGS-MRD detection was better at predicting relapse than MFC-MRD (P < .0001), especially early after HCT (day 30 MFC-MRD positive relapse rate, 35%; NGS-MRD positive relapse rate, 67%; P = .004). Any post-HCT NGS positivity resulted in an increase in relapse risk by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 7.7; P = .05). Absence of detectable IgH-V(D)J NGS-MRD pre-HCT defines good-risk patients potentially eligible for less intense treatment approaches. Post-HCT NGS-MRD is highly predictive of relapse and survival, suggesting a role for this technique in defining patients early who would be eligible for post-HCT interventions.

METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of patients treated with IV or IM PEG-ASP at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada, from March 1, 2010 to January 1, 2012. The incidence and severity of allergic reactions attributed to PEG-ASP were documented. Patient age, sex, route of PEG-ASP administration, disease (risk group and lineage) and mean time interval between PEG-ASP doses were evaluated as possible risk factors for allergic reaction. RESULTS: A total of 109 patients were included. There were 14 (35 %) allergic reactions among 40 patients who received IV, compared with eight (12 %) of the 69 who received IM [odds ratio (OR) 4.11, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.54-10.97, p = 0.005]. In multivariable logistic regression adjusting for disease risk group, route (IV vs. IM) remained independently significant (p = 0.011). Patients with standard-risk ALL had a lower risk of experiencing an allergic reaction associated with PEG-ASP compared with patients in high-risk disease risk groups (collectively referred to as ""other""; 11 vs. 31 %, OR 3.36, 95 % CI 1.16-9.72, p = 0.025). CONCLUSIONS: IV PEG-ASP is associated with a significantly higher rate of allergic reactions than IM. The clinical preference for IV PEG-ASP may warrant re-evaluation.","['Abbott, Lesleigh S', 'Zakova, Maria', 'Shaikh, Furqan', 'Shewaramani, Nisha', 'Punnett, Angela', 'Dupuis, L Lee']","['Abbott LS', 'Zakova M', 'Shaikh F', 'Shewaramani N', 'Punnett A', 'Dupuis LL']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, The Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Avenue, Toronto, M5G X8, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Paediatr Drugs,Paediatric drugs,100883685,"['3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Adolescent', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Canada', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Hypersensitivity/*etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Male', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2015/04/12 06:00,2016/02/13 06:00,['2015/04/12 06:00'],"['2015/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40272-015-0129-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Paediatr Drugs. 2015 Aug;17(4):315-21. doi: 10.1007/s40272-015-0129-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although low-intensity fludarabine-based preparative regimens without radiation confer excellent outcomes in FA HSCTs with HLA-matched sibling donors, outcomes for FA patients with alternative donors are less encouraging, albeit improving. We present our experience with 17 FA patients who completed mismatched related or unrelated donor HSCT using a non-radiation fludarabine-based preparative regimen at Charite University Medicine Berlin. All patients engrafted; however, one patient had unstable chimerism in the setting of multi-viral infections that necessitated a stem cell boost to revert to full donor chimerism. Forty-seven percent of patients developed grade I acute graft-verus-host disease (aGVHD). No grade II-IV aGVHD or chronic graft-versus-host disease of any severity occurred. At a median follow-up of 30 months, 88 % of patients are alive with normal hematopoiesis. Two patients died of infections 4 months post-transplantation. These results demonstrate that short-term outcomes for FA patients with mismatched and unrelated donor HSCTs can be excellent using chemotherapy only conditioning. Viral reactivation, however, was a major treatment-related complication.","['Chao, M M', 'Kuehl, J S', 'Strauss, G', 'Hanenberg, H', 'Schindler, D', 'Neitzel, H', 'Niemeyer, C', 'Baumann, I', 'von Bernuth, H', 'Rascon, J', 'Nagy, M', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Kratz, C P', 'Ebell, W']","['Chao MM', 'Kuehl JS', 'Strauss G', 'Hanenberg H', 'Schindler D', 'Neitzel H', 'Niemeyer C', 'Baumann I', 'von Bernuth H', 'Rascon J', 'Nagy M', 'Zimmermann M', 'Kratz CP', 'Ebell W']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Carl-Neuberg Strasse 1, 30625, Hannover, Germany, chao.mwe@mh-hannover.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fanconi Anemia/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods/trends', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Treatment Outcome', '*Unrelated Donors', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/12 06:00,2015/09/10 06:00,['2015/04/12 06:00'],"['2014/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-015-2370-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Aug;94(8):1311-8. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2370-7.

Antibodies that block the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction are perhaps the most prominent of these new anti-cancer therapies, but several other inhibitory receptor ligand interactions have also shown promise as targets in clinical trials, including CTLA-4/CD80 and Lag-3/MHC class II. Related to this is a rapidly improving knowledge of 'regulatory' lymphocyte lineages, including NKT cells, MAIT cells, B regulatory cells and others. These cells have potent cytokine responses that can influence the functioning of other immune cells and many researchers believe that they could be effective targets for therapies designed to enhance immune responses to cancer. This review will outline our current understanding of FOXP3+ 'Tregs', NKT cells, MAIT cells and B regulatory cells immune regulatory cell populations in cancer, with a particular focus on chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL).

This study aimed to investigate the apoptosis inducing effects of E. scaber and the underlying mechanisms in HCT116 colorectal cell line. METHODS: The MTT assay was used to determine the IC50 values on cancer cell lines by the ethanol, hexane, ethyl acetate and water fractions. Apoptosis was detected by cell morphologic observation through Hoechst 33342/PI dual staining, phosphatidylserine externalization by Annexin V/PI staining and DNA fragmentation by TUNEL assay. The caspase activity, Bcl-2 family and p53 proteins were determined by flow cytometric analysis. The cleaved PARP protein expression was assessed by western blot analysis RESULTS: The ethanol extract of E. scaber and its fractions significantly inhibited the growth of HCT116 and HT-29 cells and induced apoptosis. The E. scaber ethyl acetate fraction (ESEAF) was the most potent on HCT116 cell line with the IC50 value of 1.42 +/- 0.10 microg/mL. The induction of apoptosis was marked by nuclear shrinkage accompanied with chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and phosphatidylserine externalization. The results showed that ESEAF-induced apoptosis was associated with an upregulation of proapoptotic Bax, elevation of Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, activation of caspase-3 and cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). In addition, a compromised mitochondrial membrane potential and overproduction of ROS demonstrated the involvement of the mitochondrial signaling pathway. Mechanistic studies further revealed that ESEAF caused the augmentation of the intracellular ROS, subsequently incited the increase in p53 protein expression and led to oligomerization of Bax, depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and caspases cascade (caspase-3/7 and -9) in a time-dependent manner. The attenuation of intracellular ROS level by N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) preserved the integrity of mitochondrial membrane and rescued the cells from cell death. Furthermore, caspase cascade results in the cleavage of PARP which ultimately activated DNA fragmentation and eventually apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Taken together, cumulative evidences in this study suggest that ESEAF induces apoptosis through ROS-dependent mitochondrial signaling pathway and holds potential therapeutic effect for colorectal cancer.","['Chan, Chim Kei', 'Supriady, Hadi', 'Goh, Bey Hing', 'Kadir, Habsah Abdul']","['Chan CK', 'Supriady H', 'Goh BH', 'Kadir HA']","['Biomolecular Research Group, Biochemistry Program, Institute of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, 50603 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Biomolecular Research Group, Biochemistry Program, Institute of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, 50603 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Monash University Malaysia, Jalan Lagoon Selatan, Bandar Sunway, 46150 Selangor, Malaysia.', 'Biomolecular Research Group, Biochemistry Program, Institute of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, University of Malaya, 50603 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.

Approximately one-third of patients with MDS will progress to sAML within a few months to a few years, and this type of transformation is more common and rapid in patients with high-risk MDS (HR-MDS). However, the precise mechanisms underlying the evolution of MDS to sAML remain unclear. Currently, chemotherapy for sAML has minimal efficacy. The only method of curing patients with sAML is allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (Allo-HSCT). Unfortunately, only a few patients are appropriate for transplantation because this disease primarily affects older adult patients. Additionally, compared to de novo AML, sAML is more difficult to cure, and the prognosis is often worse. Therefore, it is important to clarify the molecular mechanisms of the progression of MDS to sAML and to explore the potent drugs for clinical use. This review will highlight several molecular mechanisms of the progression of MDS to sAML and new therapeutic strategies of this disease.","['Dan, Chunli', 'Chi, Jianxiang', 'Wang, Li']","['Dan C', 'Chi J', 'Wang L']","['Department of Haematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University , Chongqing , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Ann Med,Annals of medicine,8906388,,IM,"['Animals', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology/*therapy', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology/*therapy']",2015/04/12 06:00,2016/02/13 06:00,['2015/04/12 06:00'],"['2015/04/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/07853890.2015.1009156 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Med. 2015 May;47(3):209-17. doi: 10.3109/07853890.2015.1009156.

Although patients with t(8;21) translocation have good prognosis, 5-year survival is observed only in 50% of the cases. AML1-ETO translocation is usually accompanied by overexpression of mutant C-Kit, a tyrosine kinase, which contributes to uncontrolled proliferation of premature blood cells leading to relapse and poor prognosis. We illustrate the potential use of esculetin on leukemic cell line, Kasumi-1, bearing t(8;21) translocation and mutated C-Kit gene. Esculetin decreases the expression of AML1-ETO at both protein and transcript level within 24 hours of treatment. Half-life of AML1-ETO mRNA was reduced from 7 hours to 1.5 hours. Similarly half-life of C-Kit mRNA was reduced to 2 hours from 5 hours in esculetin treated cells. Esculetin also perturbed the expression of ectopically expressed AML1-ETO in U937 cells. The decreased expression of AML1-ETO chimeric gene was associated with increased expression of LAT1 and RUNX3 genes, targets of AML1. We envisage that discovery of a drug candidate which could target both these mutated genes would be a considerable breakthrough for future application.","['Sawney, Sharad', 'Arora, Rashi', 'Aggarwal, Kamal K', 'Saluja, Daman']","['Sawney S', 'Arora R', 'Aggarwal KK', 'Saluja D']","['University School of Biotechnology, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Sector 16-C, Dwarka, New Delhi 110078, India ; Dr. B.R.

Furthermore, we aimed to study the correlation between the cytogenetic molecular abnormalities and the immediate clinical outcome (induction of remission). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study conducted over a period of 2 years (May 2011 to May 2013) in a tertiary care hospital in India. Forty pediatric (1-19 years) patients (18 males, 22 females; M: F = 0.8 : 1) with newly diagnosed ALL were studied for molecular cytogenetic analysis. Written consent was obtained from the parents of the patients. Bone marrow aspiration was done for making the diagnosis of ALL. Children lost to follow-up and who failed to give consent were excluded from the survey. Host factors and clinical parameters were obtained from patients. RESULTS: Bone marrow aspirate samples of 40 diagnosed cases of ALL were subjected to routine cytogenetic analysis, and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique was used for molecular analysis. Well-spread metaphase plates were obtained in 18/40 (45%) cases for analysis. RT-PCR revealed abnormal genes in 20/40 (50%) patients. The results of molecular cytogenetic analysis were correlated with patients' clinical and hematological parameters for risk stratification and immediate outcome (induction of remission). Eighteen out of 40 (45%) cases revealed no abnormality. Among the remaining 22 cases, 8 had TEL-AML1 (20%), 6 had BCR-ABL (15%), 4 had MLL-AF4 (10%), 2 had E2A-PBX1 (5%) fusion genes, and 2 had hyperdiploidy. To conclude, a higher proportion of cases in this study showed adverse translocations such as t (9;22), t (4;11), and t (1;19) compared to that reported in literature. CONCLUSION: RT-PCR assay was useful in detecting the prognostically significant oncogene fusion transcripts. In our study of 40 patients, we found that the pattern and frequency differ from those reported in Western literature. Our study reveals a lower frequency of hyperdiploidy (5%) and a higher frequency of BCR-ABL gene fusion (20%) in childhood ALL. Above all, in contrast to previous studies on childhood ALL, our study showed female predominance, with the male-to-female ratio being 0.8 : 1. Apart from the BCR-ABL fusion gene, none other was associated with poor prognosis. It is already well established that the characterization of the genetic entities at diagnosis is crucial for the understanding and the optimal treatment of ALL. Because the aberrations in our population differ significantly from those reported in Western populations, we may be required to tailor our protocols.","['Pandita, Aakash', 'Harish, Rekha', 'Digra, Sanjeev K', 'Raina, Alok', 'Sharma, Annie Arvind', 'Koul, Ashwani']","['Pandita A', 'Harish R', 'Digra SK', 'Raina A', 'Sharma AA', 'Koul A']","['Department of Paediatrics, Government Medical College, Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Government Medical College, Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Government Medical College, Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Government Medical College, Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Government Medical College, Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Government Medical College, Jammu, Jammu and Kashmir, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Med Insights Oncol,Clinical Medicine Insights.

The huge number of gene expression values generated by microarray technology leads to complex data sets and similarity measures for high-dimensional data are problematic. Hence, gene expression similarity measurements require numerous machine-learning and data-mining techniques, such as feature selection and dimensionality reduction, to be incorporated into the retrieval process. METHODS: This article proposes a case-based retrieval framework that uses a k-nearest-neighbor classifier with a weighted-feature-based similarity to retrieve previously treated patients based on their gene expression profiles. RESULTS: The herein-proposed methodology is validated on several data sets: a childhood leukemia data set collected from The Children's Hospital at Westmead, as well as the Colon cancer, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the Prostate cancer data sets. Results obtained by the proposed framework in retrieving patients of the data sets who are similar to new patients are as follows: 96% accuracy on the childhood leukemia data set, 95% on the NCI data set, 93% on the Colon cancer data set, and 98% on the Prostate cancer data set. CONCLUSION: The designed case-based retrieval framework is an appropriate choice for retrieving previous patients who are similar to a new patient, on the basis of their gene expression data, for better diagnosis and treatment of childhood leukemia. Moreover, this framework can be applied to other gene expression data sets using some or all of its steps.","['Anaissi, Ali', 'Goyal, Madhu', 'Catchpoole, Daniel R', 'Braytee, Ali', 'Kennedy, Paul J']","['Anaissi A', 'Goyal M', 'Catchpoole DR', 'Braytee A', 'Kennedy PJ']","['Center for Quantum Computation and Intelligent Systems, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Broadway, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Center for Quantum Computation and Intelligent Systems, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Broadway, New South Wales, Australia.', ""The Tumour Bank, Children's Cancer Research Unit, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia."", 'Center for Quantum Computation and Intelligent Systems, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Broadway, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Center for Quantum Computation and Intelligent Systems, Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology, University of Technology Sydney, Broadway, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Inform,Cancer informatics,101258149,,,,2015/04/11 06:00,2015/04/11 06:01,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/11 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4137/CIN.S22371 [doi]', 'cin-14-2015-021 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Inform. 2015 Mar 19;14:21-31. doi: 10.4137/CIN.S22371. eCollection 2015.,20150319,PMC4368049,['NOTNLM'],"['case base reasoning', 'data mining', 'dimensionality reduction', 'feature weighting', 'gene expression', 'machine learning']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to identify distinct biological and prognostic subgroups based on mutations of ASXL1, RUNX1, DNMT3A, NPM1, FLT3 and TP53 in 125 AML-MRC patients according to the presence of MLD, cytogenetics and outcome. ASXL1 mutations (n=26, 21%) were associated with a higher proportion of marrow dysgranulopoiesis (mutant vs. wild-type: 75% vs. 55%, p=0.030) and were mostly found in intermediate cytogenetic AML (23/26) in which they predicted inferior 2-year overall survival (OS, mutant vs. wild-type: 14% vs. 37%, p=0.030). TP53 mutations (n=28, 22%) were mostly found in complex karyotype AML (26/28) and predicted poor outcome within unfavorable cytogenetic risk AML (mutant vs. wild-type: 9% vs. 40%, p=0.040). In multivariate analysis, the presence of either ASXL1 or TP53 mutation was the only independent factor associated with shorter OS (HR, 95%CI: 2.53, 1.40-4.60, p=0.002) while MLD, MDS-related cytogenetics and previous MDS history did not influence OS. We conclude that ASXL1 and TP53 mutations identify two molecular subgroups among AML-MRCs, with specific poor prognosis. This could be useful for future diagnostic and prognostic classifications.","['Devillier, Raynier', 'Mansat-De Mas, Veronique', 'Gelsi-Boyer, Veronique', 'Demur, Cecile', 'Murati, Anne', 'Corre, Jill', 'Prebet, Thomas', 'Bertoli, Sarah', 'Brecqueville, Mandy', 'Arnoulet, Christine', 'Recher, Christian', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Mozziconacci, Marie-Joelle', 'Delabesse, Eric', 'Birnbaum, Daniel']","['Devillier R', 'Mansat-De Mas V', 'Gelsi-Boyer V', 'Demur C', 'Murati A', 'Corre J', 'Prebet T', 'Bertoli S', 'Brecqueville M', 'Arnoulet C', 'Recher C', 'Vey N', 'Mozziconacci MJ', 'Delabesse E', 'Birnbaum D']","['Hematology Department, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Institut Paoli-Calmettes, UMR1068 Inserm, Marseille, France."", 'Hematology Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Institut Paoli-Calmettes, UMR1068 Inserm, Marseille, France."", 'Biopathology Department, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Institut Paoli-Calmettes, UMR1068 Inserm, Marseille, France."", 'Biopathology Department, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Institut Paoli-Calmettes, UMR1068 Inserm, Marseille, France."", 'Hematology Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Institut Paoli-Calmettes, UMR1068 Inserm, Marseille, France."", 'Biopathology Department, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Toulouse University, Toulouse, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Institut Paoli-Calmettes, UMR1068 Inserm, Marseille, France."", ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Institut Paoli-Calmettes, UMR1068 Inserm, Marseille, France."", 'Biopathology Department, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Marseille, France.', 'Hematology Department, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse-Oncopole, Toulouse, France.', 'Toulouse University, Toulouse, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Moleculaire, Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Institut Paoli-Calmettes, UMR1068 Inserm, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics/metabolism', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/11 06:00,2016/05/21 06:00,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2014/09/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/21 06:00 [medline]']","['3460 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3460 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Apr 10;6(10):8388-96. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3460.,,PMC4480760,['NOTNLM'],"['ASXL1', 'TP53', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'mutational status', 'myelodysplasia-related changes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Comprehensive assessment of the role of these compounds expands beyond the cellular biology of lipids and includes rapid and unambiguous measurement in cells and tissues. Here we describe a sensitive and simple liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for quantitative analysis of the most abundant among these phosphoinositide derivatives in mammalian cells, the glycerophosphoinositol (GroPIns). The method has been developed in mouse Raw 264.7 macrophages with limits of quantitation at 3 ng/ml. Validation on the same cell line showed excellent response in terms of linear dynamic range (from 3 to 3,000 ng/ml), intra-day and inter-day precision (coefficient of variation </= 7.10%) and accuracy (between 98.1 and 109.0%) in the range 10-320 ng/ml. As proof of concept, a simplified analytical platform based on this method and external calibration was also tested on four stimulated and unstimulated cell lines, including Raw 264.7 macrophages, Jurkat T-cells, A375MM melanoma cells and rat basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cells. The results indicate a wide variation in GroPIns levels among different cell lines and stimulation conditions, although the measurements were always in line with the literature. No significant matrix effects were observed thus indicating that the here proposed method can be of general use for similar determinations in cells of different origin.","['Grauso, Laura', 'Mariggio, Stefania', 'Corda, Daniela', 'Fontana, Angelo', 'Cutignano, Adele']","['Grauso L', 'Mariggio S', 'Corda D', 'Fontana A', 'Cutignano A']","['Istituto di Chimica Biomolecolare, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, via Campi Flegrei 34, 80078 Pozzuoli, Napoli, Italy.', 'Istituto di Biochimica delle Proteine, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, via Pietro Castellino 111, 80131 Napoli, Italy.', 'Istituto di Biochimica delle Proteine, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, via Pietro Castellino 111, 80131 Napoli, Italy.', 'Istituto di Chimica Biomolecolare, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, via Campi Flegrei 34, 80078 Pozzuoli, Napoli, Italy.', 'Istituto di Chimica Biomolecolare, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, via Campi Flegrei 34, 80078 Pozzuoli, Napoli, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '16824-65-0 (glycerylphosphoinositol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/*chemistry', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry/*methods/standards']",2015/04/11 06:00,2015/12/24 06:00,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0123198 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-46445 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 10;10(4):e0123198. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0123198. eCollection 2015.,20150410,PMC4393254,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cause of the disease is unknown. We recently identified a retrotransposon, Steamer, that is highly expressed and amplified to high copy number in neoplastic cells of soft-shell clams (Mya arenaria). Through analysis of Steamer integration sites, mitochondrial DNA single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and polymorphic microsatellite alleles, we show that the genotypes of neoplastic cells do not match those of the host animal. Instead, neoplastic cells from dispersed locations in New York, Maine, and Prince Edward Island (PEI), Canada, all have nearly identical genotypes that differ from those of the host. These results indicate that the cancer is spreading between animals in the marine environment as a clonal transmissible cell derived from a single original clam.

The prognosis of myelofibrosis is poor and treatment is mainly palliative. Janus kinase inhibitors are a novel strategy to treat people with myelofibrosis. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical benefits and harms of Janus kinase-1 and Janus kinase-2 inhibitors for treating myelofibrosis secondary to hematological or non-hematological conditions. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, the Cochrane Library 2014, Issue 11), Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946 to 13 November 2014), EMBASE (from 1980 to 12 January 2013), and LILACS (from 1982 to 20 November 2014). We searched WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and The metaRegister of Controlled Trials. We also searched for conference proceedings of the American Society of Hematology (from 2009 to October 2013), European Hematology Association (from 2009 to October 2013), American Society of Clinical Oncology (from 2009 to October 2013), and European Society of Medical Oncology (from 2009 to October 2013). We included searches in FDA, European Medicines Agency, and Epistemonikos. We handsearched the references of all identified included trials, and relevant review articles. We did not apply any language restrictions. Two review authors independently screened search results. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized clinical trials comparing Janus kinase-1 and Janus kinase-2 inhibitors with placebo or other treatments. Both previously treated and treatment naive patients were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for overall survival, progression-free survival and leukemia-free survival, risk ratio (RR) and 95% CI for reduction in spleen size and adverse events binary data, and standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% CI for continuous data (health-related quality of life). Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included trials. Primary outcomes were overall survival, progression-free survival and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included two trials involving 528 participants, comparing ruxolitinib with placebo or best available therapy (BAT). As the two included trials had different comparators we did not pool the data. The confidence in the results estimates of these trials was low due to the bias in their design, and their limited sample sizes that resulted in imprecise results.There is low quality evidence for the effect of ruxolitinib on survival when compared with placebo at 51 weeks of follow-up (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.98) and compared with BAT at 48 weeks of follow-up (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.20 to 2.47). Similarly there was very low quality evidence for the effect of ruxolitinib on progression free survival compared with BAT (HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.39).There is low quality evidence for the effect of ruxolitinib in terms of quality of life. Compared with placebo, the drug achieved a greater proportion of patients with a significant reduction of symptom scores (RR 8.82, 95% CI 4.40 to 17.69), and treated patients with ruxolitinib obtained greater MFSAF scores at the end of follow-up (MD -87.90, 95% CI -139.58 to -36.22). An additional trial showed significant differences in EORTC QLQ-C30 scores when compared ruxolitinib with best available therapy (MD 7.60, 95% CI 0.35 to 14.85).The effect of ruxolitinib on reduction in the spleen size of participants compared with placebo or BAT was uncertain (versus placebo: RR 64.58, 95% CI 9.08 to 459.56, low quality evidence; versus BAT: RR 41.78, 95% CI 2.61 to 669.75, low quality evidence).There is low quality evidence for the effect of the drug compared with placebo on anemia (RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.62 to 3.41), neutropenia (RR 3.57, 95% CI 1.02 to 12.55) and thrombocytopenia (RR 9.74, 95% CI 2.32 to 40.96). Ruxolitinib did not result in differences versus BAT in the risk of anemia (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.99, low quality evidence) or thrombocytopenia (RR 1.20; 95% CI 0.44 to 3.28, low quality evidence). The risk of non-hematologic grade 3 or 4 adverse events (including fatigue, arthralgia, nausea, diarrhea, extremity pain and pyrexia) was similar when ruxolitinib was compared with placebo or BAT. The rate of neutropenia comparing ruxolitinib with standard medical treatment was not reported by the trial. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is insufficient evidence to allow any conclusions regarding the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib for treating myelofibrosis. The findings of this Cochrane review should be interpreted with caution as they are based on trials sponsored by industry, and include a small number of patients. Unless powered randomized clinical trials provide strong evidence of a treatment effect, and the trade-off between potential benefits and harms is established, clinicians should be cautious when administering ruxolitinib for treating patients with myelofibrosis.","['Marti-Carvajal, Arturo J', 'Anand, Vidhu', 'Sola, Ivan']","['Marti-Carvajal AJ', 'Anand V', 'Sola I']","['Iberoamerican Cochrane Network, Valencia, Venezuela.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",England,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,100909747,"['0 (Nitriles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '82S8X8XX8H (ruxolitinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Janus Kinase 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Nitriles', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines', 'Quality of Life', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic']",2015/04/11 06:00,2015/10/21 06:00,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/14651858.CD010298.pub2 [doi]'],epublish,Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2015 Apr 10;(4):CD010298. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD010298.pub2.,20150410,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently rapid, sensitive, and specific methods to detect and quantify these mutations are needed. METHODS: We studied samples from 1088 persons with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) including 421 JAK2(V617F) negative subjects with ET, PMF, polycythemia vera (PV), chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and hyper-eosinophilic syndrome (HES). Detection of CALR exon 9 mutations was done by PCR amplification followed by fragment length analysis and direct sequencing. Dilution assays were used to determine CALR mutant allele burden. RESULTS: We detected CALR mutations in blood and bone marrow samples from 152 subjects with ET and with PMF but not in samples from normal or persons with PV, CML, or HES. CALR mutant peaks were distinct from wild-type peaks and dilution experiments indicated a sensitivity level of 0.5-5% for a CALR mutant allele in a wild-type background. Diverse types of mutations were detected including deletions, insertions, and complex indels. All mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. We also used dilution experiments to quantify mutant allele burden. We were able to reproducibly detect mutant allele levels as low 5% (0.5-5%) in a wild-type background. CONCLUSIONS: PCR amplification followed by fragment length analysis is a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for screening persons with MPNs for CALR mutations, especially those with ET and PMF and for estimating mutant allele burden.","['Yao, Qiu-Mei', 'Zhou, Jiao', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Li, Jin-Lan', 'Li, Ling-Di', 'Li, Ning', 'Chen, Shan-Shan', 'Ruan, Guo-Rui']","['Yao QM', 'Zhou J', 'Gale RP', 'Li JL', 'Li LD', 'Li N', 'Chen SS', 'Ruan GR']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Calreticulin/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', '*Gene Frequency', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology']",2015/04/11 06:00,2016/07/13 06:00,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000009 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Oct;20(9):517-22. doi: 10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000009.

Analysis of DNA mutations grouped the leukemia cases into three categories: evolving (26%), expanding (26%) and static (47%). Thus, approximately three-quarters of the CLL cases had little to no genetic subclonal evolution. However, we identified significant recurrent DNA methylation changes during progression at 4752 CpGs enriched for regions near Polycomb 2 repressive complex (PRC2) targets. Progression-associated CpGs near the PRC2 targets undergo methylation changes in the same direction during disease progression as during normal development from naive to memory B cells. Our study shows that CLL progression does not typically occur via subclonal evolution, but that certain CpG sites undergo recurrent methylation changes. Our results suggest CLL progression may involve developmental processes shared in common with the generation of normal memory B cells.","['Smith, E N', 'Ghia, E M', 'DeBoever, C M', 'Rassenti, L Z',

The aim of the study was to characterize the cytokine and gene expression profile, immunophenotype and cytogenetics of BM-MSCs from AML patients compared to normal BM-MSCs from healthy donors. AML BM-MSCs showed decreased monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels compared to normal BM-MSCs. AML BM-MSCs expressed similar beta1 integrin, CD44, CD73, CD90 and E-cadherin compared to normal BM-MSCs. Cytogenetic analysis revealed chromosomal aberrations in AML BM-MSCs, some overlapping with and others distinct from their corresponding AML blasts. No significant difference in gene expression was detected between AML BM-MSCs compared to normal BM-MSCs; however, comparing the differences between AML and MSCs from AML patients with the differences between normal hematopoietic cells and normal MSCs by Ingenuity pathway analysis showed key distinctions of the AML setting: (1) upstream gene regulation by transforming growth factor beta 1, tumor necrosis factor, tissue transglutaminase 2, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha and SWItch/Sucrose NonFermentable related, matrix associated, actin dependent regulator of chromatin, subfamily a, member 4; (2) integrin and interleukin 8 signaling as overrepresented canonical pathways; and (3) upregulation of transcription factors FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog and v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog.

The proto-oncogene c-kit is expressed in approximately 80% of AML cases. The kinase domain mutation of the c-kit gene, one of the most common gain-of-function mutations associated with t(8;21) AML, predicts higher relapse risk and poor prognosis. However, the role of c-kit high expression in t(8;21) AML remains poorly understood. Here we evaluated the prognostic significance of c-kit expression levels in AML patients. The mRNA expression of c-kit was determined by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR in 132 adult AML patients. Patients were grouped into quartiles according to c-kit expression levels (Q1-Q4, each quartile containing 25% of patients) and divided into c-kit high (Q4; n = 33) and c-kit low (Q1-Q3; n = 99). High c-kit expression was associated with AML1/ETO-positive and with c-kit mutation. Of note, 35.8% of the AML1/ETO-positive AML patients carrying wild-type c-kit expressed high levels of c-kit, suggesting that other factors are involved in c-kit overexpression. High c-kit expression was associated with inferior overall and event-free survival in AML1/ETO-positive patients and was independently predictive for overall and event-free survival in multivariate analyses in a c-kit mutation-independent manner. Thus, high c-kit expression serves as a reliable molecular marker for poor prognosis, supporting a pathogenetic role of c-kit signaling in AML1/ETO-positive AML. AML1/ETO-positive patients with high c-kit expression might benefit from early treatment modifications and molecular target therapies.","['Gao, Xiaoning', 'Lin, Ji', 'Gao, Li', 'Deng, Ailing', 'Lu, Xiaolin', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Wang, Lili', 'Yu, Li']","['Gao X', 'Lin J', 'Gao L', 'Deng A', 'Lu X', 'Li Y', 'Wang L', 'Yu L']","['Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Institute of Basic Medicine, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, China-Japan Friendship Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Medical School of Chinese PLA, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/11 06:00,2016/04/19 06:00,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2014/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0124241 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-53068 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 10;10(4):e0124241. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0124241. eCollection 2015.,20150410,PMC4393018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, there is currently no chemotherapeutic agent available to significantly prolong the survival of the most patients with metastatic melanomas. Here we report that the Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb761), one of the most widely sold herbal supplements in the world, potently induces apoptosis in human melanoma cells by disturbing the balance between pro- and anti-apoptosis Bcl-2 family proteins. Treatment with EGb761 induced varying degrees of apoptosis in melanoma cell lines but not in melanocytes. Induction of apoptosis was caspase-dependent and appeared to be mediated by the mitochondrial pathway, in that it was associated with reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of Bax and Bak. Although EGb761 did not cause significant change in the expression levels of the BH3-only Bcl-2 family proteins Bim, Puma, Noxa, and Bad, it significantly downregulated Mcl-1 in sensitive but not resistant melanoma cells, suggesting a major role of Mcl-1 in regulating apoptosis of melanoma cells induced by EGb761. Indeed, siRNA knockdown of Mcl-1 enhanced EGb761-induced apoptosis, which was associated with increased activation of Bax and Bak. Taken together, these results demonstrate that EGb761 kills melanoma cells through the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and that Mcl-1 is a major regulator of sensitivity of melanoma cells to apoptosis induced by EGb761. Therefore, EGb761 with or without in combination with targeting Mcl-1 may be a useful strategy in the treatment of melanoma.","['Wang, Yufang', 'Lv, Junping', 'Cheng, Yao', 'Du, Jipei', 'Chen, Degao', 'Li, Chengtao', 'Zhang, Ji']","['Wang Y', 'Lv J', 'Cheng Y', 'Du J', 'Chen D', 'Li C', 'Zhang J']","['Department of Pathophysiology, School of Preclinical and Forensic Medicine, Sichuan University, Chengdu, P.R.

No cytogenetic, IGHV mutational or gene usage differences were seen between PF/F and diffuse cases. PF/F cases were more often kappa positive (p<0.03) and had fewer involved nodal sites (p=0.0004).

Dysregulation of the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is prominent, even in the absence of the JAK2(V617F) mutation. Therefore, all symptomatic MF patients may potentially derive benefit from JAK inhibitors. Despite the efficacy of JAK inhibitors in controlling signs and symptoms of MF, they do not eradicate the disease. Therefore, JAK inhibitors are currently being tested in combination with other novel therapies, a strategy which may be more effective in reducing disease burden, either by overcoming JAK inhibitor resistance or targeting additional mechanisms of pathogenesis. Additional targets include modulators of epigenetic regulation, pathways that work downstream from JAK/STAT (i.e. mammalian target of rapamycin/AKT/phosphoinositide 3-kinase) heat shock protein 90, hedgehog signaling, pro-fibrotic factors, abnormal megakaryocytes and telomerase.

Compared with imatinib, the first-line use of second-generation inhibitors nilotinib and dasatinib has led to faster and deeper molecular remissions accompanied by a differential adverse effect profile. An essential part of the management of CML patients is the guideline-based application of cytogenetics and standardized polymerase chain reaction techniques to regularly assess the remission status. Long-lasting treatment-free remission in a minority of patients led to hopes for the curability of CML in a significant minority of patients. The use of interferon alpha combined with or after TKI therapy is associated with the induction of an immune response toward the leukemic clone. This innovative treatment approach is currently under prospective investigation to improve long-term response. The coordinated cooperation of academic and regional hospitals, office-based hematologists, laboratories, and patient representatives allows for up-to-date patient care and the early use of new therapeutic options in patients at risk.","['Hochhaus, A', 'La Rosee, P', 'Eigendorff, E', 'Ernst, T']","['Hochhaus A', 'La Rosee P', 'Eigendorff E', 'Ernst T']","['Abteilung Hamatologie/Onkologie, Universitatsklinikum Jena, Erlanger Allee 101, 07740, Jena, Deutschland, andreas.hochhaus@med.uni-jena.de.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Internist (Berl),Der Internist,0264620,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Monitoring/*methods', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2015/04/11 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00108-014-3594-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Internist (Berl). 2015 Apr;56(4):333-43. doi: 10.1007/s00108-014-3594-7.,,,,,,,,,,Chronische myeloische Leukamie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Effective treatment of B cell leukemia may pave the road to future treatment of solid tumors, using similar approaches. The prostate expresses many unique proteins and, since the prostate gland is a dispensable organ, CAR T cells can potentially be used to target these tissue-specific antigens. However, the location and composition of prostate cancer metastases complicate the task of treating these tumors. It is therefore likely that more sophisticated CAR T cell approaches are going to be required for prostate metastasis than for B cell malignancies. Two main challenges that need to be resolved are how to increase the migration and infiltration of CAR T cells into prostate cancer bone metastases and how to counteract the immunosuppressive microenvironment found in bone lesions. Inclusion of homing (chemokine) receptors in CAR T cells may improve their recruitment to bone metastases, as may antibody-based combination therapies to normalize the tumor vasculature. Optimal activation of CAR T cells through the introduction of multiple costimulatory domains would help to overcome inhibitory signals from the tumor microenvironment. Likewise, combination therapy with checkpoint inhibitors that can reduce tumor immunosuppression may help improve efficacy. Other elegant approaches such as induced expression of immune stimulatory cytokines upon target recognition may also help to recruit other effector immune cells to metastatic sites. Although toxicities are difficult to predict in prostate cancer, severe on-target/off-tumor toxicities have been observed in clinical trials with use of CAR T cells against hematological malignancies; therefore, the choice of the target antigen is going to be crucial. This review focuses on different means of accomplishing maximal effectiveness of CAR T cell therapy for prostate cancer bone metastases while minimizing side effects and CAR T cell-associated toxicities. CAR T cell-based therapies for prostate cancer have the potential to be a therapy model for other solid tumors.","['Hillerdal, Victoria', 'Essand, Magnus']","['Hillerdal V', 'Essand M']","['Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, 751 85, Uppsala, Sweden, Victoria.Hillerdal@igp.uu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,BioDrugs,"BioDrugs : clinical immunotherapeutics, biopharmaceuticals and gene therapy",9705305,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Bone Neoplasms/immunology/*secondary/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/*methods', 'Male', 'Models, Immunological', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*immunology/*pathology/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",2015/04/11 06:00,2015/09/05 06:00,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s40259-015-0122-9 [doi]'],ppublish,BioDrugs. 2015 Apr;29(2):75-89. doi: 10.1007/s40259-015-0122-9.,,PMC4544486,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the prospect of using genistein as an effective alternate therapy for AML. A two-cell line model, one possessing the FLT3 gene with the ITD mutation (MV4-11) and the other with the wildtype FLT3 gene (HL-60) has been employed. Our 8-plexed iTRAQ-based quantitative proteomics analysis together with various functional studies demonstrated that genistein exerts anti-leukemic effects on both the AML cell lines. Genistein treatment on the AML cells showed that the drug arrested the mTOR pathway leading to down-regulation of protein synthesis. Additionally, genistein treatment is found to induce cell death via apoptosis. Contrasting regulatory effects of genistein on the cell cycle of the two cell lines were also identified, with the induction of G2/M phase arrest in HL-60 cells but not in MV4-11 cells. Hence, our study highlights the potent anti-leukemic effect of genistein on AML cells irrespective of their genetic status. This suggests the potential use of genistein as an effective general drug therapy for AML patients.","['Narasimhan, Karthik', 'Lee, Yew Mun', 'Lim, Teck Kwang', 'Port, Sarah Alexandra', 'Han, Jin-Hua', 'Chen, Chien-Shing', 'Lin, Qingsong']","['Narasimhan K', 'Lee YM', 'Lim TK', 'Port SA', 'Han JH', 'Chen CS', 'Lin Q']","['Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, Loma Linda University, Loma Linda, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncoscience,Oncoscience,101636666,,,,2015/04/11 06:00,2015/04/11 06:01,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2014/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/11 06:01 [medline]']",['10.18632/oncoscience.120 [doi]'],epublish,Oncoscience. 2015 Feb 6;2(2):111-124. doi: 10.18632/oncoscience.120. eCollection 2015.,20150206,PMC4381704,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'genistein', 'mTOR', 'quantitative proteomics']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some, such as internal tandem duplication of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) and point mutations in DNMT3A and NRAS, are especially frequent whereas others such as NF1 and TP53 are less so. Frequencies of these mutations in persons with seemingly similar AML from other genetic groups are largely unknown. We studied 269 Chinese (mostly Han) with de novo AML. FLT3-ITD was detected in 51 subjects (23%; 95% CI, 17-28%), R882 mutation of DNMT3A in 17 (6%; 95% CI, 3-9%) and NRAS mutation in 17 (7%; 95% CI, 3-9%). No mutations in NF1 and only 1 mutation in TP53 (1%, 95% CI, <2.5%) were detected. Except for FLT3-ITD, frequencies of these mutations are significantly less than those in persons of predominately European descent with AML. The reason(s) for this disparity is unknown but may offer clues to the aetiology of AML in different populations or may indicate some mutations associated with AML in persons of predominately European descent are not fundamental to the aetiology of the disease.","['Yin, Jiawei', 'Xie, Xiaoli', 'Zhang, Fan', 'Chen, Zheng', 'Hu, Chenxi', 'Su, Guangsong', 'Liu, Hong', 'Zheng, Yanwen', 'He, Chao', 'Shen, Hongjie', 'Qiu, Qiaocheng', 'He, Jun', 'Pan, Zhirong', 'Gale, Robert Peter', 'Wu, Depei', 'Yin, Bin']","['Yin J', 'Xie X', 'Zhang F', 'Chen Z', 'Hu C', 'Su G', 'Liu H', 'Zheng Y', 'He C', 'Shen H', 'Qiu Q', 'He J', 'Pan Z', 'Gale RP', 'Wu D', 'Yin B']","['Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215123, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215123, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215123, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215123, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215123, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215123, PR China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215006, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215123, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215123, PR China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215006, PR China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215006, PR China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215006, PR China.', 'Suzhou Blood Center, Jiangsu Province 215006, PR China.', 'Haematology Research Centre, Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215006, PR China.', 'Cyrus Tang Hematology Center, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215123, PR China; Thrombosis and Hemostasis Key Lab of the Ministry of Health, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu Province 215006, PR China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Hematology, Soochow University, PR China.

The transcription factor stem cell leukemia/T-cell acute leukemia 1 (TAL1) controls human HSPC but its mechanism of action is not clarified. In this study, we show that knockdown (KD) or short-term conditional over-expression (OE) of TAL1 in human HSPC ex vivo, respectively, blocks and maintains hematopoietic potentials, affecting proliferation of human HSPC. Comparative gene expression analyses of TAL1/KD and TAL1/OE human HSPC revealed modifications of cell cycle regulators as well as previously described TAL1 target genes. Interestingly an inverse correlation between TAL1 and DNA damage-induced transcript 4 (DDiT4/REDD1), an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, is uncovered. Low phosphorylation levels of mTOR target proteins in TAL1/KD HSPC confirmed an interplay between mTOR pathway and TAL1 in correlation with TAL1-mediated effects of HSPC proliferation. Finally chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments performed in human HSPC showed that DDiT4 is a direct TAL1 target gene. Functional analyses showed that TAL1 represses DDiT4 expression in HSPCs. These results pinpoint DDiT4/REDD1 as a novel target gene regulated by TAL1 in human HSPC and establish for the first time a link between TAL1 and the mTOR pathway in human early hematopoietic cells.

(Leguminosae) has been used in folk medicines for the treatment of many diseases. The heartwood of this plant contains various phenolic components with interesting biological applications; however, the chemical and biological potentials of the seed of this plant have not been fully explored. OBJECTIVE: This study identified the cytotoxic activity of compounds from the seeds of C. sappan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The methanol extract of the seed of C. sappan was suspended in H2O and then partitioned with CH2Cl2, EtOAc, and n-BuOH, successively. Diterpenoid compounds were isolated from the CH2Cl2-soluble fraction by silica gel column chromatography methods using organic solvents. The compound structures were determined by detailed analysis of NMR and MS spectral data. Cytotoxic activity was measured using a modified MTT assay against HL-60, HeLa, MCF-7, and LLC cancer cells. The activation of caspase-3 enzyme and western blotting assay were performed to confirm inhibitory mechanism of active compound. RESULTS: Five cassane-type diterpenoids were isolated and identified as phanginin I (1), phaginin A (2), phanginin D (3), phanginin H (4), and phanginin J (5). Compounds 1-4 showed effective inhibition against HL-60 cells with the IC50 values of 16.4 +/- 1.5, 19.2 +/- 2.0, 11.7 +/- 1.6, and 22.5 +/- 5.1 muM. Compounds 1-3 exhibited cytotoxic activity against HeLa cells with the IC50 values of 28.1 +/- 3.6, 37.2 +/- 3.4, and 22.7 +/- 2.8 muM. Treatment of HL-60 cell lines with various concentrations of 3 (0-30 muM) resulted in the growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis.

However, little is known about CSF3R or CALR mutations in paediatric myeloid disorders. We analysed CSF3R exons 14 and 17, and CALR exon 9, using direct sequencing in samples of paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML; n = 521), juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML; n = 40), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; n = 20) and essential thrombocythaemia (ET; n = 21). CSF3R mutations were found in 10 (1.2%) of 521 patients with AML; two in exon 14 (both missense mutations resulting in p.T618I) and eight in exon 17 (three frameshift mutations: p.S715X, p.Q774R, and p.S783Q; and five novel missense mutations: p.Q754K, p.R769H, p.L777F, p.T781I, and S795R). All of the patients with mutations in CSF3R exon 17 had chromosomal translocations, including four with t(8;21). At the time of reporting, seven of these ten patients are alive; three have died, due to side effects of chemotherapy. No CSF3R mutations were found in cases of MDS, JMML or ET. The only mutation found in the CALR gene was a frameshift (p.L367 fs) in one ET patient.

Survivin has been demonstrated as a key resistant factor in GBM because of its function in inhibiting apoptosis, regulating autophagy, and in promoting G(2)/M cell cycle transition. Parthenolide has been reported to be an effective antitumor agent in a variety of tumor cells and decreases survivin level in leukemia cells. But the effect of parthenolide on survivin and the cell death process in GBM is still unknown. The aim of this study was to examine whether parthenolide had the potential to inhibit cell proliferation in the GBM cell line U373. The parthenolide-induced effects in relation to survivin suppression and cell death were further investigated. Our results showed that parthenolide substantially inhibited cell viability with IC(5)(0) values of approximate 16 muM. Treatment with parthenolide at the dose of 16 muM led to considerable downregulation of survivin, G(2)/M cell cycle arrest and Chk2 upregulation in cells. Parthenolide induced apoptosis in only a few cells and a slight increase in activated caspases 3 levels. By contrast, parthenolide induced a significant increase of intracellular autophagosomes and the expression of autophagy related proteins, including ULK1 and LC3 I/LC3 II, in the treated cells. These results suggested that parthenolide induced survivin inhibition, G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, and triggered cell death through autophagic cell death in the GBM cell line.","['Tang, Tswen-Kei', 'Chiu, Shih-Che', 'Lin, Chia-Wen', 'Su, Mei-Ju', 'Liao, May-Hua']","['Tang TK', 'Chiu SC', 'Lin CW', 'Su MJ', 'Liao MH']","['Department of Nursing, National Quemoy University, Kinmen 89250, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Hsinchu Mackay Memorial Hospital, Hsinchu 30015, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Institute of Physiology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei 11221, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yuanpei University, HsinChu 30015, Taiwan, Republic of China.', 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Yuanpei University, HsinChu 30015, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Chin J Physiol,The Chinese journal of physiology,7804502,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BIRC5 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Survivin)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Glioblastoma/*drug therapy/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Sesquiterpenes/*administration & dosage', 'Survivin', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/04/11 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']","['CJP.2015.BAC267 [pii]', '10.4077/CJP.2015.BAC267 [doi]']",ppublish,Chin J Physiol. 2015 Apr 30;58(2):95-103. doi: 10.4077/CJP.2015.BAC267.,,,,,,,,,['Chin J Physiol. 2015 Aug 31;58(4):273'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complexes interact with calf-thymus DNA and efficiently cleave plasmid DNA in the absence (only 2 and 5) and/or presence of additives. The cleavage ability is concentration-dependent as well as metal and ligand-dependent. Moreover, DNA binding experiments show that the phen-containing Cu(II) and V(IV)O compounds display stronger DNA interaction ability than the corresponding bipy analogues. The complexes present cytotoxic activity against human ovarian (A2780) and breast (MCF7) carcinoma cells. Cell-growth inhibition (IC50) of compounds 1, 2 and 5 in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL60) and human cervical cancer (HeLa) cells were also determined. The copper complexes show much higher cytotoxic activity than the corresponding vanadium complexes and the reference drug cisplatin (except for the sal-Gly complexes); namely, the phenanthroline copper complexes 2-5 are ca. 10-fold more cytotoxic than cisplatin and more cytotoxic than their bipyridine analogues.","['Correia, Isabel', 'Roy, Somnath', 'Matos, Cristina P', 'Borovic, Sladjana', 'Butenko, Nataliya', 'Cavaco, Isabel', 'Marques, Fernanda', 'Lorenzo, Julia', 'Rodriguez, Alejandra', 'Moreno, Virtudes', 'Pessoa, Joao Costa']","['Correia I', 'Roy S', 'Matos CP', 'Borovic S', 'Butenko N', 'Cavaco I', 'Marques F', 'Lorenzo J', 'Rodriguez A', 'Moreno V', 'Pessoa JC']","['Centro de Quimica Estrutural, Instituto Superior Tecnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Av.

Ibrutinib is an orally bioavailable and highly specific BTK inhibitor that was recently approved for treatment of patients with recurrent CLL and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). In addition, ibrutinib has shown efficacy in subsets of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia (WM). However, despite ibrutinib's activity in multiple B-cell malignancies, cases of primary and secondary resistance have emerged. The overall reported frequency of resistance is low, but follow-up in many trials was short, and we predict that the incidence of observed resistance will increase as clinical use outside clinical trials expands over time. Mutations within BTK have been described and clearly interfere with drug binding; however, there are also emerging alternative mechanisms that bypass BTK entirely and offer new opportunities for other targeted agents. Improved understanding of mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance is essential to developing appropriate therapeutic strategies to both prevent and address resistance. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of ibrutinib resistance in CLL, MCL, DLBCL and WM and considers potential strategies for further study.","['Zhang, Shuang Q', 'Smith, Sonali M', 'Zhang, Shuang Y', 'Lynn Wang, Yue']","['Zhang SQ', 'Smith SM', 'Zhang SY', 'Lynn Wang Y']","['Department of Medicine, Section of Haematology and Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Haematology and Oncology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA.', 'Division of Genomic and Molecular Pathology, Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', '*Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', '*Mutation', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2015/04/11 06:00,2015/10/17 06:00,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13427 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Aug;170(4):445-56. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13427.

Unexpectedly, GEF-induced autophagy was also observed in non-NSCLC cells such as murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and leukemia cell lines K562 and HL-60 without EGFR expression. Knockout of EGFR gene in A549 cells by CRISPR/Cas9 system still exhibited autophagy induction after treatment with GEF, indicating that the autophagy induction by GEF is not mediated through inhibiting EGFR kinase activity. Combined treatment with GEF and clarithromycin (CAM), a macrolide antibiotic having the effect of inhibiting autophagy flux, enhances the cytotoxic effect in NSCLC cell lines, although treatment with CAM alone exhibits no cytotoxicity. GEF treatment induced up-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress related genes such as CHOP/GADD153 and GRP78. Knockdown of CHOP in PC-9 cells and Chop-knockout MEF both exhibited less sensitivity to GEF than controls. Addition of CAM in culture medium resulted in further pronounced GEF-induced ER stress loading, while CAM alone exhibited no effect. These data suggest that GEF-induced autophagy functions as cytoprotective and indicates the potential therapeutic possibility of using CAM for GEF therapy. Furthermore, it is suggested that the intracellular signaling for autophagy initiation in response to GEF can be completely dissociated from EGFR, but unknown target molecule(s) of GEF for autophagy induction might exist.","['Sugita, Shohei', 'Ito, Kentaro', 'Yamashiro, Yutaro', 'Moriya, Shota', 'Che, Xiao-Fang', 'Yokoyama, Tomohisa', 'Hiramoto, Masaki', 'Miyazawa, Keisuke']","['Sugita S', 'Ito K', 'Yamashiro Y', 'Moriya S', 'Che XF', 'Yokoyama T', 'Hiramoto M', 'Miyazawa K']","['Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Tokyo Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.

SOCS2, a feedback inhibitor of JAK-STAT pathways, is expressed in most primitive HSC and is upregulated in response to STAT5-inducing cytokines. We demonstrate that Socs2 deficiency unleashes HSC proliferation in vitro, sustaining STAT5 phosphorylation in response to IL3, thrombopoietin, and GM-CSF. In vivo, SOCS2 deficiency leads to unrestricted myelopoietic response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and, in turn, induces exhaustion of long-term HSC function along serial bone marrow transplantations. The emerging role of SOCS2 in HSC under stress conditions prompted the investigation of malignant hematopoiesis. High levels of SOCS2 characterize unfavorable subsets of acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemias, such as those with MLL and BCR/ABL abnormalities, and correlate with the enrichment of genes belonging to hematopoietic and leukemic stemness signatures. In this setting, SOCS2 and its correlated genes are part of regulatory networks fronted by IKZF1/Ikaros and MEF2C, two transcriptional regulators involved in normal and leukemic hematopoiesis that have never been linked to SOCS2. Accordingly, a comparison of murine wt and Socs2(-/-) HSC gene expression in response to 5-FU revealed a significant overlap with the molecular programs that correlate with SOCS2 expression in leukemias, particularly with the oncogenic pathways and with the IKZF1/Ikaros and MEF2C-predicted targets. Lentiviral gene transduction of murine hematopoietic precursors with Mef2c, but not with Ikzf1, induces Socs2 upregulation, unveiling a direct control exerted by Mef2c over Socs2 expression.","['Vitali, Caterina', 'Bassani, Claudia', 'Chiodoni, Claudia', 'Fellini, Elisa', 'Guarnotta, Carla', 'Miotti, Silvia', 'Sangaletti, Sabina', 'Fuligni, Fabio', 'De Cecco, Loris', 'Piccaluga, Pier P', 'Colombo, Mario P', 'Tripodo, Claudio']","['Vitali C', 'Bassani C', 'Chiodoni C', 'Fellini E', 'Guarnotta C', 'Miotti S', 'Sangaletti S', 'Fuligni F', 'De Cecco L', 'Piccaluga PP', 'Colombo MP', 'Tripodo C']","['Molecular Immunology Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Molecular Immunology Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Molecular Immunology Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Molecular Immunology Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Human Pathology, University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy.', 'Molecular Immunology Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Molecular Immunology Unit, Department of Experimental Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematopathology Section, Department of Hematology and Oncology, S.

Thus, there is a need to develop novel alternative therapies for the treatment of CML. Here, we investigated whether Korean red ginseng extract (KRGE) could suppress the proliferation and induce chemosensitization in human CML cells. Also, we used a human phospho-antibody array containing 46 antibodies against signaling molecules to examine a subset of phosphorylation events after treatment. Korean red ginseng extract broadly suppressed the proliferation of five different cell lines, but KRGE was found to be the most potent inducer of apoptosis against KBM-5 cells. It also abrogated the expression of Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2), Bcl-xL (B-cell lymphoma-extra large), survivin, inhibitors of apoptosis protein 1/2, COX-2 (Cyclooxygenase-2), cyclin D1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and VEGF (Vascular endothelial growth factor), as well as upregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic gene products. Interestingly, KRGE also enhanced the cytotoxic and apoptotic effect of IM in KBM-5 cells. The combination treatment of KRGE and IM caused pronounced suppression of p38 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 phosphorylation and induced phosphorylation of p53 compared with the individual treatment. Our results demonstrate that KRGE can enhance the anticancer activity of IM and may have a substantial potential in the treatment of CML.","['Jung, Sang Yoon', 'Kim, Chulwon', 'Kim, Wan-Seok', 'Lee, Seok-Geun', 'Lee, Jun-Hee', 'Shim, Bum Sang', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon', 'Ahn, Kyoo Seok', 'Ahn, Kwang Seok']","['Jung SY', 'Kim C', 'Kim WS', 'Lee SG', 'Lee JH', 'Shim BS', 'Kim SH', 'Ahn KS', 'Ahn KS']","['College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegidong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegidong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, Korea.', 'Botanical Drug Laboratory, R&D Headquarter, Korea Ginseng Corporation, Daejeon, 305-805, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegidong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegidong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegidong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegidong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegidong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, 1 Hoegidong, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 130-701, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Phytother Res,Phytotherapy research : PTR,8904486,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Panax/*chemistry', 'Phosphorylation', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",2015/04/11 06:00,2015/11/06 06:00,['2015/04/11 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ptr.5347 [doi]'],ppublish,Phytother Res. 2015 Jul;29(7):1062-72. doi: 10.1002/ptr.5347.

While CRT is often implicated in neurocognitive impairment in ALL survivors, there is a paucity of the literature that evaluates the persistence of neurocognitive deficits in long-term survivors of pediatric ALL who were treated with contemporary chemotherapy-only protocols. Results from this systematic review concurred to the probable cognitive-sparing effect of chemotherapy-based protocols over CRT in long-term survivors. However, coupled with multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors, survivors who received chemotherapy treatment still suffered from apparent cognitive impairment, particularly in the attention and executive function domains. Notably, there is evidence to suggest that the late neurotoxic effect of methotrexate on survivors' neurocognitive performance may be dose-related. This review also recommends future pharmacokinetic, neuroimaging and genetic studies to illuminate the multifactorial nature of this subject matter and discusses the potential value of neurochemical, physiological, inflammatory and genetic markers for the prediction of susceptibility to neurocognitive impairment in long-term survivors of childhood ALL.","['Cheung, Yin Ting', 'Krull, Kevin R']","['Cheung YT', 'Krull KR']","[""Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, USA."", ""Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, USA.

Compounds having a benzoxy group at C6 position of the aromatic ring exhibited antiproliferative activity in Jurkat cells whereas all compounds induced a lower effect on K562 cells. Analysis of cell cycle, Annexin-V staining, and cleavage of initiator caspases assays showed that the active purine analogues induce cell death by apoptosis. Based on these results, a new purine derivative was synthesized, 6-benzyloxy-9-tert-butyl-8-phenyl-9H-purine (6d), which displayed the highest activity of the series against Jurkat cell lines. Finally, (33)P-radiolabeled kinase assays using 96 recombinant human kinases known to be involved in apoptotic events were performed. Just one of the kinases tested, DAPK-1, was inhibited 50% or more by the phenotypic hits at 10 muM, suggesting that the inhibition of this target could be responsible for the induction of cell death by apoptosis. In agreement with the phenotypic results, the most active antiproliferative agent, 6d, displayed also the lowest IC50 value against recombinant DAPK1 (2.5 muM), further supporting the potential role of this protein on the observed functional response. DAPK-1 inhibition led by 6d together with its pro-apoptotic properties against the Jurkat line makes it an interesting candidate to further investigate the role of DAPK1 kinase in triggering apoptosis in cancer cells, a role which is attracting recent interest.","['Pineda de las Infantas, Maria J', 'Torres-Rusillo, Sara', 'Unciti-Broceta, Juan Diego', 'Fernandez-Rubio, Pablo', 'Luque-Gonzalez, Maria Angelica', 'Gallo, Miguel A', 'Unciti-Broceta, Asier', 'Molina, Ignacio J', 'Diaz-Mochon, Juan J']","['Pineda de las Infantas MJ', 'Torres-Rusillo S', 'Unciti-Broceta JD', 'Fernandez-Rubio P', 'Luque-Gonzalez MA', 'Gallo MA', 'Unciti-Broceta A', 'Molina IJ', 'Diaz-Mochon JJ']","['Departamento de Quimica Farmaceutica y Organica.

However, 30% of patients die during therapy induction from bleeding, differentiation syndrome (DS), and/or infection. Recommendations suggest that congestive heart failure (CHF) is a presenting feature of DS. OBJECTIVE: To assess the incidence of CHF during induction in patients with APL. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed of patients diagnosed with APL from December 2004 to July 2013 and managed at Georgia Regents University Cancer Center. Baseline and follow-up ejection fractions (EF) were recorded and patients with a drop in EF during the induction period were evaluated. RESULTS: Of the 40 evaluable patients, 37 received idarubicin-based chemotherapy. 16 of the 37 patients had a repeat ECHO for suspected cardiomyopathy, and 6 of the 16 patients (37.5%) demonstrated a decrease in EF (absolute drop, 10%-35%). The cardiac function recovered completely in 4 patients and partially in 1 patient. Gender, history of hypertension, and body mass index did not seem to correlate with incidence of CHF. LIMITATIONS: The patient population is very small given the rarity of the disease. Present practice patterns do not routinely address CHF in the differential diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with APL are at risk for cardiac toxicity for a number of reasons, including cytokine storm and inflammatory state, use of anthracyclines, and DS. The clinical presentation of DS most commonly involves dyspnea and fluid retention, which are also symptoms of heart failure. Prompt cardiac evaluation should be undertaken to rule out CHF in APL patients who are going to receive an anthracycline-based therapy, because early intervention may result in an improved outcome.","['Kota, Vamsi', 'Clemmons, Amber', 'Chand, Arati', 'Simmons, Josh', 'Mansour, Joshua', 'Kolhe, Ravindra', 'Jillella, Anand']","['Kota V', 'Clemmons A', 'Chand A', 'Simmons J', 'Mansour J', 'Kolhe R', 'Jillella A']","['Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. vkota@emory.edu.', 'Georgia Regents University Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia, USA; and University of Georgia College of Pharmacy, Athens, Georgia, USA.', 'Georgia Regents University Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'Georgia Regents University Cancer Center, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Georgia Regents University, Augusta, Georgia, USA.', 'Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Community Support Oncol,The Journal of community and supportive oncology,101621609,,,,2015/04/10 06:00,2015/04/10 06:01,['2015/04/10 06:00'],"['2014/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12788/jcso.0084 [doi]'],ppublish,J Community Support Oncol. 2014 Nov;12(11):390-3. doi: 10.12788/jcso.0084.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'congestive heart failure', 'differentiation syndrome']",['(c)2014 Frontline Medical Communications.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve cord blood samples were collected from the fetal placenta umbilical vein and cultured in vitro. The proliferation and differentiation of cord blood HSCs into CFU-G was continuously disrupted with 10 nmol/l of ATRA and/or 10 nmol/l of As2O3. The expression of HOXB8 mRNA and protein were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western-blot, respectively. RESULTS: HOXB8 mRNA/protein expression was detected in control, ATRA, As2O3 and ATRA +As2O3 groups on days 3, 7, and 12 of culture. HOXB8 mRNA/protein expression was detectable on day 3, reached its highest level on day 7 and decreased on day 12. HOXB8 mRNA/protein expression in ATRA, As2O3 and ATRA+As2O3 was upregulated compared with control group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is a positive relationship between HOXB8 gene expression and granulocyte progenitor hematopoiesis. ATRA/As2O3 up-regulate the expression of HOXB8 mRNA/protein, and treatment of leukemia with ATRA/As2O3 may regulate HOX gene expression.","['Liu, W-J', 'Jiang, N-J', 'Guo, Q-L', 'Xu, Q']","['Liu WJ', 'Jiang NJ', 'Guo QL', 'Xu Q']","['Department of Pediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Luzhou Medical College, Luzhou, Sichuan, China. lwjlyfy@qq.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (HOXB8 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Oxides/*administration & dosage', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tretinoin/*administration & dosage']",2015/04/10 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2015/04/10 06:00'],"['2015/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2015;19(6):1055-62.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of medical records and microbiological data of adult patients with acute leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome with at least one positive blood culture for Candida species at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between January 2008 and October 2012. Susceptibility was defined according to the 2012 epidemiological cut-off values and clinical breakpoints. RESULTS: We identified 67 episodes of candidaemia in 65 patients. Almost all episodes (94%) occurred in patients who were receiving antifungal agents, 71% in patients receiving an echinocandin. Almost all isolates (99%) were of non-albicans Candida species [most frequently Candida parapsilosis (32%), Candida tropicalis (23%) and Candida glabrata (20%)]. Caspofungin non-susceptibility was significantly associated with fluconazole resistance (P < 0.001). Non-susceptibility to caspofungin and multidrug resistance were associated with excess 14 day [adjusted HR (aHR) 3.02 (95% CI 1.28-7.09), P = 0.011 and aHR 3.02 (95% CI 1.27-7.14), P = 0.012, respectively] and 30 day [aHR 2.96 (95% CI 1.38-6.37), P = 0.005 and aHR 2.86 (95% CI 1.31-6.21), P = 0.008, respectively] all-cause mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute leukaemia, a shift in candidaemia epidemiology was noted with a 99% predominance of non-albicans species. Non-susceptibility of Candida strains to caspofungin or multidrug resistance were independent markers of poor outcome in this patient population.","['Wang, Emily', 'Farmakiotis, Dimitrios', 'Yang, Daisy', 'McCue, Deborah A', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P', 'Mathisen, Michael S']","['Wang E', 'Farmakiotis D', 'Yang D', 'McCue DA', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Kontoyiannis DP', 'Mathisen MS']","['Department of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA Infectious Disease Section, Department of Internal Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA dfarmakiotis@partners.org.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control and Employee Health, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,"['0 (Echinocandins)', '0 (Lipopeptides)', 'F0XDI6ZL63 (Caspofungin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Candida/*classification/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Candidemia/epidemiology/*microbiology/*mortality', 'Caspofungin', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple, Fungal', 'Echinocandins/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lipopeptides', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/10 06:00,2016/04/15 06:00,['2015/04/10 06:00'],"['2015/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/15 06:00 [medline]']","['dkv087 [pii]', '10.1093/jac/dkv087 [doi]']",ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 2015 Aug;70(8):2362-8. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkv087.

However, the biological role of these receptors in tumor physio-pathology is still unknown. METHODS: We analyzed CB2 cannabinoid receptor protein expression in two series of 166 and 483 breast tumor samples operated in the University Hospitals of Kiel, Tubingen, and Freiburg between 1997 and 2010 and CB2 mRNA expression in previously published DNA microarray datasets. The role of CB2 in oncogenesis was studied by generating a mouse line that expresses the human V-Erb-B2 Avian Erythroblastic Leukemia Viral Oncogene Homolog 2 (HER2) rat ortholog (neu) and lacks CB2 and by a variety of biochemical and cell biology approaches in human breast cancer cells in culture and in vivo, upon modulation of CB2 expression by si/shRNAs and overexpression plasmids. CB2-HER2 molecular interaction was studied by colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays. Statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We show an association between elevated CB2 expression in HER2+ breast tumors and poor patient prognosis (decreased overall survival, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.09 to 0.71, P = .009) and higher probability to suffer local recurrence (HR = 0.09, 95% CI = 0.049 to 0.54, P = .003) and to develop distant metastases (HR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.13 to 0.75, P = .009). We also demonstrate that genetic inactivation of CB2 impairs tumor generation and progression in MMTV-neu mice. Moreover, we show that HER2 upregulates CB2 expression by activating the transcription factor ELK1 via the ERK cascade and that an increased CB2 expression activates the HER2 pro-oncogenic signaling at the level of the tyrosine kinase c-SRC. Finally, we show HER2 and CB2 form heteromers in cancer cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings reveal an unprecedented role of CB2 as a pivotal regulator of HER2 pro-oncogenic signaling in breast cancer, and they suggest that CB2 may be a biomarker with prognostic value in these tumors.","['Perez-Gomez, Eduardo', 'Andradas, Clara', 'Blasco-Benito, Sandra', 'Caffarel, Maria M', 'Garcia-Taboada, Elena', 'Villa-Morales, Maria', 'Moreno, Estefania', 'Hamann, Sigrid', 'Martin-Villar, Ester', 'Flores, Juana M', 'Wenners, Antonia', 'Alkatout, Ibrahim', 'Klapper, Wolfram', 'Rocken, Christoph', 'Bronsert, Peter', 'Stickeler, Elmar', 'Staebler, Annette', 'Bauer, Maret', 'Arnold, Norbert', 'Soriano, Joaquim', 'Perez-Martinez, Manuel', 'Megias, Diego', 'Moreno-Bueno, Gema', 'Ortega-Gutierrez, Silvia', 'Artola, Marta', 'Vazquez-Villa, Henar', 'Quintanilla, Miguel', 'Fernandez-Piqueras, Jose', 'Canela, Enric I', 'McCormick, Peter J', 'Guzman, Manuel', 'Sanchez, Cristina']","['Perez-Gomez E', 'Andradas C', 'Blasco-Benito S', 'Caffarel MM', 'Garcia-Taboada E', 'Villa-Morales M', 'Moreno E', 'Hamann S', 'Martin-Villar E', 'Flores JM', 'Wenners A', 'Alkatout I', 'Klapper W', 'Rocken C', 'Bronsert P', 'Stickeler E', 'Staebler A', 'Bauer M', 'Arnold N', 'Soriano J', 'Perez-Martinez M', 'Megias D', 'Moreno-Bueno G', 'Ortega-Gutierrez S', 'Artola M', 'Vazquez-Villa H', 'Quintanilla M', 'Fernandez-Piqueras J', 'Canela EI', 'McCormick PJ', 'Guzman M', 'Sanchez C']","[': Dept.

The majority of PAX5 alterations in ALL are heterozygous, and key PAX5 target genes are expressed in leukemic cells, suggesting that PAX5 may be a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor. To examine the role of PAX5 alterations in leukemogenesis, we performed mutagenesis screens of mice heterozygous for a loss-of-function Pax5 allele. Both chemical and retroviral mutagenesis resulted in a significantly increased penetrance and reduced latency of leukemia, with a shift to B-lymphoid lineage. Genomic profiling identified a high frequency of secondary genomic mutations, deletions, and retroviral insertions targeting B-lymphoid development, including Pax5, and additional genes and pathways mutated in ALL, including tumor suppressors, Ras, and Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling. These results show that in contrast to simple Pax5 haploinsufficiency, multiple sequential alterations targeting lymphoid development are central to leukemogenesis and contribute to the arrest in lymphoid maturation characteristic of ALL. This cross-species analysis also validates the importance of concomitant alterations of multiple cellular growth, signaling, and tumor suppression pathways in the pathogenesis of B-ALL.","['Dang, Jinjun', 'Wei, Lei', 'de Ridder, Jeroen', 'Su, Xiaoping', 'Rust, Alistair G', 'Roberts, Kathryn G', 'Payne-Turner, Debbie', 'Cheng, Jinjun', 'Ma, Jing', 'Qu, Chunxu', 'Wu, Gang', 'Song, Guangchun', 'Huether, Robert G', 'Schulman, Brenda', 'Janke, Laura', 'Zhang, Jinghui', 'Downing, James R', 'van der Weyden, Louise', 'Adams, David J', 'Mullighan, Charles G']","['Dang J', 'Wei L', 'de Ridder J', 'Su X', 'Rust AG', 'Roberts KG', 'Payne-Turner D', 'Cheng J', 'Ma J', 'Qu C', 'Wu G', 'Song G', 'Huether RG', 'Schulman B', 'Janke L', 'Zhang J', 'Downing JR', 'van der Weyden L', 'Adams DJ', 'Mullighan CG']","[""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", 'Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science, Delft Bioinformatics Laboratory, Delft University of Technology, Delft, The Netherlands;', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom;', ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Computational Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; and."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; and."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Structural Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Structural Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Computational Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN; and."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Structural Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Structural Biology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Pax5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Gene Deletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2015/04/10 06:00,2015/08/13 06:00,['2015/04/10 06:00'],"['2015/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31581-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-02-626127 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 4;125(23):3609-17. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-02-626127.

We undertook a retrospective analysis of Australian Paediatric Cancer Registry data from 1997 to 2008 together with a single-centre audit during the same period assessing burden on service delivery at a tertiary children's hospital (Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane). Although survival improved from 54.3% (1997-2002) to 69.2% (2003-2008), childhood AML caused a disproportionate number of childhood cancer deaths, accounting for 5.5% of all childhood cancer diagnoses yet 7.9% of all childhood cancer mortality. Furthermore, treatment was associated with significant toxicity requiring intensive use of local health resources.

Human parvovirus B19 infection may complicate the clinical course of patients with acute leukemia and may also precede the development of acute leukemia by up to 180 days. Parvovirus B19 targets erythroblasts in the bone marrow and may cause aplastic crisis in patients with shortened-red cell survival. Aplastic crisis represents a prodrome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in 2% patients. There is a significant overlap between those HLA classes I and II alleles that are associated with a vigorous immune response and development of symptoms during B19 infection and those HLA alleles that predispose to development of acute leukemia. Acute symptomatic B19 infection is associated with low circulating IL-10 consistent with a vigorous immune response; deficient IL-10 production at birth was recently found to be associated with subsequent development of acute leukemia. Anti-B19 IgG has been associated with a particular profile of methylation of human cancer genes in patients with acute leukemia, suggesting an additional hit and run mechanism. The proposed role for parvovirus B19 in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia fits well with the delayed infection hypothesis and with the two-step mutation model, which describes carriage of the first mutation prior to birth, followed by suppression of hematopoiesis, which allows rapid proliferation of cells harboring the first mutation, acquisition of a second activating mutation, and expansion of cells carrying both mutations, resulting in acute leukemia.","['Kerr, Jonathan R', 'Mattey, Derek L']","['Kerr JR', 'Mattey DL']","['Escuela de Medicina y Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad del Rosario, Bogota D.C., Colombia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Rev Med Virol,Reviews in medical virology,9112448,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cell Transformation, Viral/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Parvoviridae Infections/complications/*immunology/*virology', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Diseases/complications', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/10 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2015/04/10 06:00'],"['2014/10/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/rmv.1830 [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Med Virol. 2015 May;25(3):133-55. doi: 10.1002/rmv.1830.

Usefulness of UGT1A1 mutational screening.,1195-201,10.1002/pbc.25457 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most frequent cancer in childhood. Although intensive chemotherapy has improved survival in those patients, important side effects, including hyperbilirubinemia, are frequent. Gilbert syndrome (GS) is a frequent condition that causes a reduction in glucuronidation and intermittent hyperbilirubinemia episodes. This could provoke a greater exposure to some cytotoxic agents used in ALL, increasing the risk of toxicity. On the other hand, unexplained hyperbilirubinemia could lead to unnecessary modifications or even treatment withdrawals, which could increase the risk of relapse, but data regarding this in ALL pediatric population are scarce. METHODS: Retrospective study to analyze toxicity, outcome and treatment modifications related to GS in children diagnosed with ALL. RESULTS: A total of 23 of 159 patients were diagnosed with GS. They had statistically higher hyperbilirubinemias during all treatment phases (P < 0.0001) and a slower methotrexate clearance when it was administered during a 24-hr infusion at high doses (patients with GS: 74 hr +/- 19 vs. patients without GS: 64 hr +/- 8; P < .002). However, no relevant toxicity or delays in treatment were found in them. Finally, changes in treatment due to hyperbilirubinemia were only done in 5 patients with GS. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in outcome were not found in patients with GS. Universal screening for GS appears to be not necessary in pediatric patients with ALL. However, when hyperbilirubinemia is observed, it must be rule out in order to avoid unnecessary changes in treatment.","['Berrueco, R', 'Alonso-Saladrigues, A', 'Martorell-Sampol, L', 'Catala-Temprano, A', 'Ruiz-Llobet, A', 'Toll, T', 'Torrebadell, M', 'Naudo, M', 'Camos, M', 'Rives, S']","['Berrueco R', 'Alonso-Saladrigues A', 'Martorell-Sampol L', 'Catala-Temprano A', 'Ruiz-Llobet A', 'Toll T', 'Torrebadell M', 'Naudo M', 'Camos M', 'Rives S']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology.

We have focused on the influence of 2,8-sialyltransferases in key steps of the development of MDR in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The expressional profiles of six alpha-2,8-sialyltransferases were generated in three pairs of CML cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of CML patients. Cellular MDR phenotype positively correlated with ST8SIA4 and ST8SIA6 levels. Furthermore, ST8SIA4 mediated the activity of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signal pathway and the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway by its specific inhibitor LY294002, or by Akt RNA interfering reversed the MDR phenotype of K562/ADR cells. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt pathway also attenuated the effects caused by the overexpression of ST8SIA4 on MDR. Therefore this study indicated that alpha-2,8-sialyltransferases involved in the development of MDR of CML cells probably through ST8SIA4 regulating the activity of PI3K/Akt signaling and the expression of P-gp.","['Zhang, Xu', 'Dong, Weijie', 'Zhou, Huimin', 'Li, Hongshuai', 'Wang, Ning', 'Miao, Xiaoyan', 'Jia, Li']","['Zhang X', 'Dong W', 'Zhou H', 'Li H', 'Wang N', 'Miao X', 'Jia L']","['Department of Medical Laboratory, College of Laboratory Medicine, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,IUBMB Life,IUBMB life,100888706,"['EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ST8SIA4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (ST8SIA6 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Nude', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Sialyltransferases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/10 06:00,2016/04/28 06:00,['2015/04/10 06:00'],"['2014/09/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/07 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/iub.1351 [doi]'],ppublish,IUBMB Life. 2015 Feb;67(2):77-87. doi: 10.1002/iub.1351.

These differences were often attributed to sex steroids, but the role of estrogen and testosterone in atherosclerosis are more complex than anticipated. Cross-sex hormone therapy of transsexuals is an interesting model, which has been used to study hormonal effects on serum lipid profile, insulin resistance, and body composition. However, studies on macrophage cholesterol efflux, the first step in reverse cholesterol transport, are not available. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of cross-sex hormone therapy in transsexuals on the capacity of serum to accept cholesterol from macrophages. METHODS: Cholesterol acceptor capacity (CAC) of serum from transsexuals before and after at least 6 months of hormone treatment was measured using macrophage tissue culture models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CAC of serum using the human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1 cells). RESULTS: Unexpectedly, the CAC of serum from male to female (MtF) transsexuals was not increased, but decreased after hormone therapy. Serum from female to male (FtM) transsexuals showed no changes in CAC. CONCLUSIONS: Despite drastic changes in hormone status, no increase in CAC was detected in MtF patients, and no alteration in CAC was seen in FtM patients.

The correlation between their expressions and clinicopathologic data were analyzed using statistical software in gastric cancer tissues. RESULTS: The tissue microarray consisting of 64 gastric cancer and 10 normal gastric tissues showed NDRG2 expression in gastric cancer tissues was significantly lower than that in normal tissues, whereas Bcl-2 expression in gastric cancer tissues was significantly higher than that in normal tissues. It was also indicated that NDRG2 was negatively correlated with Bcl-2 in gastric cancer tissues. NDRG2 and Bcl-2 were further analyzed in 206 gastric cancer and paired para-carcinoma tissues. It was displayed that the expression levels of NDRG2 and Bcl-2 in human gastric cancer were not associated with age and sex, but significantly associated with tumor differentiation, clinical stage and lymph node metastasis.

METHODS: The cDNA of pre-miR-193b was obtained by chemical synthesis and inserted into the adenoviral shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV. The recombinant shuttle plasmid was linearized by Pme I and transformed into AdEasier cells for homologous recombination in E.coli BJ5183 with the adenoviral backbone plasmid pAdEasy-1. The recombinant adenoviral plasmid was linearized by Pac I and then used for transfecting HEK293 cells. After package and amplification in HEK293 cells, the virus titer was determined by serial dilution assay. The expression level of miR-193b in K562 cells was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. The cell proliferation was observed by MTT assay. RESULTS: The recombinant plasmid named pAd-miR-193b was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. The recombinant adenovirus could infect K562 cells efficiently. Compared with control group, real-time quantitative PCR revealed that the expression of miR-193b was significantly up-regulated in K562 cells infected with pAd-pre-miR-193b, and the cell proliferation was suppressed significantly in K562 cells with up-regulated miR-193b expression.

METHODS: Effects of decitabine on cells proliferation were detected by using CCK-8, the apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC, cell cycles by propidium iodide-FACS. Discrepancy genes were screened by RNA-seq technique. The CpG methylation of lactoferrin (LTF) gene in Molt4 cells were identified by Bisulfite sequencing PCR (BSP). The expression of LTF mRNA in Molt4 by RT-PCR and LTF protein expression were analyzed by Western blot. RESULTS: Decitabine effectively inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis for Molt4 cells by an time- and dose-dependent manners. Cell cycles were arrested at the G(0)/G(1) phase. The promoter methylation degree of LTF gene in Molt4 cells was 72.3% before decitabine treatment and decreased to 45.0% after treatment with 0.50 mumol/L decitabine for 72 h. After the reduction of methylation, expression of its mRNA and protein increased, meanwhile caspase 3 and caspase 9 protein expression levels increased. CONCLUSION: The demethylating drug decitabine can induce apoptosis, detain cell cycle at phase G(0)/G(1), inhibit proliferation and up-regulate LTF gene expression in Molt4 cells.

METHODS: From June 2004 to October 2013, 335 adult AML (non acute promyelocytic leukemia) patients receiving the IA regimen as induction chemotherapy were enrolled, including 198 cases with 10 mg/m(2) Ida and 137 cases with 8 mg/m(2) Ida for 3 days. We compared the hematologic response, hematologic side effects and prognosis between the two regimens. RESULTS: Except for 4 early deaths, the complete remission (CR) rate after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy was 72.5%, 10.0% partial remission (PR) and 82.5% overall remission (OR) rate. The CR and OR rates were higher in the 10 mg/m(2) Ida group than the 8 mg/m(2) Ida group (CR: 78.9% vs 63.5%, P=0.003; OR: 88.2% vs 75.4%, P=0.007). Multivariate analysis showed that female, HGB>/=100 g/L, FLT3-ITD mutation negative and 10 mg/m(2) Ida were favorable factors for CR. All patients presented cytopenias of grade . There was no differences on the recovery time of ANC>/=0.5x10(9)/L and PLT>/=20x10(9)/L after induction chemotherapy.

METHODS: From Jan 2007 to Dec 2010, 106 adult ALL patients were retrospectively divided into two groups, 50 in auto-HSCT group and 56 in allo-HSCT group. Auto-HSCT group included 21 patients with high-risk, 46 patients in CR1 and 4 cases in CR2. All the 50 patients had negative minimal residual disease (MRD) prior to HSCT. Allo-HSCT group included 44 patients with high risk, 51 patients in CR1 and 5 cases in CR2, 15 patients with positive MRD before allo-HSCT. response, regulatory T cells (Treg), cytokines levels and treatment-related adverse effects were observed. RESULTS: Of the total 106 patients, 29 patients relapsed at a medium follow-up of 22.9(0.8-63.3) months. The 3-year cumulative relapse rate (RR) was (29.9+/-8.0) % in auto-HSCT group and (32.7+/-6.8) % in allo-HSCT group. There were no significant differences in RR and overall survival (OS) between auto-HSCT and allo-HSCT groups, even of stratified risk groups. In standard risk group, 3-year OS was (77.1+/-13.2) % in auto-HSCT group and (90.9+/-8.7) % in allo-HSCT group (P=0.739). In high-risk group, 3-year OS was (68.7+/-10.8) % after auto-HSCT and (45.2+/-8.5) % after allo-HSCT (P=0.094).

The purpose of this review was to analyse the safety of RS in paediatric patients with haemophilia and provide a risk-benefit assessment, which practitioners could apply to their patients. Children undergoing knee RS receive a radiation dose of approximately 0.74 mSv (90 megabecquerels-MBq) and elbow and ankle RSs a dose of approximately 0.32 mSv (30-40 MBq). The radiation dose from natural sources is approximately 2 mSv and the recommended limit for patients (apart from natural sources) is 1 mSv per year.

We have planned to evaluate the possible role of MDM2-309T>G polymorphism with risk and response to chemotherapy in AML. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 223 de novo AML cases and 304 age and sex matched healthy controls were genotyped for the MDM2-309T>G polymorphism through the tetra-primer amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR method. In order to assess the functional relationship of -309T>G SNP with MDM2 expression level, we quantified MDM2 mRNA in 30 primary AML blood samples through quantitative RT-PCR. Both the (-309T>G) genotypes and the MDM2 expression were correlated with disease free survival (DFS) rates among patients who have achieved complete remission (CR) after first induction chemotherapy. RESULTS: MDM2-309T>G polymorphism was significantly associated with AML development (p<0.0001). The presence of either GG genotype or G allele at MDM2-309 confered 1.79 (95% CI: 1.12-2.86; p<0.001) and 1.46 fold (95%CI: 1.14-1.86; p=0.003) increased AML risk. Survival analysis revealed that CR+ve cases with GG genotype had significantly increased DFS rates (16months, p=0.05) compared to CR+ve TT (11 months) and TG (9 months) genotype groups. Further, MDM2 expression was also found to be significantly elevated in GG genotype patients (p=0.0039) and among CR+ve cases (p=0.0036).

The objective of the current study was to examine ceramide metabolism in preeclampsia, a serious disorder of pregnancy characterized by oxidative stress, and increased trophoblast cell death and autophagy. Maternal circulating and placental ceramide levels quantified by tandem mass spectrometry were elevated in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. Placental ceramides were elevated due to greater de novo synthesis via high serine palmitoyltransferase activity and reduced lysosomal breakdown via diminished ASAH1 expression caused by TGFB3-induced E2F4 transcriptional repression. SMPD1 activity was reduced; hence, sphingomyelin degradation by SMPD1 did not contribute to elevated ceramide levels in preeclampsia. Oxidative stress triggered similar changes in ceramide levels and acid hydrolase expression in villous explants and trophoblast cells. MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry localized the ceramide increases to the trophophoblast layers and syncytial knots of placentae from pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia. ASAH1 inhibition or ceramide treatment induced autophagy in human trophoblast cells via a shift of the BOK-MCL1 rheostat toward prodeath BOK. Pharmacological inhibition of ASAH1 activity in pregnant mice resulted in increased placental ceramide content, abnormal placentation, reduced fetal growth, and increased autophagy via a similar shift in the BOK-MCL1 system. Our results reveal that oxidative stress-induced reduction of lysosomal hydrolase activities in combination with elevated de novo synthesis leads to ceramide overload, resulting in increased trophoblast cell autophagy, and typifies preeclampsia as a sphingolipid storage disorder.","['Melland-Smith, Megan', 'Ermini, Leonardo', 'Chauvin, Sarah', 'Craig-Barnes, Hayley', 'Tagliaferro, Andrea', 'Todros, Tullia', 'Post, Martin', 'Caniggia, Isabella']","['Melland-Smith M', 'Ermini L', 'Chauvin S', 'Craig-Barnes H', 'Tagliaferro A', 'Todros T', 'Post M', 'Caniggia I']","['a The Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute; Mount Sinai Hospital ; Toronto , ON Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Sphingolipids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lipid Metabolism/*drug effects', 'Mice', 'Placenta/*metabolism', 'Pre-Eclampsia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Sphingolipids/*metabolism']",2015/04/09 06:00,2016/03/16 06:00,['2015/04/09 06:00'],"['2015/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15548627.2015.1034414 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2015 Apr 3;11(4):653-69. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2015.1034414.,,PMC4502662,['NOTNLM'],"['2-OE, 2-oleoylethanolamine', '3-KDS, 3-keto dihydrosphingosine', '3-MA, 3-methyladenine', 'ACTB, actin beta', 'ASAH1, N-acylsphingosine amidohydrolase (acid ceramidase) 1', 'BECN1, Beclin 1, autophagy related', 'BOK', 'BOK, BCL2-related ovarian killer', 'BafA1, bafilomycin A1', 'CANX, calnexin', 'CASP3 (caspase 3, apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase)', 'CERs, ceramides', 'CT, cytotrophoblast cells', 'D-NMAPPD, N-[(1R,2R)-2-hydroxyl-1-(hydroxyL-methyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)', 'ethyl]-tetradecanamide', 'DHCer, dihydro-ceramide', 'E2F4, E2F transcription factor 4, p107/p130-binding', 'HIF1A, hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha, subunit (basic helix-loop-helix', 'transcription factor)', 'LAMP1, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1', 'LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry', 'LC3B-II, cleaved and lipidated form of microtubule-associated protein 1 light', 'chain 3 beta (MAP1LC3B/LC3B)', 'MALDI-MS, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-mass spectrometry', 'MCL1', 'MCL1, myeloid cell leukemia 1', 'PE, preeclampsia', 'PTC, preterm control', 'S1P, sphingosine-1-phosphate', 'SM, sphingomyelin', 'SMPD1, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1, acid lysosomal (acid sphingomyelinase)', 'SNP, sodium nitroprusside (III)', 'SPH, sphingosine', 'SPT, serine palmitoyltransferase', 'SQSTM1/p62, sequestosome 1', 'ST, syncytium/syncytiotrophoblast cells', 'Sa, sphinganine', 'TC, term control', 'TGFB, transforming growth factor beta', 'autophagy', 'oxidative stress', 'placenta', 'preeclampsia', 'siRNA, small-interfering ribonucleic acid', 'sphingolipid metabolism']",,,,['MOP-89813/Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Electroporation with calcium causes ATP (adenosine triphosphate) depletion and cancer cell death and could be a novel cancer treatment. This study aims at understanding the relationship between applied electric field, calcium concentration, ATP depletion and efficacy. METHODS: In three human cell lines--H69 (small-cell lung cancer), SW780 (bladder cancer), and U937 (leukaemia), viability was determined after treatment with 1, 3, or 5 mM calcium and eight 99 mus pulses with 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4 or 1.6 kV/cm. Fitting analysis was applied to quantify the cell-killing efficacy in presence of calcium. Post-treatment intracellular ATP was measured in H69 and SW780 cells. Post-treatment intracellular ATP was observed with fluorescence confocal microscopy of quinacrine-labelled U937 cells. RESULTS: Both H69 and SW780 cells showed dose-dependent (calcium concentration and electric field) decrease in intracellular ATP (p<0.05) and reduced viability. The 50% effective cell kill was found at 3.71 kV/cm (H69) and 3.28 kV/cm (SW780), reduced to 1.40 and 1.15 kV/cm (respectively) with 1 mM calcium (lower EC50 for higher calcium concentrations). Quinacrine fluorescence intensity of calcium-electroporated U937 cells was one third lower than in controls (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Calcium electroporation dose-dependently reduced cell survival and intracellular ATP. Increasing extracellular calcium allows the use of a lower electric field. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: This study supports the use of calcium electroporation for treatment of cancer and possibly lowering the applied electric field in future trials.","['Hansen, Emilie Louise', 'Sozer, Esin Bengisu', 'Romeo, Stefania', 'Frandsen, Stine Krog', 'Vernier, P Thomas', 'Gehl, Julie']","['Hansen EL', 'Sozer EB', 'Romeo S', 'Frandsen SK', 'Vernier PT', 'Gehl J']","['Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Frank Reidy Research Center for Bioelectrics, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, United States of America.', 'Institute for Electromagnetic Sensing of the Environment (IREA), Italian National Research Council, Naples, Italy.', 'Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Frank Reidy Research Center for Bioelectrics, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, United States of America.', 'Center for Experimental Drug and Gene Electrotransfer, Department of Oncology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Calcium/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Electroporation', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology']",2015/04/09 06:00,2016/03/26 06:00,['2015/04/09 06:00'],"['2014/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0122973 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-58173 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 8;10(4):e0122973. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0122973. eCollection 2015.,20150408,PMC4390219,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2015;10(5):e0128034.

It can help patients with kidney failure live decades longer. However, renal transplantation also faces a risk of developing various blood disorders. The blood disorders typically associated with renal transplantation can be divided into two main categories: (1) Common disorders including post-transplant anemia (PTA), post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), post-transplant erythrocytosis (PTE), and post-transplant cytopenias (PTC, leukopenia/neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and pancytopenia); and (2) Uncommon but serious disorders including hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), therapy-related myelodysplasia (t-MDS), and therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML). Although many etiological factors involve the development of post-transplant blood disorders, immunosuppressive agents, and viral infections could be the two major contributors to most blood disorders and cause hematological abnormalities and immunodeficiency by suppressing hematopoietic function of bone marrow. Hematological abnormalities and immunodeficiency will result in severe clinical outcomes in renal transplant recipients. Understanding how blood disorders develop will help cure these life-threatening complications. A potential therapeutic strategy against post-transplant blood disorders should focus on tapering immunosuppression or replacing myelotoxic immunosuppressive drugs with lower toxic alternatives, recognizing and treating promptly the etiological virus, bacteria, or protozoan, restoring both hematopoietic function of bone marrow and normal blood counts, and improving kidney graft survival.","['Yang, Yu', 'Yu, Bo', 'Chen, Yun']","['Yang Y', 'Yu B', 'Chen Y']","['Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital of PLA General Hospital Beijing, China.', 'Department of Urology, First Affiliated Hospital of PLA General Hospital Beijing, China.', 'BrightstarTech, Inc.

PDT (photodynamic therapy) utilizes the fact that certain compounds coined as photosensitizers, when exposed to light of a specific wavelength, are capable of generating cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide to kill cancer cells. Combinations of cancer therapeutic modalities are studied to improve the efficacy of treatment. This study aimed to explore a new strategy of coupling of titanium dioxide whiskers (TiO2 Ws) with the anticancer drug gambogic acid (GA) in photodynamic therapy. The nanocomposites were coined as GA-TiO2. The combination of TiO2 Ws with GA induced a remarkable enhancement in antitumor activity estimated by MTT assay, nuclear DAPI staining, and flow cytometry. Furthermore, the possible signaling pathway was explored by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot assay. These results identify TiO2 Ws of good biocompatibility and photocatalytic activity. In human leukemia cells (K562 cells), TiO2 Ws could obviously increase the intracellular concentration of GA and enhance its potential antitumor efficiency, suggesting that TiO2 Ws could act as an efficient drug delivery carrier targeting GA to carcinoma cells. Moreover, photodynamic GA-TiO2 nanocomposites could induce an evident reinforcement in antitumor activity with UV illumination. These results reveal that such modality combinations put forward a promising proposal in cancer therapy.","['Xu, Peipei', 'Wang, Ruju', 'Ouyang, Jian', 'Chen, Bing']","['Xu P', 'Wang R', 'Ouyang J', 'Chen B']","[""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008 People's Republic of China."", ""Medical School, Southeast University, Nanjing, 210009 People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008 People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008 People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Nanoscale Res Lett,Nanoscale research letters,101279750,,,,2015/04/09 06:00,2015/04/09 06:01,['2015/04/09 06:00'],"['2014/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s11671-015-0796-4 [doi]', '796 [pii]']",epublish,Nanoscale Res Lett. 2015 Feb 28;10:94. doi: 10.1186/s11671-015-0796-4. eCollection 2015.,20150228,PMC4385221,['NOTNLM'],"['Drug delivery system', 'Gambogic acid', 'Leukemia', 'Photodynamic therapy', 'Titanium dioxide whiskers']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is subject to much criticism, which was the reason to study the value of the SMR as a quality indicator for the treatment of acute leukaemia. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in patients with acute leukaemia admitted to a Santeon hospital during the period 2005-2009. SMR values were calculated and compared with the overall survival (OS). RESULTS: During the study period, 455 unique patients were admitted with acute leukaemia. SMR calculation was based on 992 admissions. SMR analysis yielded a high mortality ratio in hospital 1, 2, 3 and 4 in comparison with the national average (100), significant for hospital 1 and 4 (180 [CI 95% 126-257] and 187 [CI 95% 134-261], respectively) OS analysis also showed a significantly different outcome between hospitals. However, using OS as outcome parameter, hospital 2 and 6 showed the lowest performance as compared with hospital 1 and 4 using SMR as parameter. After multivariate analysis, age (HR 1.04; CI 95% 1.03-1.05; p < 0.001) and hospital (hospital 5 compared with 6: HR 0.54; CI 95% 0.30- .98; p = 0.043; hospital 2 compared with 1: HR 1.51; CI 95% 1.02-2.23; p = 0.039) were the only significant variables that influenced OS. CONCLUSION: Outcome according to SMR is not equivalent to outcome according to OS. This study shows that the use of the SMR as a quality indicator for the treatment of acute leukaemia does not appear to be justified.","['Saes, L', 'Peters, W G', 'Schaafsma, R', 'van Spronsen, D J', 'van der Velden, A W G', 'van den Bosch, W F', 'Meijer, E']","['Saes L', 'Peters WG', 'Schaafsma R', 'van Spronsen DJ', 'van der Velden AW', 'van den Bosch WF', 'Meijer E']","['Haven Hospital/Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Netherlands,Neth J Med,The Netherlands journal of medicine,0356133,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Disease Management', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality/trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', '*Quality Indicators, Health Care', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/09 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/04/09 06:00'],"['2015/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Neth J Med. 2015 Mar;73(3):119-23.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few of these patients can be cured with conventional salvage therapy. They need to be evaluated regarding eligibility for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as this is currently the treatment with the highest probability of cure. To reduce the leukemia burden prior to transplantation, salvage chemotherapy regimens need to be employed. Whenever possible, refractory/relapsed patients should be enrolled in clinical trials as we do not have highly effective and standardized treatments for this situation. Novel therapies include tyrosine kinase inhibitors, small-molecule inhibitors (e.g., for Polo-like kinase 1 and aminopeptidase), inhibitors of mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and IDH2, antibody-based therapies, and cell-based therapies. Although the majority of these therapies are still under evaluation, they are likely to enter clinical practice rapidly as a bridge to transplant and/or in older, unfit patients who are not candidates for allogeneic HSCT.

Diagnosis can be ambiguous; for example, with prefibrotic myelofibrosis or reactive monocytosis. We set up a multiparameter flow cytometry assay to distinguish CD14(+)/CD16(-) classical from CD14(+)/CD16(+) intermediate and CD14(low)/CD16(+) nonclassical monocyte subsets in peripheral blood mononucleated cells and in total blood samples. Compared with healthy donors and patients with reactive monocytosis or another hematologic malignancy, CMML patients demonstrate a characteristic increase in the fraction of CD14(+)/CD16(-) cells (cutoff value, 94.0%). The associated specificity and sensitivity values were 95.1% and 90.6% in the learning cohort (175 samples) and 94.1% and 91.9% in the validation cohort (307 samples), respectively. The accumulation of classical monocytes, which demonstrate a distinct gene expression pattern, is independent of the mutational background.

We conclude that an increase in the fraction of classical monocytes to >94.0% of total monocytes is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic marker that rapidly and accurately distinguishes CMML from confounding diagnoses.","['Selimoglu-Buet, Dorothee', 'Wagner-Ballon, Orianne', 'Saada, Veronique', 'Bardet, Valerie', 'Itzykson, Raphael', 'Bencheikh, Laura', 'Morabito, Margot', 'Met, Elisabeth', 'Debord, Camille', 'Benayoun, Emmanuel', 'Nloga, Anne-Marie', 'Fenaux, Pierre', 'Braun, Thorsten', 'Willekens, Christophe', 'Quesnel, Bruno', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Fontenay, Michaela', 'Rameau, Philippe', 'Droin, Nathalie', 'Koscielny, Serge', 'Solary, Eric']","['Selimoglu-Buet D', 'Wagner-Ballon O', 'Saada V', 'Bardet V', 'Itzykson R', 'Bencheikh L', 'Morabito M', 'Met E', 'Debord C', 'Benayoun E', 'Nloga AM', 'Fenaux P', 'Braun T', 'Willekens C', 'Quesnel B', 'Ades L', 'Fontenay M', 'Rameau P', 'Droin N', 'Koscielny S', 'Solary E']","['INSERM U1009, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Faculty of Medicine, University Paris-Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France;', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Departement d'Hematologie et d'Immunologie Biologiques, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France; Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Est Creteil, Creteil, France;"", 'Biological Hematology, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France;', 'Departement of Immuno-Hematologie, Institut Cochin, Paris, France; Faculty of Medicine, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France;', 'INSERM U1009, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France;', 'INSERM U1009, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Faculty of Medicine, University Paris-Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France;', 'INSERM U1009, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France;', 'INSERM U1009, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France;', 'Departement of Immuno-Hematologie, Institut Cochin, Paris, France; Faculty of Medicine, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France;', ""Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Departement d'Hematologie et d'Immunologie Biologiques, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France; Faculte de Medecine, Universite Paris-Est Creteil, Creteil, France;"", 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France;', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France;', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Avicenne, Bobigny, France;', 'Clinical Hematology, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France;', 'University of Lille Nord de France, Lille, France; INSERM U837, Team 3, Cancer Research Institute of Lille, Lille, France; Clinical Hematology Unit, Centre Hospitalier Regional Universitaire de Lille, Lille, France; and.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hematologie Clinique, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France;', 'Departement of Immuno-Hematologie, Institut Cochin, Paris, France; Faculty of Medicine, Universite Paris Descartes, Paris, France;', 'INSERM US23, Unite mixte de service 2635, Analyse moleculaire, Modelisation et Imagerie de la maladie Cancereuse, and.', 'INSERM U1009, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; INSERM US23, Unite mixte de service 2635, Analyse moleculaire, Modelisation et Imagerie de la maladie Cancereuse, and.', 'Biostatistics and Epidemiology Service, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.', 'INSERM U1009, Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France; Faculty of Medicine, University Paris-Sud, Le Kremlin-Bicetre, France;']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/*diagnosis/mortality', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Monocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, IgG/*blood', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",2015/04/09 06:00,2015/08/13 06:00,['2015/04/09 06:00'],"['2015/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31582-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-01-620781 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 4;125(23):3618-26. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-01-620781.

Epidemiologic analyses of second primary malignancy (SPM) risk have only been performed in the adult population. Existing data are limited to case series with limited follow-up. The objective of this study was to analyze the elevated risk of SPM attributable to RAI in young patients treated for DTC. METHODS: Population-based analysis of 3850 pediatric and young adult patients (<25 years old) undergoing treatment with surgery with/without RAI for DTC, followed in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registry (1973-2008), equating to 54,727 person-years at risk (PYR). The excess risk of SPM was calculated relative to a reference population and expressed as standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and excess absolute risk (EAR) per 10,000 PYR. Excess risk was compared in RAI-treated and non-RAI-treated patients. RESULTS: A total of 1571 patients (40%) received RAI. The percentage of patients treated with RAI increased over time, from 4% in 1973 to 62% in 2008 (p<0.001). Among patients who received RAI, 26 SPMs were observed, and 18.3 were expected. The relative risk of SPM at any site was significantly elevated (SIR=1.42), corresponding to 4.4 excess cases per 10,000 PYR. SPM risk was not elevated in the non-RAI-treated cohort (SIR=1.01, EAR=0). Patients treated with RAI were at dramatically elevated risk for development of a salivary malignancy (SIR=34.1), corresponding to 1.7 excess cases per 10,000 PYR. The risk of leukemia in RAI-treated patients was elevated (SIR=4.0, EAR=0.9) but did not reach statistical significance. There was no elevated risk of salivary cancer or leukemia in the non-RAI-treated cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric and young adult patients who receive RAI for DTC experience an elevated risk of SPM, mainly salivary gland cancer. These risks appear to be only slightly higher than in adult patients. Over a decade, approximately 1 in 227 RAI-treated patients will develop an SPM, and 1 in 588 RAI-treated patients will develop a salivary cancer, attributable to RAI. Because the expected survival time for young DTC patients is long, it is critical to weigh the benefits of RAI carefully against the small, but real, increase in SPM risk.","['Marti, Jennifer L', 'Jain, Kunal S', 'Morris, Luc G T']","['Marti JL', 'Jain KS', 'Morris LG']","['1Division of Endocrine Surgery, Department of Surgery, Mount Sinai Beth Israel, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York.', '2Head and Neck Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.', '2Head and Neck Service, Department of Surgery, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thyroid,Thyroid : official journal of the American Thyroid Association,9104317,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology', '*Registries', 'SEER Program', 'Salivary Gland Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'United States', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/09 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/04/09 06:00'],"['2015/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/thy.2015.0067 [doi]'],ppublish,Thyroid. 2015 Jun;25(6):681-7. doi: 10.1089/thy.2015.0067.

Azacytidine is a pyrimidine derivative that undergoes metabolic detoxification driven by cytidine deaminase (CDA), a liver enzyme whose gene is prone to genetic polymorphism, leading to erratic activity among patients. Clinical reports have shown that patients with the poor metabolizer (PM) phenotype are likely to experience early severe or lethal toxicities when treated with nucleosidic analogs such as gemcitabine or cytarabine. No clinical data have been available thus far on the relationships between CDA PM status and toxicities in azacytidine-treated patients. Here, we measured CDA activity in a case of severe toxicities with fatal outcome in a patient undergoing standard azacytidine treatment. Results showed that the patient was PM (i.e. residual activity reduced by 63%), thus suggesting that an impaired detoxification step could have given rise to the lethal toxicities observed. This case report calls for further prospective studies investigating the exact role that CDA status plays in the clinical outcome of patients treated with azacytidine.","['Fanciullino, Raphaelle', 'Mercier, Cedric', 'Serdjebi, Cindy', 'Berda, Yael', 'Fina, Frederic', ""Ouafik, L'Houcine"", 'Lacarelle, Bruno', 'Ciccolini, Joseph', 'Costello, Regis']","['Fanciullino R', 'Mercier C', 'Serdjebi C', 'Berda Y', 'Fina F', 'Ouafik L', 'Lacarelle B', 'Ciccolini J', 'Costello R']","['aSMARTc Unit, Pharmacokinetics Laboratory, UMR_911 CRO2 AMU bPharmacy Unit cOnco-Hematology Unit dHematology Laboratory, La Conception University Hospital of Marseille eTransfer Oncology Laboratory, Nord University Hospital of Marseille, APHM, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pharmacogenet Genomics,Pharmacogenetics and genomics,101231005,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', 'B76N6SBZ8R (gemcitabine)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects', 'Azacitidine/*adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/toxicity', 'Cytidine Deaminase/deficiency/*genetics', 'Deoxycytidine/adverse effects/analogs & derivatives/genetics', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/chemically induced/*genetics/mortality', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide']",2015/04/09 06:00,2016/01/26 06:00,['2015/04/09 06:00'],"['2015/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/FPC.0000000000000139 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmacogenet Genomics. 2015 Jun;25(6):317-21. doi: 10.1097/FPC.0000000000000139.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the high diversity in the results from clinical trials using MSCs for such disorders emphasizes the need for MSCs to be ""professionalized"" ex vivo to a more defined regulatory phenotype before administering to patients. To this aim, we have established an ex vivo immunomodulatory triple combination treatment (TCT) for MSCs, using IFNgamma, TGFbeta, and kynurenine. We show that pretreated MSCs acquire an immunomodulatory phenotype, have improved regulatory functions, and upregulate the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), heme oxygenase 1, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and programmed death ligand 1. We define the pathway of kynurenine induced aryl hydrocarbon receptor activation in MSCs and how it contributes to the upregulation of COX2 expression and IL-6 downregulation. The combination of reduced IL-6 secretion with enhanced LIF expression leads to the inhibition of Th17 differentiation in coculture of TCT MSCs and lymphocytes. To test the immunomodulatory function of TCT MSCs in vivo, we used the cells as GVHD prophylaxis in a GVHD mouse model. TCT MSCs administration significantly decreased GVHD score and improved mouse survival. Importantly, single administration could attenuate disease symptoms for more than 3 weeks. Based on these results, we suggest considering TCT MSCs as an improved cell therapy for systemic diseases with an underlying inflammatory and immunologic etiology.

Fourteen patients with CSF3R-mutated CNL (median age 67 years; 57% males) were screened for additional mutations; 8 (57%) and 5 (38%) harbored an ASXL1 and/or SETBP1 mutation (two patients expressed both), respectively. Two patients developed blastic transformation, both SETBP1-mutated and ASXL1-unmutated, whereas two other cases evolved into chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), both ASXL1-mutated and SETBP1-unmutated. Median survival was 23.2 months (10 deaths documented). On multivariable analysis mutated ASXL1 (P = 0.009; HR 19.6, 95% CI 2.1-184.1) and thrombocytopenia (P = 0.005; HR 28.8, 95% CI 2.8-298.2) were independently predictive of shortened survival. This study provides information on the natural history of CSF3R-mutated CNL and identifies mutant ASXL1 and thrombocytopenia as risk factors for survival.

A self-administered questionnaire eliciting feedback about the QPL and assessing its perceived usefulness was mailed to all members of Australian and French patients' national MDS associations. Respectively, 301 MDS patients and 53 caregivers responded. Most (76.4%) were satisfied with the information provided at MDS disclosure but would have liked more information about prognosis (69.3%). Consistently, the three most useful questions focused on the risk of leukaemic transformation, the impact of treatment on chances of survival and the severity of the MDS. The majority (62.9%) of both patients and caregivers perceived the QPL as 'absolutely' useful, particularly those who would have preferred more information about prognosis (adjusted odds ratio=2.3, 95% confidence interval [1.2-4.2], p=0.008).

This syndrome is associated with multiple cancers occurring in childhood. The most common tumors observed with CMMRD include brain tumors, digestive tract tumors, and hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to report new phenotypic expressions of CMMRD syndrome and add new insight to the existing knowledge about this disease. A review of the literature was conducted and recommendation for surveillance and follow-up in patients with CMMRD are proposed. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We report for the first time in the literature, the case of a 22-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with CMMRD syndrome, with the development of 2 unusual tumors: an anaplastic ganglioglioma and an osteosarcoma. She presented initially with an anaplastic ganglioglioma and later developed several malignancies including colonic adenocarcinoma, osteosarcoma, and acute myeloid leukemia. The patient had an atypical course of her disease with development of the initial malignancy at an older age and a remarkably long survival period despite developing aggressive tumors. CONCLUSION: Many aspects of this disease are still unknown. We identified a case of CMMRD in a patient presenting with an anaplastic ganglioglioma, who underwent successful surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy and has had one of the longest survival periods known with this disease. This case broadens the tumor spectrum observed with CMMRD syndrome with anaplastic ganglioglioma and osteosarcoma as new phenotypic expressions of this genetic defect.","['Daou, Badih', 'Zanello, Marc', 'Varlet, Pascale', 'Brugieres, Laurence', 'Jabbour, Pascal', 'Caron, Olivier', 'Lavoine, Noemie', 'Dhermain, Frederic', 'Willekens, Christophe', 'Beuvon, Frederic', 'Malka, David', 'Lechapt-Zalcmann, Emmanuele', 'Abi Lahoud, Georges']","['Daou B', 'Zanello M', 'Varlet P', 'Brugieres L', 'Jabbour P', 'Caron O', 'Lavoine N', 'Dhermain F', 'Willekens C', 'Beuvon F', 'Malka D', 'Lechapt-Zalcmann E', 'Abi Lahoud G']","['*Department of Neurosurgery, Thomas Jefferson University and Jefferson Hospital for Neuroscience, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; double daggerDepartment of Neurosurgery, Sainte-Anne University Hospital, Paris, France; section signParis Descartes University, Paris, France; paragraph signDepartment of Neuropathology, Sainte-Anne Hospital, Paris, France; ||Department of Pediatric Oncology, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France; #Department of Medical Oncology, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France; **Department of Radiotherapy, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France; double daggerdouble daggerDepartment of Hematology, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France; section sign section signDepartment of Pathology, Cochin Hospital, Paris, France; paragraph sign paragraph signDepartment of Gastroenterology, Gustave Roussy Institute, Villejuif, France; || ||Department of Pathology, Caen University Hospital, Caen, France.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,7802914,['Turcot syndrome'],IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/etiology', 'Bone Neoplasms/*etiology', 'Brain Neoplasms/complications/*etiology', 'Colonic Neoplasms/etiology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*complications', 'Female', 'Ganglioglioma/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Neoplastic Syndromes, Hereditary/*complications', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/etiology', 'Osteosarcoma/*etiology', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/09 06:00,2016/01/15 06:00,['2015/04/09 06:00'],"['2015/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1227/NEU.0000000000000754 [doi]'],ppublish,Neurosurgery. 2015 Jul;77(1):E145-52; discussion E152. doi: 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000754.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The evaluation of minimal residual disease was implemented according international standardized protocol (Rawstron A.C. et al. 2007; 21 (5): 956-64). The minimal residual disease negative status was reached in 87 (78%) patients during evaluation of response after 6th course of treatment. The implementation of indicators of residual disease after 3 courses with fludarabine, cyclophosphan and rituximab permitted to sort out two groups of patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia i.e 67 patients with low (< 0.12%) level of minimal residual disease and 45 patients with high (> 0.12%) level of tumor cells. The rate of molecular remission after completion of treatment. in the given groups consisted 100% and 44% correspondingly. The study demonstrates possibilities of early immune phenotype evaluation of minimal residual disease to forecast differences in response to treatment in patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia that makes it possible to avoid undesirable toxicity of therapy or to choose method of consolidation.","['Kisilichina, D G', 'Lugovskaia, C A', 'Naumova, E V', ""Pochtar', M E"", 'Nikitin, E A', 'Dolgov, V V']","['Kisilichina DG', 'Lugovskaia CA', 'Naumova EV', ""Pochtar' ME"", 'Nikitin EA', 'Dolgov VV']",,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Klin Lab Diagn,Klinicheskaia laboratornaia diagnostika,9432021,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions/*blood/pathology', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*blood/chemically induced/pathology', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis']",2015/04/09 06:00,2015/04/30 06:00,['2015/04/09 06:00'],"['2015/04/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Klin Lab Diagn. 2014 Nov;59(11):26-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, issue of diagnostic effectiveness of this indicator is still open-ended in case of patients with oncologic hematological diseases. The level of C-reactive protein can increase under neoplastic processes. On the contrary, the inhibition of immune response observed under cytoplastic therapy can decrease synthesis of this protein. The study was organized to establish levels of C-reactive protein as markers of infection in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leucosis under application of chemotherapy and to evaluate their diagnostic effectiveness. The sampling included 34 patients with acute lymphoblastic leucosis all patients had infectious complications at various stages of treatment. The levels of C-reactive protein in groups of patients with localized infections (mucositis, abscess, pneumonia, etc.) or fever of unknown genesis had no statistical differences but were reliably higher in patients without infectious complications. The concentrations of C-reactive protein in patients with syndrome of systemic inflammatory response and sepsis had no differences. At the same time, level of C-reactive protein under systemic infection (syndrome of systemic inflammatory response, sepsis) was reliably higher than in case of localized infection. The diagnostically reliable levels of C-reactive protein were established as follows: lower than 11 mg/l--infectious complications are lacking; higher than 11 mg/l--availability of infectious process; higher than 82 mg/l--generalization of infection. The given levels are characterized by high diagnostic sensitivity (92% and 97% correspondingly) and specificity (97% and 97%) when patients receive therapy without application of L-asparaginase. At the stages of introduction of this preparation effecting protein synthesizing function of liver sensitivity of proposed criteria are decreased (69% and 55% correspondingly).

Using a three-stage genome-wide association study of 3,437 MPN cases and 10,083 controls, we identify two SNPs with genome-wide significance in JAK2(V617F)-negative MPN: rs12339666 (JAK2; meta-analysis P=1.27 x 10(-10)) and rs2201862 (MECOM; meta-analysis P=1.96 x 10(-9)). Two additional SNPs, rs2736100 (TERT) and rs9376092 (HBS1L/MYB), achieve genome-wide significance when including JAK2(V617F)-positive cases. rs9376092 has a stronger effect in JAK2(V617F)-negative cases with CALR and/or MPL mutations (Breslow-Day P=4.5 x 10(-7)), whereas in JAK2(V617F)-positive cases rs9376092 associates with essential thrombocythemia (ET) rather than polycythemia vera (allelic chi(2) P=7.3 x 10(-7)). Reduced MYB expression, previously linked to development of an ET-like disease in model systems, associates with rs9376092 in normal myeloid cells. These findings demonstrate that multiple germline variants predispose to MPN and link constitutional differences in MYB expression to disease phenotype.","['Tapper, William', 'Jones, Amy V',

However, it is also toxic to normal cells. One proposed anticancer mechanism induced by As might be nitrosative stress (NS). It is believed that antioxidant flavonoids in combination with As might reduce its toxic action on normal cells without interfering with its antitumor action. In the present study, we evaluated the antineoplastic potential of As on breast human cancer lines MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 treated with redox-modulating flavonoids, such as quercetin (Q) and silymarin (S). Even though both cell lines differed about their oxidative responsiveness, their viability was decreased by NS induction through gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase inhibition. Arsenic triggered NS in both MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 cultures, with the formers more sensitive without recovering their pre-treatment capacity. ZR-75-1 cells maintained their antioxidant status, whereas MCF-7 ones treated with S, As, and As + Q did not. Silymarin did not interfere with the described As bioactivity. NS was an anticancer mechanism exerted by As depending on the redox cellular response that could be differentially modified by dietary antioxidants. Hence, it is worthwhile to consider the use of dietary antioxidants as adjuvant in cancer chemotherapy, especially when using As.","['Soria, Elio A', 'Bongiovanni, Guillermina A', 'Lujan, Cintia Diaz', 'Eynard, Aldo R']","['Soria EA', 'Bongiovanni GA', 'Lujan CD', 'Eynard AR']","['a Instituto de Investigaciones en Ciencias de la Salud (INICSA-UNC/CONICET), Facultad de Ciencias Medicas, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba , Cordoba , Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Arsenites)', '0 (Silymarin)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.3.2.2 (gamma-Glutamyltransferase)', 'N5509X556J (arsenite)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Arsenites/*pharmacology', 'Breast Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Nitrosation', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/*drug effects', 'Quercetin/*pharmacology', 'Silymarin/*pharmacology', 'gamma-Glutamyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2015/04/08 06:00,2016/02/24 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2015.1019637 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2015;67(4):659-63. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2015.1019637.

As the main results, the criteria using the exponential log-likelihood loss, log-rank test statistics, the deviance residual under the proportional hazard model, or square error of martingale residual are recommended when it appears that the data have constant hazard with the passage of time. On the other hand, when the data are thought to have decreasing hazard with passage of time, the criterion using the two-sample test statistic, or square error of deviance residual would be optimal.

Formulated in a logical dynamic scheme, our approach drives any initial state to the target state with 100% effectiveness and needs to be applied only transiently for the network to reach and stay in the desired state. We illustrate our method's potential to find intervention targets for cancer treatment and cell differentiation by applying it to a leukemia signaling network and to the network controlling the differentiation of helper T cells. We find that the predicted control targets are effective in a broad dynamic framework.

Currently, benfotiamine is used to treat diabetic neuropathy. We recently reported that oral benfotiamine induced a temporary but remarkable recovery from acute myeloid leukemia in an elderly patient who was ineligible for standard chemotherapy due to dementia and renal failure. In the present study we present evidences that benfotiamine possess antitumor activity against leukemia cells. In a panel of nine myeloid leukemia cell lines benfotiamine impaired the viability of HL-60, NB4, K562 and KG1 cells and also inhibited the growing of primary leukemic blasts. The antitumor activity of benfotiamine is not mediated by apoptosis, necrosis or autophagy, but rather occurs though paraptosis cell death induction. Mechanistic studies revealed that benfotiamine inhibited the activity of constitutively active ERK1/2 and concomitantly increased the phosphorylation of JNK1/2 kinase in leukemic cells. In addition, benfotiamine induced the down regulation of the cell cycle regulator CDK3 which resulted in G1 cell cycle arrest in the sensitive leukemic cells. Moreover, combination index studies showed that benfotiamine enhanced the antiproliferative activities of cytarabine against leukemia cells. These findings suggest that benfotiamine has antitumor therapeutic potential.","['Sugimori, Naomi', 'Espinoza, J Luis', 'Trung, Ly Quoc', 'Takami, Akiyoshi', 'Kondo, Yukio', 'An, Dao Thi', 'Sasaki, Motoko', 'Wakayama, Tomohiko', 'Nakao, Shinji']","['Sugimori N', 'Espinoza JL', 'Trung LQ', 'Takami A', 'Kondo Y', 'An DT', 'Sasaki M', 'Wakayama T', 'Nakao S']","['Department of Hematology Oncology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan Takaramachi 13-1, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan Takaramachi 13-1, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan Takaramachi 13-1, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan Takaramachi 13-1, Kanazawa, Japan; Department of Hematology Oncology, Aichi Medical University School of Medicine, Nagakute, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan Takaramachi 13-1, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan Takaramachi 13-1, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomy and Histology, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology Oncology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan Takaramachi 13-1, Kanazawa, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Chelating Agents)', 'X66NSO3N35 (Thiamine)', 'Y92OUS2H9B (benphothiamine)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Chelating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Thiamine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2015/04/08 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0120709 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-46447 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 7;10(4):e0120709. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0120709. eCollection 2015.,20150407,PMC4388699,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ARG plays important roles in cell morphogenesis, motility, growth and survival, and many of these biological roles overlap with the cellular functions of the ABL kinase. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is associated with constitutive ABL kinase activation resulting from fusion between parts of the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) and ABL1 genes. Similarly, fusion of the ETV6 (Tel) and ARG genes drives some forms of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used for the treatment of CML by inhibiting ABL, and while it also inhibits ARG, there is currently no structure of ARG in complex with dasatinib. Here, the co-crystal structure of the mouse ARG catalytic domain with dasatinib at 2.5 A resolution is reported. Dasatinib-bound ARG is found in the DFG-in conformation although it is nonphosphorylated on the activation-loop tyrosine. In this structure the glycine-rich P-loop is found in a relatively open conformation compared with other known ABL family-inhibitor complex structures.","['Ha, Byung Hak', 'Simpson, Mark Adam', 'Koleske, Anthony J', 'Boggon, Titus J']","['Ha BH', 'Simpson MA', 'Koleske AJ', 'Boggon TJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Acta Crystallogr F Struct Biol Commun,"Acta crystallographica.

The role of Notch signalling has been reported recently in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) - a stem cell disease characterized by BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activation. Therefore, we studied the relationship between BCR-ABL and Notch signalling and assessed the expression patterns of Notch and its downstream target Hes1 in CD34+ stem and progenitor cells from chronic-phase CML patients and bone marrow (BM) from normal subjects (NBM). We found significant upregulation (p<0.05) of Notch1, Notch2 and Hes1 on the most primitive CD34+Thy+ subset of CML CD34+ cells suggesting that active Notch signalling in CML primitive progenitors. In addition, Notch1 was also expressed in distinct lymphoid and myeloid progenitors within the CD34+ population of primary CML cells. To further delineate the possible role and interactions of Notch with BCR-ABL in CD34+ primary cells from chronic-phase CML, we used P-crkl detection as a surrogate assay of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity. Our data revealed that Imatinib (IM) induced BCR-ABL inhibition results in significant (p<0.05) upregulation of Notch activity, assessed by Hes1 expression. Similarly, inhibition of Notch leads to hyperactivation of BCR-ABL. This antagonistic relationship between Notch and BCR-ABL signalling was confirmed in K562 and ALL-SIL cell lines. In K562, we further validated this antagonistic relationship by inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC) - an effector pathway of Hes1, using valproic acid (VPA) - a HDAC inhibitor. Finally, we also confirmed the potential antagonism between Notch and BCR/ABL in In Vivo, using publically available GSE-database, by analysing gene expression profile of paired samples from chronic-phase CML patients pre- and post-Imatinib therapy. Thus, we have demonstrated an antagonistic relationship between Notch and BCR-ABL in CML. A combined inhibition of Notch and BCR-ABL may therefore provide superior clinical response over tyrosine-kinase inhibitor monotherapy by targeting both quiescent leukaemic stem cells and differentiated leukaemic cells and hence must be explored.","['Aljedai, Abdullah', 'Buckle, Anne-Marie', 'Hiwarkar, Prashant', 'Syed, Farhatullah']","['Aljedai A', 'Buckle AM', 'Hiwarkar P', 'Syed F']","['Faculty of Life Sciences, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB), University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB), University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Paediatric Haematology, Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), London, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Life Sciences, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB), University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom; Institute of Inflammation and Repair, Manchester Institute of Biotechnology (MIB), University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH2 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch2)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch2/genetics/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factor HES-1', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2015/04/08 06:00,2016/04/20 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/01/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/20 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0123016 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-04154 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 7;10(4):e0123016. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0123016. eCollection 2015.,20150407,PMC4388554,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While virtually all patients show a good response to initial treatment, more patients respond poorly when treated at relapse. The cellular characteristics of leukemic blast cells that allow survival of initial treatment, relapse development and subsequent resistance to salvage treatment remain largely elusive. Therefore, we studied if leukemic blasts at relapse biologically resemble their initial diagnosis counterparts. We performed microarray gene expression profiling on paired initial and relapse samples of 23 pediatric AML patients. In 11 out of 23 patients, gene expression profiles of initial and corresponding relapse samples end up in different clusters in unsupervised analysis, indicating altered gene expression profiles. In addition, shifts in type I/II mutational status were found in 5 of these 11 patients, while shifts were found in 3 of the remaining 12 patients. Although differentially expressed genes varied between patients, they were commonly related to hematopoietic differentiation, encompassed genes involved in chromatin remodeling and showed associations with similar transcription factors. The top five were CEBPA, GFI1, SATB1, KLF2 and TBP. In conclusion, the leukemic blasts at relapse are biologically different from their diagnosis counterparts.

By comparison, DSB production by 1 requires 2-4 h to achieve maximal values and >8 h to achieve resolution. As evidenced by an alkaline comet unwinding assay, 3 induces extensive DNA damage, suggesting that the observed DSBs arise from closely spaced single-strand breaks (SSBs). Both 1 and 3 induce ataxia telangiectasia mutated- (ATM-) and DNA-dependent protein kinase- (DNA-PK-) dependent production of phospho-SER139-histone H2AX (gammaH2AX) and generation of p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1) foci in K562 cells within 1 h of exposure, which is indicative of activation of nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) repair. Both compounds also lead to ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related- (ATR-) dependent production of gammaH2AX at later time points (6 h post addition), which is indicative of replication stress. 3 is also shown to induce apoptosis. In accord with these data, 1 and 3 were found to be synthetic lethal with certain mutations in DNA DSB repair. 1 potently inhibits the growth of breast cancer type 2, early onset- (BRCA2-) deficient V79 Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line derivative (VC8), and phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten- (PTEN-) deficient human glioblastoma (U251) cell lines, with LC50 values of 1.5 +/- 0.5 and 2.0 +/- 0.6 pM, respectively, and selectivities of >11.6 versus the isogenic cell lines transfected with and expressing functional BRCA2 and PTEN genes. 3 inhibits the growth of the same cell lines with LC50 values of 6.0 +/- 0.5 and 11 +/- 4 nM and selectivities of 84 and 5.1, for the BRCA2 and PTEN mutants, respectively. These data argue for the evaluation of these agents as treatments for tumors that are deficient in BRCA2 and PTEN, among other DSB repair factors.","['Colis, Laureen C', 'Hegan, Denise C', 'Kaneko, Miho', 'Glazer, Peter M', 'Herzon, Seth B']","['Colis LC', 'Hegan DC', 'Kaneko M', 'Glazer PM', 'Herzon SB']","['daggerDepartment of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, United States.', 'double daggerDepartments of Therapeutic Radiology and Genetics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, United States.', 'double daggerDepartments of Therapeutic Radiology and Genetics, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, United States.', 'daggerDepartment of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Am Chem Soc,Journal of the American Chemical Society,7503056,"['0 (BRCA2 Protein)', '0 (Fluorenes)', '0 (lomaiviticin A)', '0 (monolomaiviticin aglycon)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN Phosphohydrolase)', 'EC 3.1.3.67 (PTEN protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'BRCA2 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetulus', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair', 'Fluorenes/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'PTEN Phosphohydrolase/*antagonists & inhibitors/deficiency', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2015/04/08 06:00,2016/03/15 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/ja513117p [doi]'],ppublish,J Am Chem Soc. 2015 May 6;137(17):5741-7. doi: 10.1021/ja513117p.

The ALV-J Env protein is hypothesized to be related to its unique pathogenesis. However, the molecular determinants of Env for ALV-J pathogenesis are unclear. In this study, we compared and analyzed GP37 of ALV-J Env and the EAV-HP sequence, which has high homology to that of ALV-J Env. Phylogenetic analysis revealed five groups of ALV-J GP37 and two novel ALV-J Envs with endemic GP85 and EAV-HP-like GP37. Furthermore, at least 15 virus-adapted mutations were detected in GP37 compared to the EAV-HP sequence. Further analysis demonstrated that three tyrosine-based motifs (YxxM, ITIM (immune tyrosine-based inhibitory motif) and ITAM-like (immune tyrosine-based active motif like)) associated with immune disease and oncogenesis were found in the cytoplasmic tail of GP37. Based on the potential function and distribution of these motifs in GP37, ALV-J Env was grouped into three species, inhibitory Env, bifunctional Env and active Env. Accordingly, 36.91%, 61.74% and 1.34% of ALV-J Env sequences from GenBank are classified as inhibitory, bifunctional and active Env, respectively. Additionally, the Env of the ALV-J prototype strain, HPRS-103, and 17 of 18 EAV-HP sequences belong to the inhibitory Env. And models for signal transduction of the three ALV-J Env species were predicted. Our findings and models provide novel insights for identifying the roles and molecular mechanism of ALV-J Env in the unique pathogenesis of ALV-J.","['Ye, Jianqiang', 'Fan, Zhonglei', 'Shang, Jianjun', 'Tian, Xiaoyan', 'Yang, Jialiang', 'Chen, Hongjun', 'Shao, Hongxia', 'Qin, Aijian']","['Ye J', 'Fan Z', 'Shang J', 'Tian X', 'Yang J', 'Chen H', 'Shao H', 'Qin A']","['Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Avian Preventive Medicine, Yangzhou University, Yangzhou, Jiangsu, P.

However, available Pin1 inhibitors lack the required specificity and potency for inhibiting Pin1 function in vivo. By using mechanism-based screening, here we find that all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)--a therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) that is considered the first example of targeted therapy in cancer, but whose drug target remains elusive--inhibits and degrades active Pin1 selectively in cancer cells by directly binding to the substrate phosphate- and proline-binding pockets in the Pin1 active site. ATRA-induced Pin1 ablation degrades the protein encoded by the fusion oncogene PML-RARA and treats APL in APL cell and animal models as well as in human patients. ATRA-induced Pin1 ablation also potently inhibits triple-negative breast cancer cell growth in human cells and in animal models by acting on many Pin1 substrate oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Thus, ATRA simultaneously blocks multiple Pin1-regulated cancer-driving pathways, an attractive property for treating aggressive and drug-resistant tumors.","['Wei, Shuo', 'Kozono, Shingo', 'Kats, Lev', 'Nechama, Morris', 'Li, Wenzong', 'Guarnerio, Jlenia', 'Luo, Manli', 'You, Mi-Hyeon', 'Yao, Yandan', 'Kondo, Asami', 'Hu, Hai', 'Bozkurt, Gunes', 'Moerke, Nathan J', 'Cao, Shugeng', 'Reschke, Markus', 'Chen, Chun-Hau', 'Rego, Eduardo M', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Cantley, Lewis C', 'Lee, Tae Ho', 'Wu, Hao', 'Zhang, Yan', 'Pandolfi, Pier Paolo', 'Zhou, Xiao Zhen', 'Lu, Kun Ping']","['Wei S', 'Kozono S', 'Kats L', 'Nechama M', 'Li W', 'Guarnerio J', 'Luo M', 'You MH', 'Yao Y', 'Kondo A', 'Hu H', 'Bozkurt G', 'Moerke NJ', 'Cao S', 'Reschke M', 'Chen CH', 'Rego EM', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Cantley LC', 'Lee TH', 'Wu H', 'Zhang Y', 'Pandolfi PP', 'Zhou XZ', 'Lu KP']","['1] Division of Translational Therapeutics, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.

Posterior-distal skeletal elements, such as the ulna/fibula and posterior digits develop in a Sonic hedgehog (Shh)-dependent manner. However, it is poorly understood how anterior-proximal elements, such as the humerus/femur, the radius/tibia and the anterior digits, are developed. Here we show that the zinc finger factors Sall4 and Gli3 cooperate for proper development of the anterior-proximal skeletal elements and also function upstream of Shh-dependent posterior skeletal element development. Conditional inactivation of Sall4 in the mesoderm before limb outgrowth caused severe defects in the anterior-proximal skeletal elements in the hindlimb. We found that Gli3 expression is reduced in Sall4 mutant hindlimbs, but not in forelimbs. This reduction caused posteriorization of nascent hindlimb buds, which is correlated with a loss of anterior digits. In proximal development, Sall4 integrates Gli3 and the Plzf-Hox system, in addition to proliferative expansion of cells in the mesenchymal core of nascent hindlimb buds. Whereas forelimbs developed normally in Sall4 mutants, further genetic analysis identified that the Sall4-Gli3 system is a common regulator of the early limb progenitor cells in both forelimbs and hindlimbs. The Sall4-Gli3 system also functions upstream of the Shh-expressing ZPA and the Fgf8-expressing AER in fore- and hindlimbs. Therefore, our study identified a critical role of the Sall4-Gli3 system at the early steps of limb development for proper development of the appendicular skeletal elements.","['Akiyama, Ryutaro', 'Kawakami, Hiroko', 'Wong, Julia', 'Oishi, Isao', 'Nishinakamura, Ryuichi', 'Kawakami, Yasuhiko']","['Akiyama R', 'Kawakami H', 'Wong J', 'Oishi I', 'Nishinakamura R', 'Kawakami Y']","['Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, Stem Cell Institute.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, Stem Cell Institute.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development.', 'Health Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology, Ikeda, Osaka 563-8577, Japan; and.', 'Department of Kidney Development, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.', 'Department of Genetics, Cell Biology and Development, Stem Cell Institute, Developmental Biology Center, and Lillehei Heart Institute, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455; kawak005@umn.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gli3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Irx3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Irx5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Sall4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein Gli3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Body Patterning', 'Bone and Bones/*embryology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Epistasis, Genetic', 'Forelimb/*embryology/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Hindlimb/*embryology/metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Limb Buds/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc Finger Protein Gli3']",2015/04/08 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1421949112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1421949112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Apr 21;112(16):5075-80. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1421949112.

Our purpose was to determine the outcomes of patients whose disease progressed after allogeneic SCT. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of 72 patients (52 with CLL and 20 with RT) who underwent allogeneic SCT between 1998 and 2011 and had documented progression after transplantation. Twenty-two (31%) never had a response, and 50 (69%) had a response but experienced relapse after a median of 7 months (range, 2 to 85 months). Forty-eight patients who were receiving or were candidates to receive post-SCT cell-based therapies were not included in this analysis. RESULTS: The median age at time of transplantation was 58 years (range, 30 to 72 years). Sixty-two patients (86%) received more than two treatment regimens and 37 (51%) received more than three treatment regimens before SCT. Sixty-six patients (92%) had active disease at the time of transplantation. The 2- and 5-year survival rates were 67% and 38% (patients with CLL) and 36% and 0% (patients with RT). The patients who developed acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease had a longer overall survival (OS; P = .05). In a multivariable analysis, RT or low hemoglobin at the time of SCT predicted shorter OS. Chronic graft-versus-host disease and an initial response to SCT predicted longer OS. CONCLUSION: Patients with CLL in whom allogeneic SCT fails may have a response to and benefit from salvage therapies, and their prognosis is relatively good.","['Rozovski, Uri', 'Benjamini, Ohad', 'Jain, Preetesh', 'Thompson, Philip A', 'Wierda, William G', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Burger, Jan A', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Shpall, Elizabeth', 'Hosing, Chitra', 'Khouri, Issa F', 'Champlin, Richard', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Estrov, Zeev']","['Rozovski U', 'Benjamini O', 'Jain P', 'Thompson PA', 'Wierda WG', ""O'Brien S"", 'Burger JA', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Faderl S', 'Shpall E', 'Hosing C', 'Khouri IF', 'Champlin R', 'Keating MJ', 'Estrov Z']","['All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'All authors: The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. zestrov@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Factor Analysis, Statistical', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Salvage Therapy/methods', '*Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Failure', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/04/08 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['JCO.2014.58.6750 [pii]', '10.1200/JCO.2014.58.6750 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2015 May 10;33(14):1557-63. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2014.58.6750.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION: An 18-year-old adolescent male with refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) had experienced anthracycline-induced congestive heart failure (CHF) for 3 weeks. Under intensive care with conventional therapy, the patient still had exercise intolerance and depended on supplemental oxygen all day. Therefore, he consented to treatment with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for alternative therapy. INTERVENTIONS AND OUTCOMES: This patient was treated with modified Zhi Gan Cao Tang (ZGCT), three times a day for 2 months. After 6 days of CHM treatment, the patient could tolerate daily activity without supplemental oxygen. After 2 months of CHM treatment, the follow-up chest X-ray showed great improvements in pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity resolved slowly following the administration of modified ZGCT. It is suggested that the CHM formula has a protective effect on the progression of CHF secondary to the use of anthracyclines in pediatric cancer.

In the haploidentical-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (haplo-HSCT) setting, CD34(+) donor derived NK cells play a major role in the control of leukemic relapses. Therefore, it is important to better define cytokines that influence NK-cell differentiation from CD34(+) precursors. We analyzed the effects of IL-1beta on NK-cell differentiation from umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34(+) cells. While IL-1beta inhibited CD161(+) CD56(+) cell proliferation, an increased expression of LFA-1, CD94/NKG2A, KIRs, and perforin on CD56(+) cells was detected. In addition, within the CD161(+) CD56(+) IL-1RI(+) LFA-1(-) cell fraction (representing group 3 innate lymphoid cells, ILC3-like cells), a significant increase of EOMES, NKp46, and CD94/NKG2A receptors, cytolytic granules, and IFN-gamma was detected. This increase was paralleled by a decrease of related orphan receptors (RORgammat) TF, NKp44 expression, and IL-22 production. These data suggest that IL-1beta inhibits ILC3- while favoring NK-cell maturation. Since in haplo-HSCT conditioning regimen, infections or residual leukemia cells may induce IL-1beta production, this may influence the NK/ILC3 development from donor-derived CD34(+) precursors.","['Ambrosini, Paolo', 'Loiacono, Fabrizio', 'Conte, Romana', 'Moretta, Lorenzo', 'Vitale, Chiara', 'Mingari, Maria Cristina']","['Ambrosini P', 'Loiacono F', 'Conte R', 'Moretta L', 'Vitale C', 'Mingari MC']","['Dipartimento Medicina Sperimentale (DIMES), Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genova, Italy.', 'UO Immunologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino-Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AOUSM-IST), Genova, Italy.', 'UO Immunologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino-Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AOUSM-IST), Genova, Italy.', 'Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'UO Immunologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino-Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AOUSM-IST), Genova, Italy.', 'Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Medicina Sperimentale (DIMES), Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genova, Italy.', 'UO Immunologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino-Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AOUSM-IST), Genova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Medicina Sperimentale (DIMES), Universita degli Studi di Genova, Genova, Italy.', 'UO Immunologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria San Martino-Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro (AOUSM-IST), Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', 'Cell Separation', 'Fetal Blood/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1beta/*immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2015/04/08 06:00,2015/09/16 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/eji.201445326 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2015 Jul;45(7):2061-71. doi: 10.1002/eji.201445326.

Glucose transporters mediating glucose entry are key proximal rate-limiting checkpoints. Unlike GLUT1 that is highly expressed in cancer and more ubiquitously expressed in normal tissues, GLUT4 exhibits more limited normal expression profiles. We have previously determined that insulin-responsive GLUT4 is constitutively localized on the plasma membrane of myeloma cells. Consequently, suppression of GLUT4 or inhibition of glucose transport with the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir elicited growth arrest and/or apoptosis in multiple myeloma. GLUT4 inhibition also caused sensitization to metformin in multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia and a number of solid tumors suggesting the broader therapeutic utility of targeting GLUT4. This study sought to identify selective inhibitors of GLUT4 to develop a more potent cancer chemotherapeutic with fewer potential off-target effects. Recently, the crystal structure of GLUT1 in an inward open conformation was reported. Although this is an important achievement, a full understanding of the structural biology of facilitative glucose transport remains elusive. To date, there is no three-dimensional structure for GLUT4. We have generated a homology model for GLUT4 that we utilized to screen for drug-like compounds from a library of 18 million compounds. Despite 68% homology between GLUT1 and GLUT4, our virtual screen identified two potent compounds that were shown to target GLUT4 preferentially over GLUT1 and block glucose transport. Our results strongly bolster the utility of developing GLUT4-selective inhibitors as anti-cancer therapeutics.","['Mishra, Rama K', 'Wei, Changyong', 'Hresko, Richard C', 'Bajpai, Richa', 'Heitmeier, Monique', 'Matulis, Shannon M', 'Nooka, Ajay K', 'Rosen, Steven T', 'Hruz, Paul W', 'Schiltz, Gary E', 'Shanmugam, Mala']","['Mishra RK', 'Wei C', 'Hresko RC', 'Bajpai R', 'Heitmeier M', 'Matulis SM', 'Nooka AK', 'Rosen ST', 'Hruz PW', 'Schiltz GE', 'Shanmugam M']","['From the Center for Molecular Innovation and Drug Discovery, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208.', 'the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'the Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.', 'the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'the Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.', 'the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322.', 'the City of Hope, Duarte, California 91010, and.', 'the Department of Pediatrics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110.', 'From the Center for Molecular Innovation and Drug Discovery, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208.', 'the Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322 mala.shan@emory.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 1)', '0 (Glucose Transporter Type 4)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Databases, Pharmaceutical', '*Drug Discovery', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 1/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Glucose Transporter Type 4/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Conformation', 'Small Molecule Libraries/pharmacology']",2015/04/08 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/12/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(19)79504-0 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.628826 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 Jun 5;290(23):14441-53. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.628826.

Mutation of kinase ""gatekeeper"" residues, which control access to an allosteric pocket adjacent to the ATP-binding site, has been frequently implicated in TKI resistance. The molecular underpinnings of gatekeeper mutation-mediated resistance are incompletely understood. We report the first cocrystal structure of FLT3 with the TKI quizartinib, which demonstrates that quizartinib binding relies on essential edge-to-face aromatic interactions with the gatekeeper F691 residue, and F830 within the highly conserved Asp-Phe-Gly motif in the activation loop. This reliance makes quizartinib critically vulnerable to gatekeeper and activation loop substitutions while minimizing the impact of mutations elsewhere. Moreover, we identify PLX3397, a novel FLT3 inhibitor that retains activity against the F691L mutant due to a binding mode that depends less vitally on specific interactions with the gatekeeper position. SIGNIFICANCE: We report the first cocrystal structure of FLT3 with a kinase inhibitor, elucidating the structural mechanism of resistance due to the gatekeeper F691L mutation. PLX3397 is a novel FLT3 inhibitor with in vitro activity against this mutation but is vulnerable to kinase domain mutations in the FLT3 activation loop.","['Smith, Catherine C', 'Zhang, Chao', 'Lin, Kimberly C', 'Lasater, Elisabeth A', 'Zhang, Ying', 'Massi, Evan', 'Damon, Lauren E', 'Pendleton, Matthew', 'Bashir, Ali', 'Sebra, Robert', 'Perl, Alexander', 'Kasarskis, Andrew', 'Shellooe, Rafe', 'Tsang, Garson', 'Carias, Heidi', 'Powell, Ben', 'Burton, Elizabeth A', 'Matusow, Bernice', 'Zhang, Jiazhong', 'Spevak, Wayne', 'Ibrahim, Prabha N', 'Le, Mai H', 'Hsu, Henry H', 'Habets, Gaston', 'West, Brian L', 'Bollag, Gideon', 'Shah, Neil P']","['Smith CC', 'Zhang C', 'Lin KC', 'Lasater EA', 'Zhang Y', 'Massi E', 'Damon LE', 'Pendleton M', 'Bashir A', 'Sebra R', 'Perl A', 'Kasarskis A', 'Shellooe R', 'Tsang G', 'Carias H', 'Powell B', 'Burton EA', 'Matusow B', 'Zhang J', 'Spevak W', 'Ibrahim PN', 'Le MH', 'Hsu HH', 'Habets G', 'West BL', 'Bollag G', 'Shah NP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, California.

Despite several investigations using human specimens and mice models, the exact origin of ATL cells remains unclear. Here we provide a new insight into the hierarchical architecture of ATL cells. HTLV-1-infected cells and dominant ATL clones are successfully traced back to CD45RA(+) T memory stem (TSCM) cells, which were recently identified as a unique population with stemlike properties, despite the fact that the majority of ATL cells are CD45RA(-)CD45RO(+) conventional memory T cells. TSCM cells from ATL patients are capable of both sustaining themselves in less proliferative mode and differentiating into other memory T-cell populations in the rapidly propagating phase. In a xenograft model, a low number of TSCM cells efficiently repopulate identical ATL clones and replenish downstream CD45RO(+) memory T cells, whereas other populations have no such capacities. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the phenotypic and functional heterogeneity and the hierarchy of ATL cells. TSCM cells are identified as the hierarchical apex capable of reconstituting identical ATL clones. Thus, this is the first report to demonstrate the association of a T-cell malignancy with TSCM cells.","['Nagai, Yuya', 'Kawahara, Masahiro', 'Hishizawa, Masakatsu', 'Shimazu, Yayoi', 'Sugino, Noriko', 'Fujii, Sumie', 'Kadowaki, Norimitsu', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi']","['Nagai Y', 'Kawahara M', 'Hishizawa M', 'Shimazu Y', 'Sugino N', 'Fujii S', 'Kadowaki N', 'Takaori-Kondo A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPRC protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/*immunology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice']",2015/04/08 06:00,2015/08/13 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31571-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-607465 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 4;125(23):3527-35. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-607465.

When the cellular energy level is decreased, AMPK is activated and functions to suppress energy-consuming processes, including protein synthesis. Recently, AMPK has received attention as an attractive molecular target for cancer therapy. Several studies have revealed that the activation of AMPK by chemical stimulators, such as metformin, induces apoptosis in a variety of hematologic malignant cells. From another perspective, these results suggest that the function of AMPK is impaired in hematologic tumor cells. However, the precise mechanisms by which this impairment occurs are not well understood. In melanoma cells, oncogenic BRAF constitutively activates the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and phosphorylates liver kinase B1, an upstream activator of 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), resulting in the inactivation of liver kinase B1 and AMPK. In this study, we analyzed whether ERK is involved in the suppression of AMPK activity using established and primary human leukemia cells. We found an inverse correlation between the intensity of ERK activity and the degree of AMPK activation after stimulation with either glucose deprivation or metformin. We also found that the inhibition of ERK activity by U0126 restored AMPK activation after metformin treatment. Furthermore, a combined treatment with metformin and U0126 enhanced the antileukemic activity of metformin. Importantly, metformin induced ERK activation by suppressing the protein levels of dual specificity phosphatase 6, a negative regulator of ERK. This crosstalk between AMPK and ERK could diminish the antileukemic activity of metformin. Taken together, our present observations suggest a novel therapeutic strategy for improving the efficacy of metformin in treating leukemia.","['Kawashima, Ichiro', 'Mitsumori, Toru', 'Nozaki, Yumi', 'Yamamoto, Takeo', 'Shobu-Sueki, Yuki', 'Nakajima, Kei', 'Kirito, Keita']","['Kawashima I', 'Mitsumori T', 'Nozaki Y', 'Yamamoto T', 'Shobu-Sueki Y', 'Nakajima K', 'Kirito K']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Yamanashi, Yamanashi, Japan.

T cells, in particular pathogenic T helper (Th) 1 and Th17 subsets, are a driving force for the induction of GVHD. IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines share a common p40 subunit and play a critical role in driving Th1 differentiation and in stabilizing the Th17 phenotype, respectively. In our current study, we hypothesized that p40 is an essential cytokine in the development of GVHD. By using p40-deficient mice, we found that both donor- and host-derived p40 contribute to the development of aGVHD. Neutralization of p40 with an anti-p40 mAb inhibited Th1- and Th17-polarization in vitro. Furthermore, anti-p40 treatment reduced aGVHD severity while preserving the graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. Alleviation of aGVHD was associated with an increase of Th2 differentiation and a decrease of Th1 and Th17 effector T cells in the GVHD target organs.

These include the detection of the autophagy marker, the microtubule associated protein LC3B, cell cycle analysis of LC3B expression, increase in lysosomal mass, as well as organelle specific autophagy and the measurement of mitochondrial function. We employed a range of autophagy inducing agents to determine the degree of LC3B up-regulation and corresponding cell cycle distribution, increase in lysosomal mass and mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as the relative preference for the specific type of microautophagy or organelle phagy. A variety of autophagy inducing agents were compared these included rapamycin, chloroquine, various nutrient starvation treatments on two cell types, Jurkat T-cell leukaemia and K562 erythromyeloid leukaemia cell lines. Given that numerous autophagy inducing agents cause cell cycle arrest, the cell cycle phase distribution was investigated and LC3B antigen was shown to increase as cells progressed through the cell cycle. LysoTracker dyes have been previously employed to investigate the autophagic process and here the LysoTracker signal increased in autophagic cells in relation to controls. Organelle autophagy of mitochondria and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), termed mitophagy and ER phagy was determined flow cytometrically by the employment of organelle mass probes, MitoTracker Green (MTG) and ER Tracker Green (ERTG). A modification of the cell cycle analysis width and area analysis employed for DNA content determinations was developed to show changes in organelle mass on a linear scale. Relative changes in linear scaled median fluorescence intensity (MFI) was compared to control cells to determine the degree and type of organelle phagy induced by a range of autophagy inducing agents and treatments. These flow cytometric organelle phagy and lysosome mass assays can be used by researchers to study the autophagic process further in terms of cell and mitochondrial functionality over time in a cell dependent manner as an adjunct to LC3B measurements.","['Warnes, G']",['Warnes G'],"['Flow Cytometry Core Facility, The Blizard Institute, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary London University, 4 Newark Street, London E1 2AT, United Kingdom.

Recent studies have shown that wogonin induces cell cycle arrest and reverses multi-drug resistance in the human K562 leukemia cell line. However, its pharmacological function in the apoptosis of leukemia cells remains unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that wogonin can induce apoptosis in the HL-60 leukemia cell line. In the present study, the HL-60 cells were treated with different doses of wogonin (0-150 microM). Wogonin inhibited the viability of HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Flow cytometry and analyses of caspase and PARP-1 activation and the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, demonstrated that the cytotoxic effect of wogonin on HL-60 cells was mediated by caspase-dependent and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. Wogonin also induced the expression of certain members of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway (CHOP, GRP94 and GRP78) and the activation of multiple branches of ER stress transducers (IRE1alpha, PERK-eIF2alpha and ATF6) in the HL-60 cells. In addition, wogonin reduced the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT in the HL-60 cells. Furthermore, constitutive activation of AKT induced by adenoviral vectors inhibited the pro-apoptotic effects and ER stress induced by wogonin in the HL-60 cells. In summary, our results indicated that wogonin induced apoptosis and ER stress in HL-60 cells, which was mediated by the inhibition of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.","['Hu, Chengjun', 'Xu, Maozhong', 'Qin, Rujuan', 'Chen, Weifeng', 'Xu, Xin']","['Hu C', 'Xu M', 'Qin R', 'Chen W', 'Xu X']","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Jiangyin Hospital of Southeast University Medical College, Jiangyin, Jiangsu 214400, P.R.

Virtually all cases of NSLH are caused by an invariant and functionally unique mutation in SHOC2 (c.4A>G, p.Ser2Gly). Here, we report on a child with molecularly confirmed NSLH who developed a neuroblastoma, first suspected at the age 3 months by abdominal ultrasound examination. Based on this finding, scanning of the SHOC2 coding sequence encompassing the c.4A>G change was performed on selected pediatric cohorts of malignancies documented to occur in RASopathies (i.e., neuroblastoma, brain tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma, acute lymphoblastic, and myeloid leukemia), but failed to identify a functionally relevant cancer-associated variant. While these results do not support a major role of somatic SHOC2 mutations in these pediatric cancers, this second instance of neuroblastoma in NSLAH suggests a possible predisposition to this malignancy in subjects heterozygous for the c.4A>G SHOC2 mutation.","['Garavelli, Livia', 'Cordeddu, Viviana', 'Errico, Stefania', 'Bertolini, Patrizia', 'Street, Maria Elisabeth', 'Rosato, Simonetta', 'Pollazzon, Marzia', 'Wischmeijer, Anita', 'Ivanovski, Ivan', 'Daniele, Paola', 'Bacchini, Ermanno', 'Lombardi, Alfonsa Anna', 'Izzi, Giancarlo', 'Biasucci, Giacomo', 'Del Rossi, Carmine', 'Corradi, Domenico', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Dominici, Carlo', 'Rossi, Cesare', 'De Luca, Alessandro', 'Bernasconi, Sergio', 'Riccardi, Riccardo', 'Legius, Eric', 'Tartaglia, Marco']","['Garavelli L', 'Cordeddu V', 'Errico S', 'Bertolini P', 'Street ME', 'Rosato S', 'Pollazzon M', 'Wischmeijer A', 'Ivanovski I', 'Daniele P', 'Bacchini E', 'Lombardi AA', 'Izzi G', 'Biasucci G', 'Del Rossi C', 'Corradi D', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Dominici C', 'Rossi C', 'De Luca A', 'Bernasconi S', 'Riccardi R', 'Legius E', 'Tartaglia M']","['Clinical Genetics Unit, Department of Obstetrics and Pediatrics, IRCCS S.

Herein, we review the history of the events, observations, and discussions that led to this replacement. We also provide a systematic analysis of all previously reported cases of T-PLL-sv as well as our four new additional cases. Despite the higher frequency of a normal karyotype and perhaps an overrepresented CD4(-) CD8(-) immunophenotype among these patients (compared to T-PLL in general) as well as bland morphology (that makes them superficially appear more similar to B-CLL), we argue that the current World Health Organization (WHO)-based classification as T-PLL-sv is adequate and should continue for the time being. Morphologically, T-PLL-sv represents approximately one-fifth of all T-PLL cases. However, morphology alone does not determine the clinical course and should not be the basis for clinical decision making and prognostication. We propose a clonal evolution model in which mature T-cell leukemias classified in the past as T-CLL are perhaps T-PLL diagnosed early in the course of the disease. Future research using next-generation sequencing, comparative genomic hybridization, and molecular array studies, including serial analyses of individual cases over time, is needed to better identify this rarely diagnosed, inherently controversial form of T-cell leukemia.","['Rashidi, Armin', 'Fisher, Stephen I']","['Rashidi A', 'Fisher SI']","['Division of Oncology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.', 'Pathology Sciences Medical Group/Sentara Laboratory Services, Norfolk, VA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Animals', 'Clonal Evolution', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/etiology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/*diagnosis/etiology/metabolism', 'Research']",2015/04/08 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2015/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12560 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2015 Sep;95(3):199-210. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12560.

The non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 d and 4 yr was 30% (95% C.I., 13-46%) and 47% (95% C.I., 29-65%), respectively. EBV-related post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-PTLD) accounted for more than one-third of transplant-related death, with an estimate incidence of 26% (95% C.I., 9-44). The incidence of relapse at 4 yr was 25% (95% C.I., 9-42%). Four-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 28% and 30%, respectively. Despite a high NRM and an unexpected high incidence of EBV-PTLD, UCBT in heavily pretreated HD patients is an option for patients lacking a suitable adult donor, provided the disease is not in refractory relapse.","['Pinana, Jose Luis', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Esquirol, Albert', 'Martino, Rodrigo', 'Picardi, Alessandra', 'Barba, Pere', 'Parody, Rocio', 'Gayoso, Jorge', 'Montesinos, Pau', 'Guidi, Stefano', 'Terol, Maria Jose', 'Moscardo, Federico', 'Solano, Carlos', 'Arcese, William', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Sierra, Jorge', 'Sanz, Guillermo']","['Pinana JL', 'Sanz J', 'Esquirol A', 'Martino R', 'Picardi A', 'Barba P', 'Parody R', 'Gayoso J', 'Montesinos P', 'Guidi S', 'Terol MJ', 'Moscardo F', 'Solano C', 'Arcese W', 'Sanz MA', 'Sierra J', 'Sanz G']","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Fundacion INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Rome Transplant Network, UOC Trapianto di Cellule Staminali, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', ""Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitari Vall D'Hebron, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Gregorio Maranon, Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Department of Hematology, AOU Careggi, Florence, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Fundacion INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Fundacion INCLIVA, Valencia, Spain.', 'Rome Transplant Network, UOC Trapianto di Cellule Staminali, Universita di Roma Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'Medicine Department, Universitat de Valencia, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, IIB Sant Pau and Jose Carreras Leukemia Research Institute, Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '905Z5W3GKH (Thiotepa)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Busulfan/therapeutic use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology/mortality/pathology/prevention & control', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/pathogenicity', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology/mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Infectious Mononucleosis/*etiology/immunology/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thiotepa/therapeutic use', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2015/04/08 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2015/03/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12557 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2016 Feb;96(2):128-35. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12557.

Microtubules are synthesized by polymerization of alphabeta tubulin heterodimers called protofilaments. Microtubule dynamics facilitate proper cell division during mitosis. Disruption of microtubule dynamics by small-molecule agents inhibits mitosis, resulting in apoptotic cell death and preventing cell cycle progression. To identify a novel small molecule that binds the alphabeta tubulin interface to affect microtubule dynamics, we developed a bioactive conformation alignment pharmacophore (BCAP) model to screen tubulin inhibitors from a huge database. The application of BCAP model generated based on the known alphabeta-tubulin interface binders enabled us to identify several small-molecules that cause apoptosis in human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. Virtual screening combined with an in vitro assay yielded 15 cytotoxic molecules. In particular, ethyl 2-(4-(5-methyl-3-nitro-1H-pyrazol-1-yl)butanamido)-4-phenylthiophene-3-carboxylat e (H05) inhibited tubulin polymerization with an IC50 of 17.6 mum concentration. The virtual screening results suggest that the application of an unbiased BCAP pharmacophore greatly eliminates unlikely compounds from a huge database and maximizes screening success. From the limited compounds tested in the tubulin polymerization inhibitor (TPI) assay, compound H05 was discovered as a tubulin inhibitor. This compound requires further structure activity optimization to identify additional potent inhibitors from the same class of molecules.","['Nagarajan, Shanthi', 'Choi, Min Jeong', 'Cho, Yong Seo', 'Min, Sun-Joon', 'Keum, Gyochang', 'Kim, Soo Jin', 'Lee, Chang Sik', 'Pae, Ae Nim']","['Nagarajan S', 'Choi MJ', 'Cho YS', 'Min SJ', 'Keum G', 'Kim SJ', 'Lee CS', 'Pae AN']","['Center for Neuro-Medicine, Brain Science Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Hwarangno 14-gil 5, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 136-791, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Korea University of Science and Technology, 52 Eoeun dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305-333, Korea.', 'Center for Neuro-Medicine, Brain Science Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Hwarangno 14-gil 5, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 136-791, Korea.', 'Chemistry & Nano Science, Ewha Womans University, 11-1 Daehyun-Dong, Seodaemun-Gu, Seoul, 120-750, Korea.', 'Center for Neuro-Medicine, Brain Science Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Hwarangno 14-gil 5, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 136-791, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Korea University of Science and Technology, 52 Eoeun dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305-333, Korea.', 'Center for Neuro-Medicine, Brain Science Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Hwarangno 14-gil 5, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 136-791, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Korea University of Science and Technology, 52 Eoeun dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305-333, Korea.', 'Center for Neuro-Medicine, Brain Science Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Hwarangno 14-gil 5, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 136-791, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Korea University of Science and Technology, 52 Eoeun dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305-333, Korea.', 'Chong Kun Dang Research Institute, CKD Pharmaceuticals, Jung-dong, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, 464-3, Korea.', 'Chong Kun Dang Research Institute, CKD Pharmaceuticals, Jung-dong, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, 464-3, Korea.', 'Center for Neuro-Medicine, Brain Science Institute, Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Hwarangno 14-gil 5, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, 136-791, Korea.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry, Korea University of Science and Technology, 52 Eoeun dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon, 305-333, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Chem Biol Drug Des,Chemical biology & drug design,101262549,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Drug Design', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Small Molecule Libraries/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Thiophenes/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/*metabolism', 'Tubulin Modulators/*chemistry/*pharmacology']",2015/04/08 06:00,2016/08/02 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2015/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/20 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cbdd.12568 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Biol Drug Des. 2015 Nov;86(5):998-1016. doi: 10.1111/cbdd.12568.

METHODS: The authors investigated patients with de novo and secondary APL who were included in the ongoing APL-2006 trial. Patients with secondary APL who were included in that trial also were compared with a previous retrospective cohort of patients with secondary APL. RESULTS: In the APL-2006 trial, 42 of 280 patients (15%) had secondary APL. Compared with the retrospective cohort, patients with secondary APL in the APL-2006 trial had a lower incidence of prior breast carcinoma (35.7% vs 57%; P = .03) and a higher incidence of prior prostate carcinoma (26.2% vs 4.7%; P < .001). Treatment of the primary tumor in the APL-2006 trial less frequently included combined radiochemotherapy (28.6% vs 47.2%; P = .044) and no mitoxantrone (0% vs 46.7%; P = .016) but more frequently included anthracyclines (53.3% vs 38.3%; P = .015). In the APL-2006 trial, patients who had secondary APL, compared with those who had de novo APL, were older (mean, 60.2 years vs 48.7 years, respectively; P < .0001) but had a similar complete response rate (97.6% vs 90.3%, respectively), cumulative incidence of relapse (0% vs 1.8%, respectively), and overall survival (92.3% vs 90.9%, respectively) at 18 months. CONCLUSIONS: Although the incidence of secondary APL appears to be stable over time, evolving strategies for the treatment of primary cancers have reduced its occurrence among breast cancer patients but have increased its incidence among patients with prostate cancer. The current results confirm prospectively that patients with secondary APL have characteristics and outcomes similar to those of patients with de novo APL.","['Braun, Thorsten', 'Cereja, Sophie', 'Chevret, Sylvie', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Beaumont, Marie', 'Detourmignies, Laurence', 'Pigneux, Arnaud', 'Thomas, Xavier', 'Bordessoule, Dominique', 'Guerci, Agnes', 'Lamy, Thierry', 'Recher, Christian', 'Poire, Xavier', 'Tournilhac, Olivier', 'Spertini, Olivier', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Degos, Laurent', 'Dombret, Herve', 'Ades, Lionel', 'Fenaux, Pierre']","['Braun T', 'Cereja S', 'Chevret S', 'Raffoux E', 'Beaumont M', 'Detourmignies L', 'Pigneux A', 'Thomas X', 'Bordessoule D', 'Guerci A', 'Lamy T', 'Recher C', 'Poire X', 'Tournilhac O', 'Spertini O', 'Chomienne C', 'Degos L', 'Dombret H', 'Ades L', 'Fenaux P']","['Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University of Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University of Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Biostatistics, St Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University of Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, St Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University of Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Deparment of Hematology, Hospital Dunkerque, Dunkerque, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Roubaix Hospital, Roubaix, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Haut-Leveque University Hospital, Pessac, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon University Hospital, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Limoges University Hospital, Limoges, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Nancy University Hospital, Nancy, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Rennes University Hospital, Rennes, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Purpan University Hospital, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Hematology, St Louis-Brussels University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM) Unit 940, St Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University of Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, St Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University of Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, St Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University of Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University of Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Hematology Seniors, St Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University of Paris 7, Paris, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Avicenne Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University of Paris 13, Bobigny, France.', 'Department of Hematology Seniors, St Louis Hospital, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, University of Paris 7, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anthracyclines/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Belgium/epidemiology', 'Chemoradiotherapy', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/*epidemiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",2015/04/08 06:00,2015/10/03 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2014/12/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29389 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Jul 15;121(14):2393-9. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29389.

However, it is unclear whether cancer cell lines employ a high level of glycolysis comparable to that of the original cancers from which they were derived, even if their culture conditions are changed to physiologically relevant oxygen concentrations. From three childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients we established three new pairs of cell lines in both atmospheric (20%) and physiologic (bone marrow level, 5%) oxygen concentrations. Cell lines established in 20% oxygen exhibited lower proliferation, survival, expression of glycolysis genes, glucose consumption, and lactate production. Interestingly, the effects of oxygen concentration used during cell line initiation were only partially reversible when established cell cultures were switched from one oxygen concentration to another for eight weeks. These observations indicate that ALL cell lines established at atmospheric oxygen concentration can exhibit relatively low levels of glycolysis and these levels are semi-permanent, suggesting that physiologic oxygen concentrations may be needed from the time of cell line initiation to preserve the high level of glycolysis commonly exhibited by leukemias in vivo.","['Sheard, Michael A', 'Ghent, Matthew V', 'Cabral, Daniel J', 'Lee, Joanne C', 'Khankaldyyan, Vazgen', 'Ji, Lingyun', 'Wu, Samuel Q', 'Kang, Min H', 'Sposto, Richard', 'Asgharzadeh, Shahab', 'Reynolds, C Patrick']","['Sheard MA', 'Ghent MV', 'Cabral DJ', 'Lee JC', 'Khankaldyyan V', 'Ji L', 'Wu SQ', 'Kang MH', 'Sposto R', 'Asgharzadeh S', 'Reynolds CP']","['Developmental Therapeutics Program, USC-CHLA Institute for Pediatric Clinical Research, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, 4650 Sunset Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.

However, a few data known about the prognostic value of absolute monocyte count in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. AIM: The aim of the authors was to investigate the impact of absolute monocyte count measured at the time of diagnosis in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia on the time to treatment and overal survival. METHOD: Between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2012, 223 patients with newly-diagnosed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia were included. The rate of patients needing treatment, time to treatment, overal survival and causes of mortality based on Rai stages, CD38, ZAP-70 positivity and absolute monocyte count were analyzed. RESULTS: Therapy was necessary in 21.1%, 57.4%, 88.9%, 88.9% and 100% of patients in Rai stage 0, I, II, III an IV, respectively; in 61.9% and 60.8% of patients exhibiting CD38 and ZAP-70 positivity, respectively; and in 76.9%, 21.2% and 66.2% of patients if the absolute monocyte count was <0.25 G/l, between 0.25-0.75 G/l and >0.75 G/l, respectively. The median time to treatment and the median overal survival were 19.5, 65, and 35.5 months; and 41.5, 65, and 49.5 months according to the three groups of monocyte counts. The relative risk of beginning the therapy was 1.62 (p<0.01) in patients with absolute monocyte count <0.25 G/l or >0.75 G/l, as compared to those with 0.25-0.75 G/l, and the risk of overal survival was 2.41 (p<0.01) in patients with absolute monocyte count lower than 0.25 G/l as compared to those with higher than 0.25 G/l. The relative risks remained significant in Rai 0 patients, too. The leading causes of mortality were infections (41.7%) and the chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (58.3%) in patients with low monocyte count, while tumours (25.9-35.3%) and other events (48.1 and 11.8%) occurred in patients with medium or high monocyte counts. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with low and high monocyte counts had a shorter time to treatment compared to patients who belonged to the intermediate monocyte count group. The low absolute monocyte count was associated with increased mortality caused by infectious complications and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The absolute monocyte count may give additional prognostic information in Rai stage 0, too.","['Szerafin, Laszlo', 'Jako, Janos', 'Risko, Ferenc']","['Szerafin L', 'Jako J', 'Risko F']","['Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg Megyei Josa Andras Oktatokorhaz Hematologiai Osztaly Nyiregyhaza Szent Istvan u. 68. 4400.', 'Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg Megyei Josa Andras Oktatokorhaz Hematologiai Osztaly Nyiregyhaza Szent Istvan u. 68. 4400.', 'Szabolcs-Szatmar-Bereg Megyei Josa Andras Oktatokorhaz Surgossegi Betegellato Centrum Nyiregyhaza.']",['hun'],['Journal Article'],Hungary,Orv Hetil,Orvosi hetilap,0376412,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (ZAP70 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hungary/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology/*immunology/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', '*Monocytes', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'ZAP-70 Protein-Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism']",2015/04/08 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2015/04/08 06:00'],"['2015/04/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['9025863064182821 [pii]', '10.1556/OH.2015.30126 [doi]']",ppublish,Orv Hetil. 2015 Apr;156(15):592-7. doi: 10.1556/OH.2015.30126.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['absolute monocyte count', 'abszolut monocytaszam', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'kezelesig eltelt ido', 'kronikus lymphoid leukaemia', 'overall survival', 'prognosis', 'prognozis', 'time to treatment', 'tuleles']",,,,,,Az abszolut monocytaszam prognosztikus erteke kronikus lymphoid leukaemiaban.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 18 225 men diagnosed with prostate cancer after another malignancy from 1973 to 2006. We compared demographic and clinical variables, and the proportion of death from prostate cancer vs prior malignancy with t-test and chi-squared analyses. Fine and Gray's regression was used to consider the effect of treatment on prostate cancer death. We then studied a second cohort of 88 013 men with prostate cancer as a first or second malignancy to describe current diagnostic and treatment patterns. RESULTS: One in seven men died from prostate cancer in our first cohort. More died from prostate cancer following colorectal cancer (16.8% vs 13.7%), melanoma (13.4% vs 7.56%), and oral cancer (19.1% vs 4.04%), but fewer following bladder cancer, kidney cancer, lung cancer, leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (all P < 0.001). Prostate cancer treatment was associated with a nearly 50% lower risk of death when high-grade or high-stage (adjusted hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.47-0.64). Patients who died from prostate cancer had higher grade and stage disease, and received less treatment than patients who died from prior malignancy. The second cohort showed subsequent prostate cancer had more high-risk disease (36.3% vs 22.2%, P < 0.001) and less prostate cancer treatment (adjusted odds ratio 0.872, 95% CI 0.818-0.930) than primary prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer remains a significant cause of mortality when diagnosed as a subsequent cancer. These results suggest prostate cancer treatment should be seriously considered in patients with prior malignancies, especially those with high-grade or locally advanced prostate cancer.","['Dinh, Kathryn T', 'Mahal, Brandon A', 'Ziehr, David R', 'Muralidhar, Vinayak', 'Chen, Yu-Wei', 'Viswanathan, Vidya B', 'Nezolosky, Michelle D', 'Beard, Clair J', 'Choueiri, Toni K', 'Martin, Neil E', 'Orio, Peter F', 'Sweeney, Christopher J', 'Trinh, Quoc-Dien', 'Nguyen, Paul L']","['Dinh KT', 'Mahal BA', 'Ziehr DR', 'Muralidhar V', 'Chen YW', 'Viswanathan VB', 'Nezolosky MD', 'Beard CJ', 'Choueiri TK', 'Martin NE', 'Orio PF', 'Sweeney CJ', 'Trinh QD', 'Nguyen PL']","[""Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA."", ""Harvard T.H.

Securinine (1), the most abundant and studied alkaloid of this series was isolated by Russian researchers in 1956. In the following years, French and Japanese scientists reported other Securinega compounds and extensive work was done to elucidate their intriguing structures. The homogeneity of this family relies mainly on its tetracyclic chemical backbone, which features a butenolide moiety (cycle D) and an azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane ring system (rings B and C). Interestingly, after a period of latency of 20 years, the Securinega topic reemerged as a prolific source of new natural structures and to date more than 50 compounds have been identified and characterized. The oligomeric subgroup gathering dimeric, trimeric, and tetrameric units is of particular interest. The unprecedented structure of the Securinega alkaloids was the subject of extensive synthetic efforts culminating in several efficient and elegant total syntheses. The botanical distribution of these alkaloids seems limited to the Securinega, Flueggea, Margaritaria, and Breynia genera (Phyllanthaceae). However, only a limited number of plant species have been considered for their alkaloid contents, and additional phytochemical as well as genetic studies are needed. Concerning the biosynthesis, experiments carried out with radiolabelled aminoacids allowed to identify lysine and tyrosine as the precursors of the piperidine ring A and the CD rings of securinine (1), respectively. Besides, plausible biosynthetic pathways were proposed for virosaine A (38) and B (39), flueggine A (46), and also the different oligomers flueggenine A-D (48-51), fluevirosinine A (56), and flueggedine (20). The case of nirurine (45) and secu'amamine (37) remains elusive and additional studies seem necessary to understand their mode of production. The scope of biological of activities of the Securinega alkaloids was mainly centered on the CNS activity of securinine (1), although the exact mechanism of action remained in part unknown. Nevertheless, for its stimulant and antispasmodic effects securinine nitrate was marketed as a drug in the USSR until the early 1990s. Moreover, securinine (1) and several other Securinega alkaloids recently demonstrated promising anticancer properties. In particular securinine (1) demonstrated markedly benefits in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Chirkin, Eqor', 'Atkatlian, William', 'Poree, Francois-Hugues']","['Chirkin E', 'Atkatlian W', 'Poree FH']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Alkaloids Chem Biol,The Alkaloids.

We do not yet, however, have networks that integrate information from all datasets available for a particular clinical condition. This is in part due to the limited scalability, in terms of required computational time and power, of existing algorithms. Network reconstruction methods should also be scalable in the sense of allowing scientists from different backgrounds to efficiently integrate additional data. We present a network model of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In the current version (AML 2.1), we have used gene expression data (both microarray and RNA-seq) from 5 different studies comprising a total of 771 AML samples and a protein-protein interactions dataset. Our scalable network reconstruction method is in part based on the well-known property of gene expression correlation among interacting molecules. The difficulty of distinguishing between direct and indirect interactions is addressed by optimizing the coefficient of variation of gene expression, using a validated gold-standard dataset of direct interactions. Computational time is much reduced compared to other network reconstruction methods. A key feature is the study of the reproducibility of interactions found in independent clinical datasets. An analysis of the most significant clusters, and of the network properties (intraset efficiency, degree, betweenness centrality, and PageRank) of common AML mutations demonstrated the biological significance of the network. A statistical analysis of the response of blast cells from 11 AML patients to a library of kinase inhibitors provided an experimental validation of the network. A combination of network and experimental data identified CDK1, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 and other kinases as potential therapeutic targets in AML.","['Ong, Edison', 'Szedlak, Anthony', 'Kang, Yunyi', 'Smith, Peyton', 'Smith, Nicholas', 'McBride, Madison', 'Finlay, Darren', 'Vuori, Kristiina', 'Mason, James', 'Ball, Edward D', 'Piermarocchi, Carlo', 'Paternostro, Giovanni']","['Ong E', 'Szedlak A', 'Kang Y', 'Smith P', 'Smith N', 'McBride M', 'Finlay D', 'Vuori K', 'Mason J', 'Ball ED', 'Piermarocchi C', 'Paternostro G']","['1 Salgomed Inc. , Del Mar, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Comput Biol,Journal of computational biology : a journal of computational molecular cell biology,9433358,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Ontology', '*Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', '*Protein Interaction Maps', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Transcriptome']",2015/04/07 06:00,2016/01/05 06:00,['2015/04/07 06:00'],"['2015/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1089/cmb.2014.0297 [doi]'],ppublish,J Comput Biol. 2015 Apr;22(4):266-88. doi: 10.1089/cmb.2014.0297.,,PMC4394180,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'gene networks']",,,,"['P30 CA030199/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R41CA174059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This panel, in conjunction with previous structural and functional studies, starts to provide a more comprehensive portrait of this interactome, explains promiscuity, and uncovers surprising details; for example, the Bcl-xL R139A mutation disrupts binding to all helices but the Bad-BH3 peptide, and Mcl-1 binding is particularly perturbed by only four mutations of the 12 tested (V220A, N260A, R263A, and F319A), while Bcl-xL and Bcl-2 have a more diverse set of important residues depending on the bound helix.","['Campbell, Sean T', 'Carlson, Kevin J', 'Buchholz, Carl J', 'Helmers, Mark R', 'Ghosh, Indraneel']","['Campbell ST', 'Carlson KJ', 'Buchholz CJ', 'Helmers MR', 'Ghosh I']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Arizona, 1306 East University Boulevard, Tucson, Arizona 85721, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Arizona, 1306 East University Boulevard, Tucson, Arizona 85721, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Arizona, 1306 East University Boulevard, Tucson, Arizona 85721, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Arizona, 1306 East University Boulevard, Tucson, Arizona 85721, United States.', 'Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, University of Arizona, 1306 East University Boulevard, Tucson, Arizona 85721, United States.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '0 (luciferase, Photinus)', 'EC 1.13.12.7 (Luciferases, Firefly)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell-Free System', 'Fireflies', 'Humans', 'Luciferases, Firefly', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/*chemistry/genetics/metabolism']",2015/04/07 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2015/04/07 06:00'],"['2015/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/bi501505y [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 2015 Apr 28;54(16):2632-43. doi: 10.1021/bi501505y.

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinicopathologic characteristics of patients with malignant mesothelioma and hematologic malignancies with and without a history of radiotherapy. DESIGN: From a database of approximately 3600 patients with malignant mesothelioma, we identified 45 patients (1%) who also had hematologic malignancies. We examined clinicopathologic features and noted whether the patient had received radiotherapy for malignancy, comparing those with and those without such exposure. RESULTS: Among the 45 cases, 18 (40%) had Hodgkin lymphoma, 15 (33%) had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 10 (4%) had chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and 2 (22%) had chronic myelogenous leukemia; 20 patients (44%) had a history of radiotherapy, and 23 (51%) did not. Most patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (16 of 18; 90.0%) received radiation, whereas none of the patients with leukemia (0 of 12) and only 20% (3 of 15) of the patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma did so. Patients without radiation were older than patients who received radiotherapy (median, 73 versus 54 years, respectively; P < .001), had a shorter interval from diagnosis of hematologic malignancy to that of mesothelioma (median, 2 versus 24 years, respectively; P < .001), and had a shorter survival period (median, 6.0 versus 14.0 months, respectively; P = .02). Epithelial mesotheliomas were proportionately more common in patients with a history of radiotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with mesothelioma and hematologic malignancies with a history of radiation tended to be younger, had a longer interval from diagnosis of hematologic malignancy to that of mesothelioma, had a longer survival period, and were more likely to have the epithelial variant compared with patients without radiotherapy.","['Li, Xin', 'Brownlee, Noel A', 'Sporn, Thomas A', 'Mahar, Annabelle', 'Roggli, Victor L']","['Li X', 'Brownlee NA', 'Sporn TA', 'Mahar A', 'Roggli VL']","['From the Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina (Drs Roggli and Sporn); the Department of Pathology, Tianjin Haihe Hospital, Tianjin Institute of Respiratory Diseases, Tianjin, China (Dr Li); the Pathology Associates of Greenville, Greenville, South Carolina (Dr Brownlee); and the Department of Anatomical Pathology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Camperdown, New South Wales, Australia (Dr Mahar).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,['1332-21-4 (Asbestos)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Asbestos/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*pathology/radiotherapy', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Male', 'Mesothelioma/etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Mesothelioma, Malignant', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/etiology/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/pathology', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/07 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/04/07 06:00'],"['2015/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.5858/arpa.2014-0569-OA [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2015 Sep;139(9):1129-36. doi: 10.5858/arpa.2014-0569-OA.

Cancer becomes intractable when it spreads from the primary tumor site to various organs (such as bone, lung, liver, and then brain). Unlike solid tumor cells, cancer stem cells and metastatic cancer cells grow in a non-attached (suspension) form when moving from their source to other locations in the body. Due to the non-attached growth nature, metastasis is often first detected in the circulatory systems, for instance in a lymph node near the primary tumor. Cancer research over the past several decades has primarily focused on treating solid tumors, but targeted therapy to treat cancer stem cells and cancer metastasis has yet to be developed. Because cancers undergo faster metabolism and consume more glucose than normal cells, glucose was chosen in this study as a reagent to target cancer cells. In particular, by covalently binding gold nanoparticles (GNPs) with thio-PEG (polyethylene glycol) and thio-glucose, the resulting functionalized GNPs (Glu-GNPs) were created for targeted treatment of cancer metastasis and cancer stem cells. Suspension cancer cell THP-1 (human monocytic cell line derived from acute monocytic leukemia patients) was selected because it has properties similar to cancer stem cells and has been used as a metastatic cancer cell model for in vitro studies. To take advantage of cancer cells' elevated glucose consumption over normal cells, different starvation periods were screened in order to achieve optimal treatment effects. Cancer cells were then fed using Glu-GNPs followed by X-ray irradiation treatment. For comparison, solid tumor MCF-7 cells (breast cancer cell line) were studied as well. Our irradiation experimental results show that Glu-GNPs are better irradiation sensitizers to treat THP-1 cells than MCF-7 cells, or Glu-GNPs enhance the cancer killing of THP-1 cells 20% more than X-ray irradiation alone and GNP treatment alone. This finding can help oncologists to design therapeutic strategies to target cancer stem cells and cancer metastasis.","['Hu, Chenxia', 'Niestroj, Martin', 'Yuan, Daniel', 'Chang, Steven', 'Chen, Jie']","['Hu C', 'Niestroj M', 'Yuan D', 'Chang S', 'Chen J']","[""Faculty of Chinese Pharmaceutical Science, Guangzhou University of Chinese Medicine, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China."", 'Canadian Light Source, Saskatoon, SK, Canada ; Physics Department, Bonn University, Bonn, Germany.', 'Biomedical Engineering Department, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, USA.', 'Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada.', 'Faculty of Engineering, University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada ; Canadian National Research Council/National Institute for Nanotechnology, Edmonton, AB, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",New Zealand,Int J Nanomedicine,International journal of nanomedicine,101263847,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Glucose/*chemistry', 'Gold/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'MCF-7 Cells/drug effects/radiation effects', '*Metal Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Polyethylene Glycols/pharmacology', 'X-Rays']",2015/04/07 06:00,2016/11/01 06:00,['2015/04/07 06:00'],"['2015/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/IJN.S72144 [doi]', 'ijn-10-2065 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Nanomedicine. 2015 Mar 16;10:2065-77. doi: 10.2147/IJN.S72144. eCollection 2015.,20150316,PMC4368028,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer metastasis', 'cancer stem cells', 'glucose capped gold nanoparticles', 'irradiation therapy', 'suspension cancer cells', 'targeted treatment']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the combined treatment with FTY720 and TRAIL reduced tumor growth in xenograft models. FTY720 up-regulated death receptor (DR)5 at post-translational level. Knockdown of DR5 markedly blocked apoptosis induced by the combined treatment. FTY720 also inhibited Mcl-1 expression at the post-translational level. Over-expression of Mcl-1 blocked apoptosis induced by FTY720 and TRAIL. Interestingly, phospho-FTY720 and inhibitors of sphingosine kinase failed to enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis.

Currently, treatment options for EBV-associated malignancies are limited. We have previously shown that myxoma virus specifically targets various human solid tumors and leukemia cells in a variety of animal models, while sparing normal human or murine tissues. Since transplant recipients of bone marrow or solid organs often develop EBV-associated post-transplant LPDs and lymphoma, myxoma virus may be of utility to prevent EBV-associated malignancies in immunocompromised transplant patients where treatment options are frequently limited. In this report, we demonstrate the safety and efficacy of myxoma virus purging as a prophylactic strategy for preventing post-transplant EBV-transformed human lymphomas, using a highly immunosuppressed mouse xenotransplantation model. This provides support for developing myxoma virus as a potential oncolytic therapy for preventing EBV-associated LPDs following transplantation of bone marrow or solid organ allografts.","['Kim, Manbok', 'Rahman, Masmudur M', 'Cogle, Christopher R', 'McFadden, Grant']","['Kim M', 'Rahman MM', 'Cogle CR', 'McFadden G']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA.

Increased WBC count leads to leukocyte aggregation, increased blood viscosity, and consequently results in stasis in small blood vessels. Ultimate neurological, pulmonary, gastrointestinal complications, coagulopathy, and tumor lysis syndrome cause increase in morbidity and mortality. Leukapheresis is a treatment modality used for hyperleukocytosis. In patients presenting with hyperleukocytosis the indications for leukapheresis were accepted as having symptoms of leukostasis and prophylactic. Indications for leukapheresis in prophylactic group evaluated according to WBC count. We report a single center experience about leukapheresis in managing 31 AML patients with hyperleukocytosis. In addition to demographic characteristics, disease-related clinical and laboratory findings of the patients were recorded. Survival rates were also calculated. Ten patients were female. The most common of AML subtype was AML-M2. The median number of leukapheresis per patient was 2 and totally 60 leukapheresis cycles were performed in all patients. There was a significant decrease in WBC count and LDH level after leukapheresis as compared with the baseline values (p < 0.05). Early and total mortality were 16.1% and 58.0%, respectively. Alive and died patients were evaluated according to baseline WBC, LDH; increased WBC count and LDH level were found in died patients (p < 0.05). According to leukapheresis indications, patients were divided into two groups: 14 patients in symptomatic leukostasis, 17 patients in prophylaxis. No statistically significant differences were noted between both groups in leukapheresis effectiveness, mean survival time, early and total mortality rate (p > 0.05). None of our patients suffered serious side effects and tumor lysis syndrome during or after apheresis.

The mixed-lineage leukemia gene translocated to, 3 (MLLT3) gene (9p22) is a frequent MLL-r partner ( approximately 18% of leukemias with MLL rearrangement) and is characterized by the translocation t(9;11) (p22;q23), forming an MLL-MLLT3 gene fusion. MLL-r are usually simple reciprocal translocations between two different chromosomes, although karyotypes with complex MLL-r have been observed. We present a rare case of a child with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with a complex karyotype in which the classical t(9;11) (p22;q23) was cryptically relocated into a third chromosome in a balanced three-way translocation. At the genome level, however, the MLL-MLLT3 three-way translocation still displayed both reciprocal fusion transcripts. This argues in favor for a model where a simple two-way t(9;11) (p22;q23) was likely the first step that then evolved in to a more complex karyotype. Multicolor banding techniques can be used to greatly refine complex karyotypes and its chromosomal breakpoints. Also in the presence of putative new rearrangements, Long distance inverse-PCR is an important tool to identify which gene fusion is involved.","['Ney Garcia, Daniela Ribeiro', 'Liehr, Thomas', 'Emerenciano, Mariana', 'Meyer, Claus', 'Marschalek, Rolf', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria do Socorro', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Poirot Land, Marcelo Gerardin', 'Macedo Silva, Maria Luiza']","['Ney Garcia DR', 'Liehr T', 'Emerenciano M', 'Meyer C', 'Marschalek R', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira Mdo S', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Poirot Land MG', 'Macedo Silva ML']","['Clinical Medicine Postgraduate Program, College of Medicine, Federal University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Cytogenetics Department, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.', 'Postgraduate Oncology Program, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Diagnostic Center of Acute Leukemia, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Diagnostic Center of Acute Leukemia, Goethe-University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt/Main, Germany.', 'Postgraduate Oncology Program, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Clinical Medicine Postgraduate Program, College of Medicine, Federal University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Martagao Gesteira Institute of Pediatrics and Child Development, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Clinical Medicine Postgraduate Program, College of Medicine, Federal University, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Cytogenetics Department, Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Postgraduate Oncology Program, National Cancer Institute, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Two genes that have been used as prognostic markers in acute leukemia are Wilms' tumor (WT1) and multidrug resistance-1 (MDR1). A novel gene, epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (EPS8), is often over-expressed and associated with poor outcome in some solid tumor types. However, whether EPS8 is also associated with the development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is unclear. Here, quantitative real-time PCR was used to evaluate the expression of EPS8, MDR1, and WT1 in bone marrow samples of adult ALL patients (n=107) and non-leukemia controls (n=22). EPS8, MDR1, and WT1 were detected in ALL patients, and significant correlations were found between expression profiles for EPS8 and MDR1, EPS8 and WT1, and MDR1 and WT1. In general, high expression of EPS8, MDR1, or WT1 in patients was associated with a higher risk of relapse. Furthermore, when patients were stratified based on high or low expression of the genes, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that disease-free survival of patients with the high-EPS8/high-WT1/high-MDR1 profile was significantly shorter than in patients with the low-EPS8/low-WT1/low-MDR1 profile or those excluded from either of these groups (P<0.0001). Thus, EPS8, as MDR1 and WT1, may be a clinically valuable biomarker for assessing the outcome of ALL patients.","['He, Ying-Zhi', 'Liang, Zhao', 'Wu, Mei-Rong', 'Wen, Qi', 'Deng, Lan', 'Song, Chao-Yang', 'Wu, Bing-Yi', 'Tu, San-Fang', 'Huang, Rui', 'Li, Yu-Hua']","['He YZ', 'Liang Z', 'Wu MR', 'Wen Q', 'Deng L', 'Song CY', 'Wu BY', 'Tu SF', 'Huang R', 'Li YH']","['Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510282 Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510282 Guangzhou, China.', 'Second School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, 510515 Guangzhou, China.', 'Second School of Clinical Medicine, Southern Medical University, 510515 Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510282 Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510282 Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510282 Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510282 Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510282 Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, 510282 Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (EPS8 protein, human)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/biosynthesis', 'Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*biosynthesis', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*biosynthesis', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Child', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'WT1 Proteins/biosynthesis']",2015/04/07 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2015/04/07 06:00'],"['2014/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0145-2126(15)00076-4 [pii]', '10.1016/j.leukres.2015.03.007 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2015 Jun;39(6):575-81. doi: 10.1016/j.leukres.2015.03.007.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the cases of 183 patients aged >/= 70 years with a performance status of </= 2 treated at our institution from 2000 to 2014. Treatment consisted of anthracycline- and cytarabine-based chemotherapy for 93 patients and lower intensity therapy with low-dose cytarabine or hypomethylating agent cycles for 90 patients. RESULTS: A total of 57 patients (61%) achieved complete remission in the intensive chemotherapy group versus only 11 (12%) in the lower intensity treatment group (P < .0001). The median overall survival (OS) was 14.5 months and 11.7 months with a 3-year OS rate of 34% and 18% (P = .005) for the intensive and lower intensity groups, respectively. The difference remained significant when considering patients aged </= 75 years, but not for patients aged > 75 years. Similarly, a significant difference was only observed when considering favorable and intermediate cytogenetic factors (P = .007) but not unfavorable karyotypes. On multivariate analysis, age did not appear as an independent prognostic factor. CONCLUSION: With intensive chemotherapy, the median OS significantly increased after the introduction of an improved supportive care policy compared with historical controls (14 vs. 5.4 months, with a 3-year OS rate of 33% vs. 8%). After 2006, a more ""personalized"" therapeutic approach tended to erase the difference in terms of OS, especially in patients aged > 75 years.","['Fattoum, Jihane', 'Cannas, Giovanna', 'Elhamri, Mohamed', 'Tigaud, Isabelle', 'Plesa, Adriana', 'Heiblig, Mael', 'Plesa, Claudiu', 'Wattel, Eric', 'Thomas, Xavier']","['Fattoum J', 'Cannas G', 'Elhamri M', 'Tigaud I', 'Plesa A', 'Heiblig M', 'Plesa C', 'Wattel E', 'Thomas X']","['Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Laboratory of Cytogenetics, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Laboratory of Cytology and Immunology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Hematology, Trarieux Clinic, Lyon, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Lyon-Sud Hospital, Hospices Civils de Lyon, Pierre Benite, France.

RCRI is active in HIV-associated BL in combination with HAART. The WHO classification system defines lymphomas intermediate between DLBCL and BL, in which lymphomas with t(14;18)(q32;q21) and C-MYC-carrying translocation, i.e. 'double-hit' are included (BL-DH), and these patients are conventionally treated with RCRI. RESULT: We describe the SJH experience of 25 patients with BL, BL + HIV and BL-DH treated with RCRI between 2002 and 2011. Twelve BL patients (8M/4F), median age 49.1 years (range 20-73 years); of whom 9 had extensive disease, including 8 with marrow and 2 with CNS involvement. Eleven patients remain in remission at 80.5 months (range 37-147 months) from completion of treatment and one died of progressive BL giving an OS of 91.6 % at 1 year with no late relapses. Eight patients with BL + HIV were treated (6M/2F) with a median age 40.25 years (range 24-64). Five remain in complete remission (CR) at 65 months (range 13-109 months), three patients died, two of progressive disease and one of treatment-associated hepatotoxicity in CR. Five patients with BL-DH were included; (3M/2F), age 47.8 years (range 42-55 years); and all patients died of progressive disease, 4 on RCRI therapy and a further patient despite an allogeneic transplantation. CONCLUSION: These results confirm that RCRI is an effective treatment in adults with BL and BL + HIV and remains the gold standard against which other regimens should be compared. We confirm the poor prognosis found in BL-DH, indicating new treatment approaches are needed for this sub-group which should be identified at diagnosis by FISH analysis.","['Smyth, L', 'Browne, P V', 'Conneally, E', 'Flynn, C', 'Hayden, P', 'Jeffers, M', ""O'Brien, D"", 'Quinn, F', 'Kelly, J', 'Perera, M', 'Crotty, G M', 'Leahy, M', 'Hennessy, B', 'Jackson, F', 'Ryan, M', 'Vandenberghe, E']","['Smyth L', 'Browne PV', 'Conneally E', 'Flynn C', 'Hayden P', 'Jeffers M', ""O'Brien D"", 'Quinn F', 'Kelly J', 'Perera M', 'Crotty GM', 'Leahy M', 'Hennessy B', 'Jackson F', 'Ryan M', 'Vandenberghe E']","[""Department of Haematology, St James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland. lismyth@tcd.ie."", ""Department of Haematology, St James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology, St James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology, St James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology, St James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", 'Department of Histopathology, AMNCH, Dublin 24, Ireland.', ""Department of Haematology, St James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Department of Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, St James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin 12, Ireland."", 'Department of Haematology, Midlands Regional Hospital, Tullamore, Co.

In Caski cells the fluorescence of Daxx or PML was mainly distributed in the cytoplasm or nucleus, respectively, and in the align image their signals did not overlapped. However, when the red signal of HPV16 E2 and the green signal of Daxx in cyto- plasm of Caski cells were merged, the yellow signals appeared. The yeast co-transformed with pGBKT7/Daxx and pGADT7/E2 or pGADT7/E2 TAD can grow onto SD/-Trp-Leu-His and SD/-Trp-Leu-His-Ade plates.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The present multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study aimed to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy of Debio1143 (formerly AT-406), a new IAP antagonist, when given along with a standard ""7 plus 3 regimen"" of daunorubicin and cytarabine to poor-risk patients with AML during the induction cycle. Consecutive patient cohorts received once-daily 100, 200, 300, or 400 mg of oral Debio1143 on treatment days 1 to 5. Blood samples were collected regularly until hematologic recovery or response was documented. Bone marrow samples were collected on days 0, 14, and 29 and PK and PD samples on days 1, 3, 5, 8, and 10 and 1, 2, and 8, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 29 enrolled patients, 23 completed the study. The most common adverse events of any grade deemed related to treatment were nausea (31% of patients), diarrhea (14%), and febrile neutropenia (14%). Exposure exceeded dose proportionality, without accumulation over 5 days. Inhibition of cellular IAP1 was detectable in the CD34/CD117(+) cells and blasts. A total of 11 patients (38%) achieved complete remission, most in the 100-mg dose cohort. Of these, 6 (56%) developed a relapse within the study period. The patients with a response more frequently showed plasma increases of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-8 after the first dose of Debio1143. CONCLUSION: Debio1143 </= 400 mg/d showed good tolerability in combination with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Additional studies in subsets of patients with AML are warranted.","['DiPersio, John F', 'Erba, Harry P', 'Larson, Richard A', 'Luger, Selina M', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Brill, Jeffrey M', 'Vuagniaux, Gregoire', 'Rouits, Elisabeth', 'Sorensen, J Mel', 'Zanna, Claudio']","['DiPersio JF', 'Erba HP', 'Larson RA', 'Luger SM', 'Tallman MS', 'Brill JM', 'Vuagniaux G', 'Rouits E', 'Sorensen JM', 'Zanna C']","['Division of Oncology, Siteman Cancer Center, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.

Among 130 adults with Ph+ ALL who had TKI therapy before alloHCT, 78 patients had available data on conventional cytogenetics at diagnosis and were eligible for outcomes analysis. ACAs were observed in 41 patients (53%). There were no statistically significant differences in median age, median initial WBC count, post-HCT TKI maintenance, or disease status at the time of transplant between the Ph-only and ACA cohorts; however, the Ph-only cohort had a higher rate of minimal residual disease positivity at the time of HCT. Three-year leukemia-free survival (79.8% versus 39.5%, P = .01) and 3-year overall survival (83% versus 45.6%, P = .02) were superior in the Ph-only cohort compared with the ACA cohort, respectively. Monosomy 7 was the most common additional aberration observed in our ACA cohort (n = 12). Thus, when TKI therapy and alloHCT are used as part of adult Ph+ ALL therapy, the presence of ACAs appears to have a significant deleterious effect on outcomes post-HCT.","['Aldoss, Ibrahim', 'Stiller, Tracey', 'Cao, Thai M', 'Palmer, Joycelynne M', 'Thomas, Sandra H', 'Forman, Stephen J', 'Pullarkat, Vinod']","['Aldoss I', 'Stiller T', 'Cao TM', 'Palmer JM', 'Thomas SH', 'Forman SJ', 'Pullarkat V']","['Department of Hematology and Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, City of Hope, Duarte, California.

To date, the number of studies addressing the perspective of parents is scarce. Thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of life, symptom prevalence and management, and the quality of palliative care provided to Lebanese children with cancer from their parents' perspectives. A convenience sample of 85 caregivers from the Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon was enrolled in the study over a 1-year period [2010-2011]. Using face- to-face interviews, the administered Arabic questionnaire was a combination of the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory cancer module and the Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale (both parent's versions), and selected items from the Needs at End of life Screening Tool. The majority of the sample was recruited from the outpatient clinic; mean age of children was 12.5 years with the majority having leukemia. According to parents, children encountered health-related quality of life problems in the areas related to nausea, worry and treatment anxiety. The most common symptoms were feeling irritable, feeling nervous, lack of energy, lack of appetite, pain, and feeling sad. The most treated symptoms were found to be nausea, vomiting, cough, and pain with success rates ranging between 56.3% and 73.7%. According to the parents, cancer children had acceptable health-related quality of life. They experienced physical and psychological symptoms that were inadequately managed by the healthcare team. However, parents were highly satisfied with the provided quality of care by the center.

In the present study, the molecular mechanisms of PTL's activities were explored in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced human leukemia monocytic THP-1 cells and human primary monocytes. The 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetr azolium salt (MTS) assay was used to analyze the effect of PTL on THP-1 cell viability. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the effect of PTL on LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine secretion. Flow cytometry and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to assess the effect of PTL on LPS-induced toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression. Phosphorylation levels of signaling molecules were determined by western blot analysis. Results showed that PTL <12.5 muM did not significantly affect THP-1 cells viability. LPS treatment led to a marked up-regulation of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, IL-8, IL-12p40, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, IL-18, and NO in THP-1 cells. However, PTL inhibited the expression of these cytokines in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50 values of 1.091-2.620 muM. PTL blocked TLR4 expression with an IC50 value of 1.373 muM as determined by the flow cytometry analysis, and this blocking effect was verified at both protein and mRNA levels. Up-regulation of phosphorylation levels of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, Jun N-terminal kinase, p38, nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) p65, and IkappaBalpha and up-regulation of expressions of other molecules (inducible nitric oxide synthase, TLR4, and TNF receptor-associated factor 6) induced by LPS were abolished by PTL in a dose-dependent manner. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of PTL operate partly through the TLR4-mediated mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Therefore, TLR4 may be a new target for anti-inflammation therapies.","['Li, Shuangshuang', 'Gao, Xiangli', 'Wu, Xiaoxin', 'Wu, Zhigang', 'Cheng, Linfang', 'Zhu, Lifen', 'Shen, Dan', 'Tong, Xiangmin']","['Li S', 'Gao X', 'Wu X', 'Wu Z', 'Cheng L', 'Zhu L', 'Shen D', 'Tong X']","[""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China Department of Hematology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou 310003, China."", 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'State Key Laboratory for Diagnosis and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China.', ""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University College of Medicine, Hangzhou 310003, China Department of Hematology, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, Hangzhou 310003, China tongxiangmin11@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),Acta biochimica et biophysica Sinica,101206716,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Inflammation Mediators)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 4)', '2RDB26I5ZB (parthenolide)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inflammation Mediators/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', '*Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 4/*metabolism']",2015/04/07 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/04/06 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']","['gmv019 [pii]', '10.1093/abbs/gmv019 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai). 2015 May;47(5):368-75. doi: 10.1093/abbs/gmv019.

HSF1 knockout suppresses carcinogen-induced cancer induction in mice. Therefore, HSF1 is a promising therapeutic and chemopreventive target. We performed cell-based screening with a natural compound collection and identified fisetin, a dietary flavonoid, as a HSF1 inhibitor. Fisetin abolished heat shock-induced luciferase activity with an IC50 of 14 muM in HCT-116 cancer cells. The treatment of HCT-116 with fisetin inhibited proliferation with a GI50 of 23 muM. When the cells were exposed to heat shock in the presence of fisetin, the induction of HSF1 target proteins, such as HSP70, HSP27 and BAG3 (Bcl-2-associated athanogene domain 3), were inhibited. HSP70/BAG3 complexes protect cancer cells from apoptosis by stabilizing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. The downregulation of HSP70/BAG3 by fisetin significantly reduced the amounts of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 proteins, subsequently inducing apoptotic cell death. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that fisetin inhibited HSF1 activity by blocking the binding of HSF1 to the hsp70 promoter. Intraperitoneal treatment of nude mice with fisetin at 30mg/kg resulted in a 35.7% (P < 0.001) inhibition of tumor growth.","['Kim, Joo Ae', 'Lee, Somyoung', 'Kim, Da-Eun', 'Kim, Moonil', 'Kwon, Byoung-Mog', 'Han, Dong Cho']","['Kim JA', 'Lee S', 'Kim DE', 'Kim M', 'Kwon BM', 'Han DC']","['Genomics Structure Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology and Department of BioMolecular Science, University of Science and Technology in Korea and.', 'Genomics Structure Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology and Department of BioMolecular Science, University of Science and Technology in Korea and.', 'Genomics Structure Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology and Department of BioMolecular Science, University of Science and Technology in Korea and.', 'Department of BioMolecular Science, University of Science and Technology in Korea and Bio-Nano Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, 111 Gwahangno, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-806, Korea.', 'Genomics Structure Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology and Department of BioMolecular Science, University of Science and Technology in Korea and.', 'Genomics Structure Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology and Department of BioMolecular Science, University of Science and Technology in Korea and dchan@kribb.re.kr kwonbm@kribb.re.kr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Carcinogenesis,Carcinogenesis,8008055,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BAG3 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Flavonols)', '0 (HSF1 protein, human)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPB1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'OO2ABO9578 (fisetin)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/*pharmacology', 'Flavonols', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Transcription Factors/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis']",2015/04/05 06:00,2015/08/25 06:00,['2015/04/05 06:00'],"['2015/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['bgv045 [pii]', '10.1093/carcin/bgv045 [doi]']",ppublish,Carcinogenesis. 2015 Jun;36(6):696-706. doi: 10.1093/carcin/bgv045.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were treated with the maximum tolerated dose of pilaralisib previously determined in patients with solid tumors (600 mg capsules once daily). Adverse events (AE) and response were evaluated. Plasma pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects on cytokines and chemokines were also assessed. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were included in the study: 10 with CLL and 15 with lymphoma. The most frequent AEs of any grade were diarrhea (92.0%), pyrexia (52.0%), and fatigue (44.0%). The most frequent grade >/=3 AEs were neutropenia (32.0%), diarrhea (20.0%), and anemia (16.0%). Pilaralisib exposure on cycle 1 day 28 was similar to exposure in patients with solid tumors. In patients with CLL, pilaralisib significantly reduced plasma levels of several cytokines and chemokines involved in B-cell trafficking. Five patients (50.0%) with CLL and 3 patients (20.0%) with lymphoma had a partial response. Six patients (60.0%) with CLL had nodal shrinkage >/=50%. Overall, 14 patients (56.0%; 7 patients with CLL and 7 patients with lymphoma) had progression-free survival >/=6 months. CONCLUSIONS: Pilaralisib demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in patients with CLL and lymphoma, generally consistent with findings in patients with solid tumors. Single-agent pilaralisib showed preliminary clinical activity in patients with CLL and lymphoma, supporting further development.","['Brown, Jennifer R', 'Davids, Matthew S', 'Rodon, Jordi', 'Abrisqueta, Pau', 'Kasar, Siddha N', 'Lager, Joanne', 'Jiang, Jason', 'Egile, Coumaran', 'Awan, Farrukh T']","['Brown JR', 'Davids MS', 'Rodon J', 'Abrisqueta P', 'Kasar SN', 'Lager J', 'Jiang J', 'Egile C', 'Awan FT']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts. jennifer_brown@dfci.harvard.edu.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Val d'Hebron University Hospital and Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", ""Val d'Hebron University Hospital and Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."", 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Sanofi Oncology, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Sanofi, Bridgewater, New Jersey.', 'Sanofi Oncology, Vitry sur Seine, France.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinoxalines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (XL147)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Quinoxalines/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",2015/04/05 06:00,2016/05/11 06:00,['2015/04/05 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/11 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-3262 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-3262 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2015 Jul 15;21(14):3160-9. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-3262.

High mutation frequencies of RUNX1 gene in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) have been described, whereas the biologic significances of the mutations were not investigated. Here, we aimed to correlate the biologic activities of the RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes of patients. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We examined the mutational status of RUNX1 in 143 MDS and 84 CMML patients. Then, we studied the DNA and CBFbeta binding abilities of all the RUNX1 mutants identified by using electrophoretic mobility shift assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay, and also determined their activities on target C-FMS gene induction by Western blotting and luciferase reporter assay. Using luciferase reporter assay, the relative biologic activities of each RUNX1 mutant could be quantified and correlated with the patient outcomes by statistical analyses. RESULTS: We observed that most RUNX1 mutants had reduced abilities in DNA binding, CBFbeta heterodimerization, and C-FMS gene induction. The relative biologic activities of RUNX1 mutants were grouped into high- and low-activity mutations. Correlation of the activities of RUNX1 mutants with the clinical outcomes revealed that patients harboring lower activities of RUNX1 mutants had a higher risk and shorter time to secondary acute myeloid leukemia transformation in MDS and CMML. In multivariate analysis, low RUNX1 activity remained an independent predictor for secondary acute myeloid leukemia-free survival in MDS patients. CONCLUSIONS: The biologic activity rather than the mutational status of RUNX1 might be an indicator in predicting outcome of patients with MDS and CMML.","['Tsai, Shu-Chun', 'Shih, Lee-Yung', 'Liang, Sung-Tzu', 'Huang, Ying-Jung', 'Kuo, Ming-Chung', 'Huang, Chein-Fuang', 'Shih, Yu-Shu', 'Lin, Tung-Huei', 'Chiu, Ming-Chun', 'Liang, Der-Cherng']","['Tsai SC', 'Shih LY', 'Liang ST', 'Huang YJ', 'Kuo MC', 'Huang CF', 'Shih YS', 'Lin TH', 'Chiu MC', 'Liang DC']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.

There are an estimated 5 million to 20 million HTLV-1-infected individuals worldwide; their lifetime risk of developing ATL is 3-5 %, and high HTLV-1 proviral loads have been shown to be an independent risk factor. Although conventional chemotherapeutic regimens used against other malignant lymphomas have been administered to ATL patients, the prognosis is often poor. In previous studies, we screened 459 extracts from 344 plants to isolate components exhibiting antiproliferative activity against HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines (MT-1 and MT-2). In our continuing search for potential anti-HTLV-1 natural products, 15 extracts of Asclepiadaceae plants were further tested against MT-1 and MT-2 cells. The MeOH extract of aerial parts of Tylophora tanakae showed antiproliferative activity. Activity-guided fractionation resulted in the isolation of 6 phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids (including a new compound), and we examined their antiproliferative activity against MT-1 and MT-2 cells. The EC50 value of some of the alkaloids was in the low nanomolar range, comparable to that of the clinically used antineoplastic drug doxorubicin. Structure-activity relationship analyses suggested that a 14beta-hydroxy moiety is essential for activity against HTLV-1-infected T cells. In contrast, the presence of a 2-methoxy moiety, a 7-methoxy moiety, or an N-oxide moiety appears to reduce the potency of the antiproliferative activity against HTLV-1-infected T cells.","['Nakano, Daisuke', 'Ishitsuka, Kenji', 'Ikeda, Mizuki', 'Tsuchihashi, Ryota', 'Okawa, Masafumi', 'Okabe, Hikaru', 'Tamura, Kazuo', 'Kinjo, Junei']","['Nakano D', 'Ishitsuka K', 'Ikeda M', 'Tsuchihashi R', 'Okawa M', 'Okabe H', 'Tamura K', 'Kinjo J']","['Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, 8-19-1 Nanakuma, Jonan-ku, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,J Nat Med,Journal of natural medicines,101518405,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Phenanthrolines)', '0 (phenanthroindolizidine)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HTLV-I Infections/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Indolizines/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/virology', 'Phenanthrolines/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves/chemistry', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Tylophora/*chemistry']",2015/04/05 06:00,2016/01/28 06:00,['2015/04/05 06:00'],"['2015/02/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11418-015-0906-8 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Med. 2015 Jul;69(3):397-401. doi: 10.1007/s11418-015-0906-8.

Yet, while treatment with hypomethylating agents (HMAs) has a critical limitation in eradicating MDS clones, the use of HMA treatment as a bridge to allogeneic SCT has become a focus with the hope of improving the SCT outcome based on the chance of achieving complete remission or reducing the blast percentage safely and effectively before allogeneic SCT. However, a consensus needs to be established on the use of HMAs as a bridging therapy for high-risk MDS or RAEB.

These genes encode the components of the PI3K core complex, which is central to initiation of autophagy. A consecutive series of 149 well-characterized CLL cases from Region of Southern Denmark were included in the study. All three genes were observed to be independent markers of prognosis in CLL with high expression being associated with more aggressive disease.

Hence, p53-independent strategies are required to target Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-deficient chronic lymphocytic leukemia. As Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated has been implicated in redox homeostasis, we investigated the effect of the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null chronic lymphocytic leukemia genotype on cellular responses to oxidative stress with a view to therapeutic targeting. We found that in comparison to Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-wild type chronic lymphocytic leukemia, pro-oxidant treatment of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null cells led to reduced binding of NF-E2 p45-related factor-2 to antioxidant response elements and thus decreased expression of target genes. Furthermore, Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells contained lower levels of antioxidants and elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Consequently, Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but not tumors with 11q deletion or TP53 mutations, exhibited differentially increased sensitivity to pro-oxidants both in vitro and in vivo. We found that cell death was mediated by a p53- and caspase-independent mechanism associated with apoptosis inducing factor activity. Together, these data suggest that defective redox-homeostasis represents an attractive therapeutic target for Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Agathanggelou, Angelo', 'Weston, Victoria J', 'Perry, Tracey', 'Davies, Nicholas J', 'Skowronska, Anna', 'Payne, Daniel T', 'Fossey, John S', 'Oldreive, Ceri E', 'Wei, Wenbin', 'Pratt, Guy', 'Parry, Helen', 'Oscier, David', 'Coles, Steve J', 'Hole, Paul S', 'Darley, Richard L', 'McMahon, Michael', 'Hayes, John D', 'Moss, Paul', 'Stewart, Grant S', 'Taylor, A Malcolm R', 'Stankovic, Tatjana']","['Agathanggelou A', 'Weston VJ', 'Perry T', 'Davies NJ', 'Skowronska A', 'Payne DT', 'Fossey JS', 'Oldreive CE', 'Wei W', 'Pratt G', 'Parry H', 'Oscier D', 'Coles SJ', 'Hole PS', 'Darley RL', 'McMahon M', 'Hayes JD', 'Moss P', 'Stewart GS', 'Taylor AM', 'Stankovic T']","['School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Chemistry, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham Haematology Department, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital.', 'Haematology Department, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital.', 'Haematology Department, Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Dorset.', 'Department of Haematology, Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff.', 'Department of Haematology, Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff.', 'Department of Haematology, Institute of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff.', 'Medical Research Institute, University of Dundee, UK.', 'Medical Research Institute, University of Dundee, UK.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham.', 'School of Cancer Sciences, University of Birmingham t.stankovic@bham.ac.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Oxidants)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antioxidants/metabolism', 'Apoptosis', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/*genetics', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Oxidants/*metabolism', '*Phenotype', 'Protein Binding', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Response Elements', 'Superoxides/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/04/05 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/04/05 06:00'],"['2014/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.115170 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.115170 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Aug;100(8):1076-85. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.115170.

The resulting translocation leads to the development of the BCR-ABL1 oncogene, a constitutively active fusion protein, which leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and reduced apoptosis and has a clear association with driving the malignant activity of CML cells. AREAS COVERED: Given that the BCR-ABL1 oncogene is a known key cause of CML, it has led to the development of numerous small molecule tyrosine-kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which target the specific oncogene mutation in CML. Presently, there are three FDA-approved TKI agents, imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib, for the treatment of frontline CML. Herein, we review the frontline options for the management of patients with CML and how to best choose these agents. EXPERT OPINION: Imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib are all effective at yielding hematological, molecular and cytogenetic responses in patients with newly diagnosed CML. Frontline therapy may depend on physician experience, patient age and ability to tolerate therapy, and with the lack of data comparing all three agents alongside each other, imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib may all be suitable frontline choices.","['Mace, Morgan L', 'Dahl, Jenny', 'Jabbour, Elias J']","['Mace ML', 'Dahl J', 'Jabbour EJ']","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Division of Pharmacy and Department of Leukemia , 1515 Holcombe BLVD, unit 377, Houston, TX 77030 , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Pharmacother,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,100897346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Dasatinib', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Thiazoles/therapeutic use']",2015/04/05 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/04/05 06:00'],"['2015/04/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14656566.2015.1031107 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Pharmacother. 2015 May;16(7):999-1007. doi: 10.1517/14656566.2015.1031107.

Rare disease communities exist for collaboration, dissemination of information, and to promote support for all community members. Patients with a rare disease desire to be supported through a rare disease community. Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a rare adult B-cell lymphocytic cancer that currently has no cure. OBJECTIVES: Patients with relapsed or refractory HCL may need to consider participation in a clinical trial. The research nurse can initiate a planned caring occasion based on Watson's Theory of Human Caring. The purpose of the planned caring occasion for patients with HCL in clinical trials is to establish authentic intentional caring encounters between the research nurse and patients and meaningful caring encounters between patients. OBSERVATIONS: Relapsed or refractory patients enrolled in an HCL clinical trial identify the trial as a microcommunity and the research nurse as an advocate and liaison. Patients seek support, empowerment, and the opportunity to connect with other patients with HCL. The planned caring occasion has the potential to provide a healing environment and facilitate shared experiences of living with HCL. The potential outcome for patients is strengthened holistic wellness.","['Hutchinson, Terri L']",['Hutchinson TL'],"['Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin J Oncol Nurs,Clinical journal of oncology nursing,9705336,,,"['*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*nursing', '*Nurse-Patient Relations', '*Nursing Research', 'Patient Advocacy', 'Rare Diseases/*nursing', 'Research Personnel']",2015/04/04 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1188/15.CJON.E41-E46 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin J Oncol Nurs. 2015 Apr;19(2):E41-6. doi: 10.1188/15.CJON.E41-E46.,,,['NOTNLM'],"['clinical trial', 'community', 'hairy cell leukemia', 'rare disease', 'transpersonal caring']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Older AML patients had worse transplant outcomes within each modified ELN risk group except intermediate-I when compared with younger patients; leukemia-free survival at 3 years was 67.8% versus 49.8% in favorable, 53.4% versus 50.7% in intermediate-I, 65.7% versus 20.2% in intermediate-II, and 44.6% versus 23.8% in adverse group younger and older patients, respectively. Among lesion-specific abnormalities, del5q/-5 and abnl(17p) had the worse transplant outcomes, with 3-year leukemia-free survival rates of 18.4% and 20% in younger CR1 patients. In conclusion, the modified ELN prognostic classification developed for chemotherapy outcomes also identifies prognostic groups for HSCT, which is useful for a selection of patients for post-transplant strategies to improve outcomes.","['Oran, Betul', 'Jimenez, Antonio M', 'De Lima, Marcos', 'Popat, Uday R', 'Bassett, Roland', 'Andersson, Borje', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Bashir, Qaiser', 'Chen, Julianne', 'Ciurea, Stefan O', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kebriaei, Partow', 'Khouri, Issa F', 'Qazilbash, Muzaffar H', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Rondon, Gabriela', 'Lu, Xinyan', 'Shpall, Elizabeth J', 'Champlin, Richard E']","['Oran B', 'Jimenez AM', 'De Lima M', 'Popat UR', 'Bassett R', 'Andersson B', 'Borthakur G', 'Bashir Q', 'Chen J', 'Ciurea SO', 'Jabbour E', 'Cortes J', 'Kebriaei P', 'Khouri IF', 'Qazilbash MH', 'Ravandi F', 'Rondon G', 'Lu X', 'Shpall EJ', 'Champlin RE']","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'University Hospitals and Case Western Reserve University, , Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology; The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*classification/genetics/*surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/04/04 06:00,2016/04/07 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2015/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1016/j.bbmt.2015.03.023 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2015 Aug;21(8):1405-1412. doi: 10.1016/j.bbmt.2015.03.023.

Most patients are in complete remission with full hematologic recovery (CR) before undergoing allo-HCT. However, some patients achieve CR without recovery of platelet count (CRp) or a morphologic leukemia-free state (MLFS), defined as meeting all CR criteria without recovery of both neutrophil and platelet counts. Currently, there is a paucity of data regarding transplant outcomes in AML patients achieving MLFS after chemotherapy. To address this question, we evaluated transplant outcomes in 270 AML patients who received 6/6 HLA-matched sibling or 10/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor transplantation at a single institution between 2006 and 2013. Of our 270 patients, 206 were in CR, 45 were in CRp, and 19 were in MLFS before allo-HCT. Patients in CR, CRp, or MLFS had similar 3-year overall survival rates (49%, 46%, and 47%, respectively; P = .88) and 3-year event-free survival rates (45%, 36%, and 40%, respectively; P = .53). However, the cumulative incidence of nonrelapse mortality was significantly higher in patients in MLFS compared with those in CR (58% versus 22%, P = .0004), whereas the cumulative incidence of relapse in patients in MLFS was significantly lower compared with those in CR (11% versus 36%, P = .03). Our results suggest that survival outcomes in AML patients are not influenced by degree of hematologic recovery before allo-HCT.","['Vu, Khoan', 'Manjappa, Shivaprasad', 'DiPersio, John F', 'Gao, Feng', 'Westervelt, Peter', 'Vij, Ravi', 'Stockerl-Goldstein, Keith E', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Abboud, Camille N', 'Schroeder, Mark A', 'Fehniger, Todd A', 'Cashen, Amanda F', 'Romee, Rizwan']","['Vu K', 'Manjappa S', 'DiPersio JF', 'Gao F', 'Westervelt P', 'Vij R', 'Stockerl-Goldstein KE', 'Uy GL', 'Abboud CN', 'Schroeder MA', 'Fehniger TA', 'Cashen AF', 'Romee R']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Department of Hospital Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Division of Biostatistics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.', 'Section of Bone Marrow Transplant and Leukemia, Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.

The expression and function of Nestin in AL is unclear. We investigated Nestin immunohistochemical patterns of 87 patients that included 47 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 40 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and 20 patients in complete remission (CR) from AML or ALL. We also investigated the clinico-pathological features of 87 cases of AL and their CR and overall survival (OS). Nestin was expressed in leukemic blasts and mature granulocytic cells in most cases (39/47) of AML. Conversely, Nestin was expressed in mature granulocytic cells in fewer cases (6/40) of ALL, but not in blasts. Nestin expression appeared in leukemic blasts of AML, but not ALL. Nestin expression in AML blast cells was not associated with CR or OS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective study carried on 30 newly diagnosed patients of AML over 60 years of age who were unfit for standard treatment regimens. We did not use azacytidine and decitabine in our patients because these therapeutic modalities being extremely costly and our patient affordability being poor. After taking patient consent and institutional ethical clearance these patients were treated with 20 mg/m(2) cytarabine subcutaneously in two divided doses 12 h apart for 4 days every week for 4 weeks which constituted a cycle before disease, re-assessment was done. A repeat cycle was administered where ever needed and after attainment of remission, we continued low dose cytarabine for 2 days/week as maintenance after complete or partial response was documented. RESULTS: In our study, we found that around 20% of patients achieved complete remission and 30% partial remission. The remission rates were definitely influenced by counts at presentation, performance at presentation, comorbidities, underlying myelodysplastic syndrome and baseline cytogenetics.

With the advent of rasburicase, a recombinant urate oxidase, there has been a decline in the TLS-mediated renal failure and the need for dialysis. The recommended regimen and doses pose a heavy financial burden for patients in developing countries like India. With data and studies proving a similar efficacy for the reduced dose and lesser number of rasburicase, we report here a case series of seven children with acute leukemias, whose TLS was managed by a single dose of rasburicase.

Here, we addressed these challenges by integrating two biological screens through bioinformatics and computational analysis. We screened a small-molecule library enriched in amphiphilic compounds in a degranulation assay in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 (RBL-2H3) cells. The same library was rescreened in a high-content image-based endocytosis assay in HeLa cells. This assay was previously applied to a genome-wide RNAi screen that produced quantitative multiparametric phenotypic profiles for genes that directly or indirectly affect endocytosis. By correlating the endocytic profiles of the compounds with the genome-wide siRNA profiles, we identified candidate pathways that may be inhibited by the compounds. Among these, we focused on the Akt pathway and validated its inhibition in HeLa and RBL-2H3 cells. We further showed that the compounds inhibited the translocation of the Akt-PH domain to the plasma membrane. The approach performed here can be used to integrate chemical and functional genomics screens for investigating the mechanism of action of compounds.","['McShane, Marisa P', 'Friedrichson, Tim', 'Giner, Angelika', 'Meyenhofer, Felix', 'Barsacchi, Rico', 'Bickle, Marc', 'Zerial, Marino']","['McShane MP', 'Friedrichson T', 'Giner A', 'Meyenhofer F', 'Barsacchi R', 'Bickle M', 'Zerial M']","['Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany.', 'JADO Technologies GmbH, Dresden, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany University of Fribourg, Department of Medicine-Anatomy, Fribourg, Switzerland.', 'Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany.', 'Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, Dresden, Germany zerial@mpi-cbg.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biomol Screen,Journal of biomolecular screening,9612112,"['0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Small Molecule Libraries)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Degranulation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Endocytosis/drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, Reporter', 'High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Protein Transport', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', 'Small Molecule Libraries']",2015/04/04 06:00,2016/03/25 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2015/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['1087057115579613 [pii]', '10.1177/1087057115579613 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biomol Screen. 2015 Jul;20(6):720-8. doi: 10.1177/1087057115579613.

We previously identified that the different phenotypic outcomes after HLI across inbred mouse strains is related to a region on the short arm of mouse chromosome 7. The gene coding the interleukin-21 receptor (IL-21R) lies at the peak of association in this region. APPROACH AND RESULTS: With quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, we found that a mouse strain with a greater ability to upregulate IL-21R after HLI had better perfusion recovery than a strain with no upregulation after HLI. Immunofluorescent staining of ischemic hindlimb tissue showed IL-21R expression on endothelial cells (ECs) from C57BL/6 mice. An EC-enriched fraction isolated from ischemic hindlimb muscle showed higher Il-21R levels than an EC-enriched fraction from nonischemic limbs. In vitro, human umbilical vein ECs showed elevated IL-21R expression after hypoxia and serum starvation. Under these conditions, IL-21 treatment increased cell viability, decreased cell apoptosis, and augmented tube formation. In vivo, either knockout Il21r or blocking IL-21 signaling by treating with IL-21R-Fc (fusion protein that blocks IL-21 binding to its receptor) in C57BL/6 mice resulted in less perfusion recovery after HLI. Both in vitro and in vivo modulation of the IL-21/IL-21R axis under hypoxic conditions resulted in increased signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation and a subsequent increase in the B-cell lymphoma leukemia-2/BCL-2-associated X protein ratio. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that IL-21R upregulation and ligand activation in hypoxic ECs may help perfusion recovery by limiting/preventing apoptosis and favoring cell survival and angiogenesis through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 pathway.","['Wang, Tao', 'Cunningham, Alexis', 'Dokun, Ayotunde O', 'Hazarika, Surovi', 'Houston, Kevin', 'Chen, Lingdan', 'Lye, R John', 'Spolski, Rosanne', 'Leonard, Warren J', 'Annex, Brian H']","['Wang T', 'Cunningham A', 'Dokun AO', 'Hazarika S', 'Houston K', 'Chen L', 'Lye RJ', 'Spolski R', 'Leonard WJ', 'Annex BH']","['From the Robert M.

Combination regimens that increase frequency of complete remissions, accelerate time to remission, and overcome single agent resistance are of considerable interest. We previously showed that the XPO1 inhibitor selinexor is proapoptotic in CLL cells and disrupts B-cell receptor signaling via BTK depletion. Herein we show the combination of selinexor and ibrutinib elicits a synergistic cytotoxic effect in primary CLL cells and increases overall survival compared with ibrutinib alone in a mouse model of CLL. Selinexor is effective in cells isolated from patients with prolonged lymphocytosis following ibrutinib therapy. Finally, selinexor is effective in ibrutinib-refractory mice and in a cell line harboring the BTK C481S mutation. This is the first report describing the combined activity of ibrutinib and selinexor in CLL, which represents a new treatment paradigm and warrants further evaluation in clinical trials of CLL patients including those with acquired ibrutinib resistance.","['Hing, Zachary A', 'Mantel, Rose', 'Beckwith, Kyle A', 'Guinn, Daphne', 'Williams, Erich', 'Smith, Lisa L', 'Williams, Katie', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Lehman, Amy M', 'Byrd, John C', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Lapalombella, Rosa']","['Hing ZA', 'Mantel R', 'Beckwith KA', 'Guinn D', 'Williams E', 'Smith LL', 'Williams K', 'Johnson AJ', 'Lehman AM', 'Byrd JC', 'Woyach JA', 'Lapalombella R']","['Medical Scientist Training Program, Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, and.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Triazoles)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '31TZ62FO8F (selinexor)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Triazoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/04/04 06:00,2015/08/06 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2015/01/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31690-6 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-01-621391 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 14;125(20):3128-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-01-621391.

To understand more about the roles of Ebf1 in malignant transformation, we investigated the impact of reduced functional Ebf1 dosage on mouse B-cell progenitors. Gene expression analysis suggested that Ebf1 was involved in the regulation of genes important for DNA repair and cell survival. Investigation of the DNA damage in steady state, as well as after induction of DNA damage by UV light, confirmed that pro-B cells lacking 1 functional allele of Ebf1 display signs of increased DNA damage. This correlated to reduced expression of DNA repair genes including Rad51, and chromatin immunoprecipitation data suggested that Rad51 is a direct target for Ebf1. Although reduced dosage of Ebf1 did not significantly increase tumor formation in mice, a dramatic increase in the frequency of pro-B cell leukemia was observed in mice with combined heterozygous mutations in the Ebf1 and Pax5 genes, revealing a synergistic effect of combined dose reduction of these proteins. Our data suggest that Ebf1 controls DNA repair in a dose-dependent manner providing a possible explanation to the frequent involvement of EBF1 gene loss in human leukemia.","['Prasad, Mahadesh A J', 'Ungerback, Jonas', 'Ahsberg, Josefine', 'Somasundaram, Rajesh', 'Strid, Tobias', 'Larsson, Malin', 'Mansson, Robert', 'De Paepe, Ayla', 'Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Hagman, James', 'Sigvardsson, Mikael']","['Prasad MA', 'Ungerback J', 'Ahsberg J', 'Somasundaram R', 'Strid T', 'Larsson M', 'Mansson R', 'De Paepe A', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Fioretos T', 'Hagman J', 'Sigvardsson M']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, and.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, and.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, and.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, and.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, and.', 'Bioinformatics Infrastructure for Life Sciences, IFM Bioinformatics, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden;', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine Huddinge, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden;', 'Bioinformatics Infrastructure for Life Sciences, IFM Bioinformatics, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden;', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; and.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; and.', 'Department of Biomedical Research, National Jewish Health, Denver, CO.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Experimental Hematopoiesis Unit, Faculty of Health Sciences, and.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Ebf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Pax5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Comet Assay', 'DNA Damage/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Haploinsufficiency/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics']",2015/04/04 06:00,2015/09/05 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2014/12/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/05 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31508-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-12-617282 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 25;125(26):4052-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-12-617282.

In multiple myeloma (MM), the majority of patients will inevitably relapse despite achievement of progressively higher complete remission (CR) rates. Novel treatment protocols with inclusion of antibodies and small molecules might well be able to further increase remission rates and potentially also cure rates. Therefore, MRD diagnostics becomes essential to assess treatment effectiveness. This review summarizes reports from the past 2 decades, which demonstrate that persistent MRD by multiparameter flow cytometry, polymerase chain reaction, next-generation sequencing, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography, predicts significantly inferior survival among CR patients. We describe the specific features of currently available techniques for MRD monitoring and outline the arguments favoring new criteria for response assessment that incorporate MRD levels. Extensive data indicate that MRD information can potentially be used as biomarker to evaluate the efficacy of different treatment strategies, help on treatment decisions, and act as surrogate for overall survival. The time has come to address within clinical trials the exact role of baseline risk factors and MRD monitoring for tailored therapy in MM, which implies systematic usage of highly sensitive, cost-effective, readily available, and standardized MRD techniques.","['Paiva, Bruno', 'van Dongen, Jacques J M', 'Orfao, Alberto']","['Paiva B', 'van Dongen JJ', 'Orfao A']","['Clinica Universidad de Navarra, Centro de Investigacion Medica Aplicada, Pamplona, Spain;', 'Department of Immunology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; and.', 'Cancer Research Center Instituto de Biologia Celular y Molecular del Cancer-Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas/University of Salamanca, Department of Medicine Cytometry Service, and Instituto Biosanitario de Salamanca, University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Humans', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/04/04 06:00,2015/08/06 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2014/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31682-7 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-11-568907 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 14;125(20):3059-68. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-11-568907.

Here, using PLZF-reporter mice and cell transfer assays, we studied the developmental progression of ILC1s and demonstrated substantial overlap with stages previously ascribed to the cNK lineage, including pre-pro-NK, pre-NK precursor (pre-NKP), refined NKP (rNKP), and immature NK (iNK). Although they originated from different precursors, the ILC1 and cNK lineages followed a parallel progression at early stages and diverged later at the iNK stage, with a striking predominance of ILC1s over cNKs early in ontogeny. Although a limited set of ILC1 genes depended on PLZF for expression, characteristically including Il7r, most of these genes were also differentially expressed between ILC1s and cNKs, indicating that PLZF together with other, yet to be defined, factors contribute to the divergence between these lineages.","['Constantinides, Michael G', 'Gudjonson, Herman', 'McDonald, Benjamin D', 'Ishizuka, Isabel E', 'Verhoef, Philip A', 'Dinner, Aaron R', 'Bendelac, Albert']","['Constantinides MG', 'Gudjonson H', 'McDonald BD', 'Ishizuka IE', 'Verhoef PA', 'Dinner AR', 'Bendelac A']","['Committee on Immunology.', 'Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, and.', 'Committee on Immunology.', 'Committee on Immunology.', 'Committee on Immunology.', 'Committee on Immunology, Institute for Biophysical Dynamics, and Department of Chemistry, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637.', 'Committee on Immunology, abendela@bsd.uchicago.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Klrb1c protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily B)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens, Ly/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', '*Cell Lineage/genetics', 'Fetus/cytology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Lymphocytes/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily B/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Stem Cells/cytology/immunology']",2015/04/04 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1423244112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1423244112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Apr 21;112(16):5123-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1423244112.

This includes current diagnostic and treatment recommendations for primary CNS lymphoma and complications related to hematologic malignancies. RECENT FINDINGS: Primary CNS lymphoma is an uncommon, aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma confined to the CNS in the absence of systemic disease. Diagnosis can be made by brain biopsy, CSF analysis, or vitreous fluid analysis. Primary CNS lymphoma is typically diffuse large B cell in histology. Evaluation of extent of disease should be performed before initiation of therapy. Initial induction treatment includes high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy. Several studies have demonstrated improved outcome using consolidative whole-brain radiation therapy or high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Neurologic complications can result from direct or indirect effects of leukemia and lymphoma or may be treatment-induced. SUMMARY: Early diagnosis and treatment of patients with primary CNS lymphoma is critical to maintaining neurologic and cognitive function and preserving quality of life. It is important to recognize neurologic complications from leukemia and lymphoma to avoid delays in instituting appropriate treatment.","['Nayak, Lakshmi', 'Pentsova, Elena', 'Batchelor, Tracy T']","['Nayak L', 'Pentsova E', 'Batchelor TT']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Continuum (Minneap Minn),"Continuum (Minneapolis, Minn.)",9509333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*diagnosis/secondary/*therapy', 'Combined Modality Therapy/*methods', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications/*diagnosis/*therapy', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use']",2015/04/04 06:00,2016/01/06 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1212/01.CON.0000464175.96311.0a [doi]', '00132979-201504000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Continuum (Minneap Minn). 2015 Apr;21(2 Neuro-oncology):355-72. doi: 10.1212/01.CON.0000464175.96311.0a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seed Extract Reveals Collateral Sensitivity in Multidrug-Resistant P-Glycoprotein-Expressing Tumor Cells.,664-75,10.1080/01635581.2015.1019632 [doi],"The frequent failure of standard cancer chemotherapy requires the development of novel drugs capable of killing otherwise drug-resistant tumors. Here, we have investigated a chloroform extract of Laurus nobilis seeds. Fatty acids and 23 constituents of the volatile fraction were identified by gas chromotography/flame ionization detection (GC/FID) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), in good agreement with (1)H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectrum. Multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein-expressing CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells were hypersensitive (collaterally sensitive) toward this extract compared to drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM cells, whereas CEM/ADR5000 cells were 2586-fold resistant to doxorubicin as control drug. Collateral sensitivity was verified by measurement of apoptotic cells by flow cytometry. The log10IC50 values of 3 compounds in the extract (limonene, eucalyptol, oleic acid) did not correlate with mRNA expression of the P-glycoprotein-coding ABCB1/MDR1 gene and accumulation of the P-glycoprotein substrate rhodamine in the NCI panel of tumor cell lines. A microarray-based profile of 20 genes predicted resistance to doxorubicin and 7 other anticancer drugs involved in the multidrug resistance phenotype but not to limonene, eucalyptol and oleic acid. In conclusion, our results show that Laurus nobilis seed extract is suitable to kill multidrug-resistant P-glycoprotein expressing tumor cells.","['Saab, Antoine M', 'Guerrini, Alessandra', 'Zeino, Maen', 'Wiench, Benjamin', 'Rossi, Damiano', 'Gambari, Roberto', 'Sacchetti, Gianni', 'Greten, Henry Johannes', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Saab AM', 'Guerrini A', 'Zeino M', 'Wiench B', 'Rossi D', 'Gambari R', 'Sacchetti G', 'Greten HJ', 'Efferth T']","['a Faculty of Sciences II , Lebanese University , Chemistry Department , Beirut , Lebanon.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nutr Cancer,Nutrition and cancer,7905040,"['0 (ABCB1 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Laurus/*chemistry', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Seeds/*chemistry']",2015/04/04 06:00,2016/02/24 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/01635581.2015.1019632 [doi]'],ppublish,Nutr Cancer. 2015;67(4):664-75. doi: 10.1080/01635581.2015.1019632.

This is particularly true in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Here, we isolated fetal liver kinase-1-positive (Flk1(+)) cells from CML patients and found they expressed BCR/ABL-specific CML oncogene. We examined their biological characteristics as well as immunological functions and further detected the possible molecular mechanism involved in the leukemia genesis. We showed that CML patient-derived Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) had normal morphology, phenotype and karyotype but appeared impaired immuno-modulatory function. The capacity of Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs from CML patients to inhibit T lymphocyte activation and proliferation was impaired in vitro. CML patient-derived MSCs have dampening immuno-modulatory functions, suggesting that the dysregulation of hematopoiesis and immune response might originate from MSCs rather than hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). These Ph(+) putative CML hemangioblast upregulated TGF-beta1 and resultantly activated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) to enhance s-KitL and s-ICAM-1 secretion, which activated c-kit(+) HSCs from the quiescent state to the proliferative state. Further studies showed that phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB signaling pathway was involved in CML pathogenesis. Flk1(+)CD31(-)CD34(-) MSCs that express BCR/ABL leukemia oncogene are hemangioblasts and they have a critical role in the progression of CML through PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.","['Li, Q', 'Wu, Y', 'Fang, S', 'Wang, L', 'Qi, H', 'Zhang, Y', 'Zhang, J', 'Li, W']","['Li Q', 'Wu Y', 'Fang S', 'Wang L', 'Qi H', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhang J', 'Li W']","['Department of Oncology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Gene Ther,Cancer gene therapy,9432230,"['EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Hemangioblasts/*immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunomodulation/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/enzymology/*genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/04 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2014/07/26 00:00 [received]', '2014/08/27 00:00 [revised]', '2014/08/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['cgt201465 [pii]', '10.1038/cgt.2014.65 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Gene Ther. 2015 May;22(5):227-37. doi: 10.1038/cgt.2014.65.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single centre survey of children (aged 3 to 16 years) and their parents at a routine follow-up visit during the maintenance phase of acute lymphoblastic leukaemica treatment. The questionnaire probed for their views on overall acceptability such as taste, smell, incidences of vomiting, ease and willingness to take Xaluprine(R) on a daily basis, and utilised a 5-point facial hedonic scale (1 = bad, 5 = good) as well as open/closed questions. RESULTS: Twenty-two children were recruited; 17 (77%) scored taste between 3 and 5 ('okay' to 'good') and 20 (91%) scored smell between 3 and 5. Only four children (18%) reported an aftertaste. Of the five children (23%) who scored taste as 1 or 2 ('bad'), three found taking all oral medicines difficult. Six children (27%) reported vomiting, but this was not considered related to Xaluprine(R). Seven children (32%) sometimes complained that they did not want to take Xaluprine(R); 15 (68%) never complained. In response to the question, 'How easy is it for you to take Xaluprine(R)?' 18 children (82%) reported that it was 'Easy all the time.' This was more favourable than other oral liquid medicines that they were taking concurrently.

A small-molecule inhibitor of FLT3 (known as quizartinib or AC220) that is currently in clinical trials appears promising for the treatment of AML. Here, we report the co-crystal structure of the kinase domain of FLT3 in complex with quizartinib. FLT3 with quizartinib bound adopts an ""Abl-like"" inactive conformation with the activation loop stabilized in the ""DFG-out"" orientation and folded back onto the kinase domain. This conformation is similar to that observed for the uncomplexed intracellular domain of FLT3 as well as for related receptor tyrosine kinases, except for a localized induced fit in the activation loop. The co-crystal structure reveals the interactions between quizartinib and the active site of FLT3 that are key for achieving its high potency against both wild-type FLT3 as well as a FLT3 variant observed in many AML patients. This co-complex further provides a structural rationale for quizartinib-resistance mutations.","['Zorn, Julie A', 'Wang, Qi', 'Fujimura, Eric', 'Barros, Tiago', 'Kuriyan, John']","['Zorn JA', 'Wang Q', 'Fujimura E', 'Barros T', 'Kuriyan J']","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America; California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America; Department of Chemistry, University of California, Berkeley, California, United States of America; Physical Biosciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemistry', 'Baculoviridae/genetics', 'Benzothiazoles/*chemistry', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'Humans', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*chemistry', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Folding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*chemistry/genetics', 'Sf9 Cells', 'Spodoptera/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/genetics']",2015/04/04 06:00,2016/04/06 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2014/12/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0121177 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-55491 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Apr 2;10(4):e0121177. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0121177. eCollection 2015.,20150402,PMC4383440,,,,,,"['F32 CA177087/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 CA177087-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They have also stressed the importance of also including in the assessment the contribution of frequency components, namely harmonics, other than the fundamental one. Based on the spectrum of supply voltage networks allowed by the European standard for electricity quality assessment, in this study the exposure of high-resolution three-dimensional models of foetuses to the whole harmonic content of a uniform magnetic field with a fundamental frequency of 50 Hz, was assessed. The results show that the main contribution in terms of induced electric fields to the foetal exposure is given by the fundamental frequency component. The harmonic components add some contributions to the overall level of electric fields, however, due to the extremely low permitted amplitude of the harmonic components with respect to the fundamental, their amplitudes are low. The level of the induced electric field is also much lower than the limits suggested by the guidelines for general public exposure, when the amplitude of the incident magnetic field is set at the maximum permitted level.","['Fiocchi, Serena', 'Liorni, Ilaria', 'Parazzini, Marta', 'Ravazzani, Paolo']","['Fiocchi S', 'Liorni I', 'Parazzini M', 'Ravazzani P']","[""Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni IEIIT, CNR Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, Milan 20133, Italy. serena.fiocchi@ieiit.cnr.it."", ""Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni IEIIT, CNR Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, Milan 20133, Italy. ilaria.liorni@ieiit.cnr.it."", 'Dipartimento di Elettronica, Informazione e Bioingegneria DEIB, Politecnico di Milano, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, Milan 20133, Italy. ilaria.liorni@ieiit.cnr.it.', ""Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni IEIIT, CNR Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, Milan 20133, Italy. marta.parazzini@ieiit.cnr.it."", ""Istituto di Elettronica e di Ingegneria dell'Informazione e delle Telecomunicazioni IEIIT, CNR Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, Milan 20133, Italy. paolo.ravazzani@ieiit.cnr.it.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int J Environ Res Public Health,International journal of environmental research and public health,101238455,,IM,"['*Electric Power Supplies', '*Electricity', '*Electromagnetic Fields', 'Female', '*Fetus', 'Humans', 'Maternal Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', '*Models, Theoretical', '*Pregnancy']",2015/04/04 06:00,2016/05/06 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2015/02/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/06 06:00 [medline]']","['ijerph120403667 [pii]', '10.3390/ijerph120403667 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2015 Apr 1;12(4):3667-90. doi: 10.3390/ijerph120403667.,20150401,PMC4410209,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tanacetum oshanahanii extract was more cytotoxic than Tanacetum ptarmiciflorum. Analyses of both extracts of Tanacetum by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed that T. oshanahanii extract contains the eudesmanolide tanapsin, while T. ptarmiciflorum lacks this sesquiterpene lactone. Tanapsin was cytotoxic against leukemia and melanoma cells, including cells that overexpress Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, with IC50 values of approximately 10 microM, but not against quiescent or proliferating human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Treatment of cells with tanapsin induced apoptosis. This was prevented by the non-specific caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, and reduced by the selective caspase-3/7 inhibitor z-DEVD-fmk. Tanapsin acetate was also cytotoxic against leukemia and melanoma cells and a potent apoptotic inducer. Tanapsin-induced cell death was found to be associated with (i) the loss of inner mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) and release of mitochondrial cytochrome c, (ii) the activation of multiple caspases and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, and (iii) an increase in reactive oxygen species generation. Generation of reactive oxygen species in response to tanapsin seems to play a crucial role in the cell death process since the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine blocked both ROS generation and cell death.","['Negrin, Gledy', 'Rubio, Sara', 'Marrero, Maria Teresa', 'Quintana, Jose', 'Eiroa, Jose Luis', 'Triana, Jorge', 'Estevez, Francisco']","['Negrin G', 'Rubio S', 'Marrero MT', 'Quintana J', 'Eiroa JL', 'Triana J', 'Estevez F']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Plaza Dr. Pasteur s/n, 35016 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Plaza Dr. Pasteur s/n, 35016 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Plaza Dr. Pasteur s/n, 35016 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Plaza Dr. Pasteur s/n, 35016 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Campus de Tafira, 35017 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Department of Chemistry, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Campus de Tafira, 35017 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Plaza Dr. Pasteur s/n, 35016 Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain.

However, the mechanisms by which BECN1 restrains tumorigenesis and whether autophagy-independent functions of BECN1 contribute to its tumor-restraining potential remained unexplored. We recently described a novel function of BECN1-regulation of oncogene MCL1 protein levels. Our results show that BECN1 regulates MCL1 levels in an inverse-reciprocal manner, whereby changes in the levels of one of the 2 proteins inversely affects the proteasomal degradation of the other. Importantly, this mechanism is independent of autophagy and of the physical interaction between BECN1 and MCL1. In vitro and in vivo analysis using several models, including patient-derived melanoma cells and tissue samples from patients with melanocytic lesions at different stages, showed that the identified mechanism of inverse coregulation between BECN1 and MCL1 significantly contributes to their opposing roles in tumorigenesis.","['Elgendy, Mohamed', 'Minucci, Saverio']","['Elgendy M', 'Minucci S']","['a Department of Experimental Oncology ; European Institute of Oncology ; IEO ; Milan , Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BECN1 protein, human)', '0 (Beclin-1)', '0 (Becn1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (USP9X protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Usp9x protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*metabolism', '*Autophagy', 'Beclin-1', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Melanocytes/metabolism', 'Melanoma/embryology', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Oncogenes', 'Phenotype', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex/metabolism', 'Skin Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/metabolism']",2015/04/04 06:00,2016/03/08 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15548627.2015.1029836 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2015;11(3):581-2. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2015.1029836.,,PMC4502650,['NOTNLM'],"['BECN1', 'MCL1', 'USP9X', 'melanoma', 'proteasome']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical outcomes were correlated to comprehensive analyses of soluble and cellular biomarkers. Complete resolution (CR) of aGVHD at day 28 (CR-28) occurred in 12 (25%) patients, CR lasting >1 month (CR-B) occurred in 24 (50%) patients. One-year overall survival was significantly improved in CR-28 (75 versus 33%, P=0.020) and CR-B (79 versus 8%, P<0.001) versus non-CR patients. A six soluble biomarker-panel was predictive for mortality (HR 2.924; CI 1.485-5.758) when measured before MSC-administration. Suppression of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) was only predictive for mortality 2 weeks after but not before MSC-administration (HR 2.389; CI 1.144-4.989). In addition, an increase in immature myeloid dendritic cells associated with decreased mortality (HR 0.554, CI 0.389-0.790). Patients had persisting T-cell responses against defined virus- and leukemia-associated antigens.

As they yield the same oncometabolite, D-2-hydroxyglutarate, they are often treated as equivalent, and pooled. We studied the validity of this approach and found IDH1/2 mutations in 179 of 2119 myeloid neoplasms (8%). Cross-sectionally, the frequencies of these mutations increased from lower- to higher risk disease, thus suggesting a role in clinical progression. Variant allelic frequencies indicated that IDH1(MT) and IDH2(MT) are ancestral in up to 14/74 (19%) vs 34/99 (34%; P=0.027) of cases, respectively, illustrating the pathogenic role of these lesions in myeloid neoplasms. IDH1/2(MT) was associated with poor overall survival, particularly in lower risk myelodysplastic syndromes. Ancestral IDH1(MT) cases were associated with a worse prognosis than subclonal IDH1(MT) cases, whereas the position of IDH2(MT) within clonal hierarchy did not impact survival. This may relate to distinct mutational spectra with more DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations associated with IDH1(MT) cases, and more ASXL1, SRSF2, RUNX1, STAG2 mutations associated with IDH2(MT) cases. Our data demonstrate important clinical and biological differences between IDH1(MT) and IDH2(MT) myeloid neoplasms. These mutations should be considered separately as their differences could have implications for diagnosis, prognosis and treatment with IDH1/2(MT) inhibitors of IDH1/2(MT) patients.","['Molenaar, R J', 'Thota, S', 'Nagata, Y', 'Patel, B', 'Clemente, M', 'Przychodzen, B', 'Hirsh, C', 'Viny, A D', 'Hosano, N', 'Bleeker, F E', 'Meggendorfer, M', 'Alpermann, T', 'Shiraishi, Y', 'Chiba, K', 'Tanaka, H', 'van Noorden, C J F', 'Radivoyevitch, T', 'Carraway, H E', 'Makishima, H', 'Miyano, S', 'Sekeres, M A', 'Ogawa, S', 'Haferlach, T', 'Maciejewski, J P']","['Molenaar RJ', 'Thota S', 'Nagata Y', 'Patel B', 'Clemente M', 'Przychodzen B', 'Hirsh C', 'Viny AD', 'Hosano N', 'Bleeker FE', 'Meggendorfer M', 'Alpermann T', 'Shiraishi Y', 'Chiba K', 'Tanaka H', 'van Noorden CJ', 'Radivoyevitch T', 'Carraway HE', 'Makishima H', 'Miyano S', 'Sekeres MA', 'Ogawa S', 'Haferlach T', 'Maciejewski JP']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology & Histology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Human Oncology & Pathogenesis, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Meibergdreef 15, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratories, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, Germany.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratories, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of DNA Information Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Sequence Analysis, Human Genome Center, Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Cell Biology & Histology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Quantitative Health Sciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Munich Leukemia Laboratories, Max-Lebsche-Platz 31, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

ROR1 is selectively overexpressed in a number of solid and hematological malignancies without significant expression in normal adult tissues. There are also some lines of evidence, which support the critical role of ROR1 in tumorigenesis. These characteristics introduce ROR1 as a suitable target for selective cancer immunotherapy. ROR1 targeting using different approaches such as siRNA, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and antibody induces tumor growth suppression in cancer cells. AREAS COVERED: The current review focuses on ROR1 structure and biological functions, expression profiles in normal and malignant tissues and its potential therapeutic applications in different malignancies. We aimed to encompass almost all important aspects of ROR1 biology and its importance in tumor targeted therapy approaches based on published papers in this field. EXPERT OPINION: Considering ROR1 unique characters, it seems that it can pass most of the criteria for being an ideal target for cancer immunotherapy. ROR1 unique expression on cancer cells with subtle expression on normal tissues make it a suitable target with minimum potential side effects using different cancer therapy approaches such as mAb therapy, peptide and protein vaccination, cell therapy and small molecules.","['Shabani, Mahdi', 'Naseri, Jila', 'Shokri, Fazel']","['Shabani M', 'Naseri J', 'Shokri F']","['Monoclonal Antibody Research Center, Avicenna Research Institute, ACECR , Tehran , Iran +98 2122432020 ; +98 2122432021 ; m.shabani@Avicenna.ac.ir ; msshabani@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Ther Targets,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,101127833,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ROR1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Cancer Vaccines/administration & dosage', 'Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptor Tyrosine Kinase-like Orphan Receptors/*metabolism']",2015/04/04 06:00,2016/03/12 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728222.2015.1025753 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Ther Targets. 2015 Jul;19(7):941-55. doi: 10.1517/14728222.2015.1025753.

We have been performing WT1 peptide vaccination with good clinical responses in over 750 patients with leukemia or solid cancers. In this study, we generated single-cell gene-expression profiles of the effector memory (EM) subset of WT1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in peripheral blood of nine acute myeloid leukemia patients treated with WT1 peptide vaccine, in order to discriminate responders (WT1 mRNA levels in peripheral blood decreased to undetectable levels, decreased but stayed at abnormal levels, were stable at undetectable levels, or remained unchanged from the initial abnormal levels more than 6 months after WT1 vaccination) from non-responders (leukemic blast cells and/or WT1 mRNA levels increased relative to the initial state within 6 months of WT1 vaccination) prior to WT1 vaccination. Cluster and principal component analyses performed using 83 genes did not discriminate between responders and non-responders prior to WT1 vaccination. However, these analyses revealed that EM subset of WT1-specific CTLs could be divided into two groups: the ""activated"" and ""quiescent"" states; in responders, EM subset of the CTLs shifted to the ""quiescent"" state, whereas in non-responders, those shifted to the ""activated"" state following WT1 vaccination. These results demonstrate for the first time the existence of two distinct EM states, each of which was characteristic of responders or non-responders, of WT1-specific CTLs in AML patients, and raises the possibility of using advanced gene-expression profile analysis to clearly discriminate between responders and non-responders prior to WT1 vaccination.","['Nakae, Yoshiki', 'Oka, Yoshihiro', 'Fujiki, Fumihiro', 'Morimoto, Soyoko', 'Kamiya, Toshio', 'Takashima, Satoshi', 'Nakata, Jun', 'Nishida, Sumiyuki', 'Nakajima, Hiroko', 'Hosen, Naoki', 'Tsuboi, Akihiro', 'Kyo, Taiichi', 'Oji, Yusuke', 'Mizuguchi, Kenji', 'Kumanogoh, Atsushi', 'Sugiyama, Haruo']","['Nakae Y', 'Oka Y', 'Fujiki F', 'Morimoto S', 'Kamiya T', 'Takashima S', 'Nakata J', 'Nishida S', 'Nakajima H', 'Hosen N', 'Tsuboi A', 'Kyo T', 'Oji Y', 'Mizuguchi K', 'Kumanogoh A', 'Sugiyama H']","['Departments of Respiratory Medicine, Allergy and Rheumatic Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka University, 2-2 Yamadaoka, Suita, Osaka, 565-0871, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cancer Vaccines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vaccines, Subunit)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*immunology', 'Cancer Vaccines/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory/*immunology', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Principal Component Analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/blood/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/cytology/*immunology', 'Vaccines, Subunit/immunology/therapeutic use', 'WT1 Proteins/genetics/*immunology']",2015/04/04 06:00,2015/10/24 06:00,['2015/04/04 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00262-015-1683-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 2015 Jul;64(7):791-804. doi: 10.1007/s00262-015-1683-7.

Immunophenotyping by flowcytometry is essential for diagnosis of myeloid and lymphoid subtypes. Aberrant phenotype incidence is controversial and dissimilar results have been reported by different groups. OBJECTIVES: Purpose of the study was to determine the incidence of aberrant phenotypes in North East Indian patients with acute leukemia. METHODS: We analysed a total of 100 cases (AML = 36, ALL = 61, MPAL = 3) by multiparametric flow cytometry using an acute panel of monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). The MoAbs were selected to identify differentiation-associated antigens of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages. RESULTS: Aberrant phenotypes were found in 21 (58.3%) cases of AML, 36 (59.2%) cases of B-ALL and 6 (66.7%) cases of T-ALL. CD7 was the most frequent lymphoid associated antigen found in 33% of AML cases while CD117 was the myeloid antigen most frequently detected in ALL (54%) cases. Aberrant expression of CD 117 is highly significant by Fischer's exact test (P< 0.0001). CONCLUSION: We conclude that aberrant phenotypes are present in a great majority of acute leukemia patients of North East India. Future studies will be directed to correlate of these markers with prognosis and therapeutic response.","['Sarma, Anupam', 'Hazarika, Munlima', 'Das, Debabrata', 'Kumar Rai, Avdhesh', 'Sharma, Jagannath Dev', 'Bhuyan, Chidananda', 'Kataki, Amal Chandra']","['Sarma A', 'Hazarika M', 'Das D', 'Kumar Rai A', 'Sharma JD', 'Bhuyan C', 'Kataki AC']","['Department of Pathology, Dr. B.

Here, functional proteomics of the ASXL family members are reviewed with emphasis on mutation spectra, the ASXM2 domain and the plant homeodomain (PHD) finger. Copy number gains of ASXL1 occur in chromosome 20q11.2 duplication syndrome and cervical cancer. Truncation mutations of ASXLs occur in autism, Bohring-Opitz and related syndromes, hematological malignancies and solid tumors, such as prostate cancer, breast cancer and high-grade glioma, which are gain- or loss-of-function mutations.

25834907,,Publisher,,,,,,2010,Discovering Small Molecules that Overcome Differentiation Arrest in Acute Myeloid Leukemia,,,"Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in adults is a clinically devastating disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 25%. We lack new and effective therapies for AML, and the chemotherapy standard of care remains unchanged in thirty years. One success story has been the discovery of drugs that trigger the differentiation of leukemic blasts in a small subset of patients, approximately 10%, with acute pro-myelocytic leukemia. Differentiation therapy is not available for the remaining 90% of acute myeloid leukemia patients. We generated a novel cell line model of acute myeloid leukemia, based on the potent ability of the homeobox protein HoxA9 to block differentiation in primary murine cultures of immature myeloblasts. These cells were engineered with a built-in reporter of differentiation, permitting a high-throughput flow-cytometry-based phenotypic differentiation screen against more than 330,000 small molecules. 2,500 compounds were retested resulting in twenty-nine confirmed hits. Active compounds and analogs were obtained, validated, and tested in dose against the screening cell line as well as other murine and human cell lines. This identified twelve active compounds from which two distinct scaffolds were chosen for further study based upon chemical tractability and availability. One of the two hits demonstrated stereospecificity, hence we chose to explore SAR about this lead. Of approximately thirty synthesized analogs, we identified four compounds that were more active in three cell lines (THP-1, U937 and ERHOXA9). We have chosen compound ML390 as the probe given its potent activity. Of note, the lead compound and its analog ML390 are both very well-tolerated with limited cytotoxicity at high concentrations when assayed against cultures of normal human primary bone marrow cells. ML390 exerts its potent differentiation effect on multiple leukemia models, though its mechanism of action is currently unknown. Target identification assays as well as experiments for testing the compound in vivo are currently underway. Mechanism of action studies will be performed in parallel using a combination of gene expression studies (Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures, LINCS), stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), and next-generation sequencing of compound-resistant cell clones. ML390 will be tested in mice harboring a HoxA9-driven acute myeloid leukemia to assess its differentiation effect as well as its effect on leukemic progression and overall survival. The chemotherapy standard of care in acute myeloid leukemia relies on traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy and has not changed in more than thirty years. We need new, and less toxic, therapeutic agents. In the context of our novel cell line model of AML, we hope to have identified a clinically relevant pro-differentiation therapy for acute myeloid leukemia. If successful, we anticipate that ML390 will offer insight into the mechanism of overcoming differentiation arrest, and will translate into a starting point for a much-needed new and potent treatment for patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Sykes, David B.', 'Haynes, Mark K.', 'Waller, Anna', 'Garcia, Matthew', 'Ursu, Oleg', 'Gouveia, Kristine E.', 'Sklar, Larry', 'Lewis, Timothy A.', 'Dandapani, Sivaraman', 'Munoz, Benito', 'Scadden, David T.', 'Palmer, Michelle', 'Schreiber, Stuart L.']","['Sykes DB', 'Haynes MK', 'Waller A', 'Garcia M', 'Ursu O', 'Gouveia KE', 'Sklar L', 'Lewis TA', 'Dandapani S', 'Munoz B', 'Scadden DT', 'Palmer M', 'Schreiber SL']",,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Bethesda (MD),,,,,,,2015/04/04 06:00,2015/04/04 06:00,,,['NBK280053 [bookaccession]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20150404,['20150211'],['20131215'],['National Center for Biotechnology Information (US)'],['Probe Reports from the NIH Molecular Libraries Program'],['2015/04/04 06:00'],,,,

Such aberrant AID expression is seen in B-cell leukemia/lymphomas, including Burkitt lymphoma which is associated with c-myc translocation. Moreover, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein-1 (LMP-1) increases genomic instability through early growth transcription response-1 (Egr-1) mediated upregulation of AID in B-cell lymphoma. However, few clinicopathological studies have focused on AID expression in lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs). Therefore, we conducted an immunohistochemical study to investigate the relationship between AID and LMP-1 expression in LPDs (MTX-/Age-related EBV-associated), including diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs). More intense AID expression was detected in LPDs (89.5%) than in DLBCLs (20.0%), and the expression of LMP-1 and EBER was more intense in LPDs (68.4% and 94.7%) than in DLBCLs (10.0% and 20.0%). Furthermore, stronger Egr-1 expression was found in MTX/Age-EBV-LPDs (83.3%) than in DLBCLs (30.0%). AID expression was significantly constitutively overexpressed in LPDs as compared with DLBCLs. These results suggest that increased AID expression in LPDs may be one of the processes involved in lymphomagenesis, thereby further increasing the survival of genetically destabilized B-cells. AID expression may be a useful indicator for differentiation between LPDs and DLBCLs.","['Kikuchi, Kentaro', 'Ishige, Toshiyuki', 'Ide, Fumio', 'Ito, Yumi', 'Saito, Ichiro', 'Hoshino, Miyako', 'Inoue, Harumi', 'Miyazaki, Yuji', 'Nozaki, Tadashige', 'Kojima, Masaru', 'Kusama, Kaoru']","['Kikuchi K', 'Ishige T', 'Ide F', 'Ito Y', 'Saito I', 'Hoshino M', 'Inoue H', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Nozaki T', 'Kojima M', 'Kusama K']","['Division of Pathology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, 1-1 Keyakidai, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Nihon University School of Medicine, 30-1 Oyaguchi-Kamimachi, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, 1-1 Keyakidai, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan.', 'Division of Diagnostic Pathology, Tsurumi University Dental Hospital, 2-1-3 Tsurumi, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama 230-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Tsurumi University School of Dental Medicine, 2-1-3 Tsurumi, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama 230-8501, Japan.', 'Second Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, 1-1 Keyakidai, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, 1-1 Keyakidai, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, 1-1 Keyakidai, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Osaka Dental University, 8-1 Kuzuhahanazono-cho, Hirakata, Osaka 573-1211, Japan.', 'Department of Anatomic and Diagnostic Pathology, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, 880 Oaza-kitakobayashi, Mibu-machi, Shimotsuga-gun, Tochigi 321-0293, Japan.', 'Division of Pathology, Department of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Sciences, Meikai University School of Dentistry, 1-1 Keyakidai, Sakado, Saitama 350-0283, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,2015/04/04 06:00,2015/04/04 06:01,['2015/04/03 06:00'],"['2014/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/04 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/605750 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol. 2015;2015:605750. doi: 10.1155/2015/605750.

Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-differentiated human acute monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was infected with H. pylori. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-18 in supernatant were measured by ELISA. Intracellular ROS level was analyzed by flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis were employed to determine the mRNA and protein expression levels of NLRP3 and caspase-1 in THP-1 cells, respectively. Our results showed that H. pylori infection could induce IL-1beta and IL-18 production in PMA-differentiated THP-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, secretion of IL-1beta and IL-18 in THP-1 cells following H. pylori infection was remarkably reduced by NLRP3-specific small interfering RNA treatment. In addition, the intracellular ROS level was elevated by H. pylori infection, which could be eliminated by the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Furthermore, NAC treatment could inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome formation and caspase-1 activation and suppress the release of IL-1beta and IL-18 from H. pylori-infected THP-1 cells. These findings provide novel insights into the innate immune response against H. pylori infection, which could potentially be used for the prevention and treatment of H. pylori-related diseases.","['Li, Xiang', 'Liu, Sheng', 'Luo, Jingjing', 'Liu, Anyuan', 'Tang, Shuangyang', 'Liu, Shuo', 'Yu, Minjun', 'Zhang, Yan']","['Li X', 'Liu S', 'Luo J', 'Liu A', 'Tang S', 'Liu S', 'Yu M', 'Zhang Y']","['Institute of Pathogenic Biology, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, China.', 'Institute of Pathogenic Biology, University of South China, Hengyang 421001, Hunan, China nhzhangyan@126.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pathog Dis,Pathogens and disease,101595366,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (IL18 protein, human)', '0 (Inflammasomes)', '0 (Interleukin-18)', '0 (Interleukin-1beta)', '0 (NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein)', '0 (NLRP3 protein, human)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Caspase 1/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Helicobacter pylori/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Inflammasomes/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-18/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-1beta/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/*immunology/microbiology', 'NLR Family, Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 Protein', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction']",2015/04/04 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2015/04/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['ftu024 [pii]', '10.1093/femspd/ftu024 [doi]']",ppublish,Pathog Dis. 2015 Jun;73(4). pii: ftu024. doi: 10.1093/femspd/ftu024.

Tracking mutant alleles to determine clonality from diagnosis to relapse or from primary site to metastases in a sensitive and quantitative manner is most often performed using next-generation sequencing. Such methods determine clonal frequencies by extrapolation of allele frequencies in sequencing data of DNA from the metagenome of bulk tumor samples using a set of assumptions. The computational framework that is usually used assumes specific patterns in the order of acquisition of unique mutational events and heterozygosity of mutations in single cells. However, these assumptions are not accurate for all mutant loci in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) samples. To assess whether current models of clonal diversity within individual AML samples are appropriate for common mutations, we developed protocols to directly genotype AML single cells. Single-cell analysis demonstrates that mutations of FLT3 and NPM1 occur in both homozygous and heterozygous states, distributed among at least nine distinct clonal populations in all samples analyzed.

We report that neuronal ablation of the H3K4-specific methyltransferase, Kmt2a/Mixed-lineage leukemia 1 (Mll1), in mouse postnatal forebrain and adult prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with increased anxiety and robust cognitive deficits without locomotor dysfunction. In contrast, only mild behavioral phenotypes were observed after ablation of the Mll1 ortholog Kmt2b/Mll2 in PFC. Impaired working memory after Kmt2a/Mll1 ablation in PFC neurons was associated with loss of training-induced transient waves of Arc immediate early gene expression critical for synaptic plasticity. Medial prefrontal layer V pyramidal neurons, a major output relay of the cortex, demonstrated severely impaired synaptic facilitation and temporal summation, two forms of short-term plasticity essential for working memory. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing in Mll1-deficient cortical neurons revealed downregulated expression and loss of the transcriptional mark, trimethyl-H3K4, at <50 loci, including the homeodomain transcription factor Meis2. Small RNA-mediated Meis2 knockdown in PFC was associated with working memory defects similar to those elicited by Mll1 deletion. Therefore, mature prefrontal neurons critically depend on maintenance of Mll1-regulated H3K4 methylation at a subset of genes with an essential role in cognition and emotion.","['Jakovcevski, Mira', 'Ruan, Hongyu', 'Shen, Erica Y', 'Dincer, Aslihan', 'Javidfar, Behnam', 'Ma, Qi', 'Peter, Cyril J', 'Cheung, Iris', 'Mitchell, Amanda C', 'Jiang, Yan', 'Lin, Cong L', 'Pothula, Venu', 'Stewart, A Francis', 'Ernst, Patricia', 'Yao, Wei-Dong', 'Akbarian, Schahram']","['Jakovcevski M', 'Ruan H', 'Shen EY', 'Dincer A', 'Javidfar B', 'Ma Q', 'Peter CJ', 'Cheung I', 'Mitchell AC', 'Jiang Y', 'Lin CL', 'Pothula V', 'Stewart AF', 'Ernst P', 'Yao WD', 'Akbarian S']","['Department of Psychiatry and Friedman Brain Institute and Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, 80804 Munich, Germany, and.', 'New England Primate Center, Harvard Medical School, Southborough, Massachusetts 01702.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Friedman Brain Institute and.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Friedman Brain Institute and Department of Genetics and Genomics Science and Institute for Multiscale Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Friedman Brain Institute and.', 'Department of Genetics and Genomics Science and Institute for Multiscale Biology, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York 10029.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Friedman Brain Institute and.', 'Brudnick Neuropsychiatric Research Institute, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604.', 'New England Primate Center, Harvard Medical School, Southborough, Massachusetts 01702.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Friedman Brain Institute and.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Friedman Brain Institute and.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Friedman Brain Institute and.', 'Genomics BioinnovationsZentrum, Technische Universitaet, 01307 Dresden, Germany.', 'Department of Genetics and Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Norris Cotton Cancer Center, Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover New Hampshire 03755.', 'New England Primate Center, Harvard Medical School, Southborough, Massachusetts 01702, Schahram.akbarian@mssm.edu yaow@upstate.edu.', 'Department of Psychiatry and Friedman Brain Institute and Brudnick Neuropsychiatric Research Institute, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts 01604, Schahram.akbarian@mssm.edu yaow@upstate.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Mrg1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (activity regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Behavior, Animal/physiology', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*metabolism', 'Homeodomain Proteins/drug effects/genetics', 'Male', 'Memory, Short-Term/*physiology', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*metabolism', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/metabolism', 'Neuronal Plasticity/*physiology', 'Prefrontal Cortex/*physiology', 'Prosencephalon/physiology', 'Pyramidal Cells/physiology']",2015/04/04 06:00,2015/06/20 06:00,['2015/04/03 06:00'],"['2015/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/20 06:00 [medline]']","['35/13/5097 [pii]', '10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3004-14.2015 [doi]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 2015 Apr 1;35(13):5097-108. doi: 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3004-14.2015.,,PMC4380991,['NOTNLM'],"['ChIP-seq', 'histone H3-lysine 4 methylation', 'neuroepigenetics', 'neuronal nuclei sorting', 'short-term plasticity', 'working memory']",['Copyright (c) 2015 the authors 0270-6474/15/355097-12$15.00/0.'],"['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4971-1597', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9190-8724']",,"['OD011103/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01MH086509/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'P51 OD011103/OD/NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH104341/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA032283/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DA032283/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 MH096890/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'P50MH096890/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 MH086509/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the compounds identified, GNF-7, potently and selectively inhibited NRAS-dependent cells in preclinical models of acute myelogenous leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Mechanistic analysis revealed that its effects were mediated in part through combined inhibition of ACK1/AKT and of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase kinase 2 (germinal center kinase).

Communication between CLL cells and the microenvironment is mediated through direct cell contact, soluble factors, and extracellular vesicles. Exosomes are small particles enclosed with lipids, proteins, and small RNAs that can convey biological materials to surrounding cells. Our data herein demonstrate that CLL cells release significant amounts of exosomes in plasma that exhibit abundant CD37, CD9, and CD63 expression. Our work also pinpoints the regulation of B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling in the release of CLL exosomes: BCR activation by alpha-immunoglobulin (Ig)M induces exosome secretion, whereas BCR inactivation via ibrutinib impedes alpha-IgM-stimulated exosome release. Moreover, analysis of serial plasma samples collected from CLL patients on an ibrutinib clinical trial revealed that exosome plasma concentration was significantly decreased following ibrutinib therapy. Furthermore, microRNA (miR) profiling of plasma-derived exosomes identified a distinct exosome microRNA signature, including miR-29 family, miR-150, miR-155, and miR-223 that have been associated with CLL disease. Interestingly, expression of exosome miR-150 and miR-155 increases with BCR activation. In all, this study successfully characterized CLL exosomes, demonstrated the control of BCR signaling in the release of CLL exosomes, and uncovered a disease-relevant exosome microRNA profile.","['Yeh, Yuh-Ying', 'Ozer, Hatice Gulcin', 'Lehman, Amy M', 'Maddocks, Kami', 'Yu, Lianbo', 'Johnson, Amy J', 'Byrd, John C']","['Yeh YY', 'Ozer HG', 'Lehman AM', 'Maddocks K', 'Yu L', 'Johnson AJ', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics.', 'Center for Biostatistics, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Center for Biostatistics, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Pharmacognosy, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Exosomes/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*physiology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",2015/04/03 06:00,2015/07/29 06:00,['2015/04/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31660-8 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-12-618470 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 21;125(21):3297-305. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-12-618470.

Despite the clear clinical benefit to the patient, radiation exposure from paediatric cardiac catheterisation procedures (CCPs) may be substantial. Given children's greater sensitivity to radiation and the longer life span during which radiation health effects can develop, an epidemiological cohort study, named Coccinelle or 'Ladybird' (French acronym for 'Cohorte sur le risque de cancer apres cardiologie interventionnelle pediatrique'), is carried out in France to evaluate the risks of leukaemia and solid cancers in this population. A total number of 8000 included children are expected. Individual CCP-related doses will be assessed for each child included in the cohort.

In a previous study, we screened various natural products in human leukemia HL-60 cells and identified an essential oil fraction from A. lancea rhizome that exhibited apoptosis-inducing activity in these cells; hinesol was subsequently shown to be the compound responsible for this apoptosis-inducing activity. In this study, we describe the cytotoxic effects and molecular mechanisms of hinesol in HL-60 cells. The antitumor effect of hinesol was associated with apoptosis. When HL-60 cells were treated with hinesol, characteristic features of apoptosis, such as nuclear fragmentation and DNA fragmentation, were observed. These growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing activities of hinesol in leukemia cells were much stronger than those of beta-eudesmol, another compound isolated from the essential oil fraction. Furthermore, hinesol induced activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not p38, prior to the onset of apoptosis. These results suggested that hinesol induced apoptosis through the JNK signaling pathway in HL-60 cells. Therefore, hinesol may represent a novel medicinal drug having indications in the treatment of various cancers, including leukemia.","['Masuda, Yutaka', 'Kadokura, Takayuki', 'Ishii, Maki', 'Takada, Kimihiko', 'Kitajima, Junichi']","['Masuda Y', 'Kadokura T', 'Ishii M', 'Takada K', 'Kitajima J']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacy, Showa Pharmaceutical University, Higashi Tamagawa Gakuen, Machida, Tokyo, 194-8543, Japan, ymasuda@ac.shoyaku.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,J Nat Med,Journal of natural medicines,101518405,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '0 (Spiro Compounds)', '23811-08-7 (hinesol)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Atractylodes/*chemistry', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Leukemia', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Oils, Volatile/*pharmacology', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Rhizome/*chemistry', 'Sesquiterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Spiro Compounds/*pharmacology']",2015/04/03 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/04/03 06:00'],"['2014/12/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s11418-015-0897-5 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Med. 2015 Jul;69(3):332-9. doi: 10.1007/s11418-015-0897-5.

We found that expression levels of CCR6 on human effector/memory CD4(+) T cells reflect a continuum of Th17 differentiation. By evaluating the transcriptome in cells with increasing CCR6, we detected progressive upregulation of ZBTB16, which encodes the broad complex, tramtrack, bric-a-brac-zinc finger transcription factor promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation for modified histones, p300, and PLZF, we identified enhancer-like sites at -9/-10 and -13/-14 kb from the upstream transcription start site of CCR6 that bind PLZF in CCR6(+) cells. For Th cells from adult blood, both in the CCR6(+) memory population and in naive cells activated ex vivo, knockdown of ZBTB16 downregulated CCR6 and other Th17-associated genes. ZBTB16 and RORC (which encodes the ""master regulator"" RORgammat) cross-regulate each other, and PLZF binds at the RORC promoter in CCR6(+) cells. In naive Th cells from cord blood, ZBTB16 expression was confined to CD161(+) cells, which are Th17 cell precursors. ZBTB16 was not expressed in mouse Th17 cells, and Th17 cells could be made from luxoid mice, which harbor an inactivating mutation in Zbtb16. These studies demonstrate a role for PLZF as an activator of transcription important both for Th17 differentiation and the maintenance of the Th17 phenotype in human cells, expand the role of PLZF as a critical regulator in the human adaptive immune system, and identify a novel, essential element in a regulatory network that is of significant therapeutic interest.","['Singh, Satya P', 'Zhang, Hongwei H', 'Tsang, Hsinyi', 'Gardina, Paul J', 'Myers, Timothy G', 'Nagarajan, Vijayaraj', 'Lee, Chang Hoon', 'Farber, Joshua M']","['Singh SP', 'Zhang HH', 'Tsang H', 'Gardina PJ', 'Myers TG', 'Nagarajan V', 'Lee CH', 'Farber JM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;', 'Research Technologies Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; and.', 'Research Technologies Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; and.', 'Bioinformatics and Computational Biosciences Branch, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892;', 'Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892; jfarber@niaid.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily B)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Receptors, CCR6)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics/immunology', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily B/metabolism', '*Phenotype', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, CCR6/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Th17 Cells/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism']",2015/04/03 06:00,2015/07/01 06:00,['2015/04/03 06:00'],"['2014/04/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/01 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1401093 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1401093 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 May 1;194(9):4350-61. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1401093.

This translocation forms the BCR-ABL1 oncogene, which alters several signaling pathways that control malignancy. CML has three phases: chronic, accelerated, and blast crisis. The microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) are noncoding RNAs that downregulate their target gene by targeting 3' UTR of mRNA or through translational inhibition. It has been shown that miRNAs regulate many biological processes, and dysregulation of these regulatory RNAs is involved in disease development, particularly in cancer. The important role of miRNAs as therapeutic agents and biomarkers has been demonstrated in CML patients at different phases of the disease. METHODS: Stem-loop reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was used to characterize differentially expressed miRNAs of leukocytes in the peripheral blood of 50 newly diagnosed CML patients in chronic phase. RESULTS: Some onco-miRNAs were found to be downregulated (miR-155 and miR-106), and some tumor suppressor miRs (miR-16-1, miR-15a, miR-101, miR-568) were upregulated. CONCLUSION: These results show that very few miRNAs alone would be good candidates for CML diagnosis independently of conflicting results, but together could be an additional tool for CML diagnosis. Moreover, miRNAs might be good candidates for prognosis prediction and CML therapy.","['Fallah, P', 'Amirizadeh, N', 'Poopak, B', 'Toogeh, G', 'Arefian, E', 'Kohram, F', 'Hosseini Rad, S M A', 'Kohram, M', 'Teimori Naghadeh, H', 'Soleimani, M']","['Fallah P', 'Amirizadeh N', 'Poopak B', 'Toogeh G', 'Arefian E', 'Kohram F', 'Hosseini Rad SM', 'Kohram M', 'Teimori Naghadeh H', 'Soleimani M']","['Blood Transfusion Research center, High institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Alborz University of Medical Science, Karaj, Iran.', 'Blood Transfusion Research center, High institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Medical science branch, Islamic Azad University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Thrombosis and Homeostasis Research Center, Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology, School of Biology, College of Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biology, Cell Molecular and Structural Biology Program, Miami University, Oxford, OH, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biology and Genetic Engineering, Stem Cell Technology Research Center, Tehran, Iran.', 'Genomic Medicine Institute, Geisinger Health System, Danville, PA, USA.', 'Blood Transfusion Research center, High institute for Research and Education in Transfusion Medicine, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Lab Hematol,International journal of laboratory hematology,101300213,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2015/04/03 06:00,2016/04/14 06:00,['2015/04/03 06:00'],"['2014/11/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ijlh.12351 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Lab Hematol. 2015 Aug;37(4):560-8. doi: 10.1111/ijlh.12351.

The microarray data of GSE9476 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. A total of 64 samples, including 26 AML and 38 normal samples, were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AML and normal samples. The functional enrichment analysis was performed, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of the DEGs was constructed by Cytoscape software. Besides, the target miRNAs for DEGs were identified. Totally, 323 DEGs were identified, including 87 up-regulated and 236 down-regulated genes. Not only up-regulated genes but also down-regulated genes were related to hematopoietic-related functions. Besides, down-regulated genes were also enriched in primary immunodeficiency pathway. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R), lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK), CD79a molecule and immunoglobulin-associated alpha (CD79A) were identified in these functions.

This screen identified the novel small molecule Deoxysappanone B 7,4' dimethyl ether (Deox B 7,4), which possessed nanomolar anti-leukemic activity. To determine the anti-leukemic mechanism of action of Deox B 7,4, we conducted a genome-wide screen in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and identified enrichment of genes related to mitotic cell cycle as well as vacuolar acidification, therefore pointing to microtubules and vacuolar (V)-ATPase as potential drug targets. Further investigations into the mechanisms of action of Deox B 7,4 and a related analogue revealed that these compounds were reversible microtubule inhibitors that bound near the colchicine site. In addition, Deox B 7,4 and its analogue increased lysosomal V-ATPase activity and lysosome acidity. The effects on microtubules and lysosomes were functionally important for the anti-leukemic effects of these drugs. The lysosomal effects were characteristic of select microtubule inhibitors as only the Deox compounds and nocodazole, but not colchicine, vinca alkaloids or paclitaxel, altered lysosome acidity and induced lysosomal disruption. Thus, our data highlight a new mechanism of action of select microtubule inhibitors on lysosomal function.","['Bernard, Dannie', 'Gebbia, Marinella', 'Prabha, Swayam', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'MacLean, Neil', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Sukhai, Mahadeo A', 'Cho, Eunice E', 'Manolson, Morris F', 'Datti, Alessandro', 'Wrana, Jeffrey', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Al-Awar, Rima', 'Aman, Ahmed', 'Nislow, Corey', 'Giaever, Guri', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Bernard D', 'Gebbia M', 'Prabha S', 'Gronda M', 'MacLean N', 'Wang X', 'Hurren R', 'Sukhai MA', 'Cho EE', 'Manolson MF', 'Datti A', 'Wrana J', 'Minden MD', 'Al-Awar R', 'Aman A', 'Nislow C', 'Giaever G', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network, Rm 9-516, 610 University Ave, Toronto, ON, M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Tubulin Modulators)', ""0 (deoxysappanone B 7,4' dimethyl ether)"", '6JKA7MAH9C (Guaiacol)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromones/*pharmacology', 'Guaiacol/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lysosomes/chemistry/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Tubulin Modulators/*pharmacology', 'Vacuolar Proton-Translocating ATPases/metabolism']",2015/04/03 06:00,2016/01/05 06:00,['2015/04/03 06:00'],"['2015/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-015-1123-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2015 Jul;20(7):948-59. doi: 10.1007/s10495-015-1123-3.,,,,,,,,['Canadian Institutes of Health Research/Canada'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: We performed a cross-sectional study with comprehensive echocardiography in 138 adult survivors of childhood ALL, median 23.4 years after diagnosis. Pulsed tissue Doppler measurements of early diastolic mitral annular velocities (e') were used for the assessment of diastolic function, and compared to 138 matched controls. Of the survivors, 133 also performed ergospirometry measuring peak oxygen uptake (VO2 max). Associations between cancer treatment, LV function, and VO2 max were analyzed. RESULTS: The survivor group had lower e' values than controls (e' septal 11.0 vs. 12.6 cm/s, P < 0.001), but the difference was confined to the subgroup of anthracycline treated survivors (median cumulative dose 120 mg/m(2) ). Anthracycline exposure was inversely correlated with e' (regression coefficient -1.581, P=0.009). Reduced VO2 max/kg occurred in 47% of the survivors, but more often in anthracycline treated survivors (56%) than anthracycline naive survivors (17%, P<0.001). Anthracycline exposure was inversely correlated with VO2 max/kg (regression coefficient -3.084, P = 0.05 in multivariate analysis). Furthermore, associations were observed between measures of LV function and VO2 max/kg, and e' was the best predictor of VO2 max/kg (standardized coefficient 0.355, P < 0.001 in multivariate analysis). CONCLUSIONS: Adult survivors of childhood ALL have increased risk for impaired LV diastolic function and impaired exercise capacity, both associated with previous anthracycline exposure. Furthermore, there is an association between LV diastolic function and exercise capacity.","['Christiansen, Jon R', 'Kanellopoulos, Adriani', 'Lund, May B', 'Massey, Richard', 'Dalen, Havard', 'Kiserud, Cecilie E', 'Ruud, Ellen', 'Aakhus, Svend']","['Christiansen JR', 'Kanellopoulos A', 'Lund MB', 'Massey R', 'Dalen H', 'Kiserud CE', 'Ruud E', 'Aakhus S']","['Department of Cardiology, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Innlandet Hospital Trust, Elverum, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Respiratory Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cardiology, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Levanger Hospital, Nord-Trondelag Health Trust, Levanger, Norway.', 'Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.', 'National Resource Centre for Late Effects after Cancer Treatment, Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pediatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Cardiology, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Anthracyclines)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anthracyclines/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cardiotoxicity', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Echocardiography', 'Exercise/*physiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Physical Fitness/*physiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Survivors', 'Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/*chemically induced', 'Ventricular Function, Left/physiology', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/03 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/04/03 06:00'],"['2014/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25492 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Aug;62(8):1437-43. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25492.

This pathway pedals proliferation, survival, translation, and coupled with tumor-associated endurance. Current efforts focus on the discovery and development of novel inhibitors of this pathway. We have discovered 6-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-N-phenylquinolin-4-amine [PQQ] as a potent mTOR inhibitor with IC50 value of 64nM in a cell-based and cell-free mTOR assay. Mechanistically, PQQ was found to be a strong PI3K-Akt-mTOR-p70S6K cascade inhibitor in Human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Moreover, it was found to be dual mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibitor that inhibit the entire mTOR kinase-dependent functions and feedback commencement of PI3K/Akt pathway. PQQ simultaneously induces apoptosis via mitochondrial dependant pathway, which was confirmed through a battery of the assays, e.g. cellular and nuclear microscopy, annexin-V assay, cell cycle analysis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. In summary, PQQ discovered as a novel second-generation mTOR inhibitor with significant cytotoxic and apoptotic potentials.

The patients can suffer more than one cancer in their lifetime, and radiotherapy is claimed for de novo formation of a new tumor in years after treatment of an initial tumor. METHODS: We have retrospectively analyzed our database for defining radiotherapy-related de novo brain tumors operated in between January, 2000 and August, 2012. New tumors in the field of radiotherapy were included into the study. RESULTS: The retrospective analysis revealed six patients (two girls and four boys) eligible for further evaluation. The children were irradiated at an age in the range of 5 and 12 years (mean, 7.8). The primary diagnoses were hematological malignancies in two (acute lymphocytic leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)) and solid tumors in other four (two pilocytic astrocytoma, one craniopharyngioma, and one grade 3 astrocytoma). All patients received cranial radiotherapy. The mean latency period for the ""second tumor"" was 9.5 years. The pathological diagnoses for de novo new tumors were as follows: glial tumor (two cases), medulloblastoma (two cases), mesenchymal tumor (one case), and meningeal sarcoma (one case). All de novo tumors were high graded. Mean survival was 14.6 months. CONCLUSIONS: de novo brain tumors after irradiation has poor prognosis in neurosurgical practice. Vigilance and awareness for possibility of de novo new tumor are warranted for both families and physicians at follow-ups even years after the treatment of initial tumors.","['Bilginer, Burcak', 'Turk, Cezmi Cagri', 'Narin, Firat', 'Hazer, Burcu', 'Hanalioglu, Sahin', 'Oguz, Kader Karli', 'Soylemezoglu, Figen', 'Akalan, Nejat']","['Bilginer B', 'Turk CC', 'Narin F', 'Hazer B', 'Hanalioglu S', 'Oguz KK', 'Soylemezoglu F', 'Akalan N']","['Department of Neurosurgery, Hacettepe University School of Medicine, Sihhiye, Ankara, Turkey, burcak@tr.net.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Childs Nerv Syst,Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery,8503227,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cranial Irradiation/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/03 06:00,2016/02/18 06:00,['2015/04/03 06:00'],"['2015/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00381-015-2689-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Childs Nerv Syst. 2015 Jun;31(6):893-9. doi: 10.1007/s00381-015-2689-3.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) on gibbon serum samples revealed the presence of antibodies against GALV antigens in 28% of animals, indicating previous exposure or possibly protective immunity to GALV. Virus detection in gibbon blood or serum using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or co-culture of gibbon peripheral blood mononuclear cells with human cells was negative for all samples submitted. The majority (19/27, 70%) of animals with reported health conditions were clinically healthy at the time of sample collection. Historically accrued clinical data were used to assess association of diseases in gibbons antibody positive for GALV. The results suggest captive gibbons could mount an immune response to GALV and show no evidence of infection. There was no association with neoplastic conditions in seropositive animals.

Here we designed a novel fluorescent peptide named AU4S for noninvasive detection of ATG4 activity in living cells, which consists of the cell-penetrating peptide (CPP), ATG4-recognized sequence ""GTFG,"" and the fluorophore FITC. Additionally, an ATG4-resistant peptide AG4R was used as a control. CPP can help AU4S or AG4R to penetrate cell membrane efficiently. AU4S but not AG4R can be recognized and cleaved by ATG4, leading to the change of fluorescence intensity. Therefore, the difference between AU4S- and AG4R-measured fluorescence values in the same sample, defined as ""F-D value,"" can reflect ATG4 activity. By detecting the F-D values, we found that ATG4 activity paralleled LC3B-II levels in rapamycin-treated cells, but neither paralleled LC3B-II levels in starved cells nor presented a correlation with LC3B-II accumulation in WBCs from healthy donors or leukemia patients. However, when DTT was added to the system, ATG4 activity not only paralleled LC3B-II levels in starved cells in the presence or absence of autophagy inhibitors, but also presented a positive correlation with LC3B-II accumulation in WBCs from leukemia patients (R(2) = 0.5288). In conclusion, this study provides a convenient, rapid, and quantitative method to monitor ATG4 activity in living cells, which may be beneficial to basic and clinical research on autophagy.","['Ni, Zhenhong', 'Gong, Yi', 'Dai, Xufang', 'Ding, Wen', 'Wang, Bin', 'Gong, Haiyan', 'Qin, Liyan', 'Cheng, Panke', 'Li, Song', 'Lian, Jiqin', 'He, Fengtian']","['Ni Z', 'Gong Y', 'Dai X', 'Ding W', 'Wang B', 'Gong H', 'Qin L', 'Cheng P', 'Li S', 'Lian J', 'He F']","['a Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology; College of Basic Medical Sciences ; Third Military Medical University ; Chongqing , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,"['0 (Autophagy-Related Proteins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Peptides)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (ATG4A protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence/physiology', 'Animals', 'Autophagy/*physiology', 'Autophagy-Related Proteins', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Fluorescence', 'Hepatocytes/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Microfilament Proteins/metabolism', 'Peptides/*metabolism', 'Rats']",2015/04/02 06:00,2016/01/27 06:00,['2015/04/02 06:00'],"['2015/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15548627.2015.1009773 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2015;11(2):403-15. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2015.1009773.,,PMC4502827,['NOTNLM'],"['3-MA, 3-methyladenine', 'AG4R, ATG4-resistant peptide', 'ATG4', 'ATG4, autophagy-related 4, cysteine peptidase', 'AU4S', 'AU4S, autophagy-related 4 substrate', 'Ac, acetyl', 'CFP, cyan fluorescent protein', 'CPP, cell-penetrating peptide', 'CQ, chloroquine', 'DTT, dithiothreitol', ""EBSS, Earle's balanced salt solution"", 'FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate', 'HIV, human immunodeficiency virus', 'LC3', 'MAP1LC3/LC3, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3', 'NAC, N-acetyl-L-cysteine', 'NRK, normal rat kidney cell line', 'PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis', 'PBS, phosphate-buffered saline', 'PE, phosphatidylethanolamine', 'PLA2, phospholipase A2', 'PMSF, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride', 'PtdIns3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase', 'ROS', 'ROS, reactive oxygen species', 'SDS, sodium dodecyl sulfate', 'WBCs, white blood cells', 'YFP, yellow fluorescent protein', 'autophagy']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although HTLV screening of blood donors was already routinely performed in developed countries, little is know about the HTLV prevalence among blood donors in developing countries which do not perform HTLV screening, such as China. OBJECTIVES &AIMS: To systematically characterize the prevalence of HTLV infection among bloods in southeast China. METHODS: A 10-year survey for HTLV prevalence in blood donors was performed in Xiamen, southeast China, during 2004-2013. The HTLV-1/2 of blood donations were screened by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, following with confirmation by western blot assay and 9nucleic acid testing. The HTLV-1 prevalences in donors from different cities were calculated. Viral sequences derived from identified HTLV-positive cases were sequenced and analyzed. RESULTS: Among 253,855 blood donors, 43 were confirmed to be seropositive for HTLV-1 (16.9 per 100,000 95% CI: 12.3-22.8) and none HTLV-2 infection was found. The HTLV-1 prevalence varied significantly in donors from different cities. Donors from cities in Fujian province (24.3 per 100,000, 95%CI: 17.4-33.1) had a significantly higher (p=0.001) HTLV-1 seroprevalence than those who were born in non-Fujian cities (3.4 per 100,000, 95%CI: 0.7-9.8). Among nine cities in Fujian province, the highest prevalence was found in blood donors from Ningde (171.3 per 100,000, 95%CI: 91.3-292.8) which is a coastal city in the northeast of Fujian. Molecular characterization of viral sequences from 27 HTLV-1 carriers revealed 25 were Transcontinental subtype of genotype A and 2 were Japanese subtype of genotype A. Interestingly, 12 of 25 Transcontinental subtype sequences harbored a characteristic L55P mutation in viral gp46 protein, which was only presented in the Transcontinental subtype sequences from Japan and Taiwan but not in that from other countries. CONCLUSIONS: Although China is considered to be a non-endemic region for HTLV, the HTLV-1 prevalence in blood donors is significantly higher in Fujian province, southeast China. A higher prevalence of HTLV-1 in the Fujian may be attributed to endemic foci in the city of Ningde.","['Xie, Jinzhen', 'Ge, Shengxiang', 'Zhang, Yali', 'Lin, Yongcai', 'Ni, Hongying', 'Zhang, Jun', 'Chen, Changrong']","['Xie J', 'Ge S', 'Zhang Y', 'Lin Y', 'Ni H', 'Zhang J', 'Chen C']","['Xiamen Blood Services, Xiamen, P.R.

A CAR strategy can target any tumor surface antigens as long as an antigen-binding receptor can be generated. New CARs that target solid tumors and have the potential to target multiple tumor types are needed. In this study, B7H6, a ligand for the NK cell activating receptor NKp30, was targeted to create a CAR that targets multiple tumor types. B7H6 is expressed on various primary human tumors, including leukemia, lymphoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but it is not constitutively expressed on normal tissues. B7H6-specific CAR T cells have robust cellular cytotoxicity and interferon-gamma secretion when co-cultured with B7H6+ tumor cells, and they exhibit little self-reactivity to immature dendritic cells or pro-inflammatory monocytes. In vivo, B7H6-specific CAR T cells greatly enhanced the survival of RMA/B7H6 lymphoma-bearing mice. The long-term survivor mice were protected against a B7H6-deficient tumor re-challenge. This CAR therapy also decreased tumor burden in a murine ovarian cancer model.

Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is the only potentially curative treatment for MDS, although 3 drugs have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for its treatment: lenalidomide, 5-azacitidine, and decitabine. These therapies can be effective in the relief of cytopenias, achievement of cytogenetic remissions, and reduction in bone marrow blasts. 5-azacitidine has also been shown to improve overall survival. However, there remain many unmet needs in the treatment of MDS. Breakthroughs in our understanding of the complex pathogenesis of MDS through epigenetic, genetic, immunologic, and other biological mechanisms have allowed us to develop new therapeutic strategies that can lead to improvements in outcomes in MDS. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of the evolution in classifcation and risk stratifcation in MDS and to illustrate how we can use this to guide us in tailoring therapeutic choices in this disease. Responses and outcomes related to com monly used MDS therapies will be discussed together with novel therapies that have evolved with the improved understanding of MDS pathophysiology.","['Estephan, Fayez', 'Tiu, Ramon V']","['Estephan F', 'Tiu RV']","['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research.

We evaluated the effect of DFX treatment on two murine lymphoid leukemia cell lines, and clarified the mechanisms underlying its potential anti-leukemic activity. METHODS: L1210 and A20 murine lymphoid leukemia cell lines were treated with DFX. Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthaizol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethylphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetra zolium (MTS) assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, respectively. Immunoblotting was performed to detect the expression of key apoptotic proteins. RESULTS: In dose- and time-dependent manner, DFX decreased viability and increased apoptosis of murine leukemic cells. Fas expression was significantly higher in A20 cells than in L1210 cells at all DFX concentrations tested. Although both cell lines exhibited high caspase 3 and caspase 9 expression, a critical component of the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, expression was greater in L1210 cells. In contrast, caspase 8, a key factor in the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, showed greater expression in A20 cells. Cytochrome c expression was significantly higher in L1210 cells. In both cell lines, co-treatment with ferric chloride and DFX diminished the expression of these intracellular proteins, as compared to DFX treatment alone. CONCLUSION: Treatment with DFX increased caspase-dependent apoptosis in two murine lymphoid leukemia cell lines, with differing apoptotic mechanisms in each cell line.","['Jeon, Sol-Rim', 'Lee, Jae-Wook', 'Jang, Pil-Sang', 'Chung, Nack-Gyun', 'Cho, Bin', 'Jeong, Dae-Chul']","['Jeon SR', 'Lee JW', 'Jang PS', 'Chung NG', 'Cho B', 'Jeong DC']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Catholic Blood and Marrow Transplantation Center, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,2015/04/02 06:00,2015/04/02 06:01,['2015/04/02 06:00'],"['2014/11/10 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/17 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2015.50.1.33 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2015 Mar;50(1):33-9. doi: 10.5045/br.2015.50.1.33.

This study evaluated promoter DNA methylation and aberrant expression levels of early- and late-acting hematopoietic TF genes homeobox A4 and A5 (HOXA4 and HOXA5), Meis homeobox 1 (MEIS1), T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia 1 (TAL1), and interferon regulatory factors 4 and 8 (IRF4 and IRF8) in pediatric B-cell ALL. METHODS: Blood samples of 38 ALL patients and 20 controls were obtained. DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite and DNA methylation level of HOXA4, HOXA5, MEIS1, TAL1, IRF4, and IRF8 was assessed using quantitative methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Relative gene expression was measured using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. RESULTS: Aberrant methylation of TAL1, IRF8, MEIS1, and IRF4 was observed in 26.3%, 7.9%, 5.3%, and 2.6% patients, respectively, but not in controls. HOXA4 and HOXA5 were methylated in some controls and hypermethylated in 16% and 5% patients, respectively. IRF8, MEIS1, and TAL1 expression was lower in patients than in controls. MEIS1 expression was inversely correlated with white blood cell (WBC) count. HOXA4 expression was down-regulated in patients with high risk according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) classification. TAL1 methylation was slightly elevated in patients aged >9 years and in patients showing relapse, suggesting its potential prognostic value. CONCLUSION: Aberrant methylation and expression of the selected hematopoietic genes were correlated with demographic/clinical prognostic factors of pediatric ALL, such as age, WBC count, and NCI risk classification.","['Musialik, Ewa', 'Bujko, Mateusz', 'Kober, Paulina', 'Wypych, Agnieszka', 'Gawle-Krawczyk, Karolina', 'Matysiak, Michal', 'Siedlecki, Janusz Aleksander']","['Musialik E', 'Bujko M', 'Kober P', 'Wypych A', 'Gawle-Krawczyk K', 'Matysiak M', 'Siedlecki JA']","['Department of Molecular and Translational Oncology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Oncology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Oncology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Haematology & Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Haematology & Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Pediatric Haematology & Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Oncology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Memorial Cancer Center and Institute of Oncology, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,2015/04/02 06:00,2015/04/02 06:01,['2015/04/02 06:00'],"['2014/06/13 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/28 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/02 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2015.50.1.26 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2015 Mar;50(1):26-32. doi: 10.5045/br.2015.50.1.26.

A number of Plk1 inhibitors have been developed, some of which have entered clinical trials. Of these, volasertib (BI6727) has been most extensively studied clinically in AML. Volasertib has demonstrated antileukemic activity in AML, both as a single agent and when combined with low-dose cytarabine. It is well tolerated, with the major toxicity being reversible myelosuppression.

ALL patients also had poor attention, concentration, and executive functions. Among ALL survivors, cranial irradiation was a risk factor for poor FSIQ, being male was a risk factor for poor PIQ, and younger age was a risk factor for poor attention.

Though ibrutinib results in impressive clinical activity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), most patients achieve only partial remission due to residual disease. We performed a pharmacologic profiling of residual circulating CLL cells from patients receiving ibrutinib to identify optimal agents that could induce cell death of these lymphocytes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Ex vivo serial samples of CLL cells from patients on ibrutinib were obtained prior and after (weeks 2, 4, and 12) the start of treatment. These cells were incubated with PI3K inhibitors (idelalisib or IPI-145), bendamustine, additional ibrutinib, or BCL-2 antagonists (ABT-737 or ABT-199), and cell death was measured. In vitro investigations complemented ex vivo studies. Immunoblots for BTK signaling pathway and antiapoptotic proteins were performed. RESULTS: The BCL-2 antagonists, especially ABT-199, induced high cell death during ex vivo incubations. In concert with the ex vivo data, in vitro combinations also resulted in high cytotoxicity. Serial samples of CLL cells obtained before and 2, 4, 12, or 36 weeks after the start of ibrutinib showed inhibition of BTK activity and sensitivity to ABTs. Among the three BCL-2 family antiapoptotic proteins that are overexpressed in CLL, levels of MCL-1 and BCL-XL were decreased after ibrutinib while ABT-199 selectively antagonizes BCL-2. CONCLUSIONS: Our biologic and molecular results suggest that ibrutinib and ABT-199 combination should be tested clinically against CLL.","['Cervantes-Gomez, Fabiola', 'Lamothe, Betty', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Wierda, William G', 'Keating, Michael J', 'Balakrishnan, Kumudha', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Cervantes-Gomez F', 'Lamothe B', 'Woyach JA', 'Wierda WG', 'Keating MJ', 'Balakrishnan K', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.

The aim of this work was to find preliminary evidence to know if the high level of infection of the dam would implicate a higher challenge to her own offspring. We collected 65 sets of samples consisting of dam's blood and colostrum from two heavily infected dairy farms, and investigated the correlation between the dam's blood proviral load and the presence of provirus in colostrum. We also described the dual antibody/provirus profile in the colostrum. Provirus was detected in 69.23% of the colostrum samples, mostly from dams with a high proviral load, 36/45 (80%). Colostrum proviral load was significantly higher in dams with high blood proviral load (p<0.0001). Provirus was detected in colostrum samples all along the antibody distribution, even in those with a low amount of antibodies. These results show that even when high blood proviral load dams offer higher levels of infected cells to their offspring through colostrum they also offer higher levels of protection of antibodies. On the contrary, low blood proviral load dams also offer infected cells but a poor content of antibodies, suggesting that these animals could play an important role in the epidemiological cycle of transmission.","['Gutierrez, Geronimo', 'Lomonaco, Marina', 'Alvarez, Irene', 'Fernandez, Fernando', 'Trono, Karina']","['Gutierrez G', 'Lomonaco M', 'Alvarez I', 'Fernandez F', 'Trono K']","['Laboratorio de Virus Adventicios, Instituto de Virologia, Centro de Investigaciones en Ciencias Veterinarias y Agronomicas, INTA, Nicolas Repetto y De los Reseros s/n, 1686 Hurlingham, Buenos Aires, Argentina.

In this study, we continued our efforts to identify genes involved in erythroid proliferation. Lentivirally transduced UT-7/Epo erythroleukemic cells expressing ribosomal protein L11 (RPL11) or retinol dehydrogenase 11 (RDH11) could proliferate in the absence of erythropoietin, and their cell-cycle profiles revealed G0/G1 prolongation and low percentages of apoptosis. RPL11-expressing cells proliferated more rapidly than the RDH11-expressing cells. The antiapoptotic proteins BCL-XL and BCL-2 were expressed in both cell lines. Unlike the parental UT-7/Epo cells, the expression of hemoglobins (Hbs) in the transduced cells had switched from adult to fetal type. Several signal transduction pathways, including STAT5, were highly activated in transduced cells; furthermore, expression of the downstream target genes of STAT5, such as CCND1, was upregulated in the transduced cells. Taken together, the data indicate that RPL11 and RDH11 accelerate erythroid cell proliferation by upregulating the STAT5 signaling pathway with phosphorylation of Lyn and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB).","['Kummalue, Tanawan', 'Inoue, Tomoko', 'Miura, Yoshie', 'Narusawa, Megumi', 'Inoue, Hiroyuki', 'Komatsu, Norio', 'Wanachiwanawin, Wanchai', 'Sugiyama, Daisuke', 'Tani, Kenzaburo']","['Kummalue T', 'Inoue T', 'Miura Y', 'Narusawa M', 'Inoue H', 'Komatsu N', 'Wanachiwanawin W', 'Sugiyama D', 'Tani K']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Division of Molecular and Clinical Genetics, Department of Molecular Genetics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Research and Development of Next Generation Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular and Clinical Genetics, Department of Molecular Genetics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular and Clinical Genetics, Department of Molecular Genetics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular and Clinical Genetics, Department of Molecular Genetics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Advanced Molecular and Cell Therapy, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.', 'Department of Research and Development of Next Generation Medicine, Faculty of Medical Sciences, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular and Clinical Genetics, Department of Molecular Genetics, Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan; Department of Advanced Molecular and Cell Therapy, Kyushu University Hospital, Fukuoka, Japan.

Despite the extensive experience with bendamustine, its pharmacokinetic profile has only recently been described. This overview summarizes the pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationships, and drug-drug interactions of bendamustine in adult and pediatric patients with hematologic malignancies. METHODS: A literature search and data on file (including a human mass balance study, pharmacokinetic population analyses in adult and pediatric patients, and modeling analyses) were evaluated for inclusion. RESULTS: Bendamustine concentrations peak at end of intravenous infusion (~1 h). Subsequent elimination is triphasic, with the intermediate t 1/2 (~40 min) as the effective t 1/2 since the final phase represents <1 % of the area under the curve. Bendamustine is rapidly hydrolyzed to monohydroxy-bendamustine and dihydroxy-bendamustine, which have little or no activity. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 oxidation yields the active metabolites gamma-hydroxybendamustine and N-desmethyl-bendamustine, at low concentrations, which contribute minimally to cytotoxicity. Minor involvement of CYP1A2 in bendamustine elimination suggests a low likelihood of drug-drug interactions with CYP1A2 inhibitors. Systemic exposure to bendamustine 120 mg/m(2) is comparable between adult and pediatric patients; age, race, and sex have been shown to have no significant effect on systemic exposure in either population. The effect of hepatic/renal impairment on bendamustine pharmacokinetics remains to be elucidated. Higher bendamustine concentrations may be associated with increased probability of nausea or infection. No clear exposure-efficacy response relationship has been observed. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the findings support dosing based on body surface area for most patient populations.","['Darwish, Mona', 'Bond, Mary', 'Hellriegel, Edward', 'Robertson, Philmore Jr', 'Chovan, James P']","['Darwish M', 'Bond M', 'Hellriegel E', 'Robertson P Jr', 'Chovan JP']","['Sci-Med Bridge, LLC, 1916 General Alexander Drive, Malvern, PA, 19355, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '0 (gamma-hydroxybendamustine)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (CYP1A2 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.1 (Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2)']",IM,"['Area Under Curve', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions/physiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use']",2015/04/02 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2015/04/02 06:00'],"['2014/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-015-2727-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2015 Jun;75(6):1143-54. doi: 10.1007/s00280-015-2727-6.

The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway is a major pathway for DSB repair and is highly aberrant in TK-activated leukemias; an alternative form of NHEJ (ALT-NHEJ) predominates, evidenced by increased expression of DNA ligase IIIalpha (LIG3) and PARP1, increased frequency of large genomic deletions, and repair using DNA sequence microhomologies. This study, for the first time, demonstrates that the TK target c-MYC plays a role in transcriptional activation and subsequent expression of LIG3 and PARP1 and contributes to the increased error-prone repair observed in TK-activated leukemias. c-MYC negatively regulates microRNAs miR-150 and miR-22, which demonstrate an inverse correlation with LIG3 and PARP1 expression in primary and cultured leukemia cells and chronic myelogenous leukemia human patient samples. Notably, inhibition of c-MYC and overexpression of miR-150 and -22 decreases ALT-NHEJ activity. Thus, BCR-ABL1 or FLT3/ITD induces c-MYC expression, leading to genomic instability via augmented expression of ALT-NHEJ repair factors that generate repair errors. IMPLICATIONS: In the context of TK-activated leukemias, c-MYC contributes to aberrant DNA repair through downstream targets LIG3 and PARP1, which represent viable and attractive therapeutic targets.","['Muvarak, Nidal', 'Kelley, Shannon', 'Robert, Carine', 'Baer, Maria R', 'Perrotti, Danilo', 'Gambacorti-Passerini, Carlo', 'Civin, Curt', 'Scheibner, Kara', 'Rassool, Feyruz V']","['Muvarak N', 'Kelley S', 'Robert C', 'Baer MR', 'Perrotti D', 'Gambacorti-Passerini C', 'Civin C', 'Scheibner K', 'Rassool FV']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland.

However, the outcomes for patients who discontinue therapy after achieving partial response (PR) or complete remission (CR) but before treatment failure have not been reported. We present a series of 16 patients with higher-risk MDS (n=5; 31%) or AML (n=11; 69%) who achieved PR (n=1) or CR (n=15) and stopped HMA therapy while in response in the context of clinical trials. They received a median of 12 courses (range 1-24) and achieved response after a median of 1 course of therapy (1-4). Loss of response after discontinuation of therapy was rapid, with a median progression-free survival of 4 months (95% CI: 2-6). Median overall survival (OS) from the time of therapy discontinuation was 15 months (95% CI: 6-24). Patients who received 12 cycles of therapy or more had significantly better OS (median: 20 months [95% CI: 12-27]) than those who received fewer than 12 cycles (median: 4 months [95% CI: 1-8]) (p=0.043). Poor-risk cytogenetics were also associated with lower 1-year OS (33% versus 69%; p=0.046). According to these results and considering the poor prognosis after HMA failure, HMA interruption should be avoided once a sustained response has been achieved.","['Cabrero, Monica', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Bohannan, Zach', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo']","['Cabrero M', 'Jabbour E', 'Ravandi F', 'Bohannan Z', 'Pierce S', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Garcia-Manero G']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.

Advances in HCT, including the development of intravenous busulfan and plasma assays permitting dose adjustment, have improved results of HCT in CML. Improved supportive care has lowered the incidence of non-relapse mortality and improved survival. The availability of reduced-intensity preparative regimens, molecular typing of unrelated donors, and the use of cord blood and haploidentical donors has expanded the application of HCT to nearly any patient with an appropriate indication.

Current in vitro models of intestinal fibrosis cannot model the complex intestinal architecture, while in vivo rodent models do not fully recapitulate human disease and have limited utility for large-scale screening. Here, we exploit recent advances in stem cell derived human intestinal organoids (HIOs) as a new human model of fibrosis in CD. METHODS: Human pluripotent stem cells were differentiated into HIOs. We identified myofibroblasts, the key effector cells of fibrosis, by immunofluorescence staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA), vimentin, and desmin. We examined the fibrogenic response of HIOs by treatment with transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) in the presence or absence of the anti-fibrotic drug spironolactone. Fibrotic response was assayed by expression of fibrogenic genes (COL1A1 (collagen, type I, alpha 1), ACTA2 (alpha smooth muscle actin), FN1 (fibronectin 1), MYLK (myosin light chain kinase), and MKL1 (megakaryoblastic leukemia (translocation) 1)) and proteins (alphaSMA). RESULTS: Immunofluorescent staining of organoids identified a population of myofibroblasts within the HIO mesenchyme. TGFbeta stimulation of HIOs produced a dose-dependent pro-fibrotic response. Spironolactone treatment blocked the fibrogenic response of HIOs to TGFbeta. CONCLUSIONS: HIOs contain myofibroblasts and respond to a pro-fibrotic stimulus in a manner that is consistent with isolated human myofibroblasts. HIOs are a promising model system that might bridge the gap between current in vitro and in vivo models of intestinal fibrosis in IBD.","['Rodansky, Eva S', 'Johnson, Laura A', 'Huang, Sha', 'Spence, Jason R', 'Higgins, Peter D R']","['Rodansky ES', 'Johnson LA', 'Huang S', 'Spence JR', 'Higgins PD']","['Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA; Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA.

However scant literature describes developmental changes in vertebral morphology that can mimic fractures. The goal of this paper is to aid in distinguishing between normal variants and fractures. We illustrate differences using lateral spine radiographs obtained annually from children recruited to the Canada-wide STeroid-Associated Osteoporosis in the Pediatric Population (STOPP) observational study, in which 400 children with glucocorticoid-treated leukemia, rheumatic disorders, and nephrotic syndrome were enrolled near glucocorticoid initiation and followed prospectively for 6 years. Normal variants mimicking fractures exist in all regions of the spine and fall into two groups. The first group comprises variants mimicking pathological vertebral height loss, including not-yet-ossified vertebral apophyses superiorly and inferiorly, which can lead to a vertebral shape easily over-interpreted as anterior wedge fracture, physiological beaking, or spondylolisthesis associated with shortened posterior vertebral height. The second group includes variants mimicking other radiologic signs of fractures: anterior vertebral artery groove resembling an anterior buckle fracture, Cupid's bow balloon disk morphology, Schmorl nodes mimicking concave endplate fractures, and parallax artifact resembling endplate interruption or biconcavity. If an unexpected vertebral body contour is detected, careful attention to its location, detailed morphology, and (if available) serial changes over time may clarify whether it is a fracture requiring change in management or simply a normal variant. Awareness of the variants described in this paper can improve accuracy in the diagnosis of pediatric vertebral fractures.","['Jaremko, Jacob L', 'Siminoski, Kerry', 'Firth, Gregory B', 'Matzinger, Mary Ann', 'Shenouda, Nazih', 'Konji, Victor N', 'Roth, Johannes', 'Sbrocchi, Anne Marie', 'Reed, Martin H', ""O'Brien, Mary Kathleen"", 'Nadel, Helen', 'McKillop, Scott', 'Kloiber, Reinhard', 'Dubois, Josee', 'Coblentz, Craig', 'Charron, Martin', 'Ward, Leanne M']","['Jaremko JL', 'Siminoski K', 'Firth GB', 'Matzinger MA', 'Shenouda N', 'Konji VN', 'Roth J', 'Sbrocchi AM', 'Reed MH', ""O'Brien MK"", 'Nadel H', 'McKillop S', 'Kloiber R', 'Dubois J', 'Coblentz C', 'Charron M', 'Ward LM']","['Department of Radiology and Diagnostic Imaging, 2A2.41 WC Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre, University of Alberta, 8440-112 St., Edmonton, T6G 2B7, Canada, jjaremko@ualberta.ca.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pediatr Radiol,Pediatric radiology,0365332,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Female', 'Glucocorticoids/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Osteoporotic Fractures/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Reference Values', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Spinal Fractures/*epidemiology/*pathology', 'Spine/*growth & development']",2015/04/02 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/04/02 06:00'],"['2014/07/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2014/09/03 00:00 [revised]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00247-014-3210-y [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Radiol. 2015 Apr;45(4):593-605. doi: 10.1007/s00247-014-3210-y.

The survey covered areas not traditionally examined by EQA such as: staffing numbers, flow cytometer age and service intervals, plus six test specific sections covering: leukaemia immunophenotyping, CD4(+) T-lymphocyte subsets analysis (reported here), CD34(+) stem cell testing, low level leucocyte enumeration, minimal residual disease testing and PNH testing.

Significant differences existed in basic laboratory practices such as: normal range derivation; pipetting techniques; instrument maintenance and units of reporting, all of which results in non-adherence to international guidelines. DISCUSSION: Despite the availability of international guidelines our survey highlighted a lack of concordance amongst laboratory techniques. Such variation could adversely impact on patient care and clinical trial data. Therefore, it is recommended centres undertaking flow cytometric CD4(+) T-lymphocyte subsets analysis urgently review their methodologies and normal ranges to ensure they are fit for purpose and meet current international guidelines.","['Whitby, L', 'Whitby, A', 'Fletcher, M', 'Barnett, D']","['Whitby L', 'Whitby A', 'Fletcher M', 'Barnett D']","['UK NEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping (UK NEQAS LI), Department of Haematology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'UK NEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping (UK NEQAS LI), Department of Haematology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'UK NEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping (UK NEQAS LI), Department of Haematology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom.', 'UK NEQAS for Leucocyte Immunophenotyping (UK NEQAS LI), Department of Haematology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry B Clin Cytom,"Cytometry.

All organisms devote specialized pathways to ensure proper delivery. Yet, a quantitative assessment of the intra-cellular iron concentration needed to allow the cell cycle to proceed in mammalian cells is missing. Starting from iron-depleted cell lines or primary hematopoietic progenitors prepared with clinically implemented iron chelators, replenishment via transferrin and other iron sources has been quantitatively monitored through the main endogenous markers of the cellular iron status, namely proteins involved in the uptake (transferrin receptor), the storage (ferritin), and the sensing (Iron Regulatory Proteins) of iron. When correlated with measurements of iron concentrations and indicators of growth, this minimally intrusive approach provided an unprecedented estimate of the intracellular iron concentration acting upon iron-centered regulatory pathways. The data were analyzed with the help of a previously developed theoretical treatment of cellular iron regulation. The minimal cellular iron concentration required for cell division was named functional iron concentration (FIC) to distinguish it from previous estimates of the cellular labile iron. The FIC falls in the low nanomolar range for all studied cells, including hematopoietic progenitors. These data shed new light on basic aspects of cellular iron homeostasis by demonstrating that sensing and regulation of iron occur well below the concentrations requiring storage or becoming noxious in pathological conditions. The quantitative assessment provided here is relevant for monitoring treatments of conditions in which iron provision must be controlled to avoid unwanted cellular proliferation.","['Pourcelot, Emmanuel', 'Lenon, Marine', 'Mobilia, Nicolas', 'Cahn, Jean-Yves', 'Arnaud, Josiane', 'Fanchon, Eric', 'Moulis, Jean-Marc', 'Mossuz, Pascal']","['Pourcelot E', 'Lenon M', 'Mobilia N', 'Cahn JY', 'Arnaud J', 'Fanchon E', 'Moulis JM', 'Mossuz P']","[""Universite Grenoble Alpes, Laboratory of Fundamental and Applied Bioenergetics, and Environmental and Systems Biology, Grenoble, France; Inserm, U1055, Grenoble, France; CHU Grenoble, Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Institut de Biologie et Pathologie, Grenoble, France; Universite Grenoble Alpes, TIMC-Imag CNRS 5525 Grenoble, France.

The binding constants for the complexes with DNA were obtained using UV-Vis spectroscopic titrations (K = 1.6 x 10(4)-4.0 x 10(5) M(-1)) and electrophoretic methods were used to determine the effect of the derivatives on topoisomerase I and II activity. Monotacrine derivative 1 showed evidence of topoisomerase Irelaxation activity at a concentration of 30 x 10(-6) M, while bistacrine derivatives 2-4 produced a complete inhibition of topoisomerase Iat a concentration of 5 x 10(-6) M. The biological activities of the derivatives were studied using MTT-assay and flow cytometric methods (detection of mitochondrial membrane potential and measurement of cell viability) following incubation of 24 and 48 h with human leukemic cancer cell line HL60. The ability of the derivatives to impair cell proliferation was also tested through the analysis of cell cycle distribution.","['Janockova, Jana', 'Plsikova, Jana', ""Koval', Jan"", 'Jendzelovsky, Rastislav', 'Mikes, Jaromir', 'Kasparkova, Jana', 'Brabec, Viktor', 'Hamulakova, Slavka', 'Fedorocko, Peter', 'Kozurkova, Maria']","['Janockova J', 'Plsikova J', ""Koval' J"", 'Jendzelovsky R', 'Mikes J', 'Kasparkova J', 'Brabec V', 'Hamulakova S', 'Fedorocko P', 'Kozurkova M']","['Department of Biochemistry, P.

Bcl11b is a SWI/SNF subunit and acts as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor in leukemia/lymphomas. Here, we show expression of Bcl11b in intestinal crypt cells and promotion of intestinal tumorigenesis by Bcl11b attenuation in Apc (min/+) mice. Of importance, mutations or allelic loss of BCL11B was detected in one-third of human colon cancers. We also show that attenuated Bcl11b activity in the crypt base columnar (CBC) cells expressing the Lgr5 stem cell marker enhanced regeneration of intestinal epithelial cells after the radiation-induced injury. Interestingly, BCL11B introduction in human cell lines downregulated transcription of beta-catenin target genes, whereas Bcl11b attenuation in Lgr5(+) CBCs increased expression of beta-catenin targets including c-Myc and cyclin D1. Together, our results argue that Bcl11b impairment promotes tumor development in mouse and human intestine at least in part through deregulation of beta-catenin pathway.","['Sakamaki, Akira',

Although the highly variable phenotype makes accurate diagnosis on the basis of clinical manifestations difficult in some patients, diagnosis based on a profound sensitivity to DNA-crosslinking agents can be used to identify the pre-anemia patient as well as patients with aplastic anemia or leukemia who may or may not have the physical stigmata associated with the syndrome.

The CRISPR/Cas9 method has been engineered from the type II prokaryotic CRISPR system and uses a single-guide RNA to target the Cas9 nuclease to a specific genomic sequence. Cas9 induces double-stranded DNA breaks which are repaired either by imperfect non-homologous end joining to generate insertions or deletions (indels) or, if a repair template is provided, by homology-directed repair. Due to its specificity, simplicity and versatility, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently emerged as a powerful tool for genome engineering in various species. This technology can be used to investigate the function of a gene of interest or to correct gene mutations in cells via genome editing, paving the way for future gene therapy approaches. Improvements to the efficiency of CRISPR repair, in particular to increase the rate of gene correction and to reduce undesired off-target effects, and the development of more effective delivery methods will be required for its broad therapeutic application.","['Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Dolatshad, Hamid', 'Valletta, Simona', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline']","['Pellagatti A', 'Dolatshad H', 'Valletta S', 'Boultwood J']","['Leukaemia and Lymphoma Research Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford University Hospitals, University of Oxford, Oxford, OX3 9DU, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Arch Toxicol,Archives of toxicology,0417615,['0 (CRISPR-Associated Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', 'CRISPR-Associated Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*CRISPR-Cas Systems', '*Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'Genetic Engineering/*methods', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Humans', '*RNA Editing']",2015/04/02 06:00,2016/03/16 06:00,['2015/04/02 06:00'],"['2015/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/16 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00204-015-1504-y [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Toxicol. 2015 Jul;89(7):1023-34. doi: 10.1007/s00204-015-1504-y.

At this moment, five different tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib and ponatinib) are approved for the treatment of CML. Medical and patients needs nowadays are attention to quality of life (QoL) and drug side effects; overcoming suboptimal responses; preventing progression and possibly discontinuing the drugs. Monitoring is essential to improve on treatment and on the possibility of cure, because it allows patient adapted therapies, according to patients morbidities and early responses. AREAS COVERED: This review focuses on clinical results of imatinib and second- and third-generation TKIs that have been tested in the setting of second-line and front-line treatments. The most promising new drugs in course of clinical investigations are also reported. EXPERT OPINION: The scientific community is focusing on the optimization of the use of the drugs already available, to be also used in association with other experimental drugs directed to several signaling transduction pathways of BCR-ABL, in order to improve the efficacy on resistant cases, and on leukemic stem cells, keeping in mind the issues of long-term safety, QoL and the need for treatment - free remission.","['Fava, Carmen', 'Morotti, Alessandro', 'Dogliotti, Irene', 'Saglio, Giuseppe', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna']","['Fava C', 'Morotti A', 'Dogliotti I', 'Saglio G', 'Rege-Cambrin G']","['University of Turin, San Luigi Hospital, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences , Orbassano 10043 , Italy c.fava@tin.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs,Expert opinion on emerging drugs,101135662,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Approval', 'Drug Design', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/adverse effects/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/epidemiology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Quality of Life', 'Survival']",2015/04/01 06:00,2016/01/09 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1517/14728214.2015.1031217 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Emerg Drugs. 2015 Jun;20(2):183-96. doi: 10.1517/14728214.2015.1031217.

TAT-RasGAP317-326 is a RasGAP-derived cell-permeable peptide that acts as a sensitizer to various anti-cancer treatments in adult tumor cells. In the present study, we assessed the effect of TAT-RasGAP317-326 in several childhood cancer cell lines. The RasGAP-derived peptide-induced cell death was analyzed in several neuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma and leukemia cell lines (as well as in normal lymphocytes). Cell death was evaluated using flow cytometry methods in the absence or in the presence of the peptide in combination with various genotoxins used in the clinics (4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide, etoposide, vincristine and doxorubicin). All tested pediatric tumors, in response to at least one genotoxin, were sensitized by TAT-RasGAP317-326. The RasGAP-derived peptide did not increase cell death of normal lymphocytes, alone or in combination with the majority of the tested chemotherapies.

They are tetrameric enzymes able to catalyze the deamination of L-ASN and, to a variable extent, of L-GLN, on which leukemia cells are dependent for survival. In contrast to other known L-asparaginases, Helicobacter pylori CCUG 17874 type II enzyme (HpASNase) is cooperative and has a low affinity towards L-GLN. In this study, some critical amino acids forming the active site of HpASNase (T16, T95 and E289) have been tackled by rational engineering in the attempt to better define their role in catalysis and to achieve a deeper understanding of the peculiar cooperative behavior of this enzyme. Mutations T16E, T95D and T95H led to a complete loss of enzymatic activity. Mutation E289A dramatically reduced the catalytic activity of the enzyme, but increased its thermostability. Interestingly, E289 belongs to a loop that is very variable in L-asparaginases from the structure, sequence and length point of view, and which could be a main determinant of their different catalytic features.","['Maggi, Maristella', 'Chiarelli, Laurent R', 'Valentini, Giovanna', 'Scotti, Claudia']","['Maggi M', 'Chiarelli LR', 'Valentini G', 'Scotti C']","['Unit of Immunology and General Pathology, Department of Molecular Medicine, University of Pavia, Via Ferrata 9, Pavia 27100, Italy. giovanna.valentini@unipv.it.', 'Laboratory of Protein Biochemistry, Department of Biology and Biotechnologies ""L.

Here, we show that the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 or the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 induced apoptosis through the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic pathway more efficiently in hematopoietic 32D cells driven by FLT3-TKD (32D/TKD) than FLT3-ITD (32D/ITD), which robustly activated STAT5. The resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 was gained by expression of the constitutively activated STAT5 mutant STAT5A1*6 in 32D/TKD cells, while it was abrogated by the STAT5 inhibitor pimozide in 32D/ITD cells or FLT3-ITD-expressing human leukemic MV4-11 cells. GDC-0941 or MK-2206 induced dephosphorylation of 4EBP1 more conspicuously in 32D/TKD than in 32D/ITD, which was prevented or augmented by STAT5A1*6 or pimozide, respectively, and correlated with downregulation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex formation and Mcl-1 expression. Furthermore, exogenous expression of Mcl-1 endowed resistance to GDC-0941 and MK-2206 on 32D/TKD cells. Finally, it was confirmed in primary AML cells with FLT3-ITD that pimozide enhanced 4EBP1 dephosphorylation and Mcl-1 downregulation to augment cytotoxicity of GDC-0941. These data suggest that the robust STAT5 activation by FLT3-ITD protects cells treated with the PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors from apoptosis by maintaining Mcl-1 expression through the mTORC1/4EBP1/eIF4E pathway.","['Nogami, Ayako', 'Oshikawa, Gaku', 'Okada, Keigo', 'Fukutake, Shusaku', 'Umezawa, Yoshihiro', 'Nagao, Toshikage', 'Kurosu, Tetsuya', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Nogami A', 'Oshikawa G', 'Okada K', 'Fukutake S', 'Umezawa Y', 'Nagao T', 'Kurosu T', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0', '(2-(1H-indazol-4-yl)-6-(4-methanesulfonylpiperazin-1-ylmethyl)-4-morpholin-4-ylth', 'ieno(3,2-d)pyrimidine)', '0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Eif4ebp1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Eif4g1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G)', '0 (Eukaryotic Initiation Factors)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (Indazoles)', '0 (MK 2206)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat5a protein, mouse)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (eIF4E protein, mouse)', '1HIZ4DL86F (Pimozide)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (mTOR protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 9/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4E/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factor-4G/metabolism', 'Eukaryotic Initiation Factors', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Indazoles/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Pimozide/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/antagonists & inhibitors', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",2015/04/01 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2014/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['3279 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3279 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Apr 20;6(11):9189-205. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3279.,,PMC4496211,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3', 'MCL-1', 'PI3K', 'STAT5']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median age at diagnosis is around 70 years. To confirm the diagnosis more than 5000 B-lymphocytes/microl need to be present. The expression of the typical surface markers CD5, CD19, CD20 and CD23 has to be confirmed by flow cytometry. A bone marrow biopsy is not mandatory for the diagnosis. Before start of treatment the assessment of 17 p deletion and/or TP53-mutational status is recommended. Treatment indications include stage Binet C or signs of an active disease as rapidly progressive lymphadenopathy or organomegaly together with physical limitation, B symptoms that cannot be tolerated, rapidly deteriorating blood values, or rapidly increasing leukocyte counts (Lymphocyte doubling time less than 6 months). The patient's physical condition has major impact on the treatment decision. Currently immunochemotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and the CD20-antibody rituximab (FCR) is the standard of care in previously untreated and physically fit patients. An alternative regimen is the combination of bendamustine and rituximab (BR) or ofatumumab. Physically compromised patients can be treated with the oral drug chlorambucil in combination with an anti-CD20 antibody. Due to high morbidity and mortality, allogeneic stem cell transplantation is limited to a small group of patients and should be discussed in a high-risk situation, such as 17 p deletion and/or TP53-mutation, lack of response to standard therapy or early relapse. Recently several new chemo-free treatment options have been introduced within clinical trials. Among them are monoclonal antibodies, most of them targeting the CD20 molecule: besides the licensed drugs rituximab and ofatumumab, obinutuzumab, in combination with chemotherapy, has recently shown high clinical efficacy in front-line treatment of elderly patients with CLL. Novel agents have been designed to block aberrant signaling from the B-cell receptor. Ibrutinib acts by inhibiting the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) while idelalisib represents a first-in-class specific inhibitor of the phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) delta isoform. Another class of drugs with potential impact for chemo-free treatment strategies in CLL is the BH3-mimetic inhibitor of the Bcl-2 family of pro-survival proteins, ABT-199. Given all these novel agents and targets, chemo-free or at least chemo-reduced concepts may become reality in the near future for our patients suffering from CLL.","['Bergmann, Manuela', 'Wendtner, Clemens-Martin']","['Bergmann M', 'Wendtner CM']","['Klinikum Schwabing, Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Palliativmedizin, Infektiologie und Tropenmedizin, Munchen.', 'Klinikum Schwabing, Klinik fur Hamatologie, Onkologie, Immunologie, Palliativmedizin, Infektiologie und Tropenmedizin, Munchen.']",['ger'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/*therapy', 'Piperidines', 'Purines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Rituximab', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",2015/04/01 06:00,2015/06/02 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1055/s-0041-101160 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2015 Apr;140(7):479-82. doi: 10.1055/s-0041-101160.

Although the physiological roles of the NANOG protein have been extensively explored, biochemical and biophysical properties in relation to its structural analysis are poorly understood. Here we determined the crystal structure of the human NANOG homeodomain (hNANOG HD) bound to an OCT4 promoter DNA, which revealed amino acid residues involved in DNA recognition that are likely to be functionally important. We generated a series of hNANOG HD alanine substitution mutants based on the protein-DNA interaction and evolutionary conservation and determined their biological activities. Some mutant proteins were less stable, resulting in loss or decreased affinity for DNA binding. Overexpression of the orthologous mouse NANOG (mNANOG) mutants failed to maintain self-renewal of mouse embryonic stem cells without leukemia inhibitory factor. These results suggest that these residues are critical for NANOG transcriptional activity. Interestingly, one mutant, hNANOG L122A, conversely enhanced protein stability and DNA-binding affinity. The mNANOG L122A, when overexpressed in mouse embryonic stem cells, maintained their expression of self-renewal markers even when retinoic acid was added to forcibly drive differentiation. When overexpressed in epiblast stem cells or human induced pluripotent stem cells, the L122A mutants enhanced reprogramming into ground-state pluripotency. These findings demonstrate that structural and biophysical information on key transcriptional factors provides insights into the manipulation of stem cell behaviors and a framework for rational protein engineering.","['Hayashi, Yohei', 'Caboni, Laura', 'Das, Debanu', 'Yumoto, Fumiaki', 'Clayton, Thomas', 'Deller, Marc C', 'Nguyen, Phuong', 'Farr, Carol L', 'Chiu, Hsiu-Ju', 'Miller, Mitchell D', 'Elsliger, Marc-Andre', 'Deacon, Ashley M', 'Godzik, Adam', 'Lesley, Scott A', 'Tomoda, Kiichiro', 'Conklin, Bruce R', 'Wilson, Ian A', 'Yamanaka, Shinya', 'Fletterick, Robert J']","['Hayashi Y', 'Caboni L', 'Das D', 'Yumoto F', 'Clayton T', 'Deller MC', 'Nguyen P', 'Farr CL', 'Chiu HJ', 'Miller MD', 'Elsliger MA', 'Deacon AM', 'Godzik A', 'Lesley SA', 'Tomoda K', 'Conklin BR', 'Wilson IA', 'Yamanaka S', 'Fletterick RJ']","['Gladstone Institutes of Cardiovascular Disease, San Francisco, CA 94158;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, and.', 'Joint Center for Structural Genomics, Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA 94025;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, and Structural Biology Research Center, KEK High Energy Accelerator Research Organization, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-0801, Japan;', 'Joint Center for Structural Genomics, Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037;', 'Joint Center for Structural Genomics, Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037;', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, and.', 'Joint Center for Structural Genomics, Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037;', 'Joint Center for Structural Genomics, Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA 94025;', 'Joint Center for Structural Genomics, Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA 94025;', 'Joint Center for Structural Genomics, Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037;', 'Joint Center for Structural Genomics, Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, Stanford Linear Accelerator Center National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA 94025;', 'Joint Center for Structural Genomics, Center for Research in Biological Systems, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92037;

All patients, who were older than 14 years of age and developed at least one neutropenic episode after chemotherapy due to hematological cancer from November 2010 to November 2012, were included into the study. We retrospectively collected demographic, treatment, and survival data of 126 patients with neutropenia and their 282 febrile episodes. The mean Multinational Association for Supportive Care in Cancer score was 17.18 +/- 8.27. Systemic antifungal drugs were initiated in 22 patients with 30 culture-proven invasive fungal infections (IFIs), 25 attacks of 19 patients with probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), 42 attacks of 38 patients with possible IPA, and 31 attacks of 30 patients with suspected IFI. Voriconazole (VOR), caspofungin and liposomal amphotericin B were used to treat 72 episodes of 65 patients, 45 episodes of 37 patients and 34 episodes of 32 patients as a first-line therapy, respectively. Unfavorable conditions of our hematology ward are thought to increase the number of cases with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and VOR use. It should be taken into consideration that increased systemic and per oral VOR usage predisposes patients to colonization and infection with azole-resistant fungal strains. Catheters should be removed in cases where patients' conditions are convenient to remove it. Acute myeloblastic leukemia cases that are more likely to develop invasive fungal infections should be monitored closely for early diagnosis and timely initiation of antifungal drugs which directly correlates with survival rates.","['Gedik, Habip', 'Simsek, Funda', 'Yildirmak, Taner', 'Kanturk, Arzu', 'Arica, Deniz', 'Aydin, Demet', 'Demirel, Naciye', 'Yokus, Osman']","['Gedik H', 'Simsek F', 'Yildirmak T', 'Kanturk A', 'Arica D', 'Aydin D', 'Demirel N', 'Yokus O']","['Department of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, Ministry of Health Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital, S.

We studied ten cases diagnosed over a period of 2 years (from July 2011 to June 2013). All the ten cases were in the pediatric age group ranging from 4 months to 2 years. On morphology, pointers to the diagnosis were clustering of blasts, presence of cytoplasmic blebs and platelet budding. An additional interesting morphological feature observed in our study was nuclear blebs which were seen in nine cases. Diagnosis was confirmed in all cases by positive immunostaining for CD61. Two of the cases had an extremely rare clinical presentation as granulocytic sarcoma. Although rare, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia should be kept in mind especially in leukemia in infants.","['Jayasudha, A V', 'Nair, Rekha A', 'Jacob, Priya Mary', 'Renu, S', 'Anila, K R', 'Sindhu Nair, P', 'Priya Kumari, T', 'Kusuma Kumary, P']","['Jayasudha AV', 'Nair RA', 'Jacob PM', 'Renu S', 'Anila KR', 'Sindhu Nair P', 'Priya Kumari T', 'Kusuma Kumary P']","['Department of Pathology, Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, India.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Regional Cancer Centre, Thiruvananthapuram, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,2015/04/01 06:00,2015/04/01 06:01,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2013/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/01 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-014-0413-1 [doi]', '413 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2015 Jun;31(2):169-73. doi: 10.1007/s12288-014-0413-1.

Following up on these studies, we evaluated the role of MMRN1 expression as outcome predictor in two recent Children's Oncology Group trials. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We retrospectively quantified MMRN1 expression in 183 participants of AAML03P1 and 750 participants of AAML0531 by reverse-transcriptase PCR and correlated expression levels with disease characteristics and clinical outcome. RESULTS: In AAML03P1, the highest quartile of MMRN1 expression (expression >/=0.5 relative to beta-glucuronidase; n = 45) was associated with inferior event-free survival (EFS; P < 0.002) and higher relapse risk (P < 0.004). In AAML0531, in which we quantified MMRN1 mRNA for validation, patients with relative MMRN1 expression >/=0.5 (n = 160) less likely achieved remission (67% vs. 77%, P = 0.006), and more frequently had minimal residual disease (43% vs. 24%, P = 0.001) after one induction course. They had inferior overall survival (OS; 44% +/- 9% vs. 69% +/- 4% at 5 years; P < 0.001) and EFS (32% +/- 8% vs. 54% +/- 4% at 5 years; P < 0.001) and higher relapse risk (57% +/- 10% vs. 35% +/- 5% at 5 years; P < 0.001). These differences were partly attributable to the fact that patients with high MMRN1 expression less likely had cytogenetic/molecular low-risk disease (P < 0.001) than those with low MMRN1 expression. Nevertheless, after multivariable adjustment, high MMRN1 expression remained statistically significantly associated with shorter OS (HR, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-2.12; P = 0.003) and EFS (HR, 1.34; 1.04-1.73; P = 0.025), and higher relapse risk (HR, 1.40; 1.01-1.94; P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: Together, our studies identify MMRN1 expression as a novel biomarker that may refine AML risk stratification.","['Laszlo, George S', 'Alonzo, Todd A', 'Gudgeon, Chelsea J', 'Harrington, Kimberly H', 'Gerbing, Robert B', 'Wang, Yi-Cheng', 'Ries, Rhonda E', 'Raimondi, Susana C', 'Hirsch, Betsy A', 'Gamis, Alan S', 'Meshinchi, Soheil', 'Walter, Roland B']","['Laszlo GS', 'Alonzo TA', 'Gudgeon CJ', 'Harrington KH', 'Gerbing RB', 'Wang YC', 'Ries RE', 'Raimondi SC', 'Hirsch BA', 'Gamis AS', 'Meshinchi S', 'Walter RB']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', ""Department of Biostatistics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.

It represents a therapeutic target for treatment of several diseases, mainly hyperlipidemia. To shed light on PPARalpha expression changes in response to fasting, young healthy male and female volunteers were fed or fasted for 24 hours. Monocytes were analyzed every 2 hours to compile both profiles of mRNA and protein expression of PPARalpha and its interactive partner, the circadian pacemaker brain and muscle aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator like-1 (BMAL1). We found that women change their diurnal expression profiles of PPARalpha and BMAL1 when switching from the fed to the fasted state, whereas men do not. Interestingly, the PPARalpha and BMAL1 profiles of men and women in the fed state are different, whereas the profiles in the fasted state are virtually identical. The finding of diametrically opposite responses of male and female PPARalpha expression in the fed state might have practical implication in human medicine as PPARalpha activators like fibrates are used for the therapy of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, microvascular complications in diabetes, and kidney diseases.","['Wege, Nicole', 'Schutkowski, Alexandra', 'Boenn, Markus', 'Bialek, Joanna', 'Schlitt, Axel', 'Noack, Frank', 'Grosse, Ivo', 'Stangl, Gabriele I']","['Wege N', 'Schutkowski A', 'Boenn M', 'Bialek J', 'Schlitt A', 'Noack F', 'Grosse I', 'Stangl GI']","['*Institute of Agricultural and Nutritional Sciences, Institute of Computer Science, and University Clinic Halle (Saale), Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, Halle, Germany;

There is usually insufficient time to find a suitable unrelated donor for these patients. We report on the use of decitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor as a conditioning regimen for a patient undergoing HSCT. CASE SUMMARY: Our patient was a 21-year-old male diagnosed with AML-M1 with 84.5% blast cells and a normal karyotype. His risk stratum was intermediate, without specific mutations of FLT3/ITD, NPM1, CEBPA and C-kit. He underwent successful haploidentical HSCT using decitabine, a conditioning regimen.

However, EGCG has limited clinical application, which necessitates the development of a more effective EGCG prodrug as an anticancer agent. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Derivatives of EGCG were evaluated for their stability and anti-tumour activity in human chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) K562 and KBM5 cells. KEY RESULTS: EGCG-mono-palmitate (EGCG-MP) showed most prolonged stability compared with other EGCG derivatives. EGCG-MP exerted greater cytotoxicity and apoptosis in K562 and KBM5 cells than the other EGCG derivatives. EGCG-MP induced Src-homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) leading decreased oncogenic protein BCR-ABL and STAT3 phosphorylation in CML cells, compared with treatment with EGCG. Furthermore, EGCG-MP reduced phosphorylation of STAT3 and survival genes in K562 cells, compared with EGCG. Conversely, depletion of SHP-1 or application of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor pervanadate blocked the ability of EGCG-MP to suppress phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and STAT3, and the expression of survival genes downstream of STAT3. In addition, EGCG-MP treatment more effectively suppressed tumour growth in BALB/c athymic nude mice compared with untreated controls or EGCG treatment. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased caspase 3 and SHP-1 activity and decreased phosphorylation of BCR-ABL in the EGCG-MP-treated group relative to that in the EGCG-treated group. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: EGCG-MP induced SHP-1-mediated inhibition of BCR-ABL and STAT3 signalling in vitro and in vivo more effectively than EGCG. This derivative may be a potent chemotherapeutic agent for CML treatment.","['Jung, Ji Hoon', 'Yun, Miyong', 'Choo, Eun-Jeong', 'Kim, Sun-Hee', 'Jeong, Myoung-Seok', 'Jung, Deok-Beom', 'Lee, Hyemin', 'Kim, Eun-Ok', 'Kato, Nobuo', 'Kim, Bonglee', 'Srivastava, Sanjay K', 'Kaihatsu, Kunihiro', 'Kim, Sung-Hoon']","['Jung JH', 'Yun M', 'Choo EJ', 'Kim SH', 'Jeong MS', 'Jung DB', 'Lee H', 'Kim EO', 'Kato N', 'Kim B', 'Srivastava SK', 'Kaihatsu K', 'Kim SH']","['College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences and Cancer Biology Center, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center, Amarillo, TX, USA.', 'The Institute of Scientific and Industrial Research, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.', 'College of Korean Medicine, Kyung Hee University, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Catechin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2015/04/01 06:00,2016/05/18 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2014/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/15 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bph.13146 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2015 Jul;172(14):3565-78. doi: 10.1111/bph.13146.

In a pivotal study, ofatumumab (human anti-CD20 mAb) monotherapy demonstrated a 47% objective response rate (ORR) in fludarabine refractory CLL patients. From this study, a subset of 29 patients who had at least stable disease and then progressed were retreated with eight weekly ofatumumab infusions (induction treatment period), followed by monthly infusions for up to 2 years (maintenance treatment period). The ORR after 8 weeks of induction retreatment was 45% and 24% had continued disease control after maintenance at 52 weeks. Efficacy and safety of the retreated patients were compared with their initial results in the pivotal study. Response duration was 24.1 months vs. 6.8 months; time to next therapy was 14.8 months vs. 12.3 months; and progression-free survival was 7.4 months vs. 7.9 months (medians). Upon retreatment, 72% had infusion reactions, mostly Grade 1-2. Three patients had fatal infections. In summary, ofatumumab retreatment and maintenance therapy was feasible in patients with heavily pretreated CLL and appeared to result in more durable disease control than initial ofatumumab treatment in this subset of patients who may have a more favourable disease profile.","['Osterborg, Anders', 'Wierda, William G', 'Mayer, Jiri', 'Hess, Georg', 'Hillmen, Peter', 'Schetelig, Johannes', 'Schuh, Anna', 'Smolej, Lukas', 'Beck, Christian', 'Dreyfus, Brigitte', 'Hellman, Andrzej', 'Kozlowski, Piotr', 'Pfreundschuh, Michael', 'Rizzi, Rita', 'Spacek, Martin', 'Phillips, Jennifer L', 'Gupta, Ira V', 'Williams, Vanessa', 'Jewell, Roxanne C', 'Nebot, Noelia', 'Lisby, Steen', 'Dyer, Martin J S']","['Osterborg A', 'Wierda WG', 'Mayer J', 'Hess G', 'Hillmen P', 'Schetelig J', 'Schuh A', 'Smolej L', 'Beck C', 'Dreyfus B', 'Hellman A', 'Kozlowski P', 'Pfreundschuh M', 'Rizzi R', 'Spacek M', 'Phillips JL', 'Gupta IV', 'Williams V', 'Jewell RC', 'Nebot N', 'Lisby S', 'Dyer MJ']","['Department of Haematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'The University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Cancer Therapy Research Center, San Antonio, TX, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine/Haemato-Oncology, Faculty Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Johannes-Gutenberg-Universtitaer Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Leeds Teaching Hospital, Leeds, UK.', 'Univesitatetsklinickum Carl Gustav Carus, Dresden, Germany.', 'Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Kralove, University Hospital and Charles University in Prague, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic.', 'Haematologisch-Onkologisches Institut, Moenchengladbach-Rheydt, Germany.', 'Hopital Jean Bernanrd, Poitiers, France.', 'Akademia Medyczna w Gdansku, Gdansk, Poland.', 'Universitetssjukhuset, Orebro, Sweden.', 'Universitaesklinikum des Saarlandes, Homburg, Germany.', 'Azienda Ospendaliero Universitaria Policlinico Consorziale, Bari, Italy.', 'Fakultni nemocnice, Praha10, Czech Republic.', 'GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'GlaxoSmithKline, Collegeville, PA, USA.', 'GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.', 'GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.', 'GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA.', 'Genmab, AS, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Ernest and Helen Scott Haematological Research Institute, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'M95KG522R0 (ofatumumab)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retreatment', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",2015/04/01 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2014/12/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13380 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Jul;170(1):40-9. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13380.

BACKGROUND: Since diabetes was accepted as one of the risk factors for the development of periodontal disease, various scientific studies have been undertaken in the STZ-induced periodontal disease models. STZ induces beta-cell damage and subsequent diabetes development in vivo. Until now, assessment of the impacts of STZ-induced experimental diabetes on periodontitis has generally been conducted on the fundamental assumption that STZ have no direct action on PDL and its function. However, several recent studies suggest that STZ also directly affect many different biological functions in various tissues or organs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: To assess the apoptotic effects of STZ on PDLs, they were treated with or without STZ at different concentrations. Qualitative estimation of apoptotic cell death was obtained by live/dead assay. The expression levels of apoptosis-related proteins were evaluated by western blot analysis. RESULTS: STZ inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in PDLs in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, STZ dramatically induced Mcl-1 downregulation in a proteasome-dependent manner and thereby induced apoptosis of PDLs through the Bak/Bax apoptotic signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: Our results support the hypothesis that suppression of the cellular Mcl-1 levels by STZ may be at least partly attributed to the development of periodontitis in STZ-induced diabetic animal models.","['Shin, J-A', 'Hong, I-S', 'Oh, S', 'Cho, S-D', 'Lee, K-E']","['Shin JA', 'Hong IS', 'Oh S', 'Cho SD', 'Lee KE']","['Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Biodegradable Material, Institute of Oral Bioscience, Brain Korea 21 Project, Chonbuk National University, Jeon-ju, Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Gachon University, Incheon, South Korea.', 'Lee Gil Ya Cancer and Diabetes Institute, Incheon, South Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Biodegradable Material, Institute of Oral Bioscience, Brain Korea 21 Project, Chonbuk National University, Jeon-ju, Korea.', 'Department of Oral Pathology, School of Dentistry and Institute of Biodegradable Material, Institute of Oral Bioscience, Brain Korea 21 Project, Chonbuk National University, Jeon-ju, Korea.', 'Department of Oral Medicine, School of Dentistry and Research Institute of Clinical Medicine of Chonbuk, National University, Biomedical Research Institute, Chonbuk National University Hospital, Jeonju, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Periodontal Res,Journal of periodontal research,0055107,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '5W494URQ81 (Streptozocin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*metabolism', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Fibroblasts/*drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Periodontal Ligament/cytology', 'Streptozocin/*metabolism']",2015/04/01 06:00,2017/01/10 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/01/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jre.12268 [doi]'],ppublish,J Periodontal Res. 2015 Dec;50(6):807-13. doi: 10.1111/jre.12268.

As the population was of low socioeconomic background, use of mobiles, computers and microwave was negligible. Moreover prenatal and postnatal exposure to indoor electrically charged objects was not determined to be a significant environmental factor.

Promoter hypermethylation resulting in epigenetic inactivation of SHP1 has been reported in myelomas, leukemias and other cancers. However, whether SHP1 hypermethylation occurs in MPNs, especially in Chinese patients, has remained unclear. Here, we report that aberrant hypermethylation of SHP1 was observed in several leukemic cell lines and bone marrow mononuclear cells from MPN patients. About 51 of 118 (43.2%) MPN patients including 23 of 50 (46%) polycythaemia vera patients, 20 of 50 (40%) essential thrombocythaemia and 8 of 18 (44.4%) idiopathic myelofibrosis showed hypermethylation by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. However, SHP1 methylation was not measured in 20 healthy volunteers. Hypermethylation of SHP1 was found in MPN patients with both positive (34/81, 42%) and negative (17/37, 45.9%) JAK2V617F mutation. The levels of SHP1 mRNA were significantly lower in hypermethylated samples than unmethylated samples, suggesting SHP1 may be epigenetically inactivated in MPN patients. Furthermore, treatment with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (AZA) in K562 cells showing hypermethylation of SHP1 led to progressive demethylation of SHP1, with consequently increased reexpression of SHP1. Meanwhile, phosphorylated JAK2 and STAT3 were progressively reduced. Finally, AZA increased the expression of SHP1 in primary MPN cells with hypermethylation of SHP1. Therefore, our data suggest that epigenetic inactivation of SHP1 contributes to the constitutive activation of JAK2/STAT signaling. Restoration of SHP1 expression by AZA may contribute to clinical treatment for MPN patients.","['Yang, Jun-Jun', 'Chen, Hui', 'Zheng, Xiao-Qun', 'Li, Hai-Ying', 'Wu, Jian-Bo', 'Tang, Li-Yuan', 'Gao, Shen-Meng']","['Yang JJ', 'Chen H', 'Zheng XQ', 'Li HY', 'Wu JB', 'Tang LY', 'Gao SM']","[""Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Second Affiliated Hospital and Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China E-mail : gaoshenmeng77@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Thailand,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP,101130625,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (PTPN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Case-Control Studies', '*DNA Methylation', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenomics', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Non-Receptor Type 6/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2015/04/01 06:00,2016/01/09 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.6.2219 [doi]'],ppublish,Asian Pac J Cancer Prev. 2015;16(6):2219-25. doi: 10.7314/apjcp.2015.16.6.2219.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on the sense they derive from the experience of illness, survivors may go through profound transformations in the way they approach life. METHODS: This exploratory study reports on school engagement of cancer survivors by examining their perceptions of benefits and burdens in relation to their illness. Forty-nine young Quebecers, previously diagnosed and treated for leukaemia, completed a questionnaire measuring their school engagement and participated in an interview focusing on the impact of cancer on their lives. Perceptions with regard to the presence and types of benefits and burdens were described and examined in light of participants' characteristics. An analysis of variance explored whether the presence/absence of benefits and burdens were associated with participants' scores regarding school engagement. RESULTS: Most participants mentioned benefits from having had cancer, and in particular benefits at an interpersonal level. Half of the participants mentioned burdens, mainly of a physical and psychological nature. Significant correlations indicated that (i) the older the survivors were, the more likely they were to report benefits in terms of qualities and strengths of character; (ii) the more time had elapsed since their diagnosis, the more survivors were likely to report psychological types of burdens; and (iii) children from single-parent families reported more frequently having appreciated social or recreational activities compared with children from two-parent families. One main effect indicated that school engagement was greater for survivors who perceived the presence of benefits. An interaction effect revealed that the perception of both benefits and burdens predicts the highest scores of school engagement. CONCLUSIONS: While the results reveal the promising potential that an optimistic yet realistic disposition has in regard to school engagement, more research is necessary to further our understanding of such a disposition.","['Tougas, A-M', 'Jutras, S', 'Bigras, M', 'Tourigny, M']","['Tougas AM', 'Jutras S', 'Bigras M', 'Tourigny M']","['Psychoeducation, Universite de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.', 'Psychologie, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Psychologie, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Psychoeducation, Universite de Sherbrooke, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Child Care Health Dev,"Child: care, health and development",7602632,,IM,"['*Adaptation, Physiological', '*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Child', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Interpersonal Relations', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*psychology', 'Male', 'Parents/psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Quebec/epidemiology', 'Schools', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survivors/*psychology']",2015/04/01 06:00,2016/11/03 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2015/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/11/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cch.12245 [doi]'],ppublish,Child Care Health Dev. 2016 Jan;42(1):68-75. doi: 10.1111/cch.12245.

The relative significance of HSC adhesion to the surrogate niche models via SDF1alpha-CXCR4 or N-cadherin axes was quantified by (a) the fraction of adherent cells, (b) the area of tight adhesion, and (c) the critical pressure for cell detachment. We have demonstrated that the binding of HSC to the niche model is a cooperative process, and the adhesion mediated by the CXCR4- SDF1alpha axis is stronger than that by homophilic N-cadherin binding. The statistical image analysis of stochastic morphological dynamics unraveled that HSC dissipated energy by undergoing oscillatory deformation. The combination of an in vitro niche model and novel physical tools has enabled us to quantitatively determine the relative significance of binding mechanisms between normal HSC versus leukemia blasts to the bone marrow niche.","['Burk, Alexandra S', 'Monzel, Cornelia', 'Yoshikawa, Hiroshi Y', 'Wuchter, Patrick', 'Saffrich, Rainer', 'Eckstein, Volker', 'Tanaka, Motomu', 'Ho, Anthony D']","['Burk AS', 'Monzel C', 'Yoshikawa HY', 'Wuchter P', 'Saffrich R', 'Eckstein V', 'Tanaka M', 'Ho AD']","['1] Physical Chemistry of Biosystems, Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany [2] Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, 76021 Karlsruhe, Germany.', 'Physical Chemistry of Biosystems, Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '1] Physical Chemistry of Biosystems, Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany [2] Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Saitama University, Saitama, 338-8570, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine V (Hematology, Oncology &Rheumatology), University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V (Hematology, Oncology &Rheumatology), University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine V (Hematology, Oncology &Rheumatology), University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', '1] Physical Chemistry of Biosystems, Institute of Physical Chemistry, University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany [2] Institute of Toxicology and Genetics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, 76021 Karlsruhe, Germany [3] Institute for Integrated Cell-Material Sciences (WPI iCeMS), Kyoto University, 606-8501, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Medicine V (Hematology, Oncology &Rheumatology), University of Heidelberg, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Cadherins)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Cadherins/metabolism', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, CXCR4/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Niche']",2015/04/01 06:00,2016/04/06 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2014/08/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/06 06:00 [medline]']","['srep09370 [pii]', '10.1038/srep09370 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Mar 31;5:9370. doi: 10.1038/srep09370.,20150331,PMC5380331,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, Rg3 treatment to A549 human lung adenocarcinoma led to cell death via not only apoptotic pathways but also the downregulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We used cross-linker and cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays to show that Rg3 inhibited EGFR dimerization by EGF stimulation and caused EGFR internalization from the cell membrane. Among several important phosphorylation sites in cytoplasmic EGFR, Rg3 increased the phosphorylation of tyrosine 1045 (pY1045) and serine 1046/1047 (pS1046/1047) for EGFR degradation and coincidently, attenuated pY1173 and pY1068 for mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. These effects were amplified under EGF-pretreated Rg3 stimulation. In vivo experiments showed that the average volume of the tumors treated with 30 mg/kg of Rg3 was significantly decreased by 40% compared with the control. Through immunohistochemistry, we detected the fragmentation of DNA, the accumulation of Rg3, and the reduction of EGFR expression in the Rg3-treated groups. Here, we provide the first description of the roles of Rg3 in the reduction of cell surface EGFR, the attenuation of EGFR signal transduction, and the eventual activation of apoptosis in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma.","['Joo, Eun Ji', 'Chun, Jaemoo', 'Ha, Young Wan', 'Ko, Hye Jin', 'Xu, Mei-Ying', 'Kim, Yeong Shik']","['Joo EJ', 'Chun J', 'Ha YW', 'Ko HJ', 'Xu MY', 'Kim YS']","[""Natural Products Research Institute, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea; Division of Hematology/Oncology and Leukemia Research Program, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA."", 'Natural Products Research Institute, College of Pharmacy, Seoul National University, Seoul 151-742, Republic of Korea.', 'Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology (SAIT)/Samsung Electronics Co.

Most guidelines recommend boosters at 3-yearly intervals after a basic vaccination including primary vaccination and revaccination one year later. The objective of this study was to assess the duration of immunity induced by PUREVAX((R)) RCPCh FeLV, a non-adjuvanted vaccine against feline rhinotracheitis, calicivirosis, infectious panleucopenia, chlamydiosis and leukemia. After primary vaccination followed by revaccination one year later with a vaccine formulated at minimum dose, the cats were kept in a confined environment and challenged 3 years later with a virulent heterologous strain of feline calicivirus (FCV) and subsequently a virulent strain of feline herpesvirus (FHV). Clinical signs and viral excretion were recorded for two weeks after each viral inoculation. Contemporary unvaccinated cats and new animals added at the time of challenge were used as controls. The vaccination regimen induced a stable and long-lasting humoral response. Vaccination resulted in a significant reduction in the severity of the disease after FHV challenge and in the frequency of cats showing a severe calicivirosis (defined as a combination of systemic clinical symptoms and oronasal ulcers). As opposed to the significant reduction of excretion observed a few weeks after primo-vaccination or even one year after vaccination for FCV, viral shedding was not reduced 3 years after revaccination. This study showed that primary vaccination and revaccination one year later with PUREVAX((R)) RCPCh FeLV was able to induce 3-year duration of immunity against FCV and FHV. The results and conclusion of this study are consistent with current vaccination guidelines and will allow the veterinarian to adapt the vaccination regimen to the way of life of the cat.","['Jas, Dominique', 'Frances-Duvert, Valerie', 'Vernes, Delphine', 'Guigal, Pierre-Michel', 'Poulet, Herve']","['Jas D', 'Frances-Duvert V', 'Vernes D', 'Guigal PM', 'Poulet H']","['Merial S.A.S., R&D, 254 avenue Marcel Merieux, 69007 Lyon, France.', 'Merial S.A.S., R&D, 254 avenue Marcel Merieux, 69007 Lyon, France.', 'Merial S.A.S., R&D, 254 avenue Marcel Merieux, 69007 Lyon, France.', 'Merial S.A.S., R&D, 254 avenue Marcel Merieux, 69007 Lyon, France.', 'Merial S.A.S., R&D, 254 avenue Marcel Merieux, 69007 Lyon, France.

In the current study, we investigated the potential anti-leukemic activity of a novel and specific SphK1 inhibitor, SKI-II. We demonstrated that SKI-II inhibited growth and survival of human AML cell lines (HL-60 and U937 cells). SKI-II was more efficient than two known SphK1 inhibitors SK1-I and FTY720 in inhibiting AML cells. Meanwhile, it induced dramatic apoptosis in above AML cells, and the cytotoxicity by SKI-II was almost reversed by the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. SKI-II treatment inhibited SphK1 activation, and concomitantly increased level of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) precursor ceramide in AML cells. Conversely, exogenously-added S1P protected against SKI-II-induced cytotoxicity, while cell permeable short-chain ceramide (C6) aggravated SKI-II's lethality against AML cells. Notably, SKI-II induced potent apoptotic death in primary human AML cells, but was generally safe to the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from healthy donors. In vivo, SKI-II administration suppressed growth of U937 leukemic xenograft tumors in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice.

In a previous study by this group, it was shown that As2O3 induces the apoptosis of MCF-7 breast cancer cells through inhibition of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel. The present study was designed to further investigate the effect of As2O3 on breast cancer cells and to examine the mechanism underlying the regulation of hERG expression. The present study confirmed that As2O3 inhibited tumor growth in vivo, following MCF-7 cell implantation into nude mice. Using computational prediction , it was identified that microRNA (miR)-328 had a binding site in the 3'-untranslated region of hERG mRNA. A luciferase activity assay demonstrated that hERG is a target gene of miR-328. Further investigation using western blot analysis and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that As2O3 downregulated hERG expression via upregulation of miR-328 expression in MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, As2O3 was observed to inhibit breast cancer cell growth, at least in part, through the miR-328/hERG pathway.","['Wang, Ying', 'Wang, Leqiu', 'Yin, Changhao', 'An, Baizhu', 'Hao, Yankun', 'Wei, Tao', 'Li, Li', 'Song, Gaochen']","['Wang Y', 'Wang L', 'Yin C', 'An B', 'Hao Y', 'Wei T', 'Li L', 'Song G']","['Medical Functional Laboratory, Mudanjiang Medical University, Mudanjiang, Heilongjiang 157011, P.R.

Molecularly targeted agents hold promise to change the therapeutic landscape in AML. The nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) controls a plethora of biological process through switching on and off its long list of target genes. In AML, constitutive NF-kappaB has been detected in 40% of cases and its aberrant activity enable leukemia cells to evade apoptosis and stimulate proliferation. These facts suggest that NF-kappaB signaling pathway plays a fundamental role in the development of AML and it represents an attractive target for the intervention of AML. This review summarizes our current knowledge of NF-kappaB signaling transduction including canonical and non-canonical NF-kappaB pathways. Then we specifically highlight what factors contribute to the aberrant activation of NF-kappaB activity in AML, followed by an overview of 8 important clinical trials of the first FDA approved proteasome inhibitor, Bortezomib (Velcade), which is a NF-kappaB inhibitor too, in combination with other therapeutic agents in patients with AML. Finally, this review discusses the future directions of NF-kappaB inhibitor in treatment of AML, especially in targeting leukemia stem cells (LSCs).","['Zhou, Jianbiao', 'Ching, Ying Qing', 'Chng, Wee-Joo']","['Zhou J', 'Ching YQ', 'Chng WJ']","['Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Centre for Translational Medicine, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Centre for Translational Medicine, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Cancer Science Institute of Singapore, National University of Singapore, Centre for Translational Medicine, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Department of Medicine, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Republic of Singapore.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National University Cancer Institute of Singapore (NCIS), The National University Health System (NUHS), Singapore, Republic of Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,['0 (NF-kappa B)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism']",2015/04/01 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2015/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['3545 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3545 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Mar 20;6(8):5490-500. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3545.,,PMC4467382,['NOTNLM'],"['Bortezomib', 'NF-kappaB', 'Velcade', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has recently been shown that T cell expression of the immunoinhibitory receptor PD-1 is regulated by DNA methylation. In 12 of 27 patients (44%) PD-1 promoter demethylation was observed in sorted peripheral blood T cells isolated over consecutive cycles of treatment with 5-azacytidine (5-aza). The PD-1 promoter demethylation correlated with an increase in PD-1 expression. Moreover, demethylation of the PD-1 promoter correlated with a significantly worse overall response rate (8% vs. 60%, p = 0.014), and a trend towards a shorter overall survival (p = 0.11) was observed. A significantly higher baseline methylation level of the PD-1 promoter was observed in T cells of non-responding patients compared to healthy controls (p = 0.023). Accordingly, in addition to their beneficial function, HMAs induce PD-1 expression on T cells in the MDS microenvironment, thereby likely hampering the immune response against the MDS blasts. Thus, we suggest that activation of the PD-1 checkpoint during HMA treatment can be a possible resistance mechanism, which may be overcome by combination therapy with a PD-1 pathway inhibitor.","['Orskov, Andreas D', 'Treppendahl, Marianne B', 'Skovbo, Anni', 'Holm, Mette S', 'Friis, Lone S', 'Hokland, Marianne', 'Gronbaek, Kirsten']","['Orskov AD', 'Treppendahl MB', 'Skovbo A', 'Holm MS', 'Friis LS', 'Hokland M', 'Gronbaek K']","['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'FACS Core Facility, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Biomedicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PDCD1 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites/*pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Receptor/biosynthesis/*genetics/physiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*metabolism']",2015/04/01 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2014/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['3324 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3324 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Apr 20;6(11):9612-26. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3324.,,PMC4496243,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'T cells', 'hypomethylating agents', 'myelodysplastic syndromes', 'programmed death-1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to identify the metastasis-associated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Potent metastatic SK-hep-1 (SK) cells, designated 'SKM', were generated using Transwell assay followed by selection in a mouse model. Genes expressed differentially in SKM and SK cells were identified via microarray analyses. A small form of Neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4 (sNEDD4) was identified to be overexpressed in SKM cells, which was confirmed as a novel transcript using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In clinical specimens, sNEDD4 was significantly overexpressed in tumors and serves as a poor prognostic factor for male patients with HCC (P = 0.035). Upon subcutaneous introduction of sNEDD4-overexpressing SK cells into flanks of nude mice, tumors grew faster than those of the control group. Furthermore, sNEDD4-mediated promotion of tumor metastasis was demonstrated in the orthotopic mouse model. Overexpression of sNEDD4 increased the invasive ability of SK cells through upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 and inhibited serum deprivation-induced apoptosis via upregulation of myeloid cell leukemia 1. In conclusion, sNEDD4 is a novel metastasis-associated gene, which prevents apoptosis under nutrient restriction conditions.

This retrospective analysis studied a cohort of s-ALL patients treated at a single centre between 1994 and 2013, while comparing therapy-associated ALL (t-ALL) and antecedent malignancy ALL (am-ALL) patients. Thirty-two patients with s-ALL were identified. The overall incidence was 9.4% among ALL adults while T-cell s-ALL was rare (12% of s-ALLs). The median time interval between two malignant diagnoses was 5.3 years (range: 0.1-28). In contrast to previous reports, most of the s-ALLs were CD10 + and without KMT2A (MLL) abnormalities. The overall survival (OS) rates of the entire cohort at 12 and 24 months from ALL diagnosis was 49% and 25%, respectively. Most patients (n = 23, 72%) received prior chemo-/radio-therapy for their first malignancy (t-ALL) and only 9 (28%) did not (am-ALL). No significant difference was found in the incidence of B-/T- lineage ALL, extramedullary disease, blood count, and the rate of Philadelphia-positive ALL, nor in the rates of complete remission (P = 0.55) and OS (P = 0.97). This similarity, together with high incidence of family malignancy in both groups, raise the possibility that s-ALL patients may have an inherent predisposition to malignancies and a history of previous therapy may be of lesser importance in the pathogenesis of s-ALL.","['Ganzel, Chezi', 'Devlin, Sean', 'Douer, Dan', 'Rowe, Jacob M', 'Stein, Eytan M', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Ganzel C', 'Devlin S', 'Douer D', 'Rowe JM', 'Stein EM', 'Tallman MS']","['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Shaare Zedek Medical Centre, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Shaare Zedek Medical Centre, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/04/01 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2014/12/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13386 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Jul;170(1):50-5. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13386.

Recent reports have suggested that abnormal expression of DLX4 is present in several types of human tumors, including breast cancer, leukemia and colon cancer. However, the function and the mechanistic regulation of DLX4 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are elusive. In the present study, a proportion of hepatocellular carcinomas were identified to exhibit upregulated DLX4 expression. This study proposed that the overexpression of DLX4 is associated with the downregulation of miR-122, an underexpressed miRNA in human HCC. Functional studies have demonstrated that the downregulation of DLX4 in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines is regulated by miR-122 through binding to its 3'UTR. Furthermore, a DLX4 overexpression vector lacking the 3'UTR was shown to abolish miR-122-induced inhibition of proliferation in the HCC cell line Hep3B. These results gave new insight into the mechanism of the miR-122/DLX4 axis in HCC.","['Xie, Xu-Hua', 'Xu, Xiao-Pei', 'Sun, Chang-Yu', 'Yu, Zu-Jiang']","['Xie XH', 'Xu XP', 'Sun CY', 'Yu ZJ']","['Department of Infectious Diseases, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450052, P.R.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Lung ultrasound was performed in 5 pregnant patients with blood cancers. The women's age was 29-38 years; gestational age was 14-33 weeks. Four women had different types of acute leukemia; one had primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. All the women received chemotherapy for blood cancer. When there were signs of lung injury, USG was conducted, the results of which necessitated therapy or bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). RESULTS: Three patients developed acute respiratory failure; 2 of them required noninvasive ventilation. Based on the detection of consolidation with a dynamic air bronchogram and pleural effusion, the authors diagnosed bilateral pneumonia and alveolar-interstitial syndrome in 1 patient, right-sided pneumonia in 1, left-sided one in 1, and transfusion-related pulmonary edema in 1. Lung ultrasound did not verify the diagnosis of pneumonia in 1 patient. According to USG data, BAL procedures were performed in 2 patients; one of them was diagnosed as having Pneumocystis pneumonia; the other was found to have no pathogens in lavage fluid. Treatment resulted in clinical improvements and normalization of the lung ultrasound pattern in all the pregnant women. Later on, 4 women delivered via cesarean section done at 32-34 weeks' gestation and gave birth to healthy babies. One patient died from infectious complications after chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: Lung sound may be used to diagnose lung injury in pregnant women with blood cancers.","['Galstyan, G M', 'Novikov, V A', 'Troitskaya, V V', 'Baryakh, E A', 'Makhinya, S A', 'Parovichnikova, E N', 'Savchenko, V G']","['Galstyan GM', 'Novikov VA', 'Troitskaya VV', 'Baryakh EA', 'Makhinya SA', 'Parovichnikova EN', 'Savchenko VG']","['Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.', 'Hematology Research Center, Ministry of Health of Russia, Moscow, Russia.']",['rus'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Gestational Age', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung/*diagnostic imaging', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/complications/*diagnostic imaging/microbiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Infectious/*diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/microbiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Ultrasonography']",2015/04/01 06:00,2015/04/29 06:00,['2015/04/01 06:00'],"['2015/04/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/04/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17116/terarkh2015871779-87 [doi]'],ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2015;87(1):79-87. doi: 10.17116/terarkh2015871779-87.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The modified AHP systematically integrates outcomes of individual filter methods to select the most informative genes for microarray classification. Five individual ranking methods including t-test, entropy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, Wilcoxon and signal to noise ratio are employed to rank genes. These ranked genes are then considered as inputs for the modified AHP. Additionally, a method that uses fuzzy standard additive model (FSAM) for cancer classification based on genes selected by AHP is also proposed in this paper. Traditional FSAM learning is a hybrid process comprising unsupervised structure learning and supervised parameter tuning. Genetic algorithm (GA) is incorporated in-between unsupervised and supervised training to optimize the number of fuzzy rules. The integration of GA enables FSAM to deal with the high-dimensional-low-sample nature of microarray data and thus enhance the efficiency of the classification. Experiments are carried out on numerous microarray datasets. Results demonstrate the performance dominance of the AHP-based gene selection against the single ranking methods. Furthermore, the combination of AHP-FSAM shows a great accuracy in microarray data classification compared to various competing classifiers. The proposed approach therefore is useful for medical practitioners and clinicians as a decision support system that can be implemented in the real medical practice.","['Nguyen, Thanh', 'Khosravi, Abbas', 'Creighton, Douglas', 'Nahavandi, Saeid']","['Nguyen T', 'Khosravi A', 'Creighton D', 'Nahavandi S']","['Centre for Intelligent Systems Research (CISR), Deakin University, Geelong Waurn Ponds Campus, Victoria, 3216, Australia.', 'Centre for Intelligent Systems Research (CISR), Deakin University, Geelong Waurn Ponds Campus, Victoria, 3216, Australia.', 'Centre for Intelligent Systems Research (CISR), Deakin University, Geelong Waurn Ponds Campus, Victoria, 3216, Australia.', 'Centre for Intelligent Systems Research (CISR), Deakin University, Geelong Waurn Ponds Campus, Victoria, 3216, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Algorithms', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Data Interpretation, Statistical', 'Databases, Genetic/statistics & numerical data', 'Decision Support Systems, Clinical', 'Fuzzy Logic', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Statistical', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods/statistics & numerical data', 'ROC Curve', 'Supervised Machine Learning', 'Unsupervised Machine Learning']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/04/23 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0120364 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-52191 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 30;10(3):e0120364. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0120364. eCollection 2015.,20150330,PMC4378968,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib also has efficacy against various pathogens, including pathogenic mycobacteria, where it decreases bacterial load in mice, albeit at doses below those used for treating cancer. We report that imatinib at such low doses unexpectedly induces differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors in the bone marrow, augments myelopoiesis but not lymphopoiesis, and increases numbers of myeloid cells in blood and spleen. Whereas progenitor differentiation relies on partial inhibition of c-Kit by imatinib, lineage commitment depends upon inhibition of other PTKs. Thus, imatinib mimics ""emergency hematopoiesis,"" a physiological innate immune response to infection. Increasing neutrophil numbers by adoptive transfer sufficed to reduce mycobacterial load, and imatinib reduced bacterial load of Franciscella spp., which do not utilize imatinib-sensitive PTKs for pathogenesis. Thus, potentiation of the immune response by imatinib at low doses may facilitate clearance of diverse microbial pathogens.","['Napier, Ruth J', 'Norris, Brian A', 'Swimm, Alyson', 'Giver, Cynthia R', 'Harris, Wayne A C', 'Laval, Julie', 'Napier, Brooke A', 'Patel, Gopi', 'Crump, Ryan', 'Peng, Zhenghong', 'Bornmann, William', 'Pulendran, Bali', 'Buller, R Mark', 'Weiss, David S', 'Tirouvanziam, Rabindra', 'Waller, Edmund K', 'Kalman, Daniel']","['Napier RJ', 'Norris BA', 'Swimm A', 'Giver CR', 'Harris WA', 'Laval J', 'Napier BA', 'Patel G', 'Crump R', 'Peng Z', 'Bornmann W', 'Pulendran B', 'Buller RM', 'Weiss DS', 'Tirouvanziam R', 'Waller EK', 'Kalman D']","['Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Graduate Program, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Immunology and Molecular Pathogenesis Graduate Program, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America; Center for Cystic Fibrosis Research, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America; Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier (IGMM), CNRS UMR5535, Universite Montpellier, Montpellier, France."", 'Microbiology and Molecular Genetics Graduate Program, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America; Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America; Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Molecular Microbiology and Immunology, Saint Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States of America.', 'Emory Vaccine Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America; Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America; Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America; Center for Cystic Fibrosis Research, Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America."", 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,['8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects/immunology', 'Francisella/*immunology', 'Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections/*immunology', 'Imatinib Mesylate/*pharmacology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Mice', 'Myelopoiesis/*drug effects/immunology', 'Neutrophils/*immunology']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/02/09 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1004770 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-14-01571 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2015 Mar 30;11(3):e1004770. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004770. eCollection 2015 Mar.,20150330,PMC4379053,,,,,,"['R37 AI048638/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R38 AI140299/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'UH3 AI122320/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI05606701/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01A107246201/PHS HHS/United States', 'R37 DK057665/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '5P01HL08773-05/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'F32 HL008773/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'UH2 AI122320/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 AI090023/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detailed knowledge on key intermediates in this pathway as well as any parallel pathways is largely missing.

Curcumin sustained the LIF independent self-renewal of mESCs and induced pluripotent stem cells (miPSCs) in a STAT3 activity dependent manner. Gene expression analysis showed LIF/STAT3 and redox signaling components to be majorly modulated. Amongst ROS genes, expression of Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (MnSOD) specifically relied on STAT3 signaling as evidenced by STAT3 inhibition and reporter assay. The silencing of MnSOD, but not Cu-ZnSOD expression, resulted in the loss of mESC pluripotency in presence of LIF, and the overexpression of MnSOD is sufficient for maintaining the expression of pluripotent genes in the absence of STAT3 signaling. Finally, we demonstrate MnSOD to stabilize the turnover of pluripotent proteins at the post-translational level by modulating proteasomal activity. In conclusion, our findings unravel a novel role of STAT3 mediated MnSOD in the self-renewal of mESCs.","['Sheshadri, Preethi', 'Ashwini, Ashwathnarayan', 'Jahnavi, Sowmya', 'Bhonde, Ramesh', 'Prasanna, Jyothi', 'Kumar, Anujith']","['Sheshadri P', 'Ashwini A', 'Jahnavi S', 'Bhonde R', 'Prasanna J', 'Kumar A']","['School of Regenerative Medicine, Manipal University, Bangalore-560065.', 'School of Regenerative Medicine, Manipal University, Bangalore-560065.', 'School of Regenerative Medicine, Manipal University, Bangalore-560065.', 'School of Regenerative Medicine, Manipal University, Bangalore-560065.', 'School of Regenerative Medicine, Manipal University, Bangalore-560065.', 'School of Regenerative Medicine, Manipal University, Bangalore-560065.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,,,,2015/03/31 06:00,2015/03/31 06:01,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:01 [medline]']","['srep09516 [pii]', '10.1038/srep09516 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Mar 30;5:9516. doi: 10.1038/srep09516.,20150330,PMC5380158,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook a prospective study to compare NAPL and RAPL patients treated with arsenic trioxide (ATO) based regimens. 98 NAPL and 28 RAPL were enrolled in this study. RAPL patients had a significantly lower WBC count and higher platelet count at diagnosis. IC bleeds was significantly lower in RAPL cases (P=0.022). The ability of malignant promyelocytes to concentrate ATO intracellularly and their in-vitro IC50 to ATO was not significantly different between the two groups. Targeted NGS revealed PML B2 domain mutations in 4 (15.38%) of the RAPL subset and none were associated with secondary resistance to ATO. A microarray GEP revealed 1744 genes were 2 fold and above differentially expressed between the two groups. The most prominent differentially regulated pathways were cell adhesion (n=92), cell survival (n=50), immune regulation (n=74) and stem cell regulation (n=51). Consistent with the GEP data, immunophenotyping revealed significantly increased CD34 expression (P=0.001) in RAPL cases and there was in-vitro evidence of significant microenvironment mediated innate resistance (EM-DR) to ATO. Resistance and relapse following treatment with ATO is probably multi-factorial, mutations in PML B2 domain while seen only in RAPL may not be the major clinically relevant cause of subsequent relapses. In RAPL additional factors such as expansion of the leukemia initiating compartment along with EM-DR may contribute significantly to relapse following treatment with ATO based regimens.","['Chendamarai, Ezhilarasi', 'Ganesan, Saravanan', 'Alex, Ansu Abu', 'Kamath, Vandana', 'Nair, Sukesh C', 'Nellickal, Arun Jose', 'Janet, Nancy Beryl', 'Srivastava, Vivi', 'Lakshmi, Kavitha M', 'Viswabandya, Auro', 'Abraham, Aby', 'Aiyaz, Mohammed', 'Mullapudi, Nandita', 'Mugasimangalam, Raja', 'Padua, Rose Ann', 'Chomienne, Christine', 'Chandy, Mammen', 'Srivastava, Alok', 'George, Biju', 'Balasubramanian, Poonkuzhali', 'Mathews, Vikram']","['Chendamarai E', 'Ganesan S', 'Alex AA', 'Kamath V', 'Nair SC', 'Nellickal AJ', 'Janet NB', 'Srivastava V', 'Lakshmi KM', 'Viswabandya A', 'Abraham A', 'Aiyaz M', 'Mullapudi N', 'Mugasimangalam R', 'Padua RA', 'Chomienne C', 'Chandy M', 'Srivastava A', 'George B', 'Balasubramanian P', 'Mathews V']","['Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Immunohaematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Transfusion Medicine and Immunohaematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Cytogenetics Unit, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Genotypic Technology, Bengaluru, India.', 'Genotypic Technology, Bengaluru, India.', 'Genotypic Technology, Bengaluru, India.', ""UMR 1131 Institut d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint Louis, I avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France."", ""UMR 1131 Institut d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint Louis, I avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France."", 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.', 'Department of Haematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Granulocyte Precursor Cells/drug effects/pathology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/blood/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Oxides/blood/*therapeutic use', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Prospective Studies', 'Recurrence', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/04/19 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0121912 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-51005 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 30;10(3):e0121912. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0121912. eCollection 2015.,20150330,PMC4378855,,,,,,"['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'IA/S/11/2500267/WTDBT_/DBT-Wellcome Trust India Alliance/India']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although prior work has focused on targeting AR directly, co-activators of AR signaling, which may represent new therapeutic targets, are relatively underexplored. Here we demonstrate that the mixed-lineage leukemia protein (MLL) complex, a well-known driver of MLL fusion-positive leukemia, acts as a co-activator of AR signaling. AR directly interacts with the MLL complex via the menin-MLL subunit. Menin expression is higher in CRPC than in both hormone-naive prostate cancer and benign prostate tissue, and high menin expression correlates with poor overall survival of individuals diagnosed with prostate cancer. Treatment with a small-molecule inhibitor of menin-MLL interaction blocks AR signaling and inhibits the growth of castration-resistant tumors in vivo in mice. Taken together, this work identifies the MLL complex as a crucial co-activator of AR and a potential therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer.","['Malik, Rohit', 'Khan, Amjad P', 'Asangani, Irfan A', 'Cieslik, Marcin', 'Prensner, John R', 'Wang, Xiaoju', 'Iyer, Matthew K', 'Jiang, Xia', 'Borkin, Dmitry', 'Escara-Wilke, June', 'Stender, Rachell', 'Wu, Yi-Mi', 'Niknafs, Yashar S', 'Jing, Xiaojun', 'Qiao, Yuanyuan', 'Palanisamy, Nallasivam', 'Kunju, Lakshmi P', 'Krishnamurthy, Pranathi M', 'Yocum, Anastasia K', 'Mellacheruvu, Dattatreya', 'Nesvizhskii, Alexey I', 'Cao, Xuhong', 'Dhanasekaran, Saravana M', 'Feng, Felix Y', 'Grembecka, Jolanta', 'Cierpicki, Tomasz', 'Chinnaiyan, Arul M']","['Malik R', 'Khan AP', 'Asangani IA', 'Cieslik M', 'Prensner JR', 'Wang X', 'Iyer MK', 'Jiang X', 'Borkin D', 'Escara-Wilke J', 'Stender R', 'Wu YM', 'Niknafs YS', 'Jing X', 'Qiao Y', 'Palanisamy N', 'Kunju LP', 'Krishnamurthy PM', 'Yocum AK', 'Mellacheruvu D', 'Nesvizhskii AI', 'Cao X', 'Dhanasekaran SM', 'Feng FY', 'Grembecka J', 'Cierpicki T', 'Chinnaiyan AM']","['1] Michigan Center for Translational Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA.

This gene expression program is dependent on the disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like histone 3 lysine 79 (H3K79) methyltransferase DOT1L, and small-molecule DOT1L inhibitors show promise as therapeutics for these leukemias. However, the mechanisms underlying this dependency are unclear. We conducted a genome-scale RNAi screen and found that the histone deacetylase SIRT1 is required for the establishment of a heterochromatin-like state around MLL fusion target genes after DOT1L inhibition. DOT1L inhibits chromatin localization of a repressive complex composed of SIRT1 and the H3K9 methyltransferase SUV39H1, thereby maintaining an open chromatin state with elevated H3K9 acetylation and minimal H3K9 methylation at MLL fusion target genes. Furthermore, the combination of SIRT1 activators and DOT1L inhibitors shows enhanced antiproliferative activity against MLL-rearranged leukemia cells. These results indicate that the dynamic interplay between chromatin regulators controlling the activation and repression of gene expression could provide novel opportunities for combination therapy.","['Chen, Chun-Wei', 'Koche, Richard P', 'Sinha, Amit U', 'Deshpande, Aniruddha J', 'Zhu, Nan', 'Eng, Rowena', 'Doench, John G', 'Xu, Haiming', 'Chu, Scott H', 'Qi, Jun', 'Wang, Xi', 'Delaney, Christopher', 'Bernt, Kathrin M', 'Root, David E', 'Hahn, William C', 'Bradner, James E', 'Armstrong, Scott A']","['Chen CW', 'Koche RP', 'Sinha AU', 'Deshpande AJ', 'Zhu N', 'Eng R', 'Doench JG', 'Xu H', 'Chu SH', 'Qi J', 'Wang X', 'Delaney C', 'Bernt KM', 'Root DE', 'Hahn WC', 'Bradner JE', 'Armstrong SA']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', 'Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', ""Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Children's Hospital Colorado, Aurora, Colorado, USA."", 'Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.', '1] Broad Institute of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.

We show that in mice, premalignant myeloid cells harboring a Kras(G12D) allele retained low levels of Ras signaling owing to negative feedback involving Spry4 that prevented transformation. In humans, SPRY4 is located on chromosome 5q, a region affected by large heterozygous deletions that are associated with aggressive disease in which gain-of-function mutations in the RAS pathway are rare. These 5q deletions often co-occur with chromosome 17 alterations involving the deletion of NF1 (another RAS negative regulator) and TP53. Accordingly, combined suppression of Spry4, Nf1 and p53 produces high levels of Ras signaling and drives AML in mice. Thus, SPRY4 is a tumor suppressor at 5q whose disruption contributes to a lethal AML subtype that appears to acquire RAS pathway activation through a loss of negative regulators.","['Zhao, Zhen', 'Chen, Chi-Chao', 'Rillahan, Cory D', 'Shen, Ronglai', 'Kitzing, Thomas', 'McNerney, Megan E', 'Diaz-Flores, Ernesto', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Shannon, Kevin', 'Le Beau, Michelle M', 'Spector, Mona S', 'Kogan, Scott C', 'Lowe, Scott W']","['Zhao Z', 'Chen CC', 'Rillahan CD', 'Shen R', 'Kitzing T', 'McNerney ME', 'Diaz-Flores E', 'Zuber J', 'Shannon K', 'Le Beau MM', 'Spector MS', 'Kogan SC', 'Lowe SW']","['Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.', '1] Cancer Biology and Genetics Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York, USA.

To examine in detail the clinical experience of such patients, we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of consecutive patients diagnosed with AML at our hospital from 2004 to 2012. Of 158 AML patients, 43 (27 %) did not undergo induction chemotherapy. Their median survival duration was 1.5 months, with 11, six, and four patients surviving more than 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. As expected, their survival was worse than that of those treated with intensive or less-intensive induction therapy (14, 74, and 47 % at 1 year, and 0, 40, and 10 % at 4 years, respectively). Low white blood cell count at AML diagnosis and prior history of myelodysplastic syndrome were significantly associated with longer survival. Our findings suggest that modern supportive care measures do not prolong survival for AML patients not undergoing induction chemotherapy, although certain patients show relatively long survival. These data should prove helpful in discussing treatment pathways with patients for cases in which palliative or supportive therapy alone may be a viable treatment option.","['Yanada, Masamitsu', 'Okamoto, Akinao', 'Inaguma, Yoko', 'Tokuda, Masutaka', 'Morishima, Satoko', 'Kanie, Tadaharu', 'Yamamoto, Yukiya', 'Mizuta, Shuichi', 'Akatsuka, Yoshiki', 'Okamoto, Masataka', 'Emi, Nobuhiko']","['Yanada M', 'Okamoto A', 'Inaguma Y', 'Tokuda M', 'Morishima S', 'Kanie T', 'Yamamoto Y', 'Mizuta S', 'Akatsuka Y', 'Okamoto M', 'Emi N']","['Department of Hematology, Fujita Health University School of Medicine, 1-98 Dengakugakubo, Kutsukake-cho, Toyoake, 470-1192, Japan, myanada@fujita-hu.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/17 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s12185-015-1786-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2015 Jul;102(1):35-40. doi: 10.1007/s12185-015-1786-0.

DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are used to treat these disorders, but response is highly variable, with few means to predict which patients will benefit. Here, we examined baseline differences in mutations, DNA methylation, and gene expression in 40 CMML patients who were responsive or resistant to decitabine (DAC) in order to develop a molecular means of predicting response at diagnosis. While somatic mutations did not differentiate responders from nonresponders, we identified 167 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of DNA at baseline that distinguished responders from nonresponders using next-generation sequencing. These DMRs were primarily localized to nonpromoter regions and overlapped with distal regulatory enhancers. Using the methylation profiles, we developed an epigenetic classifier that accurately predicted DAC response at the time of diagnosis. Transcriptional analysis revealed differences in gene expression at diagnosis between responders and nonresponders. In responders, the upregulated genes included those that are associated with the cell cycle, potentially contributing to effective DAC incorporation. Treatment with CXCL4 and CXCL7, which were overexpressed in nonresponders, blocked DAC effects in isolated normal CD34+ and primary CMML cells, suggesting that their upregulation contributes to primary DAC resistance.","['Meldi, Kristen', 'Qin, Tingting', 'Buchi, Francesca', 'Droin, Nathalie', 'Sotzen, Jason', 'Micol, Jean-Baptiste', 'Selimoglu-Buet, Dorothee', 'Masala, Erico', 'Allione, Bernardino', 'Gioia, Daniela', 'Poloni, Antonella', 'Lunghi, Monia', 'Solary, Eric', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Santini, Valeria', 'Figueroa, Maria E']","['Meldi K', 'Qin T', 'Buchi F', 'Droin N', 'Sotzen J', 'Micol JB', 'Selimoglu-Buet D', 'Masala E', 'Allione B', 'Gioia D', 'Poloni A', 'Lunghi M', 'Solary E', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Santini V', 'Figueroa ME']",,['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Intergenic)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PPBP protein, human)', '0 (beta-Thromboglobulin)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Intergenic/genetics', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Platelet Factor 4/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'beta-Thromboglobulin/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/08/19 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/19 06:00 [medline]']","['78752 [pii]', '10.1172/JCI78752 [doi]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2015 May;125(5):1857-72. doi: 10.1172/JCI78752.

Glycoalkaloids are nitrogen-containing secondary plant metabolites found in numerous Solanaceous plants including eggplants, potatoes, and tomatoes. Exposure of cancer cells to glycoalkaloids produced by eggplants (alpha-solamargine and alpha-solasonine), potatoes (alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine), and tomatoes (alpha-tomatine) or their hydrolysis products (mono-, di-, and trisaccharide derivatives and the aglycones solasodine, solanidine, and tomatidine) inhibits the growth of the cells in culture (in vitro) as well as tumor growth in vivo. This overview comprehensively surveys and consolidates worldwide efforts to define the following aspects of these natural compounds: (a) their prevalence in the three foods; (b) their chemistry and structure-activity relationships; (c) the reported factors (biomarkers, signaling pathways) associated with apoptosis of bone, breast, cervical, colon, gastric, glioblastoma, leukemia, liver, lung, lymphoma, melanoma, pancreas, prostate, and squamous cell carcinoma cell lines in vitro and the in vivo inhibition of tumor formation and growth in fish and mice and in human skin cancers; and (d) future research needs. The described results may make it possible to better relate the structures of the active compounds to their health-promoting function, individually, in combination, and in food, and allow the consumer to select glycoalkaloid-containing food with the optimal content of nontoxic beneficial compounds.

Atg14L, the mammalian ortholog of Atg14 in yeast and a critical regulator of autophagy, mediates the production PtdIns3P to initiate the formation of autophagosomes. However, it is not clear how Atg14L is regulated. In this study, we demonstrate that ubiquitination and degradation of Atg14L is controlled by ZBTB16-Cullin3-Roc1 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Furthermore, we show that a wide range of G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) ligands and agonists regulate the levels of Atg14L through ZBTB16. In addition, we show that the activation of autophagy by pharmacological inhibition of GPCR reduces the accumulation of misfolded proteins and protects against behavior dysfunction in a mouse model of Huntington's disease. Our study demonstrates a common molecular mechanism by which the activation of GPCRs leads to the suppression of autophagy and a pharmacological strategy to activate autophagy in the CNS for the

Objective. We aimed at comparing the disease-free survival of children with acute myeloid leukaemia who, in addition to being treated with the Latin American protocol of chemotherapy and an autologous transplant, either underwent early intensified chemotherapy or did not undergo such treatment. PROCEDURE: This was a cohort study with a historical control group, forty patients, less than 16 years old. Group A (20 patients), diagnosed in the period 2005-2007, was treated with the Latin American protocol of chemotherapy with an autologous transplant plus early intensified chemotherapy: high doses of cytarabine and mitoxantrone. Group B (20 patients), diagnosed in the period 1999-2004, was treated as Group A, but without the early intensified chemotherapy. RESULTS: Relapse-free survival for Group A was 90% whereas that for Group B it was 60% (P = 0.041). Overall survival for Group A (18, 90%) was higher than that for Group B (60%). Complete remission continued for two years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Relapse-free survival for paediatric patients treated with the Latin American protocol of chemotherapy with an autologous transplant plus early intensified chemotherapy was higher than that for those who did not receive early intensified chemotherapy.","['Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva', 'Duenas-Gonzalez, Maria Teresa', 'Arellano-Galindo, Jose', 'Medrano-Ortiz-De-Zarate, Maria Elena',

The changes are signals transmitted through molecular interactions, eventually leading to two cellular fates, apoptosis and autophagy. Due to genetic variations, the signals may not be effectively transmitted to modulate apoptotic and autophagic responses. Such aberrant modulation may lead to carcinogenesis and drug resistance. The balance between apoptosis and autophagy becomes very crucial in coping with the stress. Though there have been evidences illustrating the apoptosis-autophagy interplay, the underlying mechanism and the participation of the regulators including transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) remain unclear. RESULTS: Gene network is a graphical illustration for exploring the functional linkages and the potential coordinate regulations of genes. Microarray dataset for the study of chronic myeloid leukemia was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus. The expression profiles of those genes related to apoptosis and autophagy, including MCL1, BCL2, ATG, beclin-1, BAX, BAK, E2F, cMYC, PI3K, AKT, BAD, and LC3, were extracted from the dataset to construct the gene networks. CONCLUSION: The network analysis of these genes explored the underlying mechanisms and the roles of TFs and miRNAs for the crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy.","['Wang, Fengfeng', 'Cho, William C S', 'Chan, Lawrence W C', 'Wong, S C Cesar', 'Tsui, Nancy B Y', 'Siu, Parco M', 'Yip, S P', 'Yung, Benjamin Y M']","['Wang F', 'Cho WC', 'Chan LW', 'Wong SC', 'Tsui NB', 'Siu PM', 'Yip SP', 'Yung BY']","['Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Lee Shau Kee Building, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Clinical Oncology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, 30 Gascoigne Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Lee Shau Kee Building, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Lee Shau Kee Building, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Lee Shau Kee Building, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Lee Shau Kee Building, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Lee Shau Kee Building, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.', 'Department of Health Technology and Informatics, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Lee Shau Kee Building, Hung Hom, Kowloon, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['*Apoptosis', '*Autophagy', 'Computer Simulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/459840 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:459840. doi: 10.1155/2015/459840.

Rapid systemic deamination of gemcitabine accounts for a brief plasma half-life but its sustained administration is often curtailed by sequelae and chemotherapeutic-resistance. A molecular strategy that diminishes these limitations is the molecular design and synthetic production of covalent gemcitabine immunochemotherapeutics that possess properties of selective ""targeted"" delivery. The simultaneous dual selective ""targeted"" delivery of gemcitabine at two separate sites on the external surface membrane of a single cancer cell types represents a therapeutic approach that can increase cytosol chemotherapeutic deposition; prolong chemotherapeutic plasma half-life (reduces administration frequency); minimize innocent exposure of normal tissues and healthy organ systems; and ultimately enhance more rapid and thorough resolution of neoplastic cell populations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A light-reactive gemcitabine intermediate synthesized utilizing succinimidyl 4,4-azipentanoate was covalently bound to anti-EGFR or anti-HER2/neu IgG by exposure to UV light (354-nm) resulting in the synthesis of covalent immunochemotherapeutics, gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-EGFR] and gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu]. Cytotoxic anti-neoplastic potency of gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-EGFR] and gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] between gemcitabine-equivalent concentrations of 10(-12) M and 10(-6) M was determined utilizing chemotherapeutic-resistant mammary adenocarcinoma (SKRr-3). The organoselenium compound, [Se]-methylselenocysteine was evaluated to determine if it complemented the anti-neoplastic potency of the covalent gemcitabine immunochemotherapeutics. RESULTS: Gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-EGFR], gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] and the dual simultaneous combination of gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-EGFR] with gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] all had anti-neoplastic cytotoxic potency against mammary adenocarcinoma. Gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-EGFR] and gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] produced progressive increases in anti-neoplastic cytotoxicity that were greatest between gemcitabine-equivalent concentrations of 10(-9) M and 10(-6) M. Dual simultaneous combinations of gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-EGFR] with gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] produced levels of anti-neoplastic cytotoxicity intermediate between each of the individual covalent gemcitabine immunochemotherapeutics. Total anti-neoplastic cytotoxicity of the dual simultaneous combination of gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-EGFR] and gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[anti-HER2/neu] against chemotherapeutic-resistant mammary adenocarcinoma (SKBr-3) was substantially higher when formulated with [Se]-methylsele-nocysteine.","['Coyne, C P', 'Jones, Toni', 'Bear, Ryan']","['Coyne CP', 'Jones T', 'Bear R']","['Department of Basic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, USA.', 'Department of Basic Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, USA.', 'Wise Center, Mississippi State University, Mississippi State, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cancer Ther,Journal of cancer therapy,101555104,,,,2015/03/31 06:00,2015/03/31 06:01,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4236/jct.2015.61009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Ther. 2015 Jan;6(1):62-89. doi: 10.4236/jct.2015.61009.,,PMC4376018,['NOTNLM'],"['Anti-EGFR', 'Anti-HER2/neu', 'Covalent Immunochemotherapeutic', 'Gemcitabine', 'Gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[Anti-EGFR]', 'Gemcitabine-(C4-amide)-[Anti-HER2/neu]', 'Mammary Adenocarcinoma (SKBr-3)', '[Se]-Methylselenocysteine']",,,,['T35 OD010432/OD/NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['NIHMS670252'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the inhibitory effects of the HSP90 ATPase inhibitor AUY922 on 32D mouse hematopoietic cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl (b3a2, 32Dp210) and mutant Bcr-Abl imatinib (IM)-resistant cell lines. Western blotting results of fractions from gel filtration column chromatography of 32Dp210 cells showed that HSP90 together with Bcr-Abl, Jak2 Stat3 and several other proteins co-eluted in peak column fractions of a high molecular weight network complex (HMWNC). Co-IP results showed that HSP90 directly bound to Bcr-Abl, Jak2, Stat 3 and Akt. The associations between HSP90 and Bcr-Abl or Bcr-Abl kinase domain mutants (T315I and E255K) were interrupted by AUY922 treatment. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Bcr-Abl showed a dose-dependent decrease in 32Dp210T315I following AUY922 treatment for 16h. AUY922 also markedly inhibited cell proliferation of both IM-sensitive 32Dp210 (IC50 =6 nM) and IM-resistant 32Dp210T315I cells (IC50 approximately 6 nM) and human KBM-5R/KBM-7R cell lines (IC50 =50 nM). AUY922 caused significant G1 arrest in 32Dp210 cells but not in T315I or E255K cells. AUY922 efficiently induced apoptosis in 32Dp210 (IC50 =10 nM) and T315I or E255K lines with IC50 around 20 to 50 nM. Our results showed that Bcr-Abl and Jak2 form HMWNC with HSP90 in CML cells. Inhibition of HSP90 by AUY922 disrupted the structure of HMWNC, leading to Bcr-Abl degradation, nhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Thus, inhibition of HSP90 is a powerful way to inhibit not only IM-sensitive CML cells but also IM-resistant CML cells.","['Tao, Wenjing', 'Chakraborty, Sandip N', 'Leng, Xiaohong', 'Ma, Helen', 'Arlinghaus, Ralph B']","['Tao W', 'Chakraborty SN', 'Leng X', 'Ma H', 'Arlinghaus RB']","['Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Translational Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Cancer,Genes & cancer,101516546,,,,2015/03/31 06:00,2015/03/31 06:01,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:01 [medline]']","['49 [pii]', '10.18632/genesandcancer.49 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Cancer. 2015 Jan;6(1-2):19-29. doi: 10.18632/genesandcancer.49.,,PMC4362481,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcr-Abl', 'CML', 'HSP90', 'apoptosis', 'gel filtration']",,,,"['P01 CA049639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our previous studies showed that workers exposed to benzene and FA exhibit increased levels of aneuploidy in their blood cells. As centrosome amplification is a common phenomenon in human cancers, including leukemia, and is associated with aneuploidy in carcinogenesis, we hypothesized that benzene and FA would induce centrosome amplification in vitro. We treated human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells with a range of concentrations of hydroquinone (HQ, a benzene metabolite) or FA for 24 h, allowed the cells to recover in fresh medium for 24 h, and examined centrosome amplification; chromosomal gain, loss, and breakage; and cytotoxicity. We included melphalan and etoposide, chemotherapeutic drugs that cause therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and that have been shown to induce centrosome amplification as well as chromosomal aneuploidy and breakage, as positive controls. Melphalan and etoposide induced centrosome amplification and chromosome gain and breakage in a dose-dependent manner, at cytotoxic concentrations. HQ, though cytotoxic, did not induce centrosome amplification or any chromosomal aberration. FA-induced centrosome amplification and cytotoxicity, but did not induce chromosomal aberrations. Our data suggest, for the first time, that centrosome amplification is a potential mechanism underlying FA-induced leukemogenesis, but not benzene-induced leukemogenesis, as mediated through HQ.

We investigated the effects of prolonged exposure to L-asparaginase on antithrombin (AT), fibrinogen and mannan-binding-lectin (MBL) levels, and on the occurrence of thrombotic events (TE) and febrile neutropenia episodes (FN) in pediatric patients. PROCEDURE: Protein levels were measured in 97 children during 30 weeks of chemotherapy with L-asparaginase and up to 1 year following remission. TE and FN episodes were recorded during this period. RESULTS: Median AT level decreased from 0.96 IU/mL prior to treatment (range: 0.69-1.38) to 0.55 IU/mL (0.37-0.76) during therapy. Fibrinogen and MBL decreased from 3.18 g/L (1.29-7.28) and 1,177 ng/mL (57-5,343) to 1.56 g/L (0.84-2.13) and 193 ng/mL (57-544), respectively. All three proteins had recovered 1-4 weeks after L-asparaginase cessation. TE were reported in 22 (23%) patients. Of these, 11 occurred after a median of 10 administrations of L-asparaginase. Fifty-one FN were associated with infections, of which 36 occurred during treatment with L-asparaginase. Patients with low levels of MBL at diagnosis were at higher risk of FN associated with infections (RR = 1.59, 95%CI: 1.026-2.474). Both AT and MBL decreases were moderately correlated with fibrinogen (r = 0.51 and 0.58, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Children with ALL are exposed to significant decrease in AT, fibrinogen and MBL levels, and concomitant increased risk of thrombosis and FN with infection during L-asparaginase treatment. Measuring plasma levels of these liver-derived proteins could help predict the occurrence of adverse events.","['Merlen, Clemence', 'Bonnefoy, Arnaud', 'Wagner, Eric', 'Dedeken, Laurence', 'Leclerc, Jean-Marie', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Rivard, Georges-Etienne']","['Merlen C', 'Bonnefoy A', 'Wagner E', 'Dedeken L', 'Leclerc JM', 'Laverdiere C', 'Rivard GE']","['Division of Hematology / Oncology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology / Oncology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Immunology / Histocompatibility laboratory, CHU de Quebec and Department of Microbiology, Infectious Diseases and Immunology, Laval University, Quebec, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hopital Universitaire des Enfants Reine Fabiola, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium.', 'Division of Hematology / Oncology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology / Oncology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology / Oncology, CHU Sainte-Justine, Montreal, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antithrombins)', '0 (Mannose-Binding Lectin)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Antithrombins/*blood', 'Asparaginase/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Febrile Neutropenia/etiology', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mannose-Binding Lectin/*blood', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood', 'Thrombosis/*etiology']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25515 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Aug;62(8):1381-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25515.

Here, we describe a 2-year-old patient with a previously undescribed phenotype including right ventricular cardiomyopathy, progeroid features, and premature death. Sequencing of LMNA revealed a novel heterozygous de novo mutation p.L306R located in the alpha-helical rod domain of A-type lamins. Fibroblasts from the patient showed reduced proliferation and early premature replicative senescence, as characterized by progressive hyperlobulation of the nuclei, abnormally clustered centromeres, loss of lamin B1, and reorganization of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. Furthermore, the patient cells were more sensitive to double-strand DNA breaks. Similar structural and phenotypic defects were observed in normal fibroblasts transfected with FLAG-tagged p.L306R lamin A. Correspondingly, in vitro assembly studies revealed that the p.L306R generates a ""hyper-assembly"" mutant of lamin A that forms extensive fiber arrays under physiological conditions where wild-type lamin A is still largely soluble. In summary, we report a novel LMNA p.L306R mutation that leads to previously undescribed hyper-assembly of lamin A, heavy distortion of nuclear shape and that manifests as right ventricular cardiomyopathy and premature aging.","['Alastalo, Tero-Pekka', 'West, Gun', 'Li, Song-Ping', 'Keinanen, Anni', 'Helenius, Mikko', 'Tyni, Tiina', 'Lapatto, Risto', 'Turanlahti, Maila', 'Heikkila, Paivi', 'Kaariainen, Helena', 'Laakso, Markku', 'Mauermann, Monika', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Pihkala, Jaana', 'Taimen, Pekka']","['Alastalo TP', 'West G', 'Li SP', 'Keinanen A', 'Helenius M', 'Tyni T', 'Lapatto R', 'Turanlahti M', 'Heikkila P', 'Kaariainen H', 'Laakso M', 'Mauermann M', 'Herrmann H', 'Pihkala J', 'Taimen P']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", 'Blueprint Genetics, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'MediCity Research Laboratory, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'MediCity Research Laboratory, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'MediCity Research Laboratory, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.', ""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", ""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", ""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", ""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", 'Department of Pathology, Helsinki Central University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'National Institute of Health and Welfare, Finland, and Department of Clinical Genetics, Helsinki University Central Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Functional Architecture of the Cell Group, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Functional Architecture of the Cell Group, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', ""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", 'Department of Pathology, University of Turku and Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'MediCity Research Laboratory, University of Turku, Turku, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Mutat,Human mutation,9215429,"['0 (LMNA protein, human)', '0 (Lamin Type A)']",IM,"['Aging, Premature/*genetics', 'Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Dysplasia/*genetics/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', '*Genetic Association Studies', 'Humans', 'Lamin Type A/*genetics', 'Male', 'Phenotype', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', '*Sequence Deletion']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/03/24 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/humu.22793 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mutat. 2015 Jul;36(7):694-703. doi: 10.1002/humu.22793.

To explore the impact of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage on mitochondrial (mt) function and viability of AML cells, we screened a panel of DNA damaging chemotherapeutic agents to identify drugs that could damage mtDNA. We identified bleomycin as an agent that damaged mtDNA in AML cells at concentrations that induced cell death. Bleomycin also induced mtDNA damage in primary AML samples. Consistent with the observed mtDNA damage, bleomycin reduced mt mass and basal oxygen consumption in AML cells. We also demonstrated that the observed mtDNA damage was functionally important for bleomycin-induced cell death. Finally, bleomycin delayed tumor growth in xenograft mouse models of AML and anti-leukemic concentrations of the drug induced mtDNA damage in AML cells preferentially over normal lung tissue. Taken together, mtDNA-targeted therapy may be an effective strategy to target AML cells and bleomycin could be useful in the treatment of this disease.","['Yeung, ManTek', 'Hurren, Rose', 'Nemr, Carine', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Hershenfeld, Samantha', 'Gronda, Marcela', 'Liyanage, Sanduni', 'Wu, Yan', 'Augustine, Jeevan', 'Lee, Eric A', 'Spagnuolo, Paul A', 'Southall, Noel', 'Chen, Catherine', 'Zheng, Wei', 'Jeyaraju, Danny V', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Laposa, Rebecca', 'Schimmer, Aaron D']","['Yeung M', 'Hurren R', 'Nemr C', 'Wang X', 'Hershenfeld S', 'Gronda M', 'Liyanage S', 'Wu Y', 'Augustine J', 'Lee EA', 'Spagnuolo PA', 'Southall N', 'Chen C', 'Zheng W', 'Jeyaraju DV', 'Minden MD', 'Laposa R', 'Schimmer AD']","['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Room 7-116, 610 University Ave, Toronto, ON, M5G 2M9, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Apoptosis,Apoptosis : an international journal on programmed cell death,9712129,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bleomycin/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/*metabolism', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Transplantation']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/01/05 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s10495-015-1119-z [doi]'],ppublish,Apoptosis. 2015 Jun;20(6):811-20. doi: 10.1007/s10495-015-1119-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of novel anticancer small molecule has gained remarkable interest over the last decade. In this study, we synthesized and investigated the ability of a tetracyclic-condensed quinoline compound, 4-butylaminopyrimido[4',5':4,5]thieno(2,3-b)quinoline (BPTQ), to interact with double-stranded DNA and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. METHODS: Circular dichroism, topological studies, molecular docking, absorbance, and fluorescence spectral titrations were employed to study the interaction of BPTQ with DNA. Cytotoxicity was studied by performing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay. Further, cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry, annexin V staining, mitochondrial membrane potential assay, DNA fragmentation, and western blot analysis were used to elucidate the mechanism of action of BPTQ at the cellular level. RESULTS: Spectral, topological, and docking studies confirmed that BPTQ is a typical intercalator of DNA. BPTQ induces dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cancer cells by arresting cells at S and G2/M phase. Further, BPTQ activates the mitochondria-mediated apoptosis pathway, as explicated by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, increase in the Bax:Bcl-2 ratio, and activation of caspases. CONCLUSION: These results confirmed that BPTQ is a DNA intercalative anticancer molecule, which could aid in the development of future cancer therapeutic agents.","['RohitKumar, Heggodu G', 'Asha, Kittur R', 'Raghavan, Sathees C', 'Advi Rao, Gopal M']","['RohitKumar HG', 'Asha KR', 'Raghavan SC', 'Advi Rao GM']","['Department of Biochemistry, Davangere University, Davangere, Karnataka, India.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'E66400VT9R (quinoline)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Melanoma, Experimental', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Quinolines/*pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00280-015-2735-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2015 Jun;75(6):1121-33. doi: 10.1007/s00280-015-2735-6.

A NOPHO-AML study.,859-67,10.1111/bjh.13366 [doi],"The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of myeloid leukaemia was revised in 2008. It incorporates newly recognized entities and emphasizes the pivotal role of cytogenetic abnormalities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usability of the WHO classification when applied to a large population-based paediatric acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) cohort. We included children diagnosed with de novo AML, 0-18 years of age from the Nordic countries and Hong Kong from 1993 to 2012. Data were retrieved from the Nordic Society for Paediatric Haematology and Oncology AML database and patients classified according to the WHO 2008 classification. A successful karyotype was available in 97% of the cases. AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities were present in 262 (41%) and 94 (15%) were classified as AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MDS). WHO classifies patients with monosomy 7 and del(7q) into one group. We found that -7 (n = 14) had significantly poorer outcome than del(7q) (n = 11); 5-year event-free survival 26% vs. 67%, (P = 0.02), and 5-year overall survival 51% vs. 90%, (P = 0.04). The largest group was the highly heterogeneous AML not otherwise specified (NOS) (n = 280) (44%). In conclusion, the WHO classification allocated 15% to AML-MDS, 44% to NOS and grouped together entities with clearly different outcome, therefore limiting the applicability of the current WHO classification in children with AML.","['Sandahl, Julie D', 'Kjeldsen, Eigil', 'Abrahamsson, Jonas', 'Ha, Shau-Yin', 'Heldrup, Jesper', 'Jahnukainen, Kirsi', 'Jonsson, Olafur G', 'Lausen, Birgitte', 'Palle, Josefine', 'Zeller, Bernward', 'Forestier, Erik', 'Hasle, Henrik']","['Sandahl JD', 'Kjeldsen E', 'Abrahamsson J', 'Ha SY', 'Heldrup J', 'Jahnukainen K', 'Jonsson OG', 'Lausen B', 'Palle J', 'Zeller B', 'Forestier E', 'Hasle H']","['Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Cancer Cytogenetics Laboratory, Department of Haematology Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', ""Institution for Clinical Sciences, Department of Paediatrics, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Queen Mary Hospital and Hong Kong Paediatric Haematology & Oncology Study Group (HKPHOSG), Hong Kong, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', ""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland."", 'Department of Paediatrics, Landspitalinn, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden."", 'Department of Paediatric Medicine, Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Medical Biosciences, Clinical Genetics, Umea University Hospital, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Aarhus University Hospital Skejby, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/methods', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/mortality', '*Pediatrics', 'Scandinavian and Nordic Countries']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13366 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Jun;169(6):859-67. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13366.

Physiologic changes of pregnancy also commonly lead to mimicking symptoms of haematologic disease that may prompt investigations for haematologic disease. The toxicity and radiation associated with the diagnostic imaging and pharmacologic management of both benign and malignant haematological conditions during pregnancy present unique challenges. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment must weigh the benefits and risks to the mother while also taking foetal outcome into consideration. In this review, we highlight the common haematologic diseases encountered by obstetricians and try to provide guidance for the most prevalent diagnostic and therapeutic questions. At the other end of the spectrum, we also comment on less common but very challenging haematologic diseases in pregnancy that require multidisciplinary effort to arrive at difficult individual diagnostic and treatment decisions.","['Rodger, Marc', 'Sheppard, Dawn', 'Gandara, Esteban', 'Tinmouth, Alan']","['Rodger M', 'Sheppard D', 'Gandara E', 'Tinmouth A']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada; Ottawa Blood Disease Centre, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, Canada; Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa, Canada.

Because serum TK was not available, a slightly modified version of the model based on seven instead of eight prognostic variables was used. By German index, 62.9% of patients were scored as having low-risk CLL (score 0-2), whereas 37.1% had intermediate-risk CLL (score 3-5). This stratification translated into a significant difference in the TTFT [HR = 4.21; 95% C.I. (2.71-6.53); P < 0.0001]. Also the 2007 MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) score, barely based on traditional clinical parameters, showed comparable reliability [HR = 2.73; 95% C.I. (1.79-4.17); P < 0.0001]. A comparative performance assessment between the two models revealed that prediction of the TTFT was more accurate with German score. The c-statistic of the MDACC model was 0.65 (range, 0.53-0.78) a level below that of the German index [0.71 (range, 0.60-0.82)] and below the accepted 0.7 threshold necessary to have value at the individual patient level. Results of this external comparative validation analysis strongly support the German score as the benchmark for comparison of any novel prognostic scheme aimed at evaluating the TTFT in patients with early CLL even when a modified version which does not include TK is utilized.","['Molica, Stefano', 'Giannarelli, Diana', 'Mirabelli, Rosanna', 'Levato, Luciano', 'Russo, Antonio', 'Linardi, Maria', 'Gentile, Massimo', 'Morabito, Fortunato']","['Molica S', 'Giannarelli D', 'Mirabelli R', 'Levato L', 'Russo A', 'Linardi M', 'Gentile M', 'Morabito F']","['Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Biostatistic Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena, Roma, Italy.', 'Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.', 'Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera di Cosenza, Cosenza, Italy.', 'Department Hematology-Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera di Cosenza, Cosenza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Germany', 'Humans', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Thymidine Kinase/*blood']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/10/11 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2015/02/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12550 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2016 Jan;96(1):72-7. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12550.

Low activity phenotypes are correlated with polymorphism in the TPMT gene. Patients with low or undetectable TMPT activity could develop severe myelosuppression when they are treated with standard doses of thiopurine drugs. Since ethnic differences in the TPMT gene polymorphism have been demonstrated worldwide, assessing it in the Libyan population is worthwhile. METHODS: We investigated TPMT gene polymorphism in a total of 246 Libyan healthy adult blood donors from three different Libyan regions (Tripoli, Yefren, and Tawargha) and 50 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). We used polymerase chain reaction restriction length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and allele-specific PCR-based assays to analyse the TPMT gene for the variants *2 c.238 G>C, *3A (c.460 G>A and c.719 A>G), *3B (c.460 G>A), and *3C (c.719 A>G). RESULTS: Our results show that the TPMT variants associated with low enzymatic activity were detected in 3.25% (8 in 246) of adult Libyan individuals and the frequency of total mutant alleles was 1.63%. Heterozygous genotypes were TPMT*3A in three subjects (0.61%) and TPMT*3C in five subjects (1.02%). No TPMT*2 and TPMT*3B allelic variants and no homozygous or compound heterozygous mutant alleles were detected. The normal allele (wild-type) was found in 98.4% of the adult individuals studied. No mutant alleles were detected among the 50 children who had ALL. CONCLUSIONS: We report on the presence of the TPMT*3C and *3A mutant alleles in the Libyan population. Therefore, monitoring the patients to be treated with doses of thiopurine drugs for TPMT variants is worthwhile to avoid the development of severe myelosuppression.","['Zeglam, Hamza Ben', 'Benhamer, Abdrazak', 'Aboud, Adel', 'Rtemi, Haitem', 'Mattardi, Meftah', 'Saleh, Saleh Suleiman', 'Bashein, Abdullah', 'Enattah, Nabil']","['Zeglam HB', 'Benhamer A', 'Aboud A', 'Rtemi H', 'Mattardi M', 'Saleh SS', 'Bashein A', 'Enattah N']","['Department of Genetic Engineering, Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli, Libya.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli, Libya.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli, Libya.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli, Libya.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli, Libya.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli, Libya.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tripoli, Tripoli, Libya.', 'Department of Genetic Engineering, Biotechnology Research Center (BTRC), Twisha, Tripoli, Libya; nabil.enattah@btrc.ly; nabil.enattah@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Libyan J Med,The Libyan journal of medicine,101299403,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Alleles', 'Blood Donors/*statistics & numerical data', 'DNA Primers', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Libya/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Methyltransferases/analysis/*genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/09/30 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/30 06:00 [medline]']","['27053 [pii]', '10.3402/ljm.v10.27053 [doi]']",epublish,Libyan J Med. 2015 Mar 26;10:27053. doi: 10.3402/ljm.v10.27053. eCollection 2015.,20150326,PMC4376936,['NOTNLM'],"['TPMT gene', 'acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'polymorphisms', 'thiopurine drugs']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a correlation between AZA dose and infection complications has never been studied. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Higher-risk patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia treated with AZA in 18 Israeli hospitals between the years 2008 and 2011 were included in a former national survey. To reveal the effect of AZA dosage on infection risk we limited our analysis to the infection rate after the first AZA dose alone. We excluded subsequent cycles of AZA from the analysis, because infectious events during these cycles might be related to other cofactors such as disease response to AZA therapy. RESULTS: After the first AZA cycle, infectious events were more frequent after doses of 75 mg/m(2) for 7 days than 75 mg/m(2) for 5 days (36/106 [34%] and 10/67 [14.9%], respectively; P = .008), regardless of the patient's age. Of the 46 recorded infectious events, the causative pathogen was identified as bacterial in 25 (54.3%) and as viral or fungal in 2 (4.3%) and 2 (4.3%) cases, respectively. No pathogen was identified in 17 (37%) cases. Infections were significantly more prevalent among patients who presented with platelet counts < 20,000 (43.6% vs. 23.6%; P = .012) and poor risk cytogenetics (40.7% vs. 19.8%; P = .008). CONCLUSION: Reduction of AZA dose might decrease infection rate and therefore should be considered in patients with high infection risk.","['Ofran, Yishai', 'Filanovsky, Kalman', 'Gafter-Gvili, Anat', 'Vidal, Liat', 'Aviv, Ariel', 'Gatt, Moshe E', 'Silbershatz, Itay', 'Herishanu, Yair', 'Arad, Ariela', 'Tadmor, Tamar', 'Dally, Najib', 'Nemets, Anatoly', 'Rouvio, Ory', 'Ronson, Aharon', 'Herzog-Tzarfati, Katrin', 'Akria, Luiza', 'Braester, Andrei', 'Hellmann, Ilana', 'Yeganeh, Shay', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Leiba, Ronit', 'Mittelman, Moshe', 'Merkel, Drorit']","['Ofran Y', 'Filanovsky K', 'Gafter-Gvili A', 'Vidal L', 'Aviv A', 'Gatt ME', 'Silbershatz I', 'Herishanu Y', 'Arad A', 'Tadmor T', 'Dally N', 'Nemets A', 'Rouvio O', 'Ronson A', 'Herzog-Tzarfati K', 'Akria L', 'Braester A', 'Hellmann I', 'Yeganeh S', 'Nagler A', 'Leiba R', 'Mittelman M', 'Merkel D']","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Rambam Health Care Campus, Haifa, Israel; Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel.

MYD88 L265P was found in 49/51 (96%) LPL cases and in 1/13 (7.6%) MZL (splenic type), whereas all CLL samples remained negative. The two MYD88 wild type LPL cases were associated with cold agglutinin disease. Mutations in CXCR4 were detected in 17/47 (36.2%) LPL cases, which showed a higher extent of BM infiltration and lower leucocyte counts (P = 0.02), haemoglobin (P = 0.05) and platelet counts (P = 0.01). In conclusion the detection of MYD88 L265P mutation in FFPE samples is reliable and useful for subtyping small B-cell lymphomas in BM biopsies. In addition, the presence of CXCR4 mutations identifies a subgroup of LPL patients with higher disease activity.","['Schmidt, Janine', 'Federmann, Birgit', 'Schindler, Natalie', 'Steinhilber, Julia', 'Bonzheim, Irina', 'Fend, Falko', 'Quintanilla-Martinez, Leticia']","['Schmidt J', 'Federmann B', 'Schindler N', 'Steinhilber J', 'Bonzheim I', 'Fend F', 'Quintanilla-Martinez L']","['Institute of Pathology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Eberhard-Karls-University, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Eberhard-Karls-University, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Eberhard-Karls-University, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Eberhard-Karls-University, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Eberhard-Karls-University, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Eberhard-Karls-University, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology and Comprehensive Cancer Centre, Eberhard-Karls-University, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*genetics', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*diagnosis/*genetics']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/08/08 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/08 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13361 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Jun;169(6):795-803. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13361.

The main complication is infection, whose risk increases with the depth and duration of the neutropenia. Comprehensive etiological investigations are mandatory to determine the best treatment strategy. Constitutional neutropenia is rarely seen in everyday rheumatology practice. It predominantly affects patients of African descent and is usually moderate and well tolerated. Congenital neutropenia due to genetic abnormalities is severe and chiefly seen in the pediatric population. Most cases of neutropenia in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are acquired. Medications are the most common causes, making detailed history-taking crucial. Many medications used to treat RA can induce neutropenia. Folic acid deficiency should be sought routinely in patients taking methotrexate. A less common cause of neutropenia is an RA-related autoimmune reaction. Splenomegaly suggests Felty's syndrome, which is accompanied with large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia in 40% of cases. The treatment depends on the depth of the neutropenia and findings from the etiological workup. A neutrophil count below 0.5g/L, a fever, and the presence of clinical signs indicate a life-threatening condition requiring emergent treatment. In other patients, the first step is immediate discontinuation of any possibly involved drugs, simultaneously with the etiological workup.","['Lazaro, Estibaliz', 'Morel, Jacques']","['Lazaro E', 'Morel J']","['Service de medecine interne, hopital du Haut-Leveque, universite de Bordeaux, 33604 Pessac, France.

The goals of this study were to aggregate a geriatric approach to the patient assessment, to show the impact of gender, age, hemoglobin concentration and comorbidities on the functionality of elderly with myeloid neoplasms and to better understand how the instruments of functional assessment work according to the aggressiveness of the disease. METHODS: Elderly patients (>/=60 years old) with myeloid neoplasms were assessed using the Karnofsky scale, Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group scale, and basic and instrumental activities of daily living scales. The hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index assessed the comorbidities. A mixed logistical regression model was fitted to estimate the impact of gender, age, hemoglobin concentration and the hematopoietic cell transplantation-comorbidity index on patients' functionality. RESULTS: Eighty-two patients with a mean age of 72.8 years (range: 60-92 years) were evaluated. Eighty percent had good Karnofsky and Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group scales and 39% were independent according to the daily living activity scales. All of the patients with poor Karnofsky and Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group scales were classified as dependent by the daily living activity scales. The mixed logistic regression models showed that age, gender, hemoglobin concentration and the comorbidity index impacted on the daily living activity scales. Karnofsky and Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group scales were affected by hemoglobin and the comorbidity index. The model hypothesized the hemoglobin concentration at which there was a higher risk of poor Karnofsky and Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group scales. This hemoglobin concentration depended on comorbidities and on the aggressiveness of the myeloid neoplasm. CONCLUSION: The geriatric approach improved the sensitivity and specificity of the patients' assessment. Hemoglobin concentration associated to the risk of poor Karnofsky and Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group scales depended on the comorbidity score and on the disease aggressiveness. The Karnofsky and Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group scales had higher sensitivity in patients with more aggressive diseases.","['Carbonell, Ana Lucia Ippolito', 'Salhab, Renata Maceu', 'Giampaoli, Viviana', 'Cendoroglo, Maysa Seabra', 'Chauffaille, Maria de Lourdes']","['Carbonell AL', 'Salhab RM', 'Giampaoli V', 'Cendoroglo MS', 'Chauffaille Mde L']","['Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil.

METHODS: Uterine tissues were collected from pregnant (n=30) and pseudopregnant mice (n=30) during the peri-implantation period. The distributions of macrophages, iNOS and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) were determined by immunohistochemistry and the correlations of macrophages with iNOS and LIF were analyzed. RESULTS: Macrophages were located mainly in the endometrium before D4.5 in the pregnant rats with D0.5 defined as the morning when a vaginal plug was observed. After D4.5, the macrophages was significantly reduced in number (P<0.05) in the endometrium and gradually migrated to the perimetrium. In the psudopregnant mice, macrophages were located mainly in the endometrium. Before D4.5, iNOS-positive cells were detected mainly in the endometrium and the myometrium in the pregnant rats and became significantly reduced on D4.5 (P<0.05); in the pseudopregnant mice, the positive cells were mostly detected in the endometrium. Significant differences were found in the distribution of the macrophages and LIF between the implantation and non-implantation sites (P=0.013). LIF was mostly located in the endometrium in the pregnant mice but scarcely detected in the pseudopregnant mice. CONCLUSION: Macrophages are located mainly in the endometrium and the implantation site where iNOS and LIF are expressed, suggesting the important role of macrophages in the determination of implantation.","['Gao, Ruihua', 'Chen, Leining', 'Tan, Wenya', 'Tan, Hongchuan', 'Ou, Xianghong', 'Li, Hong', 'Quan, Song']","['Gao R', 'Chen L', 'Tan W', 'Tan H', 'Ou X', 'Li H', 'Quan S']","['Center for Reproductive Medicine, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.E-mail: gaoruihua.hi@163.com.']",['chi'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",China,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao,Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,101266132,"['0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nos2 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Cell Count', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Endometrium/cytology', 'Female', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*cytology', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II/metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Uterus/*cytology']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nan Fang Yi Ke Da Xue Xue Bao. 2015 Mar;35(3):365-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prevalence of infection in Canadian dairy herds is high and continues to increase; however, there has not been a national program to control BLV. This cross-sectional study was conducted to identify potentially important risk factors for BLV infection on Canadian dairy herds, which is a prerequisite to developing an effective control program. During 1998-2003, based on a stratified two-stage random sampling process, 315 dairy farms from seven provinces of Canada were selected. Within each farm, 9-45 cows were bled and tested with a commercial serum ELISA kit for BLV antibodies. A comprehensive questionnaire, targeting potentially important herd-level management indicators, was successfully administered in 272 herds. A zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) regression model was fit to the resulting data to assess the potential associations between BLV seropositivity and a variety of herd-level factors. Seventy-eight percent of the herds were identified as BLV-positive (had one or more test positive animals). In the negative-binomial part of the final ZINB model, herds with clinical cases of leukosis during the 12 months prior to sampling, as well as herds which purchased animals with unknown BLV infection status in the last five years, had a significantly larger proportion of BLV positive animals. Based on a significant interaction between two of the risk factors, changing gloves between cows during pregnancy examination was not statistically associated with lower proportion of infected cows compared with not changing gloves, in the western Canadian provinces. In the logistic part of the model, herds from eastern Canadian provinces and those not purchasing cows in the last five years had increased odds of being free from BLV. The high prevalence of infection across Canada should be addressed through the development and implementation of a nationwide control program which will address the regional and herd-level risk factors for BLV infection identified in this study.","['Nekouei, Omid', 'VanLeeuwen, John', 'Sanchez, Javier', 'Kelton, David', 'Tiwari, Ashwani', 'Keefe, Greg']","['Nekouei O', 'VanLeeuwen J', 'Sanchez J', 'Kelton D', 'Tiwari A', 'Keefe G']","['Department of Health Management, Atlantic Veterinary College, University of Prince Edward Island, Charlottetown, PE, Canada C1A 4P3.

Induction of apoptosis by HCMV is unusual because HCMV utilizes various strategies to prevent apoptosis in infected cells in order to delay cell death and maintain viral replication. Here we show that HCMV can infect the acute leukemia cell lines Kasumi-1 (AML) and SD-1 (BCR-ABL-positive ALL), which inhibited their proliferation and induced apoptosis in almost all cells after 14 days. Although HCMV induced a significant up-regulation of the anti-apoptotic gene cFLIP and the anti-stress gene Gadd45a, and simultaneously down-regulated the pro-apoptotic genes p53, Gadd45gamma in Kasumi-1 and SD-1 cells, we found that these anti-apoptotic mechanisms failed in HCMV-infected acute leukemia cells and apoptosis occurred via a caspase-dependent pathway. We conclude that HCMV can provide anti-leukemic effects in vitro. To determine if this phenomenon may be clinically relevant further investigations will be required.","['Koldehoff, Michael', 'Lindemann, Monika', 'Opalka, Bertram', 'Bauer, Sebastian', 'Ross, Rudolf Stefan', 'Elmaagacli, Ahmet H']","['Koldehoff M', 'Lindemann M', 'Opalka B', 'Bauer S', 'Ross RS', 'Elmaagacli AH']","['a Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation , West German Cancer Center , Essen , Germany.', 'b Institute for Transfusion Medicine , Essen , Germany.', 'c Department of Hematology , West German Cancer Center , Essen , Germany.', 'd Department of Medical Oncology , West German Cancer Center , Essen , Germany.', 'e Institute of Virology, University Hospital of Essen , Essen , Germany.', 'a Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation , West German Cancer Center , Essen , Germany.', 'f Department of Oncology and Hematology , HELIOS Schwerin , Schwerin , Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis/genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytomegalovirus/*physiology', 'Gene Silencing', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/virology', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics', 'Leukemia', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Toll-Like Receptor 9/genetics', '*Virus Activation']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/09/10 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2015.1032968 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(11):3189-97. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2015.1032968.

Owing to the very small number of LSCs in leukemia cells, xenotransplantation studies are difficult in terms of functionally and pathophysiologically replicating clinical conditions of cell culture experiments. There is currently a limited number of lead compounds that target LSCs. Using the LSC-xenograft zebrafish screening method we previously developed, we found that the fluorescent compound 3,3'-dipentyloxacarbocyanine iodide (DiOC5(3)) selectively marked LSCs and suppressed their proliferation in vivo and in vitro. DiOC5(3) had no obvious toxicity to human umbilical cord blood CD34+ progenitor cells and normal zebrafish. It accumulated in mitochondria through organic anion transporter polypeptides that are overexpressed in the plasma membrane of LSCs, and induced apoptosis via ROS overproduction. DiOC5(3) also inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB through the downregulation of LSC-selective pathways, as indicated from DNA microarray analysis. In summary, DiOC5(3) is a new type of anti-LSC compound available for diagnostic imaging and therapeutics that has the advantage of being a single fluorescent chemical.","['Zhang, Beibei', 'Shimada, Yasuhito', 'Kuroyanagi, Junya', 'Ariyoshi, Michiko', 'Nomoto, Tsuyoshi', 'Shintou, Taichi', 'Umemoto, Noriko', 'Nishimura, Yuhei', 'Miyazaki, Takeshi', 'Tanaka, Toshio']","['Zhang B', 'Shimada Y', 'Kuroyanagi J', 'Ariyoshi M', 'Nomoto T', 'Shintou T', 'Umemoto N', 'Nishimura Y', 'Miyazaki T', 'Tanaka T']","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Department of Systems Pharmacology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Mie University Medical Zebrafish Research Center, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Department of Bioinformatics, Mie University Life Science Research Center, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Department of Omics Medicine, Mie University Industrial Technology Innovation, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Corporate R&D Headquarters, Canon Inc, Ohta-ku, Tokyo 146-8501, Japan.', 'Corporate R&D Headquarters, Canon Inc, Ohta-ku, Tokyo 146-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Department of Systems Pharmacology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Department of Systems Pharmacology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Mie University Medical Zebrafish Research Center, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Department of Bioinformatics, Mie University Life Science Research Center, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Department of Omics Medicine, Mie University Industrial Technology Innovation, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.', 'Corporate R&D Headquarters, Canon Inc, Ohta-ku, Tokyo 146-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacoinformatics, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Department of Systems Pharmacology, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Mie University Medical Zebrafish Research Center, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Department of Bioinformatics, Mie University Life Science Research Center, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan; Department of Omics Medicine, Mie University Industrial Technology Innovation, 2-174 Edobashi, Tsu, Mie 514-8507, Japan.

Ibrutinib and idelalisib block B-cell receptor signaling through inhibition of Bruton tyrosine kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase delta molecules respectively, interfering with several pathways required for leukemia cell survival. Idelalisib has shown efficacy in the relapsed setting and is currently approved by the FDA for use in combination with rituximab. Ibrutinib has been studied in patients with relapsed CLL and as frontline therapy. In the relapsed setting, these agents produce durable remissions, and might be preferable to re-treatment with chemoimmunotherapy for many patients. Ibrutinib is also effective treatment for patients with deletion 17p and is approved by the FDA as frontline therapy in this patient group, although it does not appear to completely abrogate this adverse prognostic factor. These agents have a unique side effect profile and longer follow-up is required to further understand tolerability and rare adverse effects. Obinutuzumab is a type-2 monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody which results in direct and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of leukemia cells. It is approved by the FDA for use in combination with chlorambucil, and has shown efficacy in the frontline setting in patients unfit for more intensive chemoimmunotherapy.

Therefore, we studied the development of second malignancies in 868 patients diagnosed with CML between 2002 and 2011 using the Swedish CML register, cross-linked to the Swedish Cancer register. With a median follow-up of 3.7 (range 0-9.9) years, 65 (7.5%) patients developed 75 second malignancies (non-haematological), 52 of which were of the invasive type. Compared to expected rates in the background population, the risk of second malignancies was higher in the CML cohort, with a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 1.52 (95% CI 1.13-1.99). The SIR before and after the second year following diagnosis of CML was 1.58 and 1.47, respectively. Among specific cancer types, gastrointestinal and nose and throat cancer were significantly increased. Founded on a population-based material, our results indicate that CML patients treated in the TKI era are at an increased risk of developing a second malignancy, with indications that this risk may more likely be linked to CML itself rather than to the TKI treatment.","['Gunnarsson, Niklas', 'Stenke, Leif', 'Hoglund, Martin', 'Sandin, Fredrik', 'Bjorkholm, Magnus', 'Dreimane, Arta', 'Lambe, Mats', 'Markevarn, Berit', 'Olsson-Stromberg, Ulla', 'Richter, Johan', 'Wadenvik, Hans', 'Wallvik, Jonas', 'Sjalander, Anders']","['Gunnarsson N', 'Stenke L', 'Hoglund M', 'Sandin F', 'Bjorkholm M', 'Dreimane A', 'Lambe M', 'Markevarn B', 'Olsson-Stromberg U', 'Richter J', 'Wadenvik H', 'Wallvik J', 'Sjalander A']","['Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Haematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Science and Division of Haematology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Regional Cancer Centre, Uppsala-Orebro, Sweden.', 'Department of Haematology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Regional Cancer Centre, Uppsala-Orebro, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Medical Science and Division of Haematology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Haematology and Vascular Disorders, Skane University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Haematology, Sahlgrenska University Hospital, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/08/06 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/bjh.13346 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2015 Jun;169(5):683-8. doi: 10.1111/bjh.13346.

In order to clarify the relationship between the inhibition of differentiation and EGAM1N, we generated mouse MG1.19 ES cells stably expressing EGAM1N. Control transfectants with an empty vector formed relatively flattened cell colonies similar to those observed in parental MG1.19 cells. In contrast, Egam1n transfectants formed tightly aggregated cell colonies with increased localization of CDH1 at cell-to-cell interfaces. The protein levels of pluripotency factors, including TBX3 and SOX2, were also increased. The expression of Tbx3 transcripts was induced, although the level of Sox2 transcripts was almost unchanged. The expression of EGAM1N resulted in no obvious changes in the expression of genes encoding receptors, protein kinases, transcription factors, and their encoded proteins involved in the LIF-STAT3 signaling pathway. Alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker for the undifferentiated state, in Egam1n transfectants was exhibited in a clonal proliferation assay. When differentiation of Egam1n transfectants was induced, progression was prevented with increases in transcript levels of Pou5f1, Sox2, Nanog, Klf4, Tbx3, and their encoded proteins. However, Egam1n transfectants formed relatively flattened-cell layers as observed in the control, indicating that the expression of EGAM1N could not maintain LIF-independent self-renewal of ES cells. Overall, we suggest that expression of EGAM1N could inhibit differentiation, at least in part, by elevating the protein levels of pluripotency factors in MG1.19 ES cells.","['Sato, Shiori', 'Nakazawa, Masato', 'Kihara, Yumi', 'Kubo, Yusuke', 'Sato, Yuki', 'Kikuchi, Takahiro', 'Nonaka, Asumi', 'Sasaki, Akira', 'Iwashita, Jun', 'Murata, Jun', 'Hosaka, Masahiro', 'Kobayashi, Masayuki']","['Sato S', 'Nakazawa M', 'Kihara Y', 'Kubo Y', 'Sato Y', 'Kikuchi T', 'Nonaka A', 'Sasaki A', 'Iwashita J', 'Murata J', 'Hosaka M', 'Kobayashi M']","['Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan; Akita Research Institute of Food and Brewing, 4-26 Sanuki, Araya-machi, Akita 010-1623, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Bioresource Sciences, Akita Prefectural University, 241-438 Kaidohbatanishi, Shimoshinjohnakano, Akita 010-0195, Japan.

While acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients are highly responsive to retinoic acid (RA) therapy, kinase inhibitors have been gaining momentum as co-treatments with RA for non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML) differentiation therapies, especially as a means to treat relapsed or refractory AML patients. In this study GW5074 (a c-Raf inhibitor) and PP2 (a Src-family kinase inhibitor) enhanced RA-induced maturation of t(15;17)-negative myeloblastic leukemia cells and rescued response in RA-resistant cells. PD98059 (a MEK inhibitor) and Akti-1/2 (an Akt inhibitor) were less effective, but did tend to promote maturation-uncoupled G1/G0 arrest, while wortmannin (a PI3K inhibitor) did not enhance differentiation surface marker expression or growth arrest. PD98059 and Akti-1/2 did not enhance differentiation markers and have potential, antagonistic off-targets effects on the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), but neither could the AhR agonist 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ) rescue differentiation events in the RA-resistant cells. GW5074 rescued early CD38 expression in RA-resistant cells exhibiting an early block in differentiation before CD38 expression, while for RA-resistant cells with differentiation blocked later, PP2 rescued the later differentiation marker CD11b; but surprisingly, the combination of the two was not synergistic. Kinases c-Raf, Src-family kinases Lyn and Fgr, and PI3K display highly correlated signaling changes during RA treatment, while activation of traditional downstream targets (Akt, MEK/ERK), and even the surface marker CD38, were poorly correlated with c-Raf or Lyn during differentiation. This suggests that an interrelated kinase module involving c-Raf, PI3K, Lyn and perhaps Fgr functions in a nontraditional way during RA-induced maturation or during rescue of RA induction therapy using inhibitor co-treatment in RA-resistant leukemia cells.","['Jensen, Holly A', 'Bunaciu, Rodica P', 'Varner, Jeffrey D', 'Yen, Andrew']","['Jensen HA', 'Bunaciu RP', 'Varner JD', 'Yen A']","['School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.', 'School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (5-iodo-3-((3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxyphenyl)methylene)-2-indolinone)', '0 (AG 1879)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (proto-oncogene proteins c-fgr)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'CD11b Antigen/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'G1 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Phenols/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'src-Family Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0898-6568(15)00113-8 [pii]', '10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.03.014 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 2015 Aug;27(8):1666-75. doi: 10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.03.014.

GP130 transcripts were significantly upregulated after incubation with LIF or OSM for 24h. Expression of the STAT3 gene was stimulated only after incubation with LIF, but not OSM. SOCS3 showed significant upregulation for all time periods and the levels of PIAS3 were initially down- and after 24h upregulated. Furthermore, the major signaling components of the JAK/STAT pathway, GP130 and STAT3, and the kinase activation patterns of STAT3, were examined at protein level. We found constitutive protein expression for GP130, STAT3, pSTAT3(ser727) and upregulation of pSTAT3(tyr705) by LIF and OSM.

Pim&mdash;3 knockdown potently inhibited the growth of subcutaneously implanted glioblastoma cells in vivo. We further revealed that Pim&mdash;3 knockdown induced growth inhibition by reducing the levels of the anti&mdash;apoptotic protein Bcl&mdash;xl and cell cycle regulatory proteins, including cyclin D1 and Cdc25C, and increasing the levels of the pro&mdash;apoptotic protein Bax.","['Quan, J', 'Zhou, L', 'Qu, J']","['Quan J', 'Zhou L', 'Qu J']","['The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi&apos;an Jiao Tong University Department of Neurosurgery Xi&apos;an China.', 'The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi&apos;an Jiao Tong University Department of Neurosurgery Xi&apos;an China.', 'The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi&apos;an Jiao Tong University Department of Neurosurgery Xi&apos;an China lxgang_lxg&commat;163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand),"Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)",9216789,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '136601-57-5 (Cyclin D1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (PIM3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (cdc25 Phosphatases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Carcinogenesis/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Cyclin D1/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', '*Down-Regulation/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects/physiology', '*Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Glioblastoma/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Mice, Nude', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/pharmacology', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein/metabolism', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism', 'cdc25 Phosphatases/metabolism']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/05/05 06:00,['2015/03/31 06:00'],"['2014/12/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/05 06:00 [medline]']",,epublish,Cell Mol Biol (Noisy-le-grand). 2015 Mar 9;61(1):42-50.,20150309,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MAIN METHODS: Human MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were exposed to different concentrations of 5-Azac for 24 and 48h. RT-PCR was performed to determine the mRNA expression of PTPN12, E-cadherin and miRNA-124. Western blotting was performed to assess the protein expression of various proteins, including PTPN12, E-cadherin, DNMT and PARP. KEY FINDINGS: 5-Azac, a DNA hypomethylating agent, significantly increased the expression of PTPN12 at low concentrations (1muM and 2.5muM) and decreased PTPN12 expression at 5muM. We provide the first evidence that PTPN12 expression is epigenetically regulated and that it is up-regulated at a lower dose of a DNMT1 inhibitor in MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells. Interestingly, the levels of miRNA-124 were increased only at 5muM, the concentration at which PTPN12 expression was suppressed. SIGNIFICANCE: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that highlights the therapeutic potential of low-dose 5-Azac for the treatment of TNBC. Therefore, 5-Azac, an agent that has already been tested in acute myeloid leukemia, may be more effective at lower doses for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer.","['Thummuri, Dinesh', 'Kumar, Sandeep', 'Surapaneni, Sunil Kumar', 'Tikoo, Kulbhushan']","['Thummuri D', 'Kumar S', 'Surapaneni SK', 'Tikoo K']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, S.A.S.

Here, we show how upstream sensing of retroviral reverse transcripts integrates with the downstream effector APOBEC3, an IFN-induced cytidine deaminase that introduces lethal mutations during retroviral reverse transcription. Using a murine leukemia virus (MLV) variant with an unstable capsid that induces a strong IFNbeta antiviral response, we identify three sensors, IFI203, DDX41, and cGAS, required for MLV nucleic acid recognition. These sensors then signal using the adaptor STING, leading to increased production of IFNbeta and other targets downstream of the transcription factor IRF3. Using knockout and mutant mice, we show that APOBEC3 limits the levels of reverse transcripts that trigger cytosolic sensing, and that nucleic acid sensing in vivo increases expression of IFN-regulated restriction factors like APOBEC3 that in turn reduce viral load. These studies underscore the importance of the multiple layers of protection afforded by host factors.","['Stavrou, Spyridon', 'Blouch, Kristin', 'Kotla, Swathi', 'Bass, Antonia', 'Ross, Susan R']","['Stavrou S', 'Blouch K', 'Kotla S', 'Bass A', 'Ross SR']","['Department of Microbiology, Institute for Immunology and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Institute for Immunology and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Institute for Immunology and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Institute for Immunology and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Institute for Immunology and Abramson Cancer Center, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

The reasons why the examinations were performed were not known, and the dosimetric approaches did not include individual dose reconstructions or account for the possibility for missed examinations. The recent report (2013) on children by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation concluded that the associations may have resulted from confounding by indication (also called 'reverse causation'), and not radiation exposure. The reported cancer associations may very well have been related to the patients' underlying health conditions that prompted the examinations. Reverse causation has been observed in other epidemiological investigations, such as a Swedish study of thyroid cancer risk following I-131 scintillation imaging scans, and in studies of brain cancer risk following Thorotrast for cerebral angiography. Epidemiological patterns reported in the CT studies were also inconsistent with the world's literature. For example, in a UK study, teenagers had a higher risk of brain tumour than young children; in an Australian study, cancers not previously linked to radiation were significantly elevated; and in a Taiwanese study, the risk of benign tumours decreased with age at the time of CT examination. In all studies, solid tumours appeared much earlier than previously reported. Remarkably, in the Australian study, brain cancer excesses were seen regardless of whether or not the CT was to the head, i.e. a significant excess was reported for CT examinations of the abdomen and extremities, which involved no radiation exposure to the brain. In the UK study, the significance of the 'leukaemia' finding was only because myelodysplastic syndrome was added to the category, and there was no significance for leukaemia alone. Without knowledge of why CT examinations were performed, any future studies will be equally difficult to interpret. It is noteworthy that two recent studies of children in France and Germany found no significant excess cancer risk from CT scans once adjustment was made for conditions that prompted the scan, family history, or other predisposing factors known to be associated with increased cancer risk. Nonetheless, such studies have heightened awareness of these relatively high-dose diagnostic procedures, and the need to reduce unnecessary examinations and lower the dose per examination commensurate with the desired image quality.","['Boice, J D Jr']",['Boice JD Jr'],"['Department of Medicine and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Centre, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37232, USA john.boice@vanderbilt.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann ICRP,Annals of the ICRP,7708044,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/etiology', '*Radiation Dosage', 'Risk Assessment', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed/*adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/02/19 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['0146645315575877 [pii]', '10.1177/0146645315575877 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann ICRP. 2015 Jun;44(1 Suppl):236-48. doi: 10.1177/0146645315575877.

Real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a valuable tool to diagnose APL with PML-RARa. However, a single RT-qPCR analysis, which is laborious and costly, has to be performed in three reactions to determine whether one of the three PML-RARa transcripts is present and to quantify the involved transcript. This paper describes a novel TaqMan MGB probe-based 3-plex RT-qPCR assay in a single reaction to detect simultaneously the three PML-RARa transcripts. Specific primers and probe were designed, and the results were further normalized to the Abelson gene. The detection results for the serially diluted plasmid indicate that the analytical sensitivity was 10 copies per reaction for PML-RARa bcr1, bcr2, and bcr3. A relatively high sensitivity of 10-4 was achieved with this assay when analyzing the bcr1 transcripts obtained from the NB4 cell line. The reproducibility was satisfactory because the coefficients of variation of cycle threshold values were less than 3% for both inter- and intra-assays. After testing 319 newly diagnosed patients with leukemia (including 61 APL cases), the results of the 3-plex RT-qPCR assay completely agreed with the traditional methods used for the detection of PML-RARa. The quantitative results of the 3-plex RT-qPCR were highly correlated with the single RT-qPCR and showed similar assay sensitivity for 60 PML-RARa positive APL samples at diagnosis and 199 samples from 57 patients during follow-up. Interestingly, one PML-RARa bcr2 case at diagnosis with breakpoint at 1579, which was not detected by the single RT-q-PCR, was detected by the 3-plex RT-qPCR assay. The 3-plex RT-qPCR assay is a specific, sensitive, stable, and cost-effective method that can be used for the rapid diagnosis and treatment monitoring of APL with PML-RARa.","['Chen, Zhanguo', 'Tong, Yongqing', 'Li, Yan', 'Gao, Qingping', 'Wang, Qiongyu', 'Fu, Chaohong', 'Xia, Zunen']","['Chen Z', 'Tong Y', 'Li Y', 'Gao Q', 'Wang Q', 'Fu C', 'Xia Z']","['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods']",2015/03/31 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0122530 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-53370 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 27;10(3):e0122530. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0122530. eCollection 2015.,20150327,PMC4376893,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 cells were treated with various concentrations of 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) and 0.5 micromol/l suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) for 24 h and then stimulated by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) for 48 h. The mRNA levels of MHC class I, II and co-stimulatory molecules were quantified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The levels of CIITA protein were determined by western blot analysis, and the CpG island methylation ratios in the CIITA promoter IV (CIITApIV) were analyzed by bisulfite-sequencing PCR (BSP). MHC I as well as the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80 were significantly increased following treatment with 5-Aza-CdR + SAHA + IFN-gamma (epigenetic groups) compared with those in the control group and IFN-gamma group (P<0.05). The expression of MHC class II and CIITA was restored and increased in an 5-Aza-CdR concentration-dependent manner in the three epigenetic groups. The results of the BSP assay showed that the methylation rate of CIITApIV CpG sites decreased with the treatment of epigenetic modification and negatively correlated to the 5-Aza-CdR concentration. This demonstrated that the negative expression of CIITA protein was the key reason for the loss of MHC II expression in HL-60 cells. The results of the present study may help to illustrate the mechanism of immune evasion in HL-60 cells.","['Liu, Jin Hong', 'Bian, Yong Mei', 'Xie, Yi', 'Lu, Dao Pei']","['Liu JH', 'Bian YM', 'Xie Y', 'Lu DP']","[""Department of Hematology, The Fifth People's Hospital of Shanghai, Fudan University, Shanghai 200240, P.R.

The present study aimed to explore the effect of the chemopreventive agent asiatic acid (AA) on the proliferation and apoptotic rate of the leukemia cell line HL-60 and investigated the mechanisms underlying its anti-tumor activity. The effect of AA on the proliferation of HL-60 cells was evaluated using the MTT assay. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide double staining followed by flow cytometric analysis as well as Hoechst 33258 staining were used to analyze the apoptotic rate of the cells. Furthermore, changes of survivin, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), myeloid cell leukemia 1 (Mcl-1), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 expressions were detected by western blot analysis. AA blocked the growth of HL-60 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The IC50-value of AA on HL-60 cells was 46.67 +/- 5.08 micromol/l for 24 h. AA induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, which was inhibited in the presence of Z-DEVD-FMK, a specific inhibitor of caspase. The anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and survivin were downregulated by AA in a dose-dependent manner. Concurrently, AA inhibited ERK and p38 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner, while JNK phosphorylation was not affected. In conclusion, the present study indicated that the p38 and ERK pathways, as well as modulation of Bcl-2 family and survivin proteins were key regulators of apoptosis induced in HL-60 cells in response to AA.","['Wu, Qiuling', 'Lv, Tingting', 'Chen, Yan', 'Wen, Lu', 'Zhang, Junli', 'Jiang, Xudong', 'Liu, Fang']","['Wu Q', 'Lv T', 'Chen Y', 'Wen L', 'Zhang J', 'Jiang X', 'Liu F']","['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, Hubei 430022, P.R.

Comparatively, less is known about the characteristic features of cells that have aged in vivo. Here we provide a systematic molecular analysis of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDFs) that were isolated from intrinsically aged human skin of young versus middle aged versus old donors. Intrinsically aged NHDFs in culture exhibited more frequently nuclear foci positive for p53 binding protein 1 and promyelocytic leukemia protein reminiscent of 'DNA segments with chromatin alterations reinforcing senescence (DNA-SCARS)'. Formation of such foci was neither accompanied by increased DNA double strand breaks, nor decreased cell viability, nor telomere shortening. However, it was associated with the development of a secretory phenotype, indicating incipient cell senescence. By quantitative analysis of the entire secretome present in conditioned cell culture supernatant, combined with a multiplex cytokine determination, we identified 998 proteins secreted by intrinsically aged NHDFs in culture. Seventy of these proteins exhibited an age-dependent secretion pattern and were accordingly denoted 'skin aging-associated secreted proteins (SAASP)'. Systematic comparison of SAASP with the classical senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) revealed that matrix degradation as well as proinflammatory processes are common aspects of both conditions. However, secretion of 27 proteins involved in the biological processes of 'metabolism' and 'adherens junction interactions' was unique for NHDFs isolated from intrinsically aged skin. In conclusion, fibroblasts isolated from intrinsically aged skin exhibit some, but not all, molecular hallmarks of cellular senescence. Most importantly, they secrete a unique pattern of proteins that is distinct from the canonical SASP and might reflect specific processes of skin aging.","['Waldera Lupa, Daniel M', 'Kalfalah, Faiza', 'Safferling, Kai', 'Boukamp, Petra', 'Poschmann, Gereon', 'Volpi, Elena', 'Gotz-Rosch, Christine', 'Bernerd, Francoise', 'Haag, Laura', 'Huebenthal, Ulrike', 'Fritsche, Ellen', 'Boege, Fritz', 'Grabe, Niels', 'Tigges, Julia', 'Stuhler, Kai', 'Krutmann, Jean']","['Waldera Lupa DM', 'Kalfalah F', 'Safferling K', 'Boukamp P', 'Poschmann G', 'Volpi E', 'Gotz-Rosch C', 'Bernerd F', 'Haag L', 'Huebenthal U', 'Fritsche E', 'Boege F', 'Grabe N', 'Tigges J', 'Stuhler K', 'Krutmann J']","['Molecular Proteomics Laboratory, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Germany; Biomedical Research Center (BMFZ), Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Germany.', 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, Heinrich-Heine-University, Med.

This latter assays provide suitable results in 3-6 hours. We describe here two new, rapid and specific assays that detect PML-RARA transcripts, based on the RT-QLAMP (Reverse Transcription-Quenching Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification) technology in which RNA retrotranscription and cDNA amplification are carried out in a single tube with one enzyme at one temperature, in fluorescence and real time format. A single tube triplex assay detects bcr1 and bcr3 PML-RARA transcripts along with GUS housekeeping gene. A single tube duplex assay detects bcr2 and GUSB. In 73 APL cases, these assays detected in 16 minutes bcr1, bcr2 and bcr3 transcripts. All 81 non-APL samples were negative by RT-QLAMP for chimeric transcripts whereas GUSB was detectable. In 11 APL patients in which RT-PCR yielded equivocal breakpoint type results, RT-QLAMP assays unequivocally and accurately defined the breakpoint type (as confirmed by sequencing). Furthermore, RT-QLAMP could amplify two bcr2 transcripts with particularly extended PML exon 6 deletions not amplified by RQ-PCR. RT-QLAMP reproducible sensitivity is 10(-3) for bcr1 and bcr3 and 10(-)2 for bcr2 thus making this assay particularly attractive at diagnosis and leaving RQ-PCR for the molecular monitoring of minimal residual disease during the follow up. In conclusion, PML-RARA RT-QLAMP compared to RT-PCR or RQ-PCR is a valid improvement to perform rapid, simple and accurate molecular diagnosis of APL.","['Spinelli, Orietta', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Rigo, Francesca', 'Zanghi, Pamela', ""D'Agostini, Elena"", 'Amicarelli, Giulia', 'Colotta, Francesco', 'Divona, Mariadomenica', 'Ciardi, Claudia', 'Coco, Francesco Lo', 'Minnucci, Giulia']","['Spinelli O', 'Rambaldi A', 'Rigo F', 'Zanghi P', ""D'Agostini E"", 'Amicarelli G', 'Colotta F', 'Divona M', 'Ciardi C', 'Coco FL', 'Minnucci G']","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'DiaSorin SpA, Gerenzano (VA), Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Papa Giovanni XXIII, Bergamo, Italy.', 'DiaSorin SpA, Gerenzano (VA), Italy.', 'DiaSorin SpA, Gerenzano (VA), Italy.', 'DiaSorin SpA, Gerenzano (VA), Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy ; Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Roma, Italy ; Fondazione Santa Lucia, Rome, Italy.', 'DiaSorin SpA, Gerenzano (VA), Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncoscience,Oncoscience,101636666,,,,2015/03/31 06:00,2015/03/31 06:01,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/10/22 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:01 [medline]']","['114 [pii]', '10.18632/oncoscience.114 [doi]']",epublish,Oncoscience. 2014 Dec 27;2(1):50-8. doi: 10.18632/oncoscience.114. eCollection 2015.,20141227,PMC4341464,['NOTNLM'],"['APL', 'LAMP', 'PML-RARA', 'molecular diagnosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neopterin or proviral load are clinically measured as disease grading biomarkers, however, they are not exactly specific to HAM/TSP. Therefore, we aimed to identify HAM/TSP-specific biomarker molecules and establish a novel less-invasive plasma diagnostic model for HAM/TSP. METHODS: Proteome-wide quantitative profiling of CSFs from six asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (AC) and 51 HAM/TSP patients was performed. Fourteen severity grade biomarker proteins were further examined plasma enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays (n = 71). Finally, we constructed three-factor logistic regression model and evaluated the diagnostic power using 105 plasma samples. RESULTS: Quantitative analysis for 1871 nonredundant CSF proteins identified from 57 individuals defined 14 CSF proteins showing significant correlation with Osame's motor disability score (OMDS). Subsequent ELISA experiments using 71 plasma specimens confirmed secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) demonstrated the same correlations in plasma (R = -0.373 and R = 0.431, respectively). In this training set, we constructed a HAM/TSP diagnostic model using SPARC, VCAM1, and viral load. Sensitivity and specificity to diagnose HAM/TSP patients from AC (AC vs. OMDS 1-11) were 85.3% and 81.1%, respectively. Importantly, this model could be also useful for determination of therapeutic intervention point (OMDS 1-3 + AC vs. OMDS 4-11), exhibiting 80.0% sensitivity and 82.9% specificity. INTERPRETATION: We propose a novel less-invasive diagnostic model for early detection and clinical stratification of HAM/TSP.","['Ishihara, Makoto', 'Araya, Natsumi', 'Sato, Tomoo', 'Saichi, Naomi', 'Fujii, Risa', 'Yamano, Yoshihisa', 'Ueda, Koji']","['Ishihara M', 'Araya N', 'Sato T', 'Saichi N', 'Fujii R', 'Yamano Y', 'Ueda K']","['Division of Biosciences, Functional Proteomics Center, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Biosciences, Functional Proteomics Center, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Biosciences, Functional Proteomics Center, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Rare Diseases Research, Institute of Medical Science, St. Marianna University School of Medicine Kawasaki, Japan.', 'Division of Biosciences, Functional Proteomics Center, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann Clin Transl Neurol,Annals of clinical and translational neurology,101623278,,,,2015/03/31 06:00,2015/03/31 06:01,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/31 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1002/acn3.169 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Clin Transl Neurol. 2015 Mar;2(3):231-40. doi: 10.1002/acn3.169.

Although DC-based vaccines have raised great expectations, their clinical translation has been largely disappointing. For these results, several explanations have been proposed. In particular, the concomitant expression by DCs of tolerogenic pathways, such as the immunosuppressive agent indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1), has been demonstrated. The aim of this study is to evaluate both the stimulatory and the tolerogenic feature of monocyte-derived DCs (Mo-DCs) after maturation with PGE2. In particular, the role of IDO1 expression in PGE2-matured Mo-DCs has been addressed. Here we show that PGE2, which is required for full maturation of DCs, is one mediator of DC tolerance by enhancing IDO1. PGE2-mediated expression of IDO1 results in the production of kynurenine, in the generation of Tregs, and in the inhibition of either the allogeneic or the autologous antigen-specific stimulatory capacity of DCs. When pulsed with leukemic lysates and matured with PGE2, DCs are impaired in the induction of IFN-gamma secreting CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells due to IDO1 upregulation. Moreover, the inhibition of IDO1 enhances the antileukemic response. Overall, these results point toward the use of IDO1 inhibitors to enhance the vaccination capacity of DCs, matured with PGE2.","['Trabanelli, Sara', 'Lecciso, Mariangela', 'Salvestrini, Valentina', 'Cavo, Michele', 'Ocadlikova, Darina', 'Lemoli, Roberto M', 'Curti, Antonio']","['Trabanelli S', 'Lecciso M', 'Salvestrini V', 'Cavo M', 'Ocadlikova D', 'Lemoli RM', 'Curti A']","['Department of Specialistic, Diagnostic and Experimental Medicine, Institute of Hematology ""L. & A.

In this study, we found that the partially selective Usp9x deubiquitinase inhibitor WP1130 induced apoptosis and reduced Mcl-1 protein levels. However, short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown (KD) of Usp9x in myeloma cells resulted in transient induction of apoptosis, followed by a sustained reduction in cell growth. A compensatory upregulation of Usp24, a deubiquitinase closely related to Usp9x, in Usp9x KD cells was noted. Direct Usp24 KD resulted in marked induction of myeloma cell death that was associated with a reduction of Mcl-1. Usp24 was found to sustain myeloma cell survival and Mcl-1 regulation in the absence of Usp9x. Both Usp9x and Usp24 were expressed and activated in primary myeloma cells whereas Usp24 protein overexpression was noted in some patients with drug-refractory myeloma and other B-cell malignancies. Furthermore, we improved the drug-like properties of WP1130 and demonstrated that the novel compound EOAI3402143 dose-dependently inhibited Usp9x and Usp24 activity, increased tumor cell apoptosis, and fully blocked or regressed myeloma tumors in mice. We conclude that small-molecule Usp9x/Usp24 inhibitors may have therapeutic activity in myeloma.","['Peterson, Luke F', 'Sun, Hanshi', 'Liu, Yihong', 'Potu, Harish', 'Kandarpa, Malathi', 'Ermann, Monika', 'Courtney, Stephen M', 'Young, Matthew', 'Showalter, Hollis D', 'Sun, Duxin', 'Jakubowiak, Andrzej', 'Malek, Sami N', 'Talpaz, Moshe', 'Donato, Nicholas J']","['Peterson LF', 'Sun H', 'Liu Y', 'Potu H', 'Kandarpa M', 'Ermann M', 'Courtney SM', 'Young M', 'Showalter HD', 'Sun D', 'Jakubowiak A', 'Malek SN', 'Talpaz M', 'Donato NJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine/Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Department of Internal Medicine/Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Department of Internal Medicine/Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Department of Internal Medicine/Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Department of Internal Medicine/Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Department of Drug Discovery Alliance, Evotec, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Drug Discovery Alliance, Evotec, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Department of Medicinal Chemistry and.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Michigan College of Pharmacy, Ann Arbor, MI; and.', 'Section of Hematology/Oncology, University of Chicago Medical Center, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Internal Medicine/Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Department of Internal Medicine/Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI;', 'Department of Internal Medicine/Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Michigan School of Medicine and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cyanoacrylates)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (USP24 protein, human)', '0 (USP9X protein, human)', '0 (degrasyn)', 'EC 3.4.19.12 (Ubiquitin Thiolesterase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyanoacrylates/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Ubiquitin Thiolesterase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/08/13 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/10/08 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/13 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31579-2 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-605584 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jun 4;125(23):3588-97. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-605584.

The function of B7-H3 has been controversial. We show that B7-H3 is upregulated in graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) target organs, including the colon, liver, and lung. Infusion of allogeneic donor T cells into B7-H3(-/-) vs wild-type (WT) recipients resulted in increased GVHD lethality associated with increased T-cell proliferation, colonic inflammatory cytokines, and destruction of epithelial barriers. Allogeneic B7-H3(-/-) vs WT donor T cells also had increased T-cell proliferation and GVHD lethality associated with increased proliferation and cytokine secretion in the spleen, intraepithelial lymphocyte inflammatory cytokines, and intestinal permeability. Both resting and activated regulatory T cells (Tregs) lack B7-H3 messenger RNA. Consistent with these data, GVHD was augmented in recipients of B7-H3(-/-) Treg-depleted grafts. In two delayed lymphocyte infusion (DLI) models, T cells lacking B7-H3 are capable of providing graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects. We conclude that B7-H3 is responsible for providing a negative costimulatory signal. Our studies provide support for developing and testing new therapies directed toward the B7-H3 pathway, including approaches to augment host B7-H3 early after bone marrow transplantation to prevent GVHD and to develop potent antagonistic antibodies later after transplant to facilitate DLI-mediated GVL without GVHD complications.","['Veenstra, Rachelle G', 'Flynn, Ryan', 'Kreymborg, Katharina', 'McDonald-Hyman, Cameron', 'Saha, Asim', 'Taylor, Patricia A', 'Osborn, Mark J', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari, Angela', 'Schmitt-Graeff, Annette', 'Lieberknecht, Elisabeth', 'Murphy, William J', 'Serody, Jonathan S', 'Munn, David H', 'Freeman, Gordon J', 'Allison, James P', 'Mak, Tak W', 'van den Brink, Marcel', 'Zeiser, Robert', 'Blazar, Bruce R']","['Veenstra RG', 'Flynn R', 'Kreymborg K', 'McDonald-Hyman C', 'Saha A', 'Taylor PA', 'Osborn MJ', 'Panoskaltsis-Mortari A', 'Schmitt-Graeff A', 'Lieberknecht E', 'Murphy WJ', 'Serody JS', 'Munn DH', 'Freeman GJ', 'Allison JP', 'Mak TW', 'van den Brink M', 'Zeiser R', 'Blazar BR']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Immunology and Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN;', 'Department of Pathology, and.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany;', 'Department of Dermatology, School of Medicine, University of California at Davis, Sacramento, CA;', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Immunotherapy Center, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA;', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA;', 'Department of Immunology and Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY; Department of Immunology, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX; and.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, Ontario Cancer Institute, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Department of Immunology and Medicine, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Freiburg University Medical Center, Freiburg, Germany;', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (B7 Antigens)', '0 (Cd276 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Allografts', 'Animals', 'B7 Antigens/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/07/29 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31664-5 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-09-603357 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 21;125(21):3335-46. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-09-603357.

This analysis compares these metrics among 365 ALL survivors with a mean age of 28.6 +/- 5.9 years (149 treated with and 216 without CRT) and 365 age-, sex-, and race-matched peers. We also report risk factors for outcomes among survivors treated without CRT. Male survivors not exposed to CRT had abnormal body composition when compared with peers (% body fat, 26.2 +/- 8.2 vs 22.7 +/- 7.1). Survivors without CRT had similar energy balance but had significantly impaired quadriceps strength (-21.9 +/- 6.0 Newton-meters [Nm]/kg, 60 degrees /s) and endurance (-11.4 +/- 4.6 Nm/kg, 300 degrees /s), exercise capacity (-2.0 +/- 2.1 ml/kg per minute), low-back and hamstring flexibility (-4.7 +/- 1.6 cm), and dorsiflexion range of motion (-3.1 +/- 0.9 degrees ) and higher modified total neuropathy scores (+1.6 +/- 1.1) than peers. Cumulative asparaginase dose >/=120,000 IU/m(2) was associated with impaired flexibility, vincristine dose >/=39 mg/m(2) with peripheral neuropathy, glucocorticoid (prednisone equivalent) dose >/=8000 mg/m(2) with hand weakness, and intrathecal methotrexate dose >/=225 mg with dorsiflexion weakness. Physical inactivity was associated with hand weakness and decreased exercise capacity. Smoking was associated with peripheral neuropathy. Elimination of CRT from ALL therapy has improved, but not eliminated, body-composition outcomes. Survivors remain at risk for impaired fitness.","['Ness, Kirsten K', 'DeLany, James P', 'Kaste, Sue C', 'Mulrooney, Daniel A', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Chemaitilly, Wassim', 'Karlage, Robyn E', 'Lanctot, Jennifer Q', 'Howell, Carrie R', 'Lu, Lu', 'Srivastava, Deo Kumar', 'Robison, Leslie L', 'Hudson, Melissa M']","['Ness KK', 'DeLany JP', 'Kaste SC', 'Mulrooney DA', 'Pui CH', 'Chemaitilly W', 'Karlage RE', 'Lanctot JQ', 'Howell CR', 'Lu L', 'Srivastava DK', 'Robison LL', 'Hudson MM']","[""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", 'Division of Endocrinology and Metabolism, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA; and.', 'Department of Radiological Sciences.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Oncology.', 'Department of Endocrinology, and.', ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Control, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN;"", 'Department of Oncology.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Eating', 'Energy Metabolism/*physiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Physical Fitness/*physiology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/therapy', '*Survivors', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2015/01/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31605-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-01-621680 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 28;125(22):3411-9. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-01-621680.

Engineered receptors targeting TAAs have most commonly been expressed on mature T cells, however, some have postulated that receptor expression on immune progenitors could yield T cells with enhanced potency. We generated mice (survivin-TCR-transgenic [Sur-TCR-Tg]) expressing a TCR recognizing the immunodominant epitope (Sur20-28) of murine survivin during early stages of thymopoiesis. Spontaneous T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) occurred in 100% of Sur-TCR-Tg mice derived from 3 separate founders. The leukemias expressed the Sur-TCR and signaled in response to the Sur20-28 peptide. In preleukemic mice, we observed increased cycling of double-negative thymocytes expressing the Sur-TCR and increased nuclear translocation of nuclear factor of activated T cells, consistent with TCR signaling induced by survivin expression in the murine thymus. beta2M(-/-) Sur-TCR-Tg mice, which cannot effectively present survivin peptides on class I major histocompatibility complex, had significantly diminished rates of leukemia. We conclude that TCR signaling during the early stages of thymopoiesis mediates an oncogenic signal, and therefore expression of signaling receptors on developing thymocytes with specificity for TAAs expressed in the thymus could pose a risk for neoplasia, independent of insertional mutagenesis.","['Cui, Yongzhi', 'Onozawa, Masahiro', 'Garber, Haven R', 'Samsel, Leigh', 'Wang, Ziyao', 'McCoy, J Philip', 'Burkett, Sandra', 'Wu, Xiaolin', 'Aplan, Peter D', 'Mackall, Crystal L']","['Cui Y', 'Onozawa M', 'Garber HR', 'Samsel L', 'Wang Z', 'McCoy JP', 'Burkett S', 'Wu X', 'Aplan PD', 'Mackall CL']","['Pediatric Oncology Branch and.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch and.', 'Flow Cytometry Core Facility, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch and.', 'Flow Cytometry Core Facility, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD;', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Core, Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, Frederick, MD; and.', 'Cancer Research Technology Program, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc., Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD.', 'Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD;', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Birc5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Survivin)', '0 (Taa1 protein, mouse)', '128559-51-3 (RAG-1 protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/genetics/*metabolism', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Homeodomain Proteins/physiology', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins/*physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology/metabolism/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/*physiology', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survivin', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31717-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-609271 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 7;125(19):2958-67. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-609271.

In the USA and the European Union (EU), Novartis' composition of matter patent on imatinib will expire in 2016. The potential impact on health system spending levels for CML after generic imatinib becomes available is the subject of significant interest among stakeholders. The extent of the potential savings largely depends on whether and to what extent prices decline and use stays the same or even increases. These are also empirical questions since the likely spending implications following generic imatinib's availability are predicated on multiple factors: physicians' willingness to prescribe generic imatinib, molecule characteristics, and health system priorities.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) registries with more comprehensive reporting may also provide complementary data on treatment outcome to those obtained from clinical trials. Reports from several European CML registries consistently show a crude annual incidence of 0.7-1.0/100,000, a median age at diagnosis of 57-60 years and a male/female ratio of 1.2-1.7. The incidence of CML has been stable over time. Worldwide, variations in the reported incidence of CML may be due to methodological issues, but a true difference between different geographical areas and/or ethnical subgroups cannot be excluded. The prevalence of CML is not well known but has been estimated to be 10-12/100,000 inhabitants with a steady increase due to the dramatic improvement in survival of these patients. In recent population-based studies, CML patients have an overall survival that is comparable to that shown in large clinical trials, though relative survival in patients >70 years is still decreased. The importance of socio-economic factors and health-care setting for outcome and the possible increased risk of secondary cancer in CML are areas of ongoing research.","['Hoglund, Martin', 'Sandin, Fredrik', 'Simonsson, Bengt']","['Hoglund M', 'Sandin F', 'Simonsson B']","['Department of Medical Science, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden, martin.hoglund@medsci.uu.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', '*Global Health', 'Health Transition', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sex Factors', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-015-2314-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Apr;94 Suppl 2:S241-7. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2314-2.

In chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the Sokal, the Euro, and the EUTOS score are established prognostic scores which were addressed by the CML management recommendations of the European LeukemiaNet. This review provides a general definition of prognostic scores and explains their meaning. Main differences between the Sokal, the Euro, and the EUTOS score are highlighted. Due to the therapeutic success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the proportion of patients with causes of death unrelated to CML is growing. To assess the potential of a drug to prevent dying of CML, causes of death unrelated to CML need to be considered as competing risks. Supported by data of patients randomized to imatinib-based treatments within the German CML study IV, this review also explores the prognostic performance of the established scores if the primary event is death due to CML only and explains the implicit statistical particularities when treating other causes of death as competing risks. In the presence of competing risks, the application of both the cause-specific hazard model and the subdistribution hazard model is recommended when investigating the influence of prognostic factors on the event of interest. Another purpose of this work is to foster the ability of hematologists to interpret the outcome of a cause-specific hazard and a subdistribution hazard model and to understand the differences between them.","['Pfirrmann, Markus', 'Lauseker, Michael', 'Hoffmann, Verena S', 'Hasford, Joerg']","['Pfirrmann M', 'Lauseker M', 'Hoffmann VS', 'Hasford J']","['Institut fur Medizinische Informationsverarbeitung, Biometrie und Epidemiologie-IBE, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat, Marchioninistrasse 15, 81377, Munchen, Germany, pfi@ibe.med.uni-muenchen.de.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Cause of Death', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*diagnosis/drug therapy/enzymology/mortality', '*Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Assessment/methods']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-015-2316-0 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Apr;94 Suppl 2:S209-18. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2316-0.

Its pleiotropic mechanism of action in CML includes immune activation and specific targeting of CML stem cells. Early studies of IFNalpha in CML demonstrated that patients in chronic phase could attain extremely stable remissions, which correlated with long-term survival. Some patients even sustained their remission after discontinuing therapy, but the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not well understood. Today, BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib, induce remarkable responses in CML patients and have become the mainstay of CML therapy. Although TKIs target the pathogenic BCR-ABL protein in CML, they cannot fully eradicate CML stem cells. Some of the clinical trials testing IFNalpha plus imatinib combination therapy suggest that addition of IFNalpha increases the speed and rate of responses with imatinib therapy. However, the undesirable side effects of IFNalpha can make this therapy difficult to deliver, and the optimal therapeutic window for using IFNalpha in combination therapy is unknown.

The development of molecular-targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has fundamentally changed the outcome of this disease. Treatment with TKIs is now the standard of care in patients with CML and has dramatically improved long-term survival in the majority of patients. Patients who achieve major molecular response (MMR) after 2 years of treatment with imatinib have survival rates comparable to those of the general population. The success of TKIs has led to durable molecular response and possibility of normal life expectancies, such that it is now timely to address quality of life aspects such as fertility, pregnancy and family planning. Pregnancy in CML presents specific management and therapeutic challenges for the patient and the physician. Despite the recent treatment advances, we still have limited data on the safety of TKIs in pregnancy and its effect on fertility. However, there is a cause for concern and heightened awareness following the occurrence of a constellation of rare congenital malformations and spontaneous abortions in association with imatinib therapy. When a patient becomes pregnant whilst receiving TKI therapy, the difficulty lies in balancing the risk to the foetus of continuing therapy versus the risk to the patient of treatment interruption and potentially losing optimal disease response. All couples should be counselled on the risks associated with pregnancy whilst receiving TKI therapy. This is an essential aspect in patient care and frequently not emphasized enough by physicians. At the time of diagnosis, fertility preservation should be discussed with both male and female patients of childbearing potential. They should be made aware of fertility options which are available such as semen cryopreservation, ovarian or oocyte retrieval and storage and embryo cryopreservation in view of the potential detrimental effect of TKIs on fertility and gonadal function. The recommendation given to patients planning pregnancy differs according to their disease response to TKI therapy, which is the most important prognostic factor in CML.","['Palani, Renuka', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Apperley, Jane F']","['Palani R', 'Milojkovic D', 'Apperley JF']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK, palanicawandar.renuka@imperial.nhs.uk.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Teratogens)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy/adverse effects', 'Contraindications', 'Drug Monitoring', '*Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Female', '*Fertility Preservation', 'Humans', 'Lactation', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/enzymology/*therapy', 'Male', '*Patient Education as Topic', '*Precision Medicine', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications, Neoplastic/diagnosis/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Teratogens/toxicity']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/08/01 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-015-2317-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Apr;94 Suppl 2:S167-76. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2317-z.

However, the majority of patients need to be treated during their entire life span; thus, outcome does not solely depend on treatment efficacy but also on how well therapy is tolerated. TKIs have an overall favorable safety profile in clinical practice. Although many patients may encounter adverse events, these usually occur early after treatment initiation, are mild to moderate in intensity and resolve spontaneously, or are easily controlled with adequate supportive care. Whenever treatment interruption is necessary, re-exposition to the same TKI or switch to an alternative TKI is successful in the majority of the cases. However, long-term safety issues have not been fully elucidated at present, especially for new-generation TKIs. Recent evidence has emerged that these new agents may sometimes impinge on vital organs such as the heart and lung in an irreversible fashion especially when comorbidities are present; thus, decision regarding of which TKI should be used must take into account disease-related, TKI-related, and patient-related variables. The purpose of this article is to provide an up-to-date review of common adverse events associated with TKIs and how these events may be optimally managed.","['Rea, Delphine']",['Rea D'],"[""Service d'Hematologie Adulte, Hopital Saint-Louis, AP-HP, 1, avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75475, Paris Cedex 10, France, delphine.rea@sls.aphp.fr.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Drug Monitoring', '*Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*adverse effects', '*Precision Medicine', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/08/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-015-2318-y [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Apr;94 Suppl 2:S149-58. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2318-y.

Here, we make a critical review of the last, 2013, ELN recommendations, concerning the use of the five available tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the evaluation of cytogenetic and molecular response, and the strategy of treatment. Three TKIs (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib) are recommended first-line. Bosutinib and ponatinib are available second-line; ponatinib is particularly indicated in case of the T315I mutation. Achieving an optimal response, not only for survival but also for a deeper, stable, treatment-free remission, requires a BCR-ABL transcripts level </= 10 % at 3 months, </= 1 % at 6 months, </= 0.1 % at 1 year, and </= 0.01 % later on. Molecular monitoring must include mutational analysis in every case of failure. A successful treatment of accelerated and blastic phase requires TKIs, and in many cases also allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Baccarani, Michele', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Rosti, Gianantonio']","['Baccarani M', 'Castagnetti F', 'Gugliotta G', 'Rosti G']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology ""L. and A.

Second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) dasatinib, nilotinib, and bosutinib offer improved potency and a high likelihood of success for these patients. Overall, efficacy data are comparable for these agents, and so physicians should consider the BCR-ABL1 mutation profile and the patient's history to make a decision on the best choice. Only a few BCR-ABL1 mutations seem to be less responsive to any of the three drugs, and it is recommended to choose the second-line TKI that has shown clinical activity against the specific mutation in these cases. For patients with all other mutations and for patients with no mutations, it is recommended to choose the second-generation TKI based on the patient's disease history. The third-generation TKI ponatinib is available after dasatinib or nilotinib failure or for patients with T315I mutations. However, optimal dose of ponatinib is still under investigation. Overall, it is recommended to select a drug that minimizes the likelihood of worsening the patient's past side effects or comorbid conditions.

However, with the commonly used dosage of 400 mg, one third of the treated patients does not reach the criteria associated with an optimal outcome and could potentially benefit from a different treatment strategy. Several trials exploring modified imatinib-based treatments or second-generation tyrosine-kinase as front-line therapy have been performed. In some studies, high-dose (800 mg per day) or dose-adapted imatinib or imatinib plus interferon was reported to be able to induce better cytogenetic and molecular responses compared with standard-dose imatinib, although no improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) have been so far reported. At the moment, these approaches are still considered investigational. On the other side, on the basis of their capacity to induce very fast and deep molecular responses, including major molecular responses (MMRs) and the newly defined very deep molecular responses MR(4) and MR(4.5), and to prevent at least part of the early progressions to AP/BC that still occur during the first 2-3 years from diagnosis, dasatinib and nilotinib have been approved and registered by FDA and EMA as the first-line therapy for CML patients, opening the possibility to use different therapeutic strategies for newly diagnosed CML patients and a consequent intense debate among hematologists.","['Fava, Carmen', 'Rege-Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Saglio, Giuseppe']","['Fava C', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Saglio G']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, ""San Luigi Gonzaga"" University Hospital, 10043, Orbassano, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/*prevention & control', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/enzymology/mortality/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/*prevention & control', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*adverse effects', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/09/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-015-2321-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Apr;94 Suppl 2:S123-31. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2321-3.

This disease is characterised by a reciprocal t(9;22) chromosomal translocation, resulting in the formation of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome containing the BCR-ABL1 gene. As such, diagnosis and monitoring of disease involves detection of BCR-ABL1. It is the BCR-ABL1 protein, in particular its constitutively active tyrosine kinase activity, that forges the pathogenesis of CML. This aberrant kinase signalling activates downstream targets that reprogram the cell to cause uncontrolled proliferation and results in myeloid hyperplasia and 'indolent' symptoms of chronic phase (CP) CML. Without successful intervention, the disease will progress into blast crisis (BC), resembling an acute leukaemia. This advanced disease stage takes on an aggressive phenotype and is almost always fatal. The cell biology of CML is also centred on BCR-ABL1. The presence of BCR-ABL1 can explain virtually all the cellular features of the leukaemia (enhanced cell growth, inhibition of apoptosis, altered cell adhesion, growth factor independence, impaired genomic surveillance and differentiation). This article provides an overview of the clinical and cell biology of CML, and highlights key findings and unanswered questions essential for understanding this disease.","['Chereda, Bradley', 'Melo, Junia V']","['Chereda B', 'Melo JV']","['Departments of Genetics and Molecular Pathology, and Haematology, Centre for Cancer Biology, SA Pathology, Frome Road, Adelaide, 5000, Australia, bradley.chereda@health.sa.gov.au.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)'],IM,"['Animals', '*Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/genetics/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'Prognosis']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/11/25 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-015-2325-z [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Apr;94 Suppl 2:S107-21. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2325-z.

Reovirus is safe, well tolerated and currently in clinical testing for the treatment of multiple myeloma, in combination with dexamethasone/carfilzomib. Activation of natural killer (NK) cells has been observed after systemic delivery of reovirus to cancer patients; however, the ability of OV to potentiate NK cell-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is unexplored. This study elucidates the potential of oncolytic reovirus for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), both as a direct cytotoxic agent and as an immunomodulator. We demonstrate that reovirus: (i) is directly cytotoxic against CLL, which requires replication-competent virus; (ii) phenotypically and functionally activates patient NK cells via a monocyte-derived interferon-alpha (IFNalpha)-dependent mechanism; and (iii) enhances ADCC-mediated killing of CLL in combination with anti-CD20 antibodies. Our data provide strong preclinical evidence to support the use of reovirus in combination with anti-CD20 immunotherapy for the treatment of CLL.","['Parrish, C', 'Scott, G B', 'Migneco, G', 'Scott, K J', 'Steele, L P', 'Ilett, E', 'West, E J', 'Hall, K', 'Selby, P J', 'Buchanan, D', 'Varghese, A', 'Cragg, M S', 'Coffey, M', 'Hillmen, P', 'Melcher, A A', 'Errington-Mais, F']","['Parrish C', 'Scott GB', 'Migneco G', 'Scott KJ', 'Steele LP', 'Ilett E', 'West EJ', 'Hall K', 'Selby PJ', 'Buchanan D', 'Varghese A', 'Cragg MS', 'Coffey M', 'Hillmen P', 'Melcher AA', 'Errington-Mais F']","[""Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", 'Antibody and Vaccine Group, Cancer Sciences Unit, Southampton University, General Hospital, Southampton, UK.', 'Oncolytics Biotech Inc., Calgary, AB, Canada.', 'Experimental Haematology, LICAP, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK.', ""Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK."", ""Section of Oncology and Clinical Research, Leeds Institute of Cancer and Pathology (LICAP), University of Leeds, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/*immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunologic Factors/immunology/therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Male', 'Mammalian orthoreovirus 3/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Oncolytic Viruses/*immunology', 'Rituximab/*immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Virus Replication']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2014/12/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201588 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.88 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Sep;29(9):1799-810. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.88.

In addition, 1b up-regulated p21CIP1/WAF1/Sdi1 protein expression (flow cytometry), a cell cycle inhibitor, reduced cell growth, and induced DNA fragmentation (increased sub-G1 phase cells) and phosphatidylserine externalization in plasmatic membrane (increased annexin V positive cells).

This growing cohort of survivors, with many years of life ahead of them, has raised the necessity for knowledge concerning the risks of adverse long-term sequelae of the life-saving treatments in order to provide optimal screening and care and to identify and provide adequate interventions. Childhood cancer survivor cohorts in Europe. Considerable advantages exist to study late effects in individuals treated for childhood cancer in a European context, including the complementary advantages of large population-based cancer registries and the unrivalled opportunities to study lifetime risks, together with rich and detailed hospital-based cohorts which fill many of the gaps left by the large-scale population-based studies, such as sparse treatment information. Several large national cohorts have been established within Europe to study late effects in individuals treated for childhood cancer including the Nordic Adult Life after Childhood Cancer in Scandinavia study (ALiCCS), the British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (BCCSS), the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) LATER study, and the Swiss Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (SCCSS). Furthermore, there are other large cohorts, which may eventually become national in scope including the French Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (FCCSS), the French Childhood Cancer Survivor Study for Leukaemia (LEA), and the Italian Study on off-therapy Childhood Cancer Survivors (OTR). In recent years significant steps have been taken to extend these national studies into a larger pan-European context through the establishment of two large consortia - PanCareSurFup and PanCareLIFE. The purpose of this paper is to present an overview of the current large, national and pan-European studies of late effects after childhood cancer. This overview will highlight the strong cooperation across Europe, in particular the EU-funded collaborative research projects PanCareSurFup and PanCareLIFE. Overall goal. The overall goal of these large cohort studies is to provide every European childhood cancer survivor with better care and better long-term health so that they reach their full potential, and to the degree possible, enjoy the same quality of life and opportunities as their peers.","['Winther, Jeanette F', 'Kenborg, Line', 'Byrne, Julianne', 'Hjorth, Lars', 'Kaatsch, Peter', 'Kremer, Leontien C M', 'Kuehni, Claudia E', 'Auquier, Pascal', 'Michel, Gerard', 'de Vathaire, Florent', 'Haupt, Riccardo', 'Skinner, Roderick', 'Madanat-Harjuoja, Laura M', 'Tryggvadottir, Laufey', 'Wesenberg, Finn', 'Reulen, Raoul C', 'Grabow, Desiree', 'Ronckers, Cecile M', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder, Eline', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, Marry M', 'Schindler, Matthias', 'Berbis, Julie', 'Holmqvist, Anna S', 'Gudmundsdottir, Thorgerdur', 'de Fine Licht, Sofie', 'Bonnesen, Trine G', 'Asdahl, Peter H', 'Bautz, Andrea', 'Kristoffersen, Anja K', 'Himmerslev, Liselotte', 'Hasle, Henrik', 'Olsen, Jorgen H', 'Hawkins, Mike M']","['Winther JF', 'Kenborg L', 'Byrne J', 'Hjorth L', 'Kaatsch P', 'Kremer LC', 'Kuehni CE', 'Auquier P', 'Michel G', 'de Vathaire F', 'Haupt R', 'Skinner R', 'Madanat-Harjuoja LM', 'Tryggvadottir L', 'Wesenberg F', 'Reulen RC', 'Grabow D', 'Ronckers CM', 'van Dulmen-den Broeder E', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Schindler M', 'Berbis J', 'Holmqvist AS', 'Gudmundsdottir T', 'de Fine Licht S', 'Bonnesen TG', 'Asdahl PH', 'Bautz A', 'Kristoffersen AK', 'Himmerslev L', 'Hasle H', 'Olsen JH', 'Hawkins MM']","['Danish Cancer Society Research Center , Copenhagen , Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Cohort Effect', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', '*Needs Assessment', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/*therapy', 'Quality of Health Care', 'Survival Rate', '*Survivors']",2015/03/31 06:00,2015/10/09 06:00,['2015/03/28 06:00'],"['2015/03/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/09 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/0284186X.2015.1008648 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2015 May;54(5):655-68. doi: 10.3109/0284186X.2015.1008648.

DESIGN: Single center retrospective study. SETTING: University pediatric hospital. PATIENT(S): Fourteen patients with 46,XY GD. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Genotype-phenotype relationship. RESULT(S): The presenting symptom was disorders of sex development (6 patients), primary amenorrhea (2 patients), discordance between 46,XY karyotype and female external genitalia (3 patients), discovery of Mullerian structures at surgery (2 patients), or diagnosed in the evaluation of a gonadal tumor (1 patient). Mullerian structures were shown by ultrasound evaluation in 7 of 13 patients, genitography in 3 of 6 patients and/or surgery in 8 of 10 patients (3 not seen at imaging), or only by histologic examination (1 patient). Three patients had gonadoblastoma and/or seminoma. A mutation was found in 7 patients of whom 2 had family history of reproductive problems and 5 had associated somatic anomalies. The mutations were FOG2/ZFPM2 (1 patient), SRY (2 patients), WT1 (1 patient), or deletions of distal chromosome 9p (3 patients). Among the three other patients with associated anomalies and no mutation, two had ectodermal dysplasia and one had leukemia. CONCLUSION(S): Mutations were observed in half of the patients with 46,XY GD with Mullerian structures. We also describe for the first time the association between GD and ectodermal dysplasia. Mullerian structures can be found in some cases only by histologic examination, which should be coupled to preventive gonadectomy because of the risk of tumor formation.","['Bastian, Claire', 'Muller, Jean-Baptiste', 'Lortat-Jacob, Stephen', 'Nihoul-Fekete, Claire', 'Bignon-Topalovic, Joelle', 'McElreavey, Ken', 'Bashamboo, Anu', 'Brauner, Raja']","['Bastian C', 'Muller JB', 'Lortat-Jacob S', 'Nihoul-Fekete C', 'Bignon-Topalovic J', 'McElreavey K', 'Bashamboo A', 'Brauner R']","['Universite Paris Descartes and Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Fondation Ophtalmologique Adolphe de Rothschild, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes and Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Fondation Ophtalmologique Adolphe de Rothschild, Paris, France.', 'Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, Service de chirurgie viscerale pediatrique, Paris, France.', 'Universite Paris Descartes, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.', 'Human Developmental Genetics, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.', 'Human Developmental Genetics, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.

Targeting the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway has recently emerged as a potent rational anticancer strategy. Bortezomib, a specific proteasome inhibitor, has been approved for the treatment of relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma and other hematological malignancies as a single agent or as part of a combination therapy. However, bortezomib alone or in combination showed only minimal effects in the treatment of solid tumors. Myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) is an anti-apoptotic protein which protects tumor cells against spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. In multiple myeloma, specific downregulation of Mcl-1 induces apoptosis. Furthermore, previous studies demonstrated that proteasome inhibitors induce Mcl-1 accumulation that, in turn, slows down their pro-apoptotic effects, and the cell survival in multiple myeloma is highly dependent on Mcl-1. In the present study, we investigated the role of Mcl-1 downregulation in bortezomib-induced apoptosis in gliomas. We observed that bortezomib triggers caspase-3 and PARP activation, upregulates cytochrome c expression and induces apoptosis. Furthermore, we demonstrated that effective targeting of Mcl-1 in glioma cells by gene silencing technology augments the glioma cell sensitivity to bortezomib-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that Mcl-1 plays a critical role in bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Mcl-1 inhibitor in combination with bortezomib present a promising novel strategy to trigger cell death pathways in the treatment of gliomas.","['Zhang, Yang', 'Zhu, Xiaobo', 'Hou, Kun', 'Zhao, Jinchuan', 'Han, Zhiguo', 'Zhang, Xiaona']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhu X', 'Hou K', 'Zhao J', 'Han Z', 'Zhang X']","['Department of Neurosurgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin, P.R.

However, its effectiveness in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and its molecular mechanisms are still unclear. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of TMP against Jurkat and SUP-B15 ALL cell lines and to investigate the possible detailed mechanism of action of TMP. A Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was employed to examine the proliferation of Jurkat and SUP-B15 cells. Flow cytometric analysis was conducted to detect the cell cycle distribution and apoptotic rate. The expression of total glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), cox-2, survivin, bcl-2 and p27 RNA and protein levels was detected by quantitative real-time PCR and western blot assay, respectively. Additionally, western blot analysis was used to determine the whole-cell and nuclear protein levels of GSK-3beta downstream transcription factors, NF-kappaB (p65) and c-myc. TMP inhibited the proliferation of Jurkat and SUP-B15 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with IC(5)(0) values of 120 and 200 microg/ml, respectively at 48 h. TMP induced the apoptosis of Jurkat and SUP-B15 cells and synergistically blocked cell cycle progression at the G0/G1 phase. Cells treated with TMP exhibited significantly attenuated GSK-3beta, NF-kappaB (p65) and c-myc expression, followed by downregulation of bcl-2, cox-2 and survivin and an upregulation of p27. The results showed that TMP induced apoptosis and caused cell cycle arrest in Jurkat and SUP-B15 cells through the downregulation of GSK-3beta, which may have further prevented the induced translocation of NF-kappaB and c-myc from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.","['Wang, Xiao-Jing', 'Xu, You-Hua', 'Yang, Gui-Cun', 'Chen, Hong-Xia', 'Zhang, Ping']","['Wang XJ', 'Xu YH', 'Yang GC', 'Chen HX', 'Zhang P']","['Key Laboratory of Developmental Diseases in Childhood, Chongqing, P.R.

Recently, the isoform STAT3 has been implicated to play a central role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary hypertension (PH). In human PH activated STAT3 (pSTAT3) was shown to directly trigger expression of the provirus integration site for Moloney murine leukemia virus (Pim-1), which promotes proliferation and resistance to apoptosis in SMCs. We designed this study to investigate the hypothesis that pSTAT3 and Pim-1 pulmonary vascular expression is increased in nitrofen-induced CDH. METHODS: Pregnant rats were exposed to nitrofen or vehicle on D9.5. Fetuses were sacrificed on D21 and divided into nitrofen (n=16) and control group (n=16). QRT-PCR, western blotting, and confocal-immunofluorescence were performed to determine pulmonary gene and protein expression levels of pSTAT3 and Pim-1. RESULTS: Pulmonary Pim-1 gene expression was significantly increased in the CDH group compared to controls. Western blotting and confocal-microscopy confirmed increased pulmonary protein expression of Pim-1 and increased activation of pSTAT3 in CDH lungs compared to controls. CONCLUSION: Markedly increased gene and protein expression of Pim-1 and activated pSTAT3 in the pulmonary vasculature of nitrofen-induced CDH lungs suggest that pSTAT3 and Pim-1 are important mediators of PH in nitrofen-induced CDH.","['Hofmann, Alejandro D', 'Takahashi, Toshiaki', 'Duess, Johannes', 'Gosemann, Jan-Hendrik', 'Puri, Prem']","['Hofmann AD', 'Takahashi T', 'Duess J', 'Gosemann JH', 'Puri P']","[""National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", ""National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", ""National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland; School of Medicine and Medical Science and Conway Institute of Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, Ireland."", ""National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland."", ""National Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, Dublin, Ireland; School of Medicine and Medical Science and Conway Institute of Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, Ireland.

PML also acts as a restriction factor that suppresses incoming viral genomes, therefore playing an important role in intrinsic defense. Here, we show that PML positively regulates type I interferon response by promoting transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and that this regulation by PML is counteracted by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1 protein. Small hairpin RNA-mediated PML knockdown in human fibroblasts reduced ISG induction by treatment of interferon-beta or infection with UV-inactivated HCMV. PML was required for accumulation of activated STAT1 and STAT2, interacted with them and HDAC1 and HDAC2, and was associated with ISG promoters after HCMV infection. During HCMV infection, viral IE1 protein interacted with PML, STAT1, STAT2, and HDACs. Analysis of IE1 mutant viruses revealed that, in addition to the STAT2-binding domain, the PML-binding domain of IE1 was necessary for suppression of interferon-beta-mediated ISG transcription, and that IE1 inhibited ISG transcription by sequestering interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) in a manner requiring its binding of PML and STAT2, but not of HDACs. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that PML participates in type I interferon-induced ISG expression by regulating ISGF3, and that this regulation by PML is counteracted by HCMV IE1, highlighting a widely shared viral strategy targeting PML to evade intrinsic and innate defense mechanisms.","['Kim, Young-Eui', 'Ahn, Jin-Hyun']","['Kim YE', 'Ahn JH']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Samsung Biomedical Research Institute, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Pathog,PLoS pathogens,101238921,"['0 (IE1 protein, cytomegalovirus)', '0 (IRF9 protein, human)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 2)']",IM,"['Cytomegalovirus/genetics/*metabolism', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylase 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interferon Type I/genetics/*metabolism', 'Interferon-Stimulated Gene Factor 3, gamma Subunit/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT2 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/02/09 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.ppat.1004785 [doi]', 'PPATHOGENS-D-14-02716 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Pathog. 2015 Mar 26;11(3):e1004785. doi: 10.1371/journal.ppat.1004785. eCollection 2015 Mar.,20150326,PMC4374831,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we have shown that, despite the lack of a paternal genome, human parthenogenetic (PG) embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can form proliferating neural stem cells (NSCs) that are capable of differentiation into physiologically functional neurons while maintaining allele-specific expression of imprinted genes. Since biparental (""normal"") hESC-derived NSCs (N NSCs) are targeted by immune cells, we characterized the immunogenicity of PG NSCs. Flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry revealed that both N NSCs and PG NSCs exhibited surface expression of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I but not HLA-DR molecules. Functional analyses using an in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction assay resulted in less proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with PG compared with N NSCs. In addition, natural killer (NK) cells cytolyzed PG less than N NSCs. At a molecular level, expression analyses of immune regulatory factors revealed higher HLA-G levels in PG compared with N NSCs. In line with this finding, MIR152, which represses HLA-G expression, is less transcribed in PG compared with N cells. Blockage of HLA-G receptors ILT2 and KIR2DL4 on natural killer cell leukemia (NKL) cells increased cytolysis of PG NSCs. Together this indicates that PG NSCs have unique immunological properties due to elevated HLA-G expression.","['Schmitt, Jessica', 'Eckardt, Sigrid', 'Schlegel, Paul G', 'Siren, Anna-Leena', 'Bruttel, Valentin S', 'McLaughlin, K John', 'Wischhusen, Jorg', 'Muller, Albrecht M']","['Schmitt J', 'Eckardt S', 'Schlegel PG', 'Siren AL', 'Bruttel VS', 'McLaughlin KJ', 'Wischhusen J', 'Muller AM']","['Institute for Medical Radiology and Cell Research (MSZ) in the Center for Experimental Molecular Medicine (ZEMM), University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', ""Center for Molecular and Human Genetics, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America."", ""University Children's Hospital Wurzburg, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Wurzburg, Germany."", 'Department of Neurosurgery, Section for Experimental Tumor Immunology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'University of Wurzburg Medical School, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Section for Experimental Tumor Immunology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', ""Center for Molecular and Human Genetics, The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, United States of America."", 'University of Wurzburg Medical School, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Section for Experimental Tumor Immunology, University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.', 'Institute for Medical Radiology and Cell Research (MSZ) in the Center for Experimental Molecular Medicine (ZEMM), University of Wurzburg, Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (HLA-G Antigens)', '0 (MIRN152 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/genetics/immunology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Embryonic Stem Cells/*cytology', '*Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'HLA-DR Antigens/genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'HLA-G Antigens/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Neural Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/03/29 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/29 06:00 [medline]']","['molmed.2014.00188 [pii]', '10.2119/molmed.2014.00188 [doi]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2015 Mar 23;21:185-96. doi: 10.2119/molmed.2014.00188.,20150323,PMC4503648,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although these fusions have been successfully targeted with kinase inhibitors, drug-resistance and relapse continue to limit long-term survival, highlighting the need for continued innovative drug discovery. We developed a time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) -based assay to identify compounds that disrupt stimulation of the ABL kinase by blocking its ability to bind the positive regulator RIN1. This assay was used in a high throughput screen (HTS) of two small molecule libraries totaling 444,743 compounds. 708 confirmed hits were counter-screened to eliminate off-target inhibitors and reanalyzed to prioritize compounds with IC50 values below 10 muM. The CML cell line K562 was then used to identify five compounds that decrease MAPK1/3 phosphorylation, which we determined to be an indicator of RIN1-dependent ABL signaling. One of these compounds is a thiadiazole, and the other four are structurally related acyl piperidine amides.

We show that the global dynamics of the model system are determined by two threshold values R0, the corresponding reproductive number of a viral infection, and R1, the corresponding reproductive number of a CTL response, respectively. If R0 < 1, the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, and the HTLV-I viruses are cleared. If R1<1<R0, the immune-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable, and the HTLV-I infection is chronic but with no persistent CTL response. If 1<R1, a unique HAM/TSP equilibrium exists, and the HTLV-I infection becomes chronic with a persistent CTL response. Moreover, we show that the immune delay can destabilize the HAM/TSP equilibrium, leading to Hopf bifurcations. Our numerical simulations suggest that if 1<R1, an increase of the intracellular delay may stabilize the HAM/TSP equilibrium while the immune delay can destabilize it. If both delays increase, the stability of the HAM/TSP equilibrium may generate rich dynamics combining the 'stabilizing' effects from the intracellular delay with those 'destabilizing' influences from immune delay.","['Lu, Xuejuan', 'Hui, Lulu', 'Liu, Shengqiang', 'Li, Jia']","['Lu X', 'Hui L', 'Liu S', 'Li J']","['Academy of Fundamental and Interdisciplinary Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, 3041#, 2 Yi-Kuang street, Harbin, 150080, China. lujuan02@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Math Biosci Eng,Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,101197794,,IM,"['Animals', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*virology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate/immunology', '*Models, Immunological', '*Virus Internalization', 'Virus Replication/*immunology']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3934/mbe.2015.12.431 [doi]'],ppublish,Math Biosci Eng. 2015 Jun;12(3):431-49. doi: 10.3934/mbe.2015.12.431.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This variability in clinical course has spiked the search for prognostic markers able to predict patient evolution at the moment of diagnosis. Markers demonstrated to be of value are the mutation status of the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region genes (IGHV) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) expression. High LPL mRNA expression has been associated with short treatment free (TFS) and decreased overall survival (OS) in CLL. The LPL SNPs rs301 (T<C), rs328 (C<G) and rs13702 (T<C) have been associated with various metabolic disorders, but the association with CLL evolution is unknown. Here, in a cohort of 248 patients, we show that patients with the LPL SNP rs13702 wild-type T/T genotype had significantly shorter OS than patients with C/C and T/C genotypes (median time until CLL related death: 90 and 156 months respectively, p=0.008). The same was observed for LPL SNP rs301 (median time until CLL related death T/T: 102 and C/C, T/C: 144 months, p=0.03). Both SNPs rs301 and rs13702 were significantly associated with each other and notably, no association was found between IGHV status and presence of the SNP genotypes, indicating that these LPL SNPs are reliable prognostic markers that could add extra prognostic and predictive information to classical markers and help to improve the management of CLL.","['Rombout, Ans', 'Stamatopoulos, Basile', 'Lagneaux, Laurence', 'Lust, Sofie', 'Offner, Fritz', 'Naessens, Evelien', 'Vanderstraeten, Hanne', 'Verhasselt, Bruno', 'Philippe, Jan']","['Rombout A', 'Stamatopoulos B', 'Lagneaux L', 'Lust S', 'Offner F', 'Naessens E', 'Vanderstraeten H', 'Verhasselt B', 'Philippe J']","['Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Therapy, Institut Jules Bordet, Universite Libre de Bruxelles (ULB), Brussels, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Microbiology and Immunology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.1.34 (Lipoprotein Lipase)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*enzymology/*genetics', 'Lipoprotein Lipase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0121526 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-54190 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 26;10(3):e0121526. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0121526. eCollection 2015.,20150326,PMC4374908,,,,,,,['PLoS One. 2015;10(6):e0131029.

In this disease, kidney involvement is usually silent, and is rarely reported in the literature. This study provides a clinicopathological analysis of all-cause kidney disease in CLL/SLL patients. METHODS: Fifteen CLL/SLL patients with kidney biopsy were identified retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, pathological and laboratory data were assessed at biopsy, and during follow-up. RESULTS: At biopsy 11 patients presented impaired renal function, 7 patients nephrotic syndrome, 6 patients dysproteinemia, and 3 patients cryoglobulinemia. Kidney pathology revealed CLL/SLL-specific monoclonal infiltrate in 10 biopsies, glomerulopathy in 9 biopsies (5 membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, 2 minimal change disease, 1 glomerulonephritis with organized microtubular monoclonal immunoglobulin deposits, 1 AHL amyloidosis). Five patients presented interstitial granulomas attributed to CLL/SLL. After treatment of the hematological disease, improvement of renal function was observed in 7/11 patients, and remission of nephrotic syndrome in 5/7 patients. During follow-up, aggravation of the kidney disease systematically occurred in the absence of favorable response to hematological treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A broad spectrum of kidney diseases is associated with CLL/SLL. In this setting, kidney biopsy can provide important information for diagnosis and therapeutic guidance.","['Poitou-Verkinder, Anne-Laure', 'Francois, Arnaud', 'Drieux, Fanny', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Legallicier, Bruno', 'Moulin, Bruno', 'Godin, Michel', 'Guerrot, Dominique']","['Poitou-Verkinder AL', 'Francois A', 'Drieux F', 'Lepretre S', 'Legallicier B', 'Moulin B', 'Godin M', 'Guerrot D']","['Service de Nephrologie, CHU Hopitaux de Rouen, Rouen, France.', ""Service d'Anatomie Pathologique, CHU Hopitaux de Rouen, Rouen, France."", ""Service d'Anatomie Pathologique, CHU Hopitaux de Rouen, Rouen, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France."", 'Service de Nephrologie, CHU Hopitaux de Rouen, Rouen, France.', 'Service de Nephrologie, CHU Hopitaux de Strasbourg, Strasbourg, France.', 'Service de Nephrologie, CHU Hopitaux de Rouen, Rouen, France; INSERM Unite 1096, Universite de Medecine-Pharmacie de Rouen, Rouen, France.', 'Service de Nephrologie, CHU Hopitaux de Rouen, Rouen, France; INSERM Unite 1096, Universite de Medecine-Pharmacie de Rouen, Rouen, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Demography', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glomerulonephritis/complications', 'Humans', 'Kidney/diagnostic imaging/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/complications', 'Radiography', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0119156 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-41707 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 26;10(3):e0119156. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0119156. eCollection 2015.,20150326,PMC4374947,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A basic tool of this approach is a biologically motivated mathematical model of the granulocytopoietic system, which is capable of predicting the dynamics of blood granulocytes and bone marrow granulocytopoietic cells in acutely and chronically irradiated humans. The performed modeling studies revealed that the dose dependence of the scaled maximal concentration of bone marrow granulocytopoietic cells with radiation-induced changes, which make a cell premalignant, and the dose dependence of the scaled integral of the concentration of these cells over the period of the response of the granulocytopoietic system to acute irradiation conform to the dose dependence of excess relative risk for myeloid leukemia among atomic bomb survivors in a wide range of doses and in a range of comparatively low doses, respectively. Additionally, the dose dependence of the scaled integral of the concentration of these cells over the period of the response of the granulocytopoietic system to continuous irradiation with the dose rate and durations, which were used in brachytherapy, conforms to the dose dependence of excess relative risk for leukemia among the respective groups of exposed patients. These modeling findings demonstrate the potential to use the proposed modeling approach for predicting the excess relative risk for myeloid leukemia among humans exposed to various radiation regimes. Obviously, this is especially important in the assessment of the risks for radiogenic myeloid leukemia among people residing in contaminated areas after an accident or explosion of a radiological device, among astronauts on long-term space missions, as well as among patients treated with radiotherapy.","['Smirnova, O A']",['Smirnova OA'],"['*Federal State Unitary Enterprise Research and Technical Center of Radiation-Chemical Safety and Hygiene, 40 Shchukinskaya st., Moscow, 123182, Russian Federation.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Health Phys,Health physics,2985093R,,IM,"['Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Granulocytes/*radiation effects', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Models, Biological', '*Risk Assessment']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/05/27 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/HP.0000000000000259 [doi]', '00004032-201505000-00002 [pii]']",ppublish,Health Phys. 2015 May;108(5):492-502. doi: 10.1097/HP.0000000000000259.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To identify clinical challenges among hematologists and medical oncologists regarding the provision of care to patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), or B-cell lymphomas. Methods Hematologists and medical oncologists in active practice in the United States and who have a case load of >/= 1 patient a year with CML, ALL, or B-cell lymphoma were recruited. The initial qualitative phase consisted of an online case-based survey followed by an interview exploring the contextual and behavioral factors that influence treatment decisions (n = 27). The analysis of qualitative data then informed a quantitative phase, in which 121 participants completed an online survey composed of case vignettes, multiple choice, and semantic differential rating scale questions. The respondents' answers were compared with recommendations from treatment guidelines and faculty experts. RESULTS: A higher frequency of bone marrow biopsies was reported compared with expert faculty recommendations by 74% of oncologists. Many respondents failed to recognize the clinical relevance of BCR-ABL mutations other than T315I. Respondents reported perceiving difficulties in individualizing treatment and interpreting response to treatment in patients with ALL and B-cell lymphomas. Fewer than 30% of respondents recognized the mechanisms of action of 5 of the 9 promising investigational agents presented. LIMITATIONS: Participant self-selection bias is a possibility because participation was voluntary. Practice gaps are not based on clinical data, but hypothetical case situations and self-report. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study can guide education to address the identified challenges in caring for patients with hematologic malignancies and improving patient care.

Sansevieria liberica Gerome and Labroy (Agavaceae) is a perennial plant widely distributed in tropical Africa. Preparations of the plant are commonly used across Nigeria for the treatment of inflammatory conditions. Based on the fact that herbal medicine is a strong component of integrative medicine, this study was conducted to evaluate the anticancer activity of root extracts of Sansevieria liberica. Methods. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) in vitro cytotoxicity assay, Sarcoma-180 (S-180) ascites and solid tumor, and L1210 lymphoid leukemia in vivo models were used in this study. Results. SL-A002 (IC50 23 microg/mL with HeLa), SL-A003 (IC50 22 microg/mL with HCT-116), and SL-A004 (IC50 23 and 18 microg/mL with A549 and THP-1, resp.) demonstrated significant activity in the SRB cytotoxicity assay. Potency was highest with the following pairs of extract : cancer cell line: SL-A002 : HeLa (IC50 23 microg/mL), SL-A003 : HCT-116 (IC50 22 microg/mL), and SL-A004 : THP-1 (IC50 18 microg/mL). SL-A002 demonstrated significant dose-dependent antitumor activity in the Sarcoma-180 (S-180) ascites model with peak effect produced at the dose of 120 mg/kg (i.p.) with inhibition of 89.36% compared to 97.96% for 5-FU (20 mg/kg i.p.). The inhibition of tumor growth by SL-A002 in the S-180 solid tumor model was 47.40% compared to a value of 50.18% for 5-FU. SL-A002 was also significantly active in the L1210 lymphoid leukemia model with 158.33% increase in mean survival time, the same value for 5-FU. Conclusions. The hydroethanolic extract of Sansevieria liberica, SL-A002, possesses significant anticancer activity to warrant further extensive study to identify, isolate, and characterize the specific bioactive molecules responsible for the observed antitumor activity and the precise mechanism(s) of action.","['Akindele, Abidemi J', 'Wani, Zahoor A', 'Sharma, Sadhana', 'Mahajan, Girish', 'Satti, Naresh K', 'Adeyemi, Olufunmilayo O', 'Mondhe, Dilip M', 'Saxena, Ajit K']","['Akindele AJ', 'Wani ZA', 'Sharma S', 'Mahajan G', 'Satti NK', 'Adeyemi OO', 'Mondhe DM', 'Saxena AK']","['Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (Council of Scientific & Industrial Research), Jammu 180001, India ; Department of Pharmacology, Therapeutics & Toxicology (PTT), Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, PMB 12003, Lagos 23401, Nigeria.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (Council of Scientific & Industrial Research), Jammu 180001, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (Council of Scientific & Industrial Research), Jammu 180001, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (Council of Scientific & Industrial Research), Jammu 180001, India.', 'Natural Products Chemistry Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (Council of Scientific & Industrial Research), Jammu 180001, India.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Therapeutics & Toxicology (PTT), Faculty of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, University of Lagos, PMB 12003, Lagos 23401, Nigeria.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (Council of Scientific & Industrial Research), Jammu 180001, India.', 'Cancer Pharmacology Division, Indian Institute of Integrative Medicine (Council of Scientific & Industrial Research), Jammu 180001, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,101215021,,,,2015/03/27 06:00,2015/03/27 06:01,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/27 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/560404 [doi]'],ppublish,Evid Based Complement Alternat Med. 2015;2015:560404. doi: 10.1155/2015/560404.

Identification of somatic mutations in genes associated with pathogenesis and evolution of these myeloproliferative conditions (Janus Kinase 2; myeloproliferative leukemia virus gene; calreticulin) led to substantial changes in the international guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of Ph-negative MPN during the last few years.The MPN-Working Group (MPN-WG), a panel of hematologists with expertise in MPN diagnosis and treatment from various parts of India, examined applicability of this latest clinical and scientific evidence in the context of hematology practice in India.This manuscript summarizes the consensus recommendations formulated by the MPN-WG that can be followed as a guideline for management of patients with Ph-negative MPN in the context of clinical practice in India.","['Agarwal, M B', 'Malhotra, Hemant', 'Chakrabarti, Prantar', 'Varma, Neelam', 'Mathews, Vikram', 'Bhattacharyya, Jina', 'Seth, Tulika', 'Gayathri, K', 'Menon, Hari', 'Subramanian, P G', 'Sharma, Ajay', 'Bhattacharyya, Maitreyee', 'Mehta, Jay', 'Vaid, A K', 'Shah, Sandeep', 'Aggarwal, Shyam', 'Gogoi, P K', 'Nair, Reena', 'Agarwal, Usha', 'Varma, Subhash', 'Prasad, S V S S', 'Manipadam, Marie Therese']","['Agarwal MB', 'Malhotra H', 'Chakrabarti P', 'Varma N', 'Mathews V', 'Bhattacharyya J', 'Seth T', 'Gayathri K', 'Menon H', 'Subramanian PG', 'Sharma A', 'Bhattacharyya M', 'Mehta J', 'Vaid AK', 'Shah S', 'Aggarwal S', 'Gogoi PK', 'Nair R', 'Agarwal U', 'Varma S', 'Prasad SV', 'Manipadam MT']","['Department of Hematology, Bombay Hospital Institute of Medical Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, RK Birla Cancer Center, SMS Medical College Hospital, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India.', 'Department of Hematology, NRS Medical College, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Department of Hematology and Pathology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Guwahati Medical College and Hospital, Assam, India.', 'Department of Hematology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi Cantonment, India.', 'Department of Hematopathology, Lifeline Tapadia Diagnostic Centre, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Hematopathology Laboratory, Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Hematology and Center for Stem Cell Transplantation and Research, Army Research and Referral Hospital, Delhi Cantonment, India.', 'Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Medical College, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Centre of Excellence in Histopathology, SRL Diagnostics, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Cancer Institute-Division of Medical Oncology and Haemotology, Medanta-The Medicity, New Delhi, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Gujarat Cancer and Research Institute, Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, India.', 'East India Hematological Centre, Rajgarh Road, Guwahati, Assam, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Tata Medical Centre, Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Ashirwad Hematology Centre, Dadar, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.', 'Department of Pathology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, India.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Apollo Cancer Hospitals, Hyderabad, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol,Indian journal of medical and paediatric oncology : official journal of Indian Society of Medical & Paediatric Oncology,9604571,,,,2015/03/27 06:00,2015/03/27 06:01,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/27 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/0971-5851.151770 [doi]', 'IJMPO-36-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Med Paediatr Oncol. 2015 Jan-Mar;36(1):3-16. doi: 10.4103/0971-5851.151770.,,PMC4363847,['NOTNLM'],"['Essential thrombocythemia', 'myeloproliferative neoplasms', 'polycythemia vera', 'primary myelofibrosis']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Novel therapeutic targets against preleukemic stem cells need to be identified for potentially curative strategies. We conducted parallel transcriptional analysis of highly fractionated stem and progenitor populations in MDS, AML, and control samples and found interleukin 8 (IL8) to be consistently overexpressed in patient samples. The receptor for IL8, CXCR2, was also significantly increased in MDS CD34(+) cells from a large clinical cohort and was predictive of increased transfusion dependence. High CXCR2 expression was also an adverse prognostic factor in The Cancer Genome Atlas AML cohort, further pointing to the critical role of the IL8-CXCR2 axis in AML/MDS. Functionally, CXCR2 inhibition by knockdown and pharmacologic approaches led to a significant reduction in proliferation in several leukemic cell lines and primary MDS/AML samples via induction of G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Importantly, inhibition of CXCR2 selectively inhibited immature hematopoietic stem cells from MDS/AML samples without an effect on healthy controls. CXCR2 knockdown also impaired leukemic growth in vivo. Together, these studies demonstrate that the IL8 receptor CXCR2 is an adverse prognostic factor in MDS/AML and is a potential therapeutic target against immature leukemic stem cell-enriched cell fractions in MDS and AML.","['Schinke, Carolina', 'Giricz, Orsolya', 'Li, Weijuan', 'Shastri, Aditi', 'Gordon, Shanisha', 'Barreyro, Laura', 'Bhagat, Tushar', 'Bhattacharyya, Sanchari', 'Ramachandra, Nandini', 'Bartenstein, Matthias', 'Pellagatti, Andrea', 'Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Wickrema, Amittha', 'Yu, Yiting', 'Will, Britta', 'Wei, Sheng', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Verma, Amit']","['Schinke C', 'Giricz O', 'Li W', 'Shastri A', 'Gordon S', 'Barreyro L', 'Bhagat T', 'Bhattacharyya S', 'Ramachandra N', 'Bartenstein M', 'Pellagatti A', 'Boultwood J', 'Wickrema A', 'Yu Y', 'Will B', 'Wei S', 'Steidl U', 'Verma A']","['Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Leukemia and Lymphoma Research Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, and National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom;', 'Leukemia and Lymphoma Research Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, and National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre, Oxford, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology-Oncology, Cancer Research Center, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL; and.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Department of Immunology, Clinical Immunology, Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY;']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8B)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/genetics/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Mice', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/mortality', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/08/06 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/01/16 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31692-X [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-01-621631 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 14;125(20):3144-52. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-01-621631.

We hypothesized that differences in KIR and HLA class I genotypes predictive of varying degrees of receptor-ligand binding affinities influence clinical outcomes in autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Using genomic DNA from a homogeneous cohort of 125 AML patients treated with AHCT, we performed KIR and HLA class I genotyping and found that patients with a compound KIR3DL1(+) and HLA-Bw4-80Thr(+), HLA-Bw4-80Ile(-) genotype, predictive of low-affinity interactions, had a low incidence of relapse, compared with patients with a KIR3DL1(+) and HLA-Bw4-80Ile(+) genotype, predictive of high-affinity interactions (hazard ratio [HR], 0.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-0.78; p = 0.02). This effect was influenced by HLA-Bw4 copy number, such that relapse progressively increased with one copy of HLA-Bw4-80Ile (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.84-3.1; p = 0.15) to two to three copies (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.4-6.5; p = 0.005) and progressively decreased with one to two copies of HLA-Bw4-80Thr (p = 0.13). Among KIR3DL1(+) and HLA-Bw4-80Ile(+) patients, a predicted low-affinity KIR2DL2/3(+) and HLA-C1/C1 genotype was associated with lower relapse than a predicted high-affinity KIR2DL1(+) and HLA-C2/C2 genotype (HR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09-0.73; p = 0.01). Similarly, a KIR3DL1(+) and HLA-Bw4-80Thr(+), HLA-Bw4-80Ile(-) genotype, or lack of KIR3DL1(+) and HLA-Bw4-80Ile(+) genotype, rescued KIR2DL1(+) and HLA-C2/C2 patients from high relapse (p = 0.007). These findings support a role for NK cell graft-versus-leukemia activity modulated by NK cell receptor-ligand affinities in AHCT for AML.","['Marra, John', 'Greene, Justin', 'Hwang, Jimmy', 'Du, Juan', 'Damon, Lloyd', 'Martin, Tom', 'Venstrom, Jeffrey M']","['Marra J', 'Greene J', 'Hwang J', 'Du J', 'Damon L', 'Martin T', 'Venstrom JM']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143; and.', 'Biostatistics Core, University of California, San Francisco, Helen Diller Comprehensive Cancer Center, San Francisco, CA 94115.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143; and.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94143; and venstromj@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (HLA-B Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Genotype', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics/*immunology', 'HLA-B Antigens/*genetics/immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/immunology', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/07/21 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/21 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1402124 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1402124 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 May 1;194(9):4222-30. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1402124.

Studies in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) patients revealed a new form of multidrug resistance. Here, increased glioma-associated protein GLI1 leads to elevation of the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) enzymes. UGTs add glucuronic acid to xenobiotics and metabolites. Traditionally, the loss of these enzymes is thought to contribute to cancer as a result of impaired clearance of environmental carcinogens. However, we demonstrate that overexpression of UGTs can contribute to oncogenesis by promoting drug resistance. Indeed, UGT levels in AML patients treated with ribavirin and/or cytarabine were elevated at relapse relative to diagnosis. This was reversed by GLI1 inhibition, suggesting a clinically relevant strategy to overcome drug resistance. Further, overexpression of UGTs can also lead to drug resistance in other cancers, such as certain Hsp90 inhibitors and vorinostat in colorectal and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, respectively. Not all drugs are targets of glucuronidation, suggesting that UGT status could be relevant to treatment choice. Here, we describe several facets of UGT biology and how these could be exploited clinically. These studies demonstrate how drugs in cancer cells can be metabolized differentially than their normal counterparts. In summary, we describe a new form of drug resistance relevant to a variety of cancer contexts.","['Zahreddine, Hiba Ahmad', 'Borden, Katherine L B']","['Zahreddine HA', 'Borden KL']","['Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Institute of Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC), Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada. katherine.borden@umontreal.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (GLI1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zinc Finger Protein GLI1)', '8A5D83Q4RW (Glucuronic Acid)', 'EC 2.4.1.17 (Glucuronosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Glucuronic Acid/metabolism', 'Glucuronosyltransferase/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Humans', 'Inactivation, Metabolic', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/enzymology', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Zinc Finger Protein GLI1']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/02/20 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/20 06:00 [medline]']","['1078-0432.CCR-14-1370 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1370 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2015 May 15;21(10):2207-10. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-14-1370.

MicroRNA-155 (miR-155) plays an important role in the innate immune response by regulating macrophage function; however, the effects of miR-155 in macrophages on atherosclerosis are controversial. We hypothesized that the stage-dependent target selection of miR-155 in macrophages determines its effects on atherosclerosis. APPROACH AND RESULTS: The expression of miR-155 increased in lesional macrophages of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice between 12 and 24 weeks of a high-cholesterol diet. Mir155 knockout in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice enhanced lesion formation, increased the lesional macrophage content, and promoted macrophage proliferation after 12 weeks of the high-cholesterol diet. In vitro, miR-155 inhibited macrophage proliferation by suppressing colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor, which was upregulated in lesional macrophages of Mir155(-/-) apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. By contrast, Mir155 deficiency reduced necrotic core formation and the deposition of apoptotic cell debris, thereby preventing the progression of atherosclerosis between 12 and 24 weeks of the high-cholesterol diet. miR-155 inhibited efferocytosis in vitro by targeting B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 and thus activating RhoA (ras homolog gene family, member A). Accordingly, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 was upregulated in lesional macrophages of Mir155(-/-) apolipoprotein E-deficient mice after 24 weeks, but not after 12 weeks of the high-cholesterol diet. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate a stage-specific role of miR-155 in lesion formation. miR-155 suppressed macrophage proliferation by targeting colony-stimulating factor-1 receptor in early and impaired efferocytosis by downregulating B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 in advanced atherosclerosis. Therefore, targeting the interaction between miR-155 and B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 may be a promising approach to inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis.","['Wei, Yuanyuan', 'Zhu, Mengyu', 'Corbalan-Campos, Judit', 'Heyll, Kathrin', 'Weber, Christian', 'Schober, Andreas']","['Wei Y', 'Zhu M', 'Corbalan-Campos J', 'Heyll K', 'Weber C', 'Schober A']","['From the Experimental Vascular Medicine, Institute for Cardiovascular Prevention, Medical Faculty of Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany (Y.W., M.Z., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); Institute for Molecular Cardiovascular Research, Medical Faculty of RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany (Y.W., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); and Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany (C.W., A.S.).', 'From the Experimental Vascular Medicine, Institute for Cardiovascular Prevention, Medical Faculty of Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany (Y.W., M.Z., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); Institute for Molecular Cardiovascular Research, Medical Faculty of RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany (Y.W., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); and Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany (C.W., A.S.).', 'From the Experimental Vascular Medicine, Institute for Cardiovascular Prevention, Medical Faculty of Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany (Y.W., M.Z., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); Institute for Molecular Cardiovascular Research, Medical Faculty of RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany (Y.W., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); and Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany (C.W., A.S.).', 'From the Experimental Vascular Medicine, Institute for Cardiovascular Prevention, Medical Faculty of Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany (Y.W., M.Z., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); Institute for Molecular Cardiovascular Research, Medical Faculty of RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany (Y.W., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); and Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany (C.W., A.S.).', 'From the Experimental Vascular Medicine, Institute for Cardiovascular Prevention, Medical Faculty of Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany (Y.W., M.Z., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); Institute for Molecular Cardiovascular Research, Medical Faculty of RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany (Y.W., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); and Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany (C.W., A.S.).', 'From the Experimental Vascular Medicine, Institute for Cardiovascular Prevention, Medical Faculty of Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Munich, Germany (Y.W., M.Z., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); Institute for Molecular Cardiovascular Research, Medical Faculty of RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany (Y.W., J.C.-C., K.H., C.W., A.S.); and Munich Heart Alliance, Munich, Germany (C.W., A.S.). aschober@med.lmu.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",9505803,"['0 (Apolipoproteins E)', '0 (Bcl6 protein, mouse)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn155 microRNA, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (RhoA protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rho GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rhoA GTP-Binding Protein)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Aortic Diseases/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Apolipoproteins E/deficiency/genetics', 'Apoptosis', 'Atherosclerosis/genetics/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cholesterol/blood', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Diet, High-Fat', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Necrosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'rho GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'rhoA GTP-Binding Protein']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/06/03 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/03 06:00 [medline]']","['ATVBAHA.114.304723 [pii]', '10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304723 [doi]']",ppublish,Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2015 Apr;35(4):796-803. doi: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304723.

WSS is caused by heterozygous mutations in KMT2A (also known as MLL), a gene encoding a histone methyltransferase. Here, we identify six novel KMT2A mutations in six WSS patients, with four mutations occurring de novo. Interestingly, some of the patients were initially diagnosed with atypical Kabuki syndrome, which is caused by mutations in KMT2D or KDM6A, genes also involved in histone methylation. KMT2A mutations and clinical features are summarized in our six patients together with eight previously reported patients. Furthermore, clinical comparison of the two syndromes is discussed in detail.","['Miyake, N', 'Tsurusaki, Y', 'Koshimizu, E', 'Okamoto, N', 'Kosho, T', 'Brown, N J', 'Tan, T Y', 'Yap, P J J', 'Suzumura, H', 'Tanaka, T', 'Nagai, T', 'Nakashima, M', 'Saitsu, H', 'Niikawa, N', 'Matsumoto, N']","['Miyake N', 'Tsurusaki Y', 'Koshimizu E', 'Okamoto N', 'Kosho T', 'Brown NJ', 'Tan TY', 'Yap PJ', 'Suzumura H', 'Tanaka T', 'Nagai T', 'Nakashima M', 'Saitsu H', 'Niikawa N', 'Matsumoto N']","['Department of Human Genetics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Osaka Medical Center and Research Institute for Maternal and Child Health, Izumi, Japan.', 'Department of Medical Genetics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Genetics, Austin Health, Heidelberg, Australia.', ""Victorian Clinical Genetics Services, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia."", ""Victorian Clinical Genetics Services, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia."", ""Department of Paediatrics, University of Melbourne, Royal Children's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia."", ""Victorian Clinical Genetics Services, Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Dokkyo Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Clinical research, National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Medical Center, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Dokkyo Medical University Koshigaya Hospital, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Health Science University of Hokkaido, Hokkaido, Japan.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Yokohama City University Graduate School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Clin Genet,Clinical genetics,0253664,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Abnormalities, Multiple/*diagnosis/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Exome', 'Female', 'Genetic Loci', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', '*Phenotype']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/10/14 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/12/09 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/cge.12586 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Genet. 2016 Jan;89(1):115-9. doi: 10.1111/cge.12586.

Therefore, the use of RT is controversial. In the current study, the authors characterized updated trends in RT for elderly patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive ESBC. METHODS: Patients aged >/=70 years with ER-positive ESBC measuring </=2 cm after lumpectomy with negative resection margins and known RT details were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. Patients were classified by year of diagnosis and segregated into 3 groups relative to the initial publication and updated presentation of the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) 9343 trial. RT use overall, prescription of hypofractionated RT, and use of boost RT were compared between groups using logistic regression analysis, and the influence of clinicopathologic covariates was determined with multivariable logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 122,796 elderly patients with ER-positive ESBC who were diagnosed between 1998 and 2011 were identified. Overall, 84,649 patients (68.9%) received adjuvant RT, with a decline observed between successive cohorts (71.3% in the pre-initial publication cohort, 69.5% in the pre-update cohort, and 64.7% in the post-update cohort; P <.001). Hypofractionated RT use increased among treated patients over time (P<.001). Boost RT was used in 67.5% of patients, with a decline noted between the pre-update and post-update cohorts (68.7% vs 57.7%; P<.001). Overall RT use as well as use of boost RT were found to be lower among older patients and those with lower-grade or smaller tumors (P<.001), whereas hypofractionated RT was used more commonly in these groups (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: RT use appears to have declined in elderly patients with ER-positive ESBC, a finding that is reflective of evidence-based practice integrating mature trial data. Further research is needed to develop tools to aid in the decision-making process regarding the delivery or avoidance of RT in this setting.","['Rutter, Charles E', 'Lester-Coll, Nataniel H', 'Mancini, Brandon R', 'Corso, Christopher D', 'Park, Henry S', 'Yeboa, Debra N', 'Gross, Cary P', 'Evans, Suzanne B']","['Rutter CE', 'Lester-Coll NH', 'Mancini BR', 'Corso CD', 'Park HS', 'Yeboa DN', 'Gross CP', 'Evans SB']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Department of Therapeutic Radiology, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.', 'Cancer Outcomes, Public Policy, and Effectiveness Research Center, Yale School of Medicine, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Receptors, Estrogen)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemistry/*pathology/*radiotherapy', 'Decision Making', 'Dose Fractionation, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Logistic Models', '*Mastectomy, Segmental', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Receptors, Estrogen/analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/10/03 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29377 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Jul 15;121(14):2331-40. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29377.

MET is mutated or amplified in several malignancies. In myeloma, MET is not mutated, but patients have high plasma concentrations of HGF, high levels of MET expression, and gene copy number, which are associated with poor prognosis and advanced disease. Our previous studies demonstrated that MET is critical for myeloma cell survival and its knockdown induces apoptosis. In our current study, we tested tivantinib (ARQ 197), a small-molecule pharmacological MET inhibitor. At clinically achievable concentrations, tivantinib induced apoptosis by >50% in all 12 human myeloma cell lines tested. This biologic response was associated with down-regulation of MET signaling and inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways, which are downstream of the HGF/MET axis. Tivantinib was equally effective in inducing apoptosis in myeloma cell lines resistant to standard chemotherapy (melphalan, dexamethasone, bortezomib, and lenalidomide) as well as in cells that were co-cultured with a protective bone marrow microenvironment or with exogenous cytokines. Tivantinib induced apoptosis in CD138+ plasma cells from patients and demonstrated efficacy in a myeloma xenograft mouse model. On the basis of these data, we initiated a clinical trial for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In conclusion, MET inhibitors may be an attractive target-based strategy for the treatment of MM.","['Zaman, Shadia', 'Shentu, Shujun', 'Yang, Jing', 'He, Jin', 'Orlowski, Robert Z', 'Stellrecht, Christine M', 'Gandhi, Varsha']","['Zaman S', 'Shentu S', 'Yang J', 'He J', 'Orlowski RZ', 'Stellrecht CM', 'Gandhi V']","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Experimental Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA; Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX, USA; Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.

Over a 10-yr interval, NPM1 mutation analysis was performed in 152 CMML at our institution. NPM1 mutations were identified in 8 (5.3%) patients, five men and three women, with a median age of 72 yr (range, 27-87). In all patients, the bone marrow was hypercellular with multilineage dysplasia, monocytosis, and retained maturation supporting a diagnosis of CMML. NPM1 mutation allele burden was <5% in two patients and >10% in six patients. Four (50%) patients, all with >10% NPM1, progressed AML with a median interval of 11 months (range, 1-21). Compared with 144 CMML without NPM1 mutations, CMML patients with NPM1 mutation presented with more severe anemia (P = 0.053), higher BM monocyte percentage (P = 0.033), and an increased tendency for AML progression (P = 0.088) and an inferior overall survival (P = 0.076). Mutations involving NRAS/KRAS (2/7), TET2(2/5), ASXL1(1/5,) and FLT3(0/8) were not significantly different between these two groups. In summary, CMML with NPM1 mutation shows histopathological features of CMML, but patients appear to have a high probability for AML progression and may require aggressive clinical intervention, especially in patients with a high mutation burden.","['Peng, Jie', 'Zuo, Zhuang', 'Fu, Bin', 'Oki, Yasuhiro', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Goswami, Maitrayee', 'Priyanka, Priyanka', 'Muzzafar, Tariq', 'Medeiros, L Jeffrey', 'Luthra, Rajyalakshmi', 'Wang, Sa A']","['Peng J', 'Zuo Z', 'Fu B', 'Oki Y', 'Tang G', 'Goswami M', 'Priyanka P', 'Muzzafar T', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Luthra R', 'Wang SA']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Central South University Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Central South University Xiangya Hospital, Changsha, China.', 'Department of Lymphoma/Myeloma, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Retrospective Studies']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/10/11 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12549 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2016 Jan;96(1):65-71. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12549.

Effective, less toxic therapies are needed to achieve and maintain durable remissions. METHODS: One hundred eighteen patients with newly diagnosed AML (median age, 68 years; range, 60-81 years) were treated with a regimen of clofarabine and low-dose cytarabine (LDAC) alternating with decitabine (DAC). The induction consisted of intravenous clofarabine at 20 mg/m(2) on days 1 to 5 combined with subcutaneous LDAC at 20 mg twice daily on days 1 to 10. Responding patients were then treated with a prolonged consolidation/maintenance regimen consisting of cycles of clofarabine plus LDAC alternating with cycles of DAC. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 68%. The complete remission (CR) rate was 60% overall, 71% for patients with a diploid karyotype, and 50% for patients with an adverse karyotype. The median overall survival (OS) was 11.1 months for all patients and 18.5 months for those achieving a CR/complete remission with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp). The median relapse-free survival for patients achieving a CR/CRp was 14.1 months. According to a multivariate analysis, only adverse cytogenetics and a white blood cell count >/= 10 x 10(9)/L predicted worse OS. The regimen was well tolerated with 4- and 8-week mortality rates of 3% and 7%, respectively. The most common nonhematologic adverse events were nausea, elevated liver enzymes, and rash. CONCLUSIONS: The lower intensity, prolonged-therapy program of clofarabine and LDAC alternating with DAC is well tolerated and highly effective in older patients with AML.","['Kadia, Tapan M', 'Faderl, Stefan', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Jabbour, Elias', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Borthakur, Gautam', 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Burger, Jan', 'Huang, Xuelin', 'Wang, Xuemei', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Brandt, Mark', 'Feliu, Jennie', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Kadia TM', 'Faderl S', 'Ravandi F', 'Jabbour E', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Borthakur G', 'Ferrajoli A', 'Konopleva M', 'Burger J', 'Huang X', 'Wang X', 'Pierce S', 'Brandt M', 'Feliu J', 'Cortes J', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Leukemia, John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack, New Jersey.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Adenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Arabinonucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Adenine Nucleotides/administration & dosage', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinonucleosides/administration & dosage', 'Azacitidine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Clofarabine', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nausea/chemically induced', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/10/03 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cncr.29367 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2015 Jul 15;121(14):2375-82. doi: 10.1002/cncr.29367.

Rarely, patients with HCL present with a lymphoma-like clinicopathological picture mimicking other types of low-grade B-cell lymphoma. Distinguishing HCL from other types of lymphoma is essential, given the different treatments and prognoses. We report two cases of the lymphomatous variant of HCL to draw attention to this unusual presentation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Two cases of HCL presented initially as salivary gland and soft tissue masses. Morphologically, the neoplastic cells showed a typical fried-egg or monocytoid appearance with reniform nuclei, and were positive for CD11c, CD20, CD25, CD103, annexin A1, and cyclin D1. Both cases were positive for the BRAF V600E mutation, as shown by pyrosequencing and mutation-specific immunohistochemistry. The diagnosis was challenging in both patients, and one patient experienced 5 years of disease relapse and progression after treatment with multiple lymphoma-type regimens before the final diagnosis of HCL was established and complete remission was achieved following cladribine therapy. CONCLUSIONS: HCL can very rarely present as an extranodal mass. Being aware of this unusual presentation of HCL is essential to avoid diagnostic confusion with other types of low-grade B-cell lymphoma and to facilitate appropriate therapy.","['Liu, Hui', 'Wang, Wei', 'Tang, Guilin', 'Yin, Cheng Cameron', 'Muzzafar, Tariq', 'Medeiros, Leonard Jeffrey', 'Hu, Shimin']","['Liu H', 'Wang W', 'Tang G', 'Yin CC', 'Muzzafar T', 'Medeiros LJ', 'Hu S']","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Xuzhou Medical College, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,,IM,"['Adult', '*Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diagnostic Errors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Soft Tissue Neoplasms/pathology', 'Submandibular Gland Neoplasms/pathology']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/08/19 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/08/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/his.12694 [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 2015 Nov;67(5):740-5. doi: 10.1111/his.12694.

Oncocers are ceRNAs taking crucial roles in oncogenic pathways processed in many types of cancer, and this study analyzes oncocer-mediated cross-talk by sponging microRNAs (miRNAs) in these pathways. While doing this, breast, liver, colon, prostate, gastric, lung, endometrium, thyroid and epithelial cancers and melanoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, glioblastoma, acute promyelocytic leukemia, retinoblastoma, and neuroblastoma were analyzed with respect to ceRNA-based carcinogenesis. This study defines, firstly, oncocers in the literature and contains all oncocer-related findings found up to now. Therefore, it will help to increase our comprehension about oncocer-mediated mechanisms. Via this study, a novel perspective would be produced to make clear cancer mechanisms and suggest novel approaches to regulate ceRNA networks via miRNA competition for cancer therapeutics. Graphical Abstract Multiple RNA transcripts have common MREs for the similar miRNA in their 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs). Upregulation of ceRNAs rises the abundance of specific MREs and shifts the miRNA pool distribution, as a result, leading to the increased expression of target mRNA. The depot of genomic mutations and epigenetic alterations changing gene function and expression causes cancers. Herewith, genome-based somatic base-pair mutations, DNA copy number alterations, chromosomal translocation, also transcript fusions, alternative splicing are usually seen in cancer situations. Consequently, such cases causing changed UTR expression in transcripts influence the levels of MRE or present new MREs into the cells. Alterations in MREs of ceRNAs affect the capability of a specific mRNA transcript to attach or titrate miRNAs. As a result, the disturbed ceRNA network can lead to diseases and cancers. As a new term in RNA world, oncocers-the name for ceRNAs taking crucial roles in oncogenic pathways-are processed in many types of cancer, and oncocer-mediated cross-talk are analyzed by sponging miRNAs in these pathways.","['Ergun, Sercan', 'Oztuzcu, Serdar']","['Ergun S', 'Oztuzcu S']","['Ulubey Vocational Higher School, Ordu University, Ordu, Turkey, sercanergun@msn.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'MicroRNAs/*physiology', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogenes', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/physiology']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/08/01 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s13277-015-3346-x [doi]'],ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 May;36(5):3129-36. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-3346-x.

We achieved a MEDLINE/EMBASE comprehensive search for studies published up to August 2014 investigating the association between use of statins and the risk of hematological malignancies, including Hodgkin- and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma. Fixed- and random-effect models were fitted to estimate the summary relative risk (RR) based on adjusted study-specific results. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the Q and I(2) statistics and the sources of heterogeneity were investigated using Deeks' test. Moreover, an influence analysis was performed. Finally, publication bias was evaluated using funnel plot and Egger's regression asymmetry test. Fourteen studies (10 case-control and four cohort studies) contributed to the analysis. Statin use, compared to nonuse of statins, was negatively associated with all hematological malignancies taken together (summary RR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77-0.96), with leukemia (0.83; 0.74-0.92), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.81; 0.68 to 0.96), but it was not related to the risk of myeloma (0.89; 0.53-1.51). Long-term users of statins showed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of all hematological malignancies taken together (0.78; 0.71-0.87). Statistically significant between-studies heterogeneity was observed for all outcome except for leukemia. Heterogeneity was caused by differences confounding-adjustment level of the included studies only for Myeloma. No significant evidence of publication bias was found.","['Pradelli, Danitza', 'Soranna, Davide', 'Zambon, Antonella', 'Catapano, Alberico', 'Mancia, Giuseppe', 'La Vecchia, Carlo', 'Corrao, Giovanni']","['Pradelli D', 'Soranna D', 'Zambon A', 'Catapano A', 'Mancia G', 'La Vecchia C', 'Corrao G']","['Department of Statistics and Quantitative Methods, Division of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Statistics and Quantitative Methods, Division of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Statistics and Quantitative Methods, Division of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Pharmacological Sciences, University of Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'IRCCS, Multimedica, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Medicine and Prevention, University of Milano-Bicocca, Monza (MB), Italy.', 'Department of Epidemiology, Institute for Pharmacological Research Mario Negri, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical Sciences and Public Health, University of Milano, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Statistics and Quantitative Methods, Division of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,['0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)'],IM,"['Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Odds Ratio', 'Publication Bias', '*Risk']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/02/03 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/09/29 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/10 00:00 [revised]', '2014/12/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cam4.411 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2015 May;4(5):770-80. doi: 10.1002/cam4.411.

In contrast to solid tumors, the primary objective of molecular pathology in hematopoietic neoplasms is not the prediction of drug efficacy but the diagnosis itself by excluding reactive proliferation and by using molecular features for tumor classification. In the case of malignant lymphomas, the most commonly applied molecular tests are those for gene rearrangements for immunoglobulin heavy chains and T-cell receptors. However, this article puts the focus on new and diagnostically relevant assays in hematopathology. Among these are mutations of MYD88 codon 265 in lymphoplasmacytic lymphomas, B-raf V600E in hairy cell leukemia and Stat3 exon 21 in indolent T-cell lymphomas. In myeloproliferative neoplasms, MPL W515, calreticulin exon 9 and the BCR-ABL and JAK2 V617F junctions are the most frequently analyzed differentiation series. In myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasms, SRSF2, SETBP1 and CSF3R mutations provide important differential diagnostic information. Genes mutated in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are particularly diverse but their analysis significantly improves the differential diagnostics between reactive conditions and MDS. The most frequent changes in MDS include mutations of TET2 and various genes encoding splicing factors.","['Klapper, W', 'Kreipe, H']","['Klapper W', 'Kreipe H']","['Institut fur Pathologie, Sektion Hamatopathologie und Lymphknotenregister, Christian-Albrechts-Universitat zu Kiel, Universitatsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Arnold-Heller-Strasse 3, 24105, Kiel, Deutschland, wklapper@path.uni-kiel.de.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Pathologe,Der Pathologe,8006541,"['0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (MYD88 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BRAF protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf)']",IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', '*DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Genetic Markers/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', '*Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic-Myeloproliferative Diseases/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins B-raf/genetics', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*diagnosis/*genetics/pathology']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/02/06 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00292-015-0007-1 [doi]'],ppublish,Pathologe. 2015 Mar;36(2):164-70. doi: 10.1007/s00292-015-0007-1.,,,,,,,,,,Diagnostische Molekularpathologie bei lymphatischen und myeloischen Neoplasien.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used serological methods and quantitative real-time PCR to test free-ranging and captive Namibian cheetahs for the presence of feline leukemia virus (FeLV), a gammaretrovirus that can be highly aggressive in populations with low genetic diversity, such as cheetahs. We also assessed the presence of antibodies to other gammaretroviruses and the responses to a FeLV vaccine developed for domestic cats. Up to 19% of the free-ranging cheetahs, 27% of the captive nonvaccinated cheetahs, and 86% of the captive vaccinated cheetahs tested positive for FeLV antibodies. FeLV-antibody-positive free-ranging cheetahs also tested positive for Rauscher murine leukemia virus antibodies. Nevertheless, FeLV was not detectable by quantitative real-time PCR and no reverse transcriptase activity was detectable by product-enhanced reverse transcriptase assay in the plasma of cheetahs or the supernatants from cultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The presence of antibodies to gammaretroviruses in clinically healthy specimens may be caused either by infection with a low-pathogenic retrovirus or by the expression of endogenous retroviral sequences. The strong humoral immune responses to FeLV vaccination demonstrate that cheetahs can respond to the vaccine and that vaccination against FeLV infection may be beneficial should FeLV infection ever become a threat, as was seen in Iberian lynx and Florida panthers.","['Krengel, Annika', 'Cattori, Valentino', 'Meli, Marina L', 'Wachter, Bettina', 'Boni, Jurg', 'Bisset, Leslie R', 'Thalwitzer, Susanne', 'Melzheimer, Jorg', 'Jago, Mark', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina', 'Hofer, Heribert', 'Lutz, Hans']","['Krengel A', 'Cattori V', 'Meli ML', 'Wachter B', 'Boni J', 'Bisset LR', 'Thalwitzer S', 'Melzheimer J', 'Jago M', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R', 'Hofer H', 'Lutz H']","['Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin, Germany.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin, Germany.', 'Swiss National Center for Retroviruses, Institute for Medical Virology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Swiss National Center for Retroviruses, Institute for Medical Virology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin, Germany.', 'Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin, Germany.', 'The AfriCat Foundation, Otjiwarongo, Namibia.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Berlin, Germany.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland hlutz@vetclinics.uzh.ch.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Vaccine Immunol,Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,101252125,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Vaccines)']",IM,"['Acinonyx/*virology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Blood/immunology/virology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Namibia', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Serologic Tests', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Viral Vaccines/administration & dosage/immunology']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['CVI.00705-14 [pii]', '10.1128/CVI.00705-14 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Vaccine Immunol. 2015 Jun;22(6):611-7. doi: 10.1128/CVI.00705-14.

In MF, most infiltrating cells in patches and plaques express CXCR3, while tumor cells express CCR4 in advanced stages. Poteligeo Test IHC (CCR4 staining kit) is a newly developed staining kit that can examine the presence of CCR4 expressed on tumor cells of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma before treatment of anti-CCR4 antibody using paraffin-embedded samples. In this study, we analyzed CCR4 expression in lesional skin of MF, SS, atopic dermatitis (AD) and psoriasis with this new kit. CCR4 was expressed on infiltrating cells in lesional skin of patch, plaque, tumor MF and SS, and the number of positive cells increased as the disease progressed. Immunohistochemistry with frozen sections also showed some positive cells scattered in the dermis, although the quality was not high enough to quantify positive cells. There were significant positive correlations between CCR4(+) cells and serum lactate dehydrogenase levels. Interestingly, CCR4(+) cells were also detected in AD skin, whose number was larger than that in psoriatic skin. Previous studies showed only scattered CCR4(+) cells in skin samples by standard immunohistochemical staining. The new, sensitive CCR4 staining kit has revealed that CCR4 is expressed on infiltrating cells in lesional skin of early MF and AD as well as advanced MF and SS. These cells can be therapeutic targets for patients who are resistant to standard treatments.","['Sugaya, Makoto', 'Morimura, Sohshi', 'Suga, Hiraku', 'Kawaguchi, Makiko', 'Miyagaki, Tomomitsu', 'Ohmatsu, Hanako', 'Fujita, Hideki', 'Sato, Shinichi']","['Sugaya M', 'Morimura S', 'Suga H', 'Kawaguchi M', 'Miyagaki T', 'Ohmatsu H', 'Fujita H', 'Sato S']","['Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Dermatol,The Journal of dermatology,7600545,"['0 (CCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Reagent Kits, Diagnostic)', '0 (Receptors, CCR4)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Dermatitis, Atopic/blood/*metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/blood', 'Mycosis Fungoides/blood/*chemistry', 'Psoriasis/blood/*metabolism', 'Reagent Kits, Diagnostic', 'Receptors, CCR4/*analysis', 'Sezary Syndrome/blood/*chemistry', 'Skin/chemistry']",2015/03/27 06:00,2016/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/08/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/1346-8138.12852 [doi]'],ppublish,J Dermatol. 2015 Jun;42(6):613-5. doi: 10.1111/1346-8138.12852.

We hypothesize that changes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteome will occur after asp therapy and will anticipate CNS clots. METHODS: Five newly diagnosed patients, ages 1-11 years, with ALL (n = 4) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) (n = 1) underwent serial lumbar punctures during induction. CSF was depleted of abundant plasma proteins and analyzed by gel-free, label-free quantitative proteomics. RESULTS: More than 600 proteins were quantified across all CSF samples. In four subjects, the expression of proteins involved in coagulation such as protein C Inhibitor (SERPINA5) and heparin cofactor II (SERPIND1) changed over the course of asp therapy.

DESIGN AND METHODS: In this case-control study, enrolled patients with leukemia were identified from 1262 patients between May 2002 and May 2013 at a single institution. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were aged >/= 50 yr (the older group) and 165 patients were aged 18-49 yr (the younger group). Of the older group, 20 of 31 (64.5%) had a hematopoietic cell transplantation comorbidity index (HCT-CI) of 0 or 2. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences in the incidences of grades II to IV acute GVHD, extensive chronic GVHD, and non-relapse mortality (NRM), or probability of relapse between the two groups. Furthermore, the 3-yr overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were not significantly different between the older and younger groups: 67.0 +/- 9.3% vs. 75.3 +/- 3.4% (p = 0.406) and 60.5 +/- 9.6% vs. 72.5 +/- 3.5% (p = 0.183), respectively.

In normal cells, their signaling potential is strictly limited in extent and duration. The persistent activation of Stat3 or Stat5 is found in many human tumor cells and contributes to their growth and survival. Stat5 activation plays a pivotal role in nearly all hematological malignancies and occurs downstream of oncogenic kinases, e.g., Bcr-Abl in chronic myeloid leukemias (CML) and Jak2(V617F) in other myeloproliferative diseases (MPD). We defined the mechanisms through which Stat5 affects growth and survival of K562 cells, representative of Bcr-Abl positive CML, and HEL cells, representative for Jak2(V617F) positive acute erythroid leukemia. In our experiments we suppressed the protein expression levels of Stat5a and Stat5b through shRNA mediated downregulation and demonstrated the dependence of cell survival on the presence of Stat5. Alternatively, we interfered with the functional capacities of the Stat5 protein through the interaction with a Stat5 specific peptide ligand. This ligand is a Stat5 specific peptide aptamer construct which comprises a 12mer peptide integrated into a modified thioredoxin scaffold, S5-DBD-PA. The peptide sequence specifically recognizes the DNA binding domain (DBD) of Stat5. Complex formation of S5-DBD-PA with Stat5 causes a strong reduction of P-Stat5 in the nuclear fraction of Bcr-Abl-transformed K562 cells and a suppression of Stat5 target genes. Distinct Stat5 mediated survival mechanisms were detected in K562 and Jak2(V617F)-transformed HEL cells. Stat5 is activated in the nuclear and cytosolic compartments of K562 cells and the S5-DBD-PA inhibitor most likely affects the viability of Bcr-Abl+ K562 cells through the inhibition of canonical Stat5 induced target gene transcription. In HEL cells, Stat5 is predominantly present in the cytoplasm and the survival of the Jak2(V617F)+ HEL cells is impeded through the inhibition of the cytoplasmic functions of Stat5.","['Weber, Axel', 'Borghouts, Corina', 'Brendel, Christian', 'Moriggl, Richard', 'Delis, Natalia', 'Brill, Boris', 'Vafaizadeh, Vida', 'Groner, Bernd']","['Weber A', 'Borghouts C', 'Brendel C', 'Moriggl R', 'Delis N', 'Brill B', 'Vafaizadeh V', 'Groner B']","['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main 60596, Germany. axel.weber@signis.de.', 'Ganymed Pharmaceuticals AG, Mainz 55131, Germany. c.heinz@ganymed.ag.', ""Boston Children's Hospital, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston, MA 02115, USA. christian.brendel@childrens.harvard.edu."", 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Cancer Research (LBI-CR), Vienna 1090, Austria. richard.moriggl@lbicr.lbg.ac.at.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main 60596, Germany. delis@gsh.uni-frankfurt.de.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main 60596, Germany. brill@gsh.uni-frankfurt.de.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main 60596, Germany. vida.vafaizadeh@unibas.ch.', 'Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Tumor Biology and Experimental Therapy, Frankfurt am Main 60596, Germany.

The incidence of probable IA (EORTC/MSG criteria) was 9.9%. Fifty-six Aspergillus were isolated from 53 (6.5%) of 811 sputa collected from 35 (38.5%) patients. Aspergillus spp. were isolated in 59.7% of 494 air samples and in 52.8% of 1579 surface samples taken in the patients' room. Aspergillus section Nigri (72.7%) was the most frequent. Aspergillus contamination peaked in autumn and winter on surface and in summer and autumn in air samples and was higher (P = 0.03) during the renovation work period. Multivariate analysis showed that for each Aspergillus section Nigri CFU airborne contamination IA risk increased by 1.05 (P = 0.04). In Tunisia, Aspergillus section Nigri and Flavi, but not Fumigati, are chiefly involved in IA.

Other patients at risk undergo serum galactomannan testing three times weekly. At 72-96 h of persisting fever despite broad-spectrum antibiotics, or at onset of lower respiratory tract symptoms a thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan is performed. Without lung infiltrates on CT, IPA is ruled out. In lung infiltrates not suggestive for IPA mycological confirmation is pursued. In patients without posaconazole prophylaxis empiric caspofungin will be considered. CT findings typical for IPA prompt targeted treatment, and mycological confirmation. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is most important for cultural identification and susceptibility testing, and facilitates diagnosing other pathogens. BAL performance is virtually independent of platelet counts. If despite suggestive infiltrates BAL does not yield the diagnosis, CT-guided biopsy follows as soon as platelet counts allow.

PLZF is a canonical androgen-regulated putative tumor suppressor gene whose expression is inhibited by androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Here, we demonstrate that knockdown of PLZF expression promotes a CRPC and enzalutamide-resistant phenotype in prostate cancer cells. Reintroduction of PLZF expression is sufficient to reverse androgen-independent growth mediated by PLZF depletion. PLZF loss enhances CRPC tumor growth in a xenograft model. Bioinformatic analysis of the PLZF cistrome shows that PLZF negatively regulates multiple pathways, including the MAPK pathway. Accordingly, our data support an oncogenic program activated by ADT. This acquired mechanism together with the finding of genetic loss in CRPC implicates PLZF inactivation as a mechanism promoting ADT resistance and the CRPC phenotype.","['Hsieh, Chen-Lin', 'Botta, Ginevra', 'Gao, Shuai', 'Li, Tiantian', 'Van Allen, Eliezer M', 'Treacy, Daniel J', 'Cai, Changmeng', 'He, Housheng Hansen', 'Sweeney, Christopher J', 'Brown, Myles', 'Balk, Steven P', 'Nelson, Peter S', 'Garraway, Levi A', 'Kantoff, Philip W']","['Hsieh CL', 'Botta G', 'Gao S', 'Li T', 'Van Allen EM', 'Treacy DJ', 'Cai C', 'He HH', 'Sweeney CJ', 'Brown M', 'Balk SP', 'Nelson PS', 'Garraway LA', 'Kantoff PW']","['Department of Medical Oncology, and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, and Broad Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts.', 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, and Center for Functional Cancer Epigenetics, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, and.', 'Hematology-Oncology Division, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF), a zinc finger protein, is a critical factor for maintaining the self-renewal of mGSCs, so, evaluation of the PLZF pathway in mGSCs may provide a deeper insight into mammalian spermatogenesis. miRNA was also an important regulating factor for the self-renewal and differentiation of mGSCs; however, there is currently no data indicating that which miRNA regulate the self-renewal and differentiation of mGSCs via PLZF. Here, we predicted the prospective miRNA targeting to PLZF using the online Bioinformatics database-Targetscan, and performed an analysis of the dual-luciferase recombinant vector, psiCHCEKTM-2-PLZF-3'UTR. miR-544 mimics (miR-544m), miR-544 inhibitors (miR-544i), Control (NC, scrambled oligonucleotides transfection), pPLZF-IRES2-EGFP or PLZF siRNA were transfected into mGSCs; the cells proliferation was evaluated by BRDU incorporation assay and flow cytometry, and the mGSC marker, GFRa1, PLZF, KIT, DAZL, and VASA expression were analyzed by RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence and Western blot. The results showed that miR-544 regulates dairy goat male germline stem cell self-renewal via targeting PLZF.

Poor diet quality can exacerbate chronic health conditions in the survivors but their nutritional intake has not been adequately studied. PROCEDURE: We assessed the Healthy Eating Index 2010 (HEI-2010) in 22 survivors of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma (median age = 11.7 years) and compared survivors' dietary intake to the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Dietary data were collected using repeated 24 hr dietary recalls over a 1-year period, which were averaged to estimate habitual intake. RESULTS: The mean HEI-2010 in childhood cancer survivors was 52.7, about 50 percent of the maximum score. Long-term survivors (time from diagnosis >/=10 years) had a significantly lower HEI-2010 than recent survivors (time from diagnosis <5 years) (beta = -11.5, 95% CI: -22.1, -0.9, P = 0.047). For individual food groups and nutrients, survivors had a particularly poor adherence to green vegetables and beans, total vegetables, and whole fruits. None of the survivors met the guidelines for dietary fiber and potassium intake. Only 4%, 19%, 24%, and 29% met the guidelines for vitamin D, sodium, calcium, and saturated fat intake. The average intake in relative to the recommended intake was 32% for vitamin D, 50% for potassium, 63% for fiber, and 85% for calcium, but was 115% for saturated fat and 143% for sodium. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood cancer survivors, in particular long-term survivors, have a poor adherence to the US dietary guidelines.","['Zhang, Fang Fang', 'Saltzman, Edward', 'Kelly, Michael J', 'Liu, Shanshan', 'Must, Aviva', 'Parsons, Susan K', 'Roberts, Susan B']","['Zhang FF', 'Saltzman E', 'Kelly MJ', 'Liu S', 'Must A', 'Parsons SK', 'Roberts SB']","['Department of Nutrition Sciences, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Nutrition Sciences, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/ Oncology, The Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Nutrition Sciences, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/ Oncology, The Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Institute for Clinical Research and Health Policy Studies, Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medicine, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Nutrition Sciences, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Body Mass Index', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Diet', 'Dietary Fiber', 'Energy Intake', '*Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Fruit', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Nutrition Assessment', '*Nutrition Policy', 'Nutritional Status', '*Patient Compliance', 'Survivors', 'Vegetables', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/01/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25521 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Aug;62(8):1461-7. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25521.

Although it functions as an activator of protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro, bryostatin 1 paradoxically antagonizes most responses to the prototypical PKC activator, the phorbol esters. The bottom half of the bryostatin 1 structure has been shown to be sufficient to confer binding to PKC. In contrast, we have previously shown that the top half of the bryostatin 1 structure is necessary for its unique biological behavior to antagonize phorbol ester responses. Neristatin 1 comprises a top half similar to that of bryostatin 1 together with a distinct bottom half that confers PKC binding. We report here that neristatin 1 is bryostatin 1-like, not phorbol ester-like, in its biological activity on U937 promyelocytic leukemia cells. We conclude that the top half of the bryostatin 1 structure is largely sufficient for bryostatin 1-like activity, provided the molecule also possesses an appropriate PKC binding domain.","['Kedei, Noemi', 'Kraft, Matthew B', 'Keck, Gary E', 'Herald, Cherry L', 'Melody, Noeleen', 'Pettit, George R', 'Blumberg, Peter M']","['Kedei N', 'Kraft MB', 'Keck GE', 'Herald CL', 'Melody N', 'Pettit GR', 'Blumberg PM']","['daggerLaboratory of Cancer Biology and Genetics, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-4255, United States.', 'double daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112, United States.', 'double daggerDepartment of Chemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112, United States.', 'section signDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Arizona State University, P.O.

Understanding the critical time periods in which patients with pediatric ALL are vulnerable to unhealthy weight gain will lay the groundwork for developing effectively timed interventions. PROCEDURE: We determined the growth patterns of patients with pediatric ALL during and after treatment through the conduct of a systematic review and meta-analysis. A search of MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science was performed from its inception through May 2014. Studies met the inclusion criteria if they included at least 10 patients of pediatric ALL, and longitudinally assessed BMI at diagnosis and at least one time point after diagnosis RESULTS: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and 16 were included in meta-analysis. The mean increase in BMI z-score during treatment in 1,514 patients with pediatric ALL was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.25-1.38). Specifically, patients experienced substantial weight gain in early treatment (Delta = 0.41, 95% CI: -0.34, 1.17) and again during maintenance (Delta = 0.34, 95% CI:-0.22, 0.90). The mean increase in BMI z-score ranged between 0.52 and 0.89 beyond treatment completion. Subgroup analyses found unhealthy weight gain occurred regardless of patients' receipt of cranial radiation therapy, sex, and, weight status at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with pediatric ALL experience unhealthy weight gain early in treatment, and increases in weight are maintained beyond treatment completion. Preventing early onset of obesity is a priority for improving the care and outcomes for patients with pediatric ALL.","['Zhang, Fang Fang', 'Liu, Shanshan', 'Chung, Mei', 'Kelly, Michael J']","['Zhang FF', 'Liu S', 'Chung M', 'Kelly MJ']","['Department of Nutrition Sciences, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Nutrition Sciences, Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Tufts University, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Public Health and Community Medicine, Nutrition/Infection Unit, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/ Oncology, The Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Body Mass Index', 'Body Weight', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Obesity', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Survivors', '*Weight Gain']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/01/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25519 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Aug;62(8):1452-60. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25519.

We retrospectively reviewed our institute's experience with epigenetic (Epi) versus cytarabine- and anthracycline-based intensive chemotherapy (IC) as induction in newly diagnosed AML patients aged 60 years and older. One hundred sixty-seven patients (n = 84, IC; n = 83, Epi) were assessed; 69 patients received decitabine and 14 azacitidine. Baseline characteristics between the IC and Epi patient cohorts were not statistically different except for age, initial white blood cell count, and comorbidity index. Overall response rate (ORR, 50% vs. 28%, respectively, P < 0.01) and complete response rate (CRR, 43% vs. 20%, respectively, P < 0.01) were superior following IC vs. Epi. Although univariate analysis demonstrated longer overall survival after IC (10.7 vs. 9.1 months, P = 0.012), multivariate analysis showed no independent impact of induction treatment. Treatment-related mortality was not statistically different in the two groups. Outcomes of patients with secondary, poor cytogenetic risk, FLT-3 mutated AML, or relapsed/refractory disease after IC or Epi were not significantly different. Outcomes of patients receiving IC versus a 10-day decitabine regimen (n = 63) also were not significantly different. Our results suggest that IC and Epi therapy are clinically equivalent approaches for upfront treatment of older patients with AML and that other factors (feasibility, toxicity, cost, etc.) should drive treatment decisions. Prospective randomized trials to determine the optimal induction approach for specific patient subsets are needed.","['Gupta, Neha', 'Miller, Austin', 'Gandhi, Shipra', 'Ford, Laurie A', 'Vigil, Carlos E', 'Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Thompson, James E', 'Wetzler, Meir', 'Wang, Eunice S']","['Gupta N', 'Miller A', 'Gandhi S', 'Ford LA', 'Vigil CE', 'Griffiths EA', 'Thompson JE', 'Wetzler M', 'Wang ES']","['Department of Medicine, SUNY-UB School of Medicine, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Department of Medicine, SUNY-UB School of Medicine, Buffalo, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.', 'Leukemia Service, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Decitabine', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/genetics']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/09/02 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/07/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/ajh.24016 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2015 Jul;90(7):639-46. doi: 10.1002/ajh.24016.,,PMC6791130,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,"['L30 CA111110/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA016156/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA016056/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS998203'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: A collaboration was undertaken between Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia (Bogota, Colombia), which serves a poor patient population in an upper-middle income country, and Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center (Boston, USA). Several interventions aimed at reducing toxic deaths and abandonment were implemented, including a reduced-intensity treatment regimen and a psychosocial effort targeting abandonment. We performed a cohort study to assess impact. RESULTS: The Study Population comprised 99 children with ALL diagnosed between 2007 and 2010, and the Historic Cohort comprised 181 children treated prior to the study interventions (1995-2004). Significant improvements were achieved in the rate of deaths in complete remission (13% to 3%; P = 0.005), abandonment (32% to 9%; P < 0.001), and event-free survival with abandonment considered an event (47% to 65% at 2 years; P = 0.016). However, relapse rate did not improve. Medically unnecessary treatment delays were common, and landmark analysis revealed that initiating the PIII phase of therapy >/=4 weeks delayed predicted markedly inferior disease-free survival (P = 0.016). Conversely, patients who received therapy without excessive delays had outcomes approaching those achieved in high-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a twinning program was followed by reductions in abandonment and toxic deaths, but relapse rate did not improve. Inappropriate treatment delays were common and strongly predicted treatment failure. These findings highlight the importance of adherence to treatment schedule for effective therapy of ALL.","['Suarez, Amaranto', 'Pina, Martha', 'Nichols-Vinueza, Diana X', 'Lopera, John', 'Rengifo, Lyda', 'Mesa, Mauricio', 'Cardenas, Marcela', 'Morrissey, Lisa', 'Veintemilla, Galo', 'Vizcaino, Martha', 'Del Toro, Ligia', 'Vicuna, Victor', 'Fernandez, Jorge', 'Neuberg, Donna', 'Stevenson, Kristen', 'Gutierrez, Alejandro']","['Suarez A', 'Pina M', 'Nichols-Vinueza DX', 'Lopera J', 'Rengifo L', 'Mesa M', 'Cardenas M', 'Morrissey L', 'Veintemilla G', 'Vizcaino M', 'Del Toro L', 'Vicuna V', 'Fernandez J', 'Neuberg D', 'Stevenson K', 'Gutierrez A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Surgery, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, Bogota, Colombia.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Division of Hematology/Oncology, Boston Children's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Developing Countries', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*mortality', '*Withholding Treatment']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2014/11/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25510 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Aug;62(8):1395-402. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25510.

With a median follow-up of 44 months, the outcome was similar in both groups. Acute graft-versus-host disease grade II-IV was observed in 25% after thiotepa-containing regimen versus 35% after TBI (P = 0.06). The 2-yr cumulative incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 40.5% for thiotepa and 41% for TBI (P = 0.98). At 2 yrs, the cumulative incidences of non-relapse mortality and relapse incidence were 23.9% (thiotepa) vs. 22.4% (TBI; P = 0.66) and 17.2% (thiotepa) vs. 23.3% (TBI; P = 0.77), respectively. The probabilities of leukaemia-free and overall survival at 2 yrs were not significantly different between the thiotepa and TBI groups, at 58.9% vs. 54.2% (P = 0.95) and 61.4% vs. 58% (P = 0.72), respectively. Myeloablative regimens using combinations including thiotepa can provide satisfactory outcomes, but the optimal conditioning remains unclear for the individual patient in this setting.","['Eder, Sandra', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Arcese, William', 'Or, Reuven', 'Majolino, Ignazio', 'Bacigalupo, Andrea', 'de Rosa, Gennaro', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Beelen, Dietrich', 'Veelken, Hendrik', 'Schaap, Nicolaas P M', 'Kuball, Jurgen', 'Cornelissen, Jan', 'Nagler, Arnon', 'Mohty, Mohamad']","['Eder S', 'Labopin M', 'Arcese W', 'Or R', 'Majolino I', 'Bacigalupo A', 'de Rosa G', 'Volin L', 'Beelen D', 'Veelken H', 'Schaap NP', 'Kuball J', 'Cornelissen J', 'Nagler A', 'Mohty M']","['EBMT Office Paris, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'EBMT Office Paris, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Paris, France.', 'Rome Transplant Network ""Tor Vergata"", University of Rome Stem Cell Transplant Unit, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.', 'Haematology & SCT Unit, Ospedale S.

ABL1 kinase domain mutations in CML with the e19a2 rearrangement were seldom reported. METHODS: The clinical characteristics of a 45-year-old Chinese female CML patient with e19a2 BCR/ABL1 transcript were described. The mutation on the ABL gene exons was determined by sequencing the cDNA of the mu-BCR-ABL fusion product. RESULTS: This patient developed an acquired resistance associated with two p-BCR/ABL1 mutations (E255K and G250E) during treatment with imatinib. CONCLUSIONS: Here, we report a CML patient with e19a2 transcripts, carrying E255K and G250E mutation and experience of nilotinib treatment. The mu-BCR/ABL1 mutation should be investigated after imatinib treatment failure.","['Li, Chunrui', 'Wang, Ying', 'Xu, Danmei', 'Zhang, Ping', 'Ding, Xiaoyi', 'Zhang, Na', 'Xiao, Min', 'Huang, Liang', 'Meng, Li']","['Li C', 'Wang Y', 'Xu D', 'Zhang P', 'Ding X', 'Zhang N', 'Xiao M', 'Huang L', 'Meng L']",,['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/*therapeutic use', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*therapeutic use']",2015/03/27 06:00,2015/04/30 06:00,['2015/03/27 06:00'],"['2015/03/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/27 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/30 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/clin.lab.2014.140818 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2015;61(1-2):183-6. doi: 10.7754/clin.lab.2014.140818.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there are a few reports of non-classic mRNA alterations, as yet there is no molecular explanation for these alternative changes. Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) mutations and variants are implicated in several diseases, including Wilms tumor and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We observed two alternative G-to-A changes, namely c.1303G>A and c.1586G>A in cDNA clones and found them to be recurrent in a series of 21 umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell (CBMC) samples studied. Two less conserved U-to-C changes were also observed. These alternative changes were found to be significantly higher in non-progenitor as compared to progenitor CBMCs, while they were found to be absent in a series of AML samples studied, indicating they are targeted, cell type-specific mRNA editing modifications. Since APOBEC/ADAR family members are implicated in RNA/DNA editing, we screened them by RNA-interference (RNAi) for WT1-mRNA changes and observed near complete reversal of WT1 c.1303G>A alteration upon APOBEC3A (A3A) knockdown. The role of A3A in mediating this change was confirmed by A3A overexpression in Fujioka cells, which led to a significant increase in WT1 c.1303G>A mRNA editing. Non-progenitor CBMCs showed correspondingly higher levels of A3A-mRNA and protein as compared to the progenitor ones. To our knowledge, this is the first report of mRNA modifying activity for an APOBEC3 protein and implicates A3A in a novel G-to-A form of editing. These findings open the way to further investigations into the mechanisms of other potential mRNA changes, which will help to redefine the RNA editing paradigm in both health and disease.","['Niavarani, Ahmadreza', 'Currie, Erin', 'Reyal, Yasmin', 'Anjos-Afonso, Fernando', 'Horswell, Stuart', 'Griessinger, Emmanuel', 'Luis Sardina, Jose', 'Bonnet, Dominique']","['Niavarani A', 'Currie E', 'Reyal Y', 'Anjos-Afonso F', 'Horswell S', 'Griessinger E', 'Luis Sardina J', 'Bonnet D']","['Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute, London, United Kingdom; Digestive Disease Research Institute (DDRI), Shariati Hospital, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Bioinformatics, Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute, London, United Kingdom.', 'INSERM U1065, Mediterranean Centre for Molecular Medicine (C3M), Universite Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France.', 'Instituto de Biologia Funcional y Genomica, CSIC/Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain.', 'Haematopoietic Stem Cell Laboratory, Cancer Research UK, London Research Institute, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (WT1 protein, human)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (APOBEC3A protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytidine Deaminase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Guanine/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', '*RNA Editing', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Messenger/chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Umbilical Cord/cytology', 'WT1 Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Wilms Tumor/genetics/pathology']",2015/03/26 06:00,2016/03/05 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2014/09/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0120089 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-37457 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 25;10(3):e0120089. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0120089. eCollection 2015.,20150325,PMC4373805,,,,,,['Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Down-regulation of PLZF has been found in various tumor cell lines. There has been virtually no tissue study on the expression of PLZF in prostate cancer (PCa). PCa is a heterogeneous disease, most of which are indolent and non-lethal. Currently there are no biomarkers that distinguish indolent from aggressive PCa; therefore there is an urgent need for such markers to provide clinical decision support. This study aimed to investigate the expression of PLZF by immunohistochemistry in different grade as well as metastatic PCa and to correlate the alteration of PLZF expression with PCa aggressiveness. We studied a total of 83 primary PCa from biopsies, 43 metastatic PCa and 8 paired primary and metastatic PCa from radical prostatectomies with lymph node dissection. Our results demonstrated that PLZF was strongly expressed in almost all (~100%) benign luminal cells (n=77) and low grade (Gleason pattern 3) PCa (n=70) and weak or absent (100%) in basal cells (n=70). Decreased or lost expression of PLZF was evidenced in 26% of high-grade (Gleason 4 and 5) primary PCa (n=70) and 84% metastatic PCa (n=43). The primary high grade PCa in the prostatectomies shared similar PLZF loss/decrease and histomorphology to that of paired parallel lymph node metastases. These data demonstrated that down-regulation of PLZF is an important molecular process for tumor progression and loss of PLZF expression detected by routine immunohistochemistry is a promising and valuable biomarker for PCa aggressiveness and metastasis in the personalized care of PCa.","['Xiao, Guang-Qian', 'Unger, Pamela', 'Yang, Qi', 'Kinoshita, Yayoi', 'Singh, Kyra', 'McMahon, Loralee', 'Nastiuk, Kent', 'Sha, Kai', 'Krolewski, John', 'Burstein, David']","['Xiao GQ', 'Unger P', 'Yang Q', 'Kinoshita Y', 'Singh K', 'McMahon L', 'Nastiuk K', 'Sha K', 'Krolewski J', 'Burstein D']","['Departments of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, United States of America.', 'Departments of Pathology, Lenox Hill Hospital, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, United States of America.', 'Departments of Pathology, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, United States of America.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, United States of America.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, United States of America.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, United States of America.', 'Departments of Pathology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, United States of America.', 'Departments of Pathology, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York, New York, United States of America.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '147855-37-6 (ZBTB16 protein, human)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/*metabolism/pathology/surgery', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Lymph Node Excision', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*pathology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein', 'Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology/surgery']",2015/03/26 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2014/12/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0121318 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-51715 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 25;10(3):e0121318. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0121318. eCollection 2015.,20150325,PMC4373907,,,,,,['UL1 TR000042/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous single-nucleotide change in ETV6 (ets variant 6), c.641C>T, encoding a p.Pro214Leu substitution in the central domain, segregating with thrombocytopenia and elevated MCV. A screen of 23 families with similar phenotypes identified 2 with ETV6 mutations. One family also had a mutation encoding p.Pro214Leu and one individual with ALL. The other family had a c.1252A>G transition producing a p.Arg418Gly substitution in the DNA-binding domain, with alternative splicing and exon skipping. Functional characterization of these mutations showed aberrant cellular localization of mutant and endogenous ETV6, decreased transcriptional repression and altered megakaryocyte maturation.

These findings markedly modified the current field of research on the etiology of ALL. In this new context, the present exploratory study investigated the possible interactions between these at-risk alleles and the non-genetic suspected ALL risk factors that were of sufficient prevalence in the French ESCALE study: maternal use of home insecticides during pregnancy, preconception paternal smoking, and some proxies for early immune modulation, i.e. breastfeeding, history of common infections before age one year, and birth order. The analyses were based on 434 ALL cases and 442 controls of European origin, drawn from the nationwide population-based case-control study ESCALE. Information on non-genetic factors was obtained by standardized telephone interview. Interactions between rs10740055 in ARID5B or rs4132601 in IKZF1 and each of the suspected non-genetic factors were tested, with the SNPs coded as counts of minor alleles (trend variable). Statistical interactions were observed between rs4132601 and maternal insecticide use (p = 0.012), breastfeeding p = 0.017) and repeated early common infections (p = 0.0070), with allelic odds ratios (OR) which were only increased among the children not exposed to insecticides (OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.4), those who had been breastfed (OR = 1.8, 95%CI: 1.3, 2.5) and those who had had repeated early common infections (OR = 2.4, 95%CI: 1.5, 3.8). The allelic ORs were close to one among children exposed to insecticides, who had not been breastfed and who had had no or few common infections. Repeated early common infections interacted with rs10740055 (p = 0.018) in the case-only design. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether these observations of a modification of the effect of the at-risk alleles by non-genetic factors are chance findings or reflect true underlying mechanisms.","['Rudant, Jeremie', 'Orsi, Laurent', 'Bonaventure, Audrey', 'Goujon-Bellec, Stephanie', 'Baruchel, Andre', 'Petit, Arnaud', 'Bertrand, Yves', 'Nelken, Brigitte', 'Pasquet, Marlene', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Saumet, Laure', 'Chastagner, Pascal', 'Ducassou, Stephane', 'Reguerre, Yves', 'Hemon, Denis', 'Clavel, Jacqueline']","['Rudant J', 'Orsi L', 'Bonaventure A', 'Goujon-Bellec S', 'Baruchel A', 'Petit A', 'Bertrand Y', 'Nelken B', 'Pasquet M', 'Michel G', 'Saumet L', 'Chastagner P', 'Ducassou S', 'Reguerre Y', 'Hemon D', 'Clavel J']","['Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medicale (INSERM) U1153, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Sorbonne Paris Cite Center (CRESS), Epidemiology of childhood and adolescent cancers team (EPICEA), Villejuif, France;

DATA SOURCES: Systematic review of the literature from 1990-2013 found in the PubMed, PsycINFO(R), EMBASE, and CINAHL(R) databases, as well as manual searches. DATA SYNTHESIS: The review identified 16 quantitative studies and 1 qualitative study published from 1990-2013 that used a self-reported QOL or symptom questionnaire. Fatigue was the most commonly assessed and reported symptom, followed by depression. CONCLUSIONS: Acute leukemia and its treatment have a significant impact in all QOL domains. Future studies should include longitudinal research, more than one recruitment site, increased minority representation, and home-based exercise interventions as ways to improve all domains of QOL. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: This review increases awareness of commonly reported symptoms faced by adults with acute leukemia. Oncology nurses are central in monitoring and reporting symptoms to the interdisciplinary team that may contribute to changes in function, with the overall goal of optimizing QOL over time.","['Leak Bryant, Ashley', 'Lee Walton, AnnMarie', 'Shaw-Kokot, Julia', 'Mayer, Deborah K', 'Reeve, Bryce B']","['Leak Bryant A', 'Lee Walton A', 'Shaw-Kokot J', 'Mayer DK', 'Reeve BB']","['School of Nursing, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'College of Nursing, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'User Services in the Health Sciences Library, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'School of Nursing, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Gillings School of Global Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Oncol Nurs Forum,Oncology nursing forum,7809033,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Epidemiologic Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/nursing/*psychology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/nursing/*psychology', 'Qualitative Research', '*Quality of Life', 'Research Design', 'Spirituality', 'Survivors/psychology', '*Symptom Assessment']",2015/03/26 06:00,2015/12/31 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1188/15.ONF.E91-E101 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncol Nurs Forum. 2015 Mar;42(2):E91-E101. doi: 10.1188/15.ONF.E91-E101.,,PMC5835968,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'acute leukemia survivors', 'patient-reported symptoms', 'quality of life', 'symptoms', 'systematic review']",,,,"['R25 CA116339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R25CA116339/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS944930'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic cutaneous GVHD can present with sclerotic or nonsclerotic changes of the skin and often requires treatment with systemic immunosuppressants, extracorporeal photopheresis, or phototherapy. We describe the first reported case, to our knowledge, of the effective treatment of sclerotic chronic cutaneous GVHD with narrowband UV-B (NB UV-B) phototherapy. OBSERVATIONS: A woman in her 40s presented with sclerotic chronic GVHD of the skin 6 years after HCT for treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia. The patient's cutaneous disease progressed despite treatment with prednisone and oral tacrolimus. The patient was initiated on NB UV-B phototherapy 3 times per week, resulting in clinically significant improvement of cutaneous lesions over the first 2 months. The NB UV-B regimen allowed for a reduction of prednisone dose and continued control of cutaneous GVHD over 6 months of therapy. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our case report describes the successful use of NB UV-B phototherapy for the treatment of sclerotic chronic cutaneous GVHD.

The underlying etiology of SCN palsy has a wide range from viral infections to intracranial tumors; therefore, a careful and systematic approach is necessary while examining these patients. METHODS: Fourteen patients who presented with acute SCN paralysis to pediatric emergency department during the last 10 years were examined. RESULTS: The age at the time of admission ranged between 14 months and 16 years (median, 9.5 years). Of the 14 patients, 5 were girls and 9 were boys. A total of 3 of the 14 patients had bilateral cranial nerve VI paralysis, and 9 patients had additional abnormal findings on neurological examination. Neuroimaging studies included cranial tomography (n = 3) and brain magnetic resonance imaging in all patients. The underlying etiology was malignancy (n = 3); glioma, medulloblastoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and dural sinus thrombosis (n = 2); as well as Guillain-Barre syndrome (n = 2), multiple sclerosis (n = 1), pseudotumor cerebri (n = 1), and meningitis (n = 1). The remaining 4 patients had miscellaneous benign etiologies. CONCLUSIONS: Other lesions of primary brain tumors causing increased intracranial pressure constitute 50% of the underlying etiology, followed by Guillain-Barre syndrome (14.2%). However, these patients had neurological symptoms signs, in addition to diplopia or SCN paralysis. Patients admitted to pediatric emergency department with acute SCN paralysis should be examined in detail to disclose the underlying etiology especially if they present with additional clinical signs or symptoms.","['Teksam, Ozlem', 'Gultekingil, Ayse', 'Konuskan, Bahadir', 'Haliloglu, Goknur', 'Oguz, Kader Karli', 'Yalnizoglu, Dilek']","['Teksam O', 'Gultekingil A', 'Konuskan B', 'Haliloglu G', 'Oguz KK', 'Yalnizoglu D']","['From the *Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Emergency Medicine, daggerDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Neurology, and section signDepartment of Radiology, Hacettepe University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Emerg Care,Pediatric emergency care,8507560,,IM,"['Abducens Nerve/*pathology', 'Abducens Nerve Diseases/*diagnosis/*etiology', 'Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Diagnostic Imaging', 'Emergency Service, Hospital', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Retrospective Studies']",2015/03/26 06:00,2017/03/28 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2017/03/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/PEC.0000000000000366 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Emerg Care. 2016 May;32(5):307-11. doi: 10.1097/PEC.0000000000000366.,,,,,,,,,['Pediatr Emerg Care. 2021 Mar 1;37(3):190.

Terminal granulocytic differentiation can be induced in acute promyelocytic (APL) cell line HT93A by G-CSF and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Because the detailed mechanism has never been shown, we investigated the signal transduction pathway in granulocytic differentiation by G-CSF, alone or in combination with ATRA. METHODS: HT93A cell viability and growth were investigated by trypan blue exclusion assay. Cell differentiation was assessed by CD11b and CD34 expressions. Intracellular protein expressions were also evaluated by flow cytometry after fixation and permeabilization. RESULTS: ATRA (100 nM) induced granulocytic differentiation (upregulation of CD11b and downregulation of CD34) and the effect was potentiated by addition of G-CSF, while G-CSF alone had no effect on HT93A cells. The addition of G-CSF to ATRA had little or no effect on NB4 and THP-1 cells in comparison to ATRA alone. G-CSF receptor expression was reduced by ATRA treatment in a time-dependent manner. After 5 days' incubation with ATRA, the expression levels of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, and phosphorylated STAT3 and STAT5, were significantly reduced. STAT5 was strongly activated by G-CSF stimulation in ATRA-pretreated cells in comparison to untreated cells. In contrast, STAT3 showed no response to G-CSF. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor ruxolitinib (320 nM) had little or no effect on ATRA-induced differentiation, but eliminated the enhancing effect of G-CSF, as evidenced by the levels of CD11b and CD34 expression. These results suggest G-CSF activates STAT5 through the JAK pathway in combination with ATRA, resulting in myeloid differentiation in HT93A cells. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, activation of the JAK-STAT pathway is likely essential for inducting differentiation in the APL cell line HT93A; thus, monitoring its expression and activation is important for predicting clinical efficacy and understanding the mechanisms of cytokine-dependent myelopoiesis, proliferation, and differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia.","['Uchino, Yoshihito', 'Iriyama, Noriyoshi', 'Hatta, Yoshihiro', 'Takei, Masami']","['Uchino Y', 'Iriyama N', 'Hatta Y', 'Takei M']","['Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, 30-1 Oyaguchi Kami-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610 Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, 30-1 Oyaguchi Kami-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610 Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, 30-1 Oyaguchi Kami-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610 Japan.', 'Division of Hematology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, 30-1 Oyaguchi Kami-cho, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo 173-8610 Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,2015/03/26 06:00,2015/03/26 06:01,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2014/10/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/26 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-015-0176-2 [doi]', '176 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2015 Mar 12;15:30. doi: 10.1186/s12935-015-0176-2. eCollection 2015.,20150312,PMC4372317,['NOTNLM'],"['All-trans retinoic acid', 'Differentiation', 'Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor', 'HT93A', 'Ruxolitinib', 'Signal transducer and activator of transcription']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcriptional activation of Notch target genes involves cleavage of the Notch receptor in response to ligand binding, production of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD), and NICD migration into the nucleus and assembly of a coactivator complex. Posttranslational modifications of the NICD are important for its transcriptional activity and protein turnover. Deregulation of Notch signaling and stabilizing mutations of Notch1 have been linked to leukemia development. We found that the methyltransferase CARM1 (coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1; also known as PRMT4) methylated NICD at five conserved arginine residues within the C-terminal transactivation domain. CARM1 physically and functionally interacted with the NICD-coactivator complex and was found at gene enhancers in a Notch-dependent manner. Although a methylation-defective NICD mutant was biochemically more stable, this mutant was biologically less active as measured with Notch assays in embryos of Xenopus laevis and Danio rerio. Mathematical modeling indicated that full but short and transient Notch signaling required methylation of NICD.","['Hein, Kerstin', 'Mittler, Gerhard', 'Cizelsky, Wiebke', 'Kuhl, Michael', 'Ferrante, Francesca', 'Liefke, Robert', 'Berger, Ina M', 'Just, Steffen', 'Strang, J Eric', 'Kestler, Hans A', 'Oswald, Franz', 'Borggrefe, Tilman']","['Hein K', 'Mittler G', 'Cizelsky W', 'Kuhl M', 'Ferrante F', 'Liefke R', 'Berger IM', 'Just S', 'Strang JE', 'Kestler HA', 'Oswald F', 'Borggrefe T']","['Max-Planck-Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics, 79108 Freiburg, Germany.

Here, we investigated the functional and prognostic implications of CXXC5 expression in AML. CXXC5 mRNA was downregulated in AML with MLL rearrangements, t(8;21) and GATA2 mutations. As a mechanism of CXXC5 inactivation, we found evidence for epigenetic silencing by promoter methylation. Patients with CXXC5 expression below the median level had a lower relapse rate (45% vs 59%; P = .007) and a better overall survival (OS, 46% vs 28%; P < .001) and event-free survival (EFS, 36% vs 21%; P < .001) at 5 years, independent of cytogenetic risk groups and known molecular risk factors. In gene-expression profiling, lower CXXC5 expression was associated with upregulation of cell-cycling genes and co-downregulation of genes implicated in leukemogenesis (WT1, GATA2, MLL, DNMT3B, RUNX1). Functional analyses demonstrated CXXC5 to inhibit leukemic cell proliferation and Wnt signaling and to affect the p53-dependent DNA damage response. In conclusion, our data suggest a tumor suppressor function of CXXC5 in AML. Inactivation of CXXC5 is associated with different leukemic pathways and defines an AML subgroup with better outcome.","['Kuhnl, Andrea', 'Valk, Peter J M', 'Sanders, Mathijs A', 'Ivey, Adam', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Mills, Ken I', 'Gale, Rosemary E', 'Kaiser, Martin F', 'Dillon, Richard', 'Joannides, Melanie', 'Gilkes, Amanda', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Schnittger, Susanne', 'Duprez, Estelle', 'Linch, David C', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Baldus, Claudia D', 'Solomon, Ellen', 'Burnett, Alan K', 'Grimwade, David']","['Kuhnl A', 'Valk PJ', 'Sanders MA', 'Ivey A', 'Hills RK', 'Mills KI', 'Gale RE', 'Kaiser MF', 'Dillon R', 'Joannides M', 'Gilkes A', 'Haferlach T', 'Schnittger S', 'Duprez E', 'Linch DC', 'Delwel R', 'Lowenberg B', 'Baldus CD', 'Solomon E', 'Burnett AK', 'Grimwade D']","[""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, London, United Kingdom; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite University Hospital Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany;"", 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, London, United Kingdom;"", 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom;', ""Centre for Cancer Research and Cell Biology, Queen's University Belfast, Belfast, United Kingdom;"", 'Department of Haematology, University College London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite University Hospital Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany;', ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, London, United Kingdom;"", ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, London, United Kingdom;"", 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom;', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany; and.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany; and.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille, INSERM U1068, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique UMR7258, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Aix Marseille University, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University College London, London, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands;', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Charite University Hospital Berlin, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany;', ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, London, United Kingdom;"", 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom;', ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, King's College London, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, London, United Kingdom;""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CXXC5 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Wnt Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Signal Transduction', 'Survival Rate', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wnt Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/26 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2014/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31720-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-12-613703 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 7;125(19):2985-94. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-12-613703.

Vosaroxin, a quinolone-derived intercalating agent has several properties that could prove beneficial. Initial clinical studies showed it to be well-tolerated in older patients with relapsed/refractory disease. In vitro data suggested synergy with cytarabine (Ara-C). To evaluate vosaroxin, we performed 2 randomized comparisons within the ""Pick a Winner"" program. A total of 104 patients were randomized to vosaroxin vs low-dose Ara-C (LDAC) and 104 to vosaroxin + LDAC vs LDAC. When comparing vosaroxin with LDAC, neither response rate (complete recovery [CR]/complete recovery with incomplete count recovery [CRi], 26% vs 30%; odds ratio [OR], 1.16 (0.49-2.72); P = .7) nor 12-month survival (12% vs 31%; hazard ratio [HR], 1.94 [1.26-3.00]; P = .003) showed benefit for vosaroxin.

A major reason for this lack of benefit was excess early mortality in the vosaroxin + LDAC arm, most obviously in the second month following randomization. At its first interim analysis, the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee recommended closure of the vosaroxin-containing trial arms because a clinically relevant benefit was unlikely.","['Dennis, Mike', 'Russell, Nigel', 'Hills, Robert K', 'Hemmaway, Claire', 'Panoskaltsis, Nicki', 'McMullin, Mary-Frances', 'Kjeldsen, Lars', 'Dignum, Helen', 'Thomas, Ian F', 'Clark, Richard E', 'Milligan, Don', 'Burnett, Alan K']","['Dennis M', 'Russell N', 'Hills RK', 'Hemmaway C', 'Panoskaltsis N', 'McMullin MF', 'Kjeldsen L', 'Dignum H', 'Thomas IF', 'Clark RE', 'Milligan D', 'Burnett AK']","['Department of Haematology, Christie Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Haematology, Nottingham University Hospital National Health Service Trust, Nottingham, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom;', ""Department of Haematology, Queen's Hospital, Romford, United Kingdom;"", 'Department of Haematology, Imperial College, Northwick Park Hospital Campus, London, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Haematology, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Haematology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark;', 'Department of Haematology, Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom;', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, United Kingdom; and.', 'Department of Haematology, Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Cardiff University School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom;']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Naphthyridines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'K6A90IIZ19 (vosaroxin)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Naphthyridines/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Thiazoles/administration & dosage']",2015/03/26 06:00,2015/07/22 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2014/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/22 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31713-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-608117 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 7;125(19):2923-32. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-608117.

A holistic approach, incorporating a multidisciplinary team, is a key component of successful treatment of these AYA patients. With the appropriate support and management of toxicities during and following treatment, these regimens are well tolerated in the AYA population. Even with the significant progress that has been made during the last decade, patients with persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD) during intensive therapy still have a poor prognosis. With new insights into disease pathogenesis in AYA ALL and the availability of disease-specific kinase inhibitors and novel targeted antibodies, future studies will focus on individualized therapy to eradicate MRD and result in further improvements in survival.

It can be seen de novo or in association with acute myeloid leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasias, or myelodysplastic syndrome. Isolated myeloid sarcoma can be seen as a relapse in cases with allogenic bone marrow transplantation. Although it may involve any tissue in the body, the most common locations are skin, soft tissues, lymph nodes, and the gastrointestinal tract. Immunohistochemically, most cases show myelomonocytic or pure monoblastic differentiation. We reviewed the clinicopathological features of 20 cases of myeloid sarcoma diagnosed in our institute in view of the literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The cases diagnosed between 2005 and 2012 at the Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, were selected. Clinicopathological findings including the age and sex of the patients; symptoms; anatomic location; accompanying hematological disease; and the morphological, immunohistochemical, and cytogenetic features of the cases were noted. RESULTS: Sixteen of the patients were male and 4 were female. The median age at diagnosis was 47 years. The most commonly involved locations were the lymph nodes and skin. Immunohistochemically, eleven cases were of the myelomonocytic and 7 cases were of the myeloid phenotype, whereas 2 cases showed pure monoblastic differentiation. The median follow-up period for the 18 cases with known clinical data was 33 weeks. Five patients died of the disease in an average of 36 weeks. CONCLUSION: Myeloid sarcoma is a rare presentation of leukemias, myeloproliferative neoplasias, or myelodysplastic syndrome, composed of immature myelomonocytic cells in extramedullary tissues. It may present with variable morphological and phenotypic features, always creating a challenge in pathological diagnosis.","['Kaygusuz, Gulsah', 'Kankaya, Duygu', 'Ekinci, Cemil', 'Topcuoglu, Pervin', 'Kuzu, Isinsu']","['Kaygusuz G', 'Kankaya D', 'Ekinci C', 'Topcuoglu P', 'Kuzu I']","['Ankara University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pathology, Ankara, Turkey.

This study was planned to evaluate the MBL prevalence in first-degree relatives of CLL patients in Turkey, which is considered to be an ethnic and geographic bridge between the Eastern and Western worlds. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 136 volunteers [median age: 40 (17-77) years; male/female: 60/76] from 61 families were included. Flow cytometry analysis by 4-colour staining was used for MBL diagnosis. RESULTS: MBL was demonstrated in 17 cases (12.5%). A total of 14 cases (10.3%) were classified as CLL-like MBL, while 3 (2.2%) exhibited a non-CLL-like phenotype. The prevalence of MBL was 12.72% in subjects aged less than 40 years, 12.28% in subjects between 40 and 60 years, and 40% in subjects over 60 years, without statistical significance (p>0.05). A total of 115 cases were evaluated for intermarriage, which was observed in 19 cases (16.5%). The prevalence of MBL did not differ based on intermarriage status (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: The current report is the first MBL prevalence study in a Eurasian population that demonstrates a similar distribution pattern of MBL in Anatolian CLL kindreds.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied LEF-1 expression in 56 newly diagnosed B-acute ALL adult patients using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to investigate whether LEF-1 expression was associated with clinical patient characteristics and treatment outcomes. RESULTS: High LEF-1 expression was associated with significantly poorer disease-free survival (p=0.03) and overall survival (p=0.005). Patients with high LEF-1 expression had a significantly higher relapse rate compared with low LEF-1 expression (p=0.01).

METHODS: Average wholesale price of commonly used CLL treatment regimens was ascertained from national registries. Using the population of Olmsted County, Minnesota, we identified the proportion of patients with newly diagnosed CLL who experience progression to the point of requiring treatment. Using these data, total pharmaceutical cost over a 10-year period after diagnosis was estimated for a hypothetic cohort of 100 newly diagnosed patients under three scenarios: before approval of ibrutinib and idelalisib (historical scenario), after approval of ibrutinib and idelalisib as salvage therapy (current scenarios A and B), and assuming use of ibrutinib as first-line treatment (potential future scenario). RESULTS: Estimated 10-year pharmaceutical costs for 100 newly diagnosed patients were as follows: $4,565,929 (approximately $45,659 per newly diagnosed patient and $157,446 per treated patient) for the historical scenario, $7,794,843 (approximately $77,948 per newly diagnosed patient and $268,788 per treated patient) for current scenario A, $6,309,162 (approximately $63,092 per newly diagnosed patient and $217,557 per treated patient) for current scenario B, and $16,414,055 (approximately $164,141 per newly diagnosed patient and $566,002 per treated patient) for the potential future scenario. Total out-of-pocket cost for 100 patients with newly diagnosed CLL under Medicare Part D increased from $9,426 under the historical scenario (approximately $325 per treated patient) to $363,830 and $255,051 under current scenarios A and B (approximately $8,800 to $12,500 per treated patient) and to $1,031,367 (approximately $35,564 per treated patient) under the future scenario. CONCLUSION: Although ibrutinib and idelalisib are profound treatment advances, they will dramatically increase individual out-of-pocket and societal costs of caring for patients with CLL. These cost considerations may undermine the potential promise of these agents by limiting access and reducing adherence.","['Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Borah, Bijan J', 'Finnes, Heidi D', 'Chaffee, Kari G', 'Ding, Wei', 'Leis, Jose F', 'Chanan-Khan, Asher A', 'Parikh, Sameer A', 'Slager, Susan L', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Call, Tim G']","['Shanafelt TD', 'Borah BJ', 'Finnes HD', 'Chaffee KG', 'Ding W', 'Leis JF', 'Chanan-Khan AA', 'Parikh SA', 'Slager SL', 'Kay NE', 'Call TG']","['Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL shanafelt.tait@mayo.edu.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ; and Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Quinazolinones)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'YG57I8T5M0 (idelalisib)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', '*Drug Costs', 'Health Expenditures', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*economics', 'Medicare Part D/economics', 'Minnesota', 'Models, Economic', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Purines/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Quinazolinones/adverse effects/*economics/*therapeutic use', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",2015/03/26 06:00,2016/04/26 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/04/26 06:00 [medline]']","['JOP.2014.002469 [pii]', '10.1200/JOP.2014.002469 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2015 May;11(3):252-8. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2014.002469.

METHODS: Retrospective, descriptive study was carried out using biopsy specimens of patients diagnosed or suspected to have a lymphoma received by the Department of Pathology, University of Peradeniya for WHO sub typing. A sample of 227 cases diagnosed to have a lymphoma. All lymphomas were sub classified according to WHO 2007 revised classification of haematopoietic and lymphoid neoplasm using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There were 35 (15.4%) Hodgkin Lymphoma (HL) and 192 (84.6%) non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) specimens. Of the NHL the common sub types were diffuse large B cell lymphoma 87 (38.3%), follicular lymphoma 26 (11.5%) and peripheral T cell lymphoma 25 (11%). Of the HL the common sub types were mixed cellular 20 (8.8%) and nodular sclerosis 13 (5.7%). The mean age of the patients was 48.8 +/- 19.3 years and male to female ratio was 1.4:1. The observed patterns of both HL and NHL in the study population were similar to those of other South Asian countries such as India and Pakistan.

DNA of 92 pediatric ALL patients and 312 healthy controls was analyzed for the NAT2 polymorphisms using the PCR-RFLP method. The wild-type NAT2*4 was encountered in 8.6 % of patients versus 11.8 % of controls (P = 0.23). The rapid acetylators NAT2*12 803A>G, AG, GG, and AG/GG were overrepresented in controls (P = 0.0001; odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 0.19, and 0.21 respectively). NAT2*5D 341T>C and NAT2*11A 481C>T were of comparable frequencies. For their combination, NAT2*5A, a slow acetylator, both TCTT and CCCT were overrepresented in patients (P < 0.001; OR 15.8 and 17.9 respectively). NAT2*5B (803A>G, 341T>C, 481C>T) was overrepresented in controls (P < 0.001; OR 0.12). Apparently, 803A>G ameliorated the combined effect of 341T>C and 481C>T. A similar effect was obtained with NAT2*5C (341T>A, 803A>G) (P < 0.0001; OR 0.11). For slow acetylator NAT2*7A 857G>A, GA and GA/AA were overrepresented in patients (P = 0.009 and 0.01; OR 2.74 and 2.72 respectively). NAT2*13 282C>T, NAT2*6B 590G>A, and NAT2*14A 191G>A were of comparable frequencies. NAT2 282C>A in combination with NAT2 857G>A (NAT2*7B) showed a synergistic effect in patients versus controls (P < 0.0001; OR 3.51). In conclusion, NAT2 gene polymorphism(s) with slow acetylator phenotype is generally associated with the risk of development of ALL in children.","['Kamel, Azza M', 'Ebid, Gamal T A', 'Moussa, Heba S']","['Kamel AM', 'Ebid GT', 'Moussa HS']","['Clinical Pathology Department, NCI, Cairo University, Fom El-Khalig square, Kasr El-Aini St, Cairo, 11796, Egypt, azzamkamel@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Tumour Biol,Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine,8409922,"['EC 2.3.1.5 (Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.1.5 (NAT2 protein, human)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Adolescent', 'Arylamine N-Acetyltransferase/*genetics', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Risk Factors']",2015/03/26 06:00,2015/11/17 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2014/10/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/11/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13277-015-3320-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s13277-015-3320-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Tumour Biol. 2015 Aug;36(8):6341-8. doi: 10.1007/s13277-015-3320-7.

The MEK1/2 inhibitor, MEKi-1, induced apoptosis of CLL cells and was synergistic with fludarabine under conditions that mimic the tumor microenvironment, irrespective of poor-risk characteristics. MEKi-1 down-regulated the activities of AKT and ERK1/2 and was synergistic with fludarabine through a mechanism that involved potentiation of DNA damage and attenuation of the activity of ERK1/2 and expression of Mcl-1. This study highlights the significant role of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-ERK1/2 pathway in mediating the effects of the CLL tumor microenvironment and suggests that targeting MEK1/2 in CLL cells may impact upon the activity of both ERK1/2 and AKT.

Degranulation assay, reverse transcription PCR, enzyme-lined immunosorbent assays, western blot analyses, and PCA were performed to measure allergic responses and proinflammatory mediators in antigen-stimulated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-2H3 mast cells and the PCA mouse model. In antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, HDB inhibited the secretion of beta-hexosaminidase (indicating the inhibition of degranulation) and histamine release; decreased expression and production of the inflammatory mediators, cyclooxygenase-2 and prostaglandin E2, and cytokines interleukin-4 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha; and suppressed activation of nuclear factor kappaB, a transcription factor involved in the response to cytokines. HDB attenuated phosphorylation of the mast cell downstream effectors Lyn, Syk, phospholipase Cgamma, protein kinase Cmu, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38. In IgE-sensitized mice, HDB inhibited mast cell-dependent PCA. Furthermore, HDB contained pinosylvin and possessed significant anti-allergic activities.

A multi-center, international, phase II study of alvocidib in fludarabine refractory CLL was undertaken to validate these early results. Patients with fludarabine refractory CLL or prolymphocytic leukemia arising from CLL were treated with single agent alvocidib. The primary outcome measure was overall response rate, with secondary outcomes including survival, toxicity, and response duration. One hundred and sixty five patients were enrolled and 159 patients were treated. The median age was 61 years, the median number of prior therapies was 4, and 96% of patients were fludarabine refractory. The investigator-assessed overall response rate was 25%; the majority of responses were partial. Response rates were lower among patients with del(17p) (14%), but equivalent in patients with del(11q) or bulky lymphadenopathy.

AIM: The aim of this work was the study of the peripheral blood (PB) T-lymphocyte phenotypes in ZAP-70-positive (ZAP-70(+)) and ZAP-70-negative (ZAP-70(-)) untreated patients with CLL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: ZAP-70-, CD25-, CD3-, CD4-, and CD8-positive lymphocytes were enumerated by flow cytometry in PB of 120 untreated CLL patients. CD8+, CD3+CD4+ and CD3+CD25+ cells were counted for the non-leukemic lymphocytes. RESULTS: The patients were distributed into two groups: the ZAP-70(+) group of high CLL progression (n = 61), and the ZAP-70(-) group of low CLL progression (n = 59). In the ZAP-70(+) group, the ratio CD4/CD8 (0.33 +/- 0.62; p = 0.001) and the numbers of the CD3+ (34.8 +/- 8.1%; p = 0.01), CD3+CD4+ (24.4% +/- 4.8; p = 0.001), and CD3+CD25+ (6.2 +/- 0.91%; p = 0.001) lymphocytes were reduced and the percentage of the CD8+ cells (73.1 +/- 4.6%; p = 0.0001) was above the norm. In the ZAP-70(-) group, the number of the CD3+CD4+ cells (36.9 +/- 6.1%; p = 0.001) was within the norm, but the numbers of the CD8+ (11.3 +/- 1.1%; p = 0.0001) and CD3+ (41.2 +/- 5.3%; p = 0.05) lymphocytes were reduced; the ratio CD4/CD8 (3.26 +/- 0.88; p = 0.001) and the percentage of the CD3+CD25+ cells (27.1 +/- 3.4%; p = 0.0001) were above the norm. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the increased CD4/CD8 ratio, caused by the reduced number of the CD8+ lymphocytes, and the increased number of CD3+CD25+ cells are characteristic for the ZAP-70(-) group (slow progressing) of untreated CLL patients. In ZAP-70(+) patients, the CD4/CD8 ratio was significantly below the norm indicating an active disease process. Results of our study contribute to identification of CLL patients with different prognosis in routine diagnostic/prognostic procedures.","['Rivkina, A', 'Holodnuka-Kholodyuk, I', 'Murovska, M', 'Soloveichika, M', 'Lejniece, S']","['Rivkina A', 'Holodnuka-Kholodyuk I', 'Murovska M', 'Soloveichika M', 'Lejniece S']","['Riga Stradins University, Internal Diseases Department, Riga LV1007, Latvia.', 'Riga Stradins University, A.

Such cells, regardless of treatment, acquire ability to proliferation and differentiation. This leads to the re-expansion of the CD34(+) cells. AIM: to determine the CD34 antigen expression in bone marrow and peripheral blood cells in CML patients with different response to imatinib therapy using the results of hematopoietic cells culturing and the data of flow cytometry. METHODS: Bone marrow aspirate from 39 patients who were treated with imatinib was studied with cytogenetic, flow cytometry and culture methods in vitro. RESULTS: In patients with an optimal response to imatinib therapy the number of colonies was 1.8 times lower than the number of those in the group of patients with a suboptimal response to therapy. In turn, in patients with failure of imatinib therapy the number of colonies was the highest and was 2.1 times higher than the patients with optimal response. The results of cytometric studies have shown that the number of CD34(+) cells in bone marrow was significantly higher compared to the number of CD34(+) cells in peripheral blood cells and increased with the acquisition of leukemic cells the resistance to imatinib. There was a direct correlation between the number of colonies and clusters in semisolid agar in vitro and the number of CD34(+) cells in the bone marrow of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between the number of CD34(+) cells and the number of cell aggregates in semisolid agar in vitro indicates the prognostic value of the method for determining CD34(+) cells in the patient bone marrow. The parallel increase of their number in the peripheral blood will allow developing express methods for the detection of individual patient response to imatinib therapy.","['Sviezhentseva, I O', 'Perekhrestenko, T P', 'Bilko, D I', 'Gordienko, A I', 'Diachenko, M V', 'Dyagil, I S']","['Sviezhentseva IO', 'Perekhrestenko TP', 'Bilko DI', 'Gordienko AI', 'Diachenko MV', 'Dyagil IS']","['Centre for Molecular and Cell Research of National University of ""Kyiv-Mohyla Academy"", Kyiv 04655, Ukraine.', 'SI ""Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology of the NAMS of Ukraine"", Kyiv 04060, Ukraine.', 'Centre for Molecular and Cell Research of National University of ""Kyiv-Mohyla Academy"", Kyiv 04655, Ukraine.', 'SI ""Institute of Hematology and Transfusiology of the NAMS of Ukraine"", Kyiv 04060, Ukraine.', 'Centre for Molecular and Cell Research of National University of ""Kyiv-Mohyla Academy"", Kyiv 04655, Ukraine.', 'SI ""The National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the NAMS of Ukraine"", Kyiv 04050, Ukraine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Blood Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects/*pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperazines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",2015/03/26 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['7509 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2015 Mar;37(1):70-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: This study was carried out to analyze the immunophenotypic characteristics of 40 Moroccan patients with T-ALL and its association with biological and clinical features. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 2006 and 2009, 130 adult patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were immunophenotyped by 3-color flow cytometry using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. Cases presenting features of a T-lineage phenotype were subjected to detailed analysis including immunophenotypic, clinical and biological parameters. RESULTS: Proportion of T-ALL among ALL Moroccan patients was 31.0%. Median age of patients was 28 years. Twenty-nine patients were females and 11 were males. 45.0% of patients (18/40) had features of immature T-ALL stages (pro-T and pre-T ALL), 30.0% (12/40) of CD1a+ cortical T-ALL stage and 25.0% (10/40) had a characteristic phenotype of medullary T-ALL. The frequencies of progenitor cell markers CD10, CD34 and TdT expression were 14.0; 57.5% and 50.0% respectively. The aberrant expression of B lineage associated antigen CD79a were positive in 20.5% of the cases and the aberrant expression of myeloid antigens CD13 and/or CD33 was found in 22 (55.0%) cases. No significant association was encountered between TdT, CD34 or myeloid antigens positivity and high risk features at presentation as age, sex, and white blood cells. However, myeloid antigens (CD13 and/or CD33) was significantly associated with T-cell maturation stages (p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report from North Africa of immunophenotypic study on adult T-ALL. Our findings indicate that the proportion of T-ALL among ALL in Morocco is similar to that reported in others Mediterranean countries like France and Italy and that myeloid-associated antigens expression is frequently associated with immature immunophenotype.","['Lahjouji, A', 'Bachir, F', 'Bennani, S', 'Quessar, A', 'Amzazi, S']","['Lahjouji A', 'Bachir F', 'Bennani S', 'Quessar A', 'Amzazi S']","['Laboratory of Flow Cytometry, National Institute of Hygiene, Rabat 769, Morocco.', 'Laboratory of Flow Cytometry, National Institute of Hygiene, Rabat 769, Morocco.', 'Laboratory of Flow Cytometry, National Institute of Hygiene, Rabat 769, Morocco.', 'Service of Hematology and Pediatric Oncology, Hospital 20 Aout, Casablanca, Morocco.', 'Mohamed V-Agdal University, Faculty of Sciences, UFR Biochemistry and Immunology, Rabat 769, Morocco.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ukraine,Exp Oncol,Experimental oncology,101230541,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/immunology', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/analysis/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Morocco/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/26 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['7526 [pii]'],ppublish,Exp Oncol. 2015 Mar;37(1):64-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analysis of immunophenotype of leukemic blast cells seems to be a promising approach for interpreting some controversies in the schemes of normal hematopoiesis. The literature data as well as our own findings in the patients with various types of acute leukemias are in favor of the concept postulating that common myeloid-lymphoid progenitors giving rise to T and B cell branches retain the myeloid potential. The similarity of some immunophenotypic features of blast cells in pro-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute monoblastic leukemia is consistent with monocyte origin postulated in the studies of normal hematopoiesis.

Broviac catheters were used in 63% of all patients and Ports in 20%. One hundred forty-two patients (18%; 95% CI 16 to 21%) experienced at least one BSI (179 BSIs in total; bacteraemia 70%, bacterial sepsis 27%, candidaemia 2%). In 57%, the BSI occurred in inpatients, in 79% after conventional chemotherapy. Only 56 % of the patients showed neutropenia at BSI onset. Eventually, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) or acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML), relapsed malignancy and patients with a Broviac faced an increased risk of BSI in the multivariate analysis. Relapsed malignancy (16%) was an independent risk factor for all BSI and for Gram-positive BSI. CONCLUSION: This study confirms relapsed malignancy as an independent risk factor for BSIs in paediatric cancer patients. On a unit level, data on BSIs in this high-risk population derived from prospective surveillance are not only mandatory to decide on empiric antimicrobial treatment but also beneficial in planning and evaluating preventive bundles. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Paediatric cancer patients face an increased risk of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSIs). * In most cases, these BSIs are associated with the use of a long-term central venous catheter (Broviac, Port), severe and prolonged immunosuppression (e.g. neutropenia) and other chemotherapy-induced alterations of host defence mechanisms (e.g. mucositis). What is New: * This study is the first multicentre study confirming relapsed malignancy as an independent risk factor for BSIs in paediatric cancer patients. * It describes the epidemiology of nosocomial BSI in paediatric cancer patients mainly outside the stem cell transplantation setting during conventional intensive therapy and argues for prospective surveillance programmes to target and evaluate preventive bundle interventions.","['Ammann, R A', 'Laws, H J', 'Schrey, D', 'Ehlert, K', 'Moser, O', 'Dilloo, D', 'Bode, U', 'Wawer, A', 'Schrauder, A', 'Cario, G', 'Laengler, A', 'Graf, N', 'Furtwangler, R', 'Simon, A']","['Ammann RA', 'Laws HJ', 'Schrey D', 'Ehlert K', 'Moser O', 'Dilloo D', 'Bode U', 'Wawer A', 'Schrauder A', 'Cario G', 'Laengler A', 'Graf N', 'Furtwangler R', 'Simon A']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland, Roland.Ammann@insel.ch.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,,IM,"['Bacteremia/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Blood-Borne Pathogens', 'Cancer Care Facilities/statistics & numerical data', 'Candidemia/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Catheter-Related Infections/epidemiology/microbiology', 'Child', 'Cross Infection/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Female', 'Hospitals, Pediatric/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Male', '*Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",2015/03/26 06:00,2016/02/26 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/12 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/26 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00431-015-2525-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 2015 May;174(5):675-86. doi: 10.1007/s00431-015-2525-5.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The prospective pilot study included 8 patients (6 men, 2 women) with CLL concurrent with RF. The patients' median age was 63 years (51-77 years). The Binet classification stage of CLL corresponded to B in 2 cases and C in 6. The mean (+/- standard error) pretreatment concentration of creatinine was 218 +/- 92 mumol/l and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 33 +/- 20 ml/min. The efficiency of monotherapy with B (n=5) and combination therapy with B + R (n=3) was evaluated. In progressive CLL, therapy was performed in specific treatment-naive patients (n = 5) and in pretreated patients refractory to alkylating agents (cyclophosphan, chlorambucil) (n = 3). A total of cycles of B and B + R were carried out. RESULTS: After B monotherapy, one of the 5 cases achieved a complete remission, 3 a partial remission, and 1 a nodular partial remission. Three patients developed recurrence. In the B monotherapy group, the cumulative risk of recurrence was 70% at a median follow-up of 22 months and at a maximum follow-up of 27 months. In the B + R therapy group, all the 3 patients achieved a complete remission. The median follow-up was 7 months; the maximum follow-up was 1 year. There were no deaths or recurrences. During B monotherapy and B + R combination therapy, there was improved kidney function: the mean concentration of creatinine decreased from 218 +/- 92 to 140 +/- 57 mumol/l (p < 0.05); GFR increased from 33 +/- 20.0 to 54 +/- 25 ml/min; the mean increment was 20 ml/min (p < 0.01). Mild and moderate anemia and thrombocytopenia were most common during B and B + R therapies. Neutropenia with mild infection complications, as well as nonhematologic complications were detected in some cases. The drugs were observed to have no nephrotoxic effects. CONCLUSION: The performed pilot prospective indicated that the B + R combination therapy was effective in patients with RF-associated CLL. No toxic effect of B on kidney function was seen. During B therapy, there was better kidney function manifesting itself as a statistically and clinically important decrease in creatinine concentrations and a statistically and clinically important increase in GFR as compared to the baseline values.","['Dzhumbaeva, B T', 'Biriukova, L S', 'Gemdzhian, E G', 'Kravchenko, S K', 'Melikian, A L', 'Roshtina, L S']","['Dzhumbaeva BT', 'Biriukova LS', 'Gemdzhian EG', 'Kravchenko SK', 'Melikian AL', 'Roshtina LS']",,['rus'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)', '981Y8SX18M (Bendamustine Hydrochloride)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Bendamustine Hydrochloride', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Renal Insufficiency/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Rituximab', 'Treatment Outcome']",2014/01/01 00:00,2015/05/06 06:00,['2015/03/26 06:00'],"['2015/03/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.17116/terarkh2014861237-41 [doi]'],ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2014;86(12):37-41. doi: 10.17116/terarkh2014861237-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ABL inhibition by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor nilotinib is a first-line treatment for this disease. Recently, ABL has also been implicated in the transforming properties of solid tumors, including triple negative (TN) breast cancer. TN breast cancers are highly metastatic and several cell lines derived from these tumors display high invasive activity in vitro. This feature is associated with the activation of actin-rich membrane structures called invadopodia that promote extracellular matrix degradation. Here, we investigated nilotinib effect on the invasive and migratory properties of different TN breast cancer cell lines. Nilotinib decreased both matrix degradation and invasion in the TN breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB 231 and MDA-MB 468. However, and unexpectedly, nilotinib increased by two-fold the invasive properties of the TN breast cancer cell line BT-549 and of Src-transformed fibroblasts. Both display much higher levels of ABL kinase activity compared to MDA-MB 231. Similar effects were obtained by siRNA-mediated down-regulation of ABL expression, confirming ABL central role in this process. ABL anti-tumor effect in BT-549 cells and Src-transformed fibroblasts was not dependent on EGF secretion, as recently reported in neck and squamous carcinoma cells. Rather, we identified the TRIO-RAC1 axis as an important downstream element of ABL activity in these cancer cells. In conclusion, the observation that TN breast cancer cell lines respond differently to ABL inhibitors could have implications for future therapies.","['Chevalier, Clement', 'Cannet, Aude', 'Descamps, Simon', 'Sirvent, Audrey', 'Simon, Valerie', 'Roche, Serge', 'Benistant, Christine']","['Chevalier C', 'Cannet A', 'Descamps S', 'Sirvent A', 'Simon V', 'Roche S', 'Benistant C']","['Centre de Recherche de Biochimie Macromoleculaire CNRS UMR5237, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, 34000, France.', 'Centre de Recherche de Biochimie Macromoleculaire CNRS UMR5237, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, 34000, France.', 'Centre de Recherche de Biochimie Macromoleculaire CNRS UMR5237, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, 34000, France.', 'Centre de Recherche de Biochimie Macromoleculaire CNRS UMR5237, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, 34000, France.', 'Centre de Recherche de Biochimie Macromoleculaire CNRS UMR5237, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, 34000, France.', 'Centre de Recherche de Biochimie Macromoleculaire CNRS UMR5237, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, 34000, France.', 'Centre de Biochimie Structurale, CNRS UMR 5048, INSERM UMR 1054, University of Montpellier, Montpellier, 34090, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac1 GTP-Binding Protein)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism/pathology', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'rac1 GTP-Binding Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",2015/03/25 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/10/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0118854 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-44475 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 24;10(3):e0118854. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0118854. eCollection 2015.,20150324,PMC4372365,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, the etiology of childhood leukemia remains largely unknown. Few risk factors (genetic susceptibility, infections, ionizing radiation, etc.) have been clearly identified, but they appear to explain only a small proportion of cases. Considerably more uncertain is the role of other environmental risk factors, such as indoor and outdoor air pollution. We sought to summarize and quantify the association between traffic-related air pollution and risk of childhood leukemia, and further examined results according to method of exposure assessment, study quality, leukemia subtype, time period, and continent where studies took place. After a literature search yielded 6 ecologic and 20 case-control studies, we scored the studies based on the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The studies assessed residential exposure to pollutants from motorized traffic by computing traffic density in the neighboring roads or vicinity to petrol stations, or by using measured or modeled nitrogen dioxide and benzene outdoor air levels. Because heterogeneity across studies was observed, random-effects summary odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were reported. Whenever possible we additionally conducted stratified analyses comparing acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Limiting the analysis to high-quality studies (Newcastle-Ottawa Scale >/= 7), those using traffic density as the exposure assessment metric showed an increase in childhood leukemia risk in the highest exposure category (OR = 1.07, 95% CI 0.93-1.24). However, we observed evidence of publication bias. Results for NO2 exposure and benzene showed an OR of 1.21 (95% CI 0.97-1.52) and 1.64 (95% CI 0.91-2.95) respectively. When stratifying by leukemia type, the results based upon NO2 were 1.21 (95% CI 1.04-1.41) for ALL and 1.06 (95% CI 0.51-2.21) for AML; based upon benzene were 1.09 (95% CI 0.67-1.77) for ALL and 2.28 (95% CI 1.09-4.75) for AML. Estimates were generally higher for exposures in the postnatal period compared to the prenatal period, and for European studies compared to North American studies. Overall, our results support a link between ambient exposure to traffic pollution and childhood leukemia risk, particularly due to benzene.","['Filippini, Tommaso', 'Heck, Julia E', 'Malagoli, Carlotta', 'Del Giovane, Cinzia', 'Vinceti, Marco']","['Filippini T', 'Heck JE', 'Malagoli C', 'Del Giovane C', 'Vinceti M']","['a Environmental, Genetic and Nutritional Epidemiology Research Center (CREAGEN) , University of Modena and Reggio Emilia , Modena , Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,J Environ Sci Health C Environ Carcinog Ecotoxicol Rev,"Journal of environmental science and health.

Treatment of WM cells with PRIMA-1Met resulted in induction of apoptosis, inhibition of migration and suppression of colony formation. Upon PRIMA-1Met treatment, p73 was upregulated and Bcl-xL was down-regulated while no significant change in expression of p53 was observed. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of p53 in WM cell line did not influence the PRIMA-1Met-induced apoptotic response whereas silencing of p73 inhibited latter response in WM cells. Importantly, combined treatment of BCWM-1 cells with PRIMA-1Met and dexamethasone or bortezomib induced synergistic reduction in cell survival.

METHODS: Isolated DNA from peripheral blood of 43 AML patients and 25 healthy subjects as a control group was treated with sodium bisulfite was treated with sodium bisulfite and analyzed by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP) with primers specific for methylated and unmethylated promoter sequences of the SFRP1 & -2 genes. We used Mann-Whitney u-tests to investigate the correlation between SFRP1 and SFRP2 genes hypermethylation and clinical parameters. RESULTS: The frequency of aberrant hypermethylation of SFRP1 and SFRP2 genes in patients with AML was determined 30.2% (13/43) and 20.9% (9/43), respectively. In addition, for all subjects in control group, methylation of SFRP1 and SFRP2 genes were negative. Patients with M0 subtype of FAB-AML had the highest incidence of hypermethylation of SFRP1 (P = 0.028) and SFRP2 (P = 0.004). CONCLUSION: The present study showed that, like many solid tumors, methylation of SFRP genes also occurs in AML. Therefore, the methylation of these genes may play a role in the initiation of leukmogenesis.","['Ghasemi, Ali', 'Rostami, Shahrbano', 'Chahardouli, Bahram', 'Alizad Ghandforosh, Nasrin', 'Ghotaslou, Abbas', 'Nadali, Fatemeh']","['Ghasemi A', 'Rostami S', 'Chahardouli B', 'Alizad Ghandforosh N', 'Ghotaslou A', 'Nadali F']","['MSc, Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran university of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'PhD, Assistant Professor, Hematology-Oncology and Stem cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran university of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'PhD, Assistant Professor, Hematology-Oncology and Stem cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran university of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'MSc, Hematology-Oncology and Stem cell Transplantation Research Center, Tehran university of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'MSc, Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran university of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'PhD, Associate Professor, Department of Hematology, School of Allied Medical Sciences, Tehran university of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,2015/03/25 06:00,2015/03/25 06:01,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2014/09/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/25 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2015 Jan 1;9(1):15-21.,,PMC4369229,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'DNA Methylation', 'SFRP']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to validate the expression profile of 45 genes associated with signaling pathways involved in leukemia and to evaluate their association with the prognosis of B-ALL. METHODS: 219 samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from 73 B-ALL patients were studied at diagnosis, four, and eight weeks after starting treatment. Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Normalized delta Cq values of 23 genes showed differences between B-ALL and controls at diagnosis time (P values < 0.05). There were significant associations between B-ALL patients relapse/death and the expression levels of IL2RA, SORT1, DEFA1, and FLT3 genes at least in one of the times evaluated (P values < 0.05 and odds ratio ranges: 3.73-27). The association between FLT3 deregulation and relapse/death was a constant in the times studied and their overexpression significantly increased the odds of relapse/death in a range of 3.73 and 6.05 among study population (P values < 0.05).

Patients with CLL are susceptible to infectious diseases as a result of both, the disease progression and chemotherapy that indicates deficiency of immune responses to pathogens, including innate immunity, mediated by monocytes. Monocytes are also often recruited by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) which express anti-tumour toxicity through Fcgamma-receptor (FcgammaR)-mediated phagocytosis of opsonised leukaemic cells. In this paper we address of monocytes functional status through assessment of the patterns of expression of Fcgamma receptors CD64, CD32, CD16 and CD180 receptor on monocytes from CLL patients and healthy individuals using specific mAbs and flow cytometry. Our data demonstrate that monocytes from peripheral blood of CLL patients lack expression of CD64 and CD16 as well as CD180 that would substantially undermine their ability to contribute to anti-bacterial immune responses. In addition, aberrant expression of CD64 would negatively affect the efficiency of antibody-mediated immunotherapies.","['Tsertsvadze, T Sh', 'Mitskevich, N G', 'Ghirdaladze, D M', 'Porakishvili, N Z']","['Tsertsvadze TSh', 'Mitskevich NG', 'Ghirdaladze DM', 'Porakishvili NZ']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Georgia (Republic),Georgian Med News,Georgian medical news,101218222,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD180 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*blood/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/*genetics/pathology', 'Monocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Phagocytosis/genetics', 'Receptors, IgG/*blood/genetics']",2015/03/25 06:00,2016/02/13 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Georgian Med News. 2015 Feb;(239):35-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The evolutionary history of these lncRNAs has been notoriously hard to study systematically due to their low level of sequence conservation that precludes comprehensive homology-based surveys and makes them nearly impossible to align. An increasing number of special cases, however, has been shown to be at least as old as the vertebrate lineage. Here we use the conservation of splice sites to trace the evolution of lncRNAs. We show that >85% of the human GENCODE lncRNAs were already present at the divergence of placental mammals and many hundreds of these RNAs date back even further. Nevertheless, we observe a fast turnover of intron/exon structures. We conclude that lncRNA genes are evolutionary ancient components of vertebrate genomes that show an unexpected and unprecedented evolutionary plasticity. We offer a public web service (http://splicemap.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de) that allows to retrieve sets of orthologous splice sites and to produce overview maps of evolutionarily conserved splice sites for visualization and further analysis.

The aim of this study was to estimate the reversal effects of down-regulation of Na(+)/H(+) exchanger 1 (NHE1) on the chemoresistance of BCR-ABL-positive leukemia patients' cells and cell lines. After treatment with the specific NHE1 inhibitor cariporide to decrease intracellular pH (pHi), the heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) levels of the K562R cell line and cells from IM-insensitive CML patients decreased. HO-1, as a Bcr/Abl-dependent survival molecule in CML cells, is important for the resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with newly diagnosed CML or IM-resistant CML. Silencing PKC-beta and Nrf-2 or treatment with inhibitors of p38 pathways obviously blocked NHE1-induced HO-1 expression. Furthermore, treatment with HO-1 or p38 inhibitor plus IM increased the apoptosis of the K562R cell line and IM-insensitive CML patients' cells. Inhibiting HO-1 enhanced the activation of caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1. Hence, the results support the anti-apoptotic role of HO-1 induced by NHE1 in the K562R cell line and IM-insensitive CML patients and provide a mechanism by which inducing HO-1 expression via the PKC-beta/p38-MAPK pathway may promote tumor resistance to oxidative stress.","['Ma, Dan', 'Fang, Qin', 'Wang, Ping', 'Gao, Rui', 'Wu, Weibing', 'Lu, Tangsheng', 'Cao, Lu', 'Hu, Xiuying', 'Wang, Jishi']","['Ma D', 'Fang Q', 'Wang P', 'Gao R', 'Wu W', 'Lu T', 'Cao L', 'Hu X', 'Wang J']","['From the Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China, Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated BaiYun Hospital of Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated BaiYun Hospital of Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550014, China, Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China, and.', 'From the Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China, Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'From the Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China, Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'From the Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China, Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'School of Pharmacy, Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'From the Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China, Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guiyang 550004, China.', 'From the Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, China, Guizhou Province Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Center and Key Laboratory of Hematological Disease Diagnostic and Treatment Centre, Guiyang 550004, China, wangjishi9646@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Cation Transport Proteins)', '0 (NF-E2-Related Factor 2)', '0 (NFE2L2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (SLC9A1 protein, human)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 1)', '0 (Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (HMOX1 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase-1)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology', 'Cation Transport Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects/genetics', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Heme Oxygenase-1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/genetics', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C beta/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 1', 'Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers/genetics/*metabolism']",2015/03/25 06:00,2015/07/30 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0021-9258(20)33729-7 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.M114.626960 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2015 May 15;290(20):12558-71. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M114.626960.

This article summarizes pharmacological, efficacy and tolerability data relevant to the use of ibrutinib in these indications. In clinical studies, ibrutinib induced a high overall response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL (phase II study). In addition, ibrutinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival and significantly improved the partial response rate and overall survival in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL (RESONATE study), including in those with del 17p, a subgroup with a poor prognosis. Ibrutinib had an acceptable tolerability profile in these studies with <10% of patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events.

Runx1 is functionally promiscuous and acts as either an oncogene or tumor suppressor gene in certain epithelial cancers. Recent evidence suggests that Runx1 is an important factor in breast cancer, however, its role remains ambiguous. Here, we addressed whether Runx1 has a specific pathological role during breast cancer progression and show that Runx1 has an oncogenic function. We observed elevated Runx1 expression in a subset of human breast cancers. Furthermore, throughout the course of disease progression in a classical mouse model of breast cancer (i.e., the MMTV-PyMT transgenic model), Runx1 expression increases in the primary site (mammary gland) and is further upregulated in tumors and distal lung metastatic lesions. Ex vivo studies using tumor epithelial cells derived from these mice express significantly higher levels of Runx1 than normal mammary epithelial cells. The tumor cells exhibit increased rates of migration and invasion, indicative of an aggressive cancer phenotype. Inhibition of Runx1 expression using RNA interference significantly abrogates these cancer-relevant phenotypic characteristics. Importantly, our data establish that Runx1 contributes to murine mammary tumor development and malignancy and potentially represents a key disease-promoting and prognostic factor in human breast cancer progression and metastasis.","['Browne, Gillian', 'Taipaleenmaki, Hanna', 'Bishop, Nicole M', 'Madasu, Sharath C', 'Shaw, Leslie M', 'van Wijnen, Andre J', 'Stein, Janet L', 'Stein, Gary S', 'Lian, Jane B']","['Browne G', 'Taipaleenmaki H', 'Bishop NM', 'Madasu SC', 'Shaw LM', 'van Wijnen AJ', 'Stein JL', 'Stein GS', 'Lian JB']","['Department of Biochemistry and Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Heisenberg-Group for Molecular Skeletal Biology, Department of Trauma, Hand & Reconstructive Surgery, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany.', 'Microscopy Imaging Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Orthopedic Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Vermont Cancer Center, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, Vermont.', 'Department of Cell Biology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Movement/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/*genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mammary Tumor Virus, Mouse/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial/*pathology']",2015/03/25 06:00,2015/09/22 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/02/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/jcp.24989 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 2015 Oct;230(10):2522-32. doi: 10.1002/jcp.24989.,,PMC4481134,,,"['(c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,"['P01 CA082834/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 DE012528/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA140043/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS682686'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Individuals with WT1-positive acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first (CR1) or second (CR2) remission or with higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) following at least 1 prior line of therapy were vaccinated with a mixture of peptides derived from the WT1 protein, with sargramostim injections before vaccination to amplify immunogenicity. Six vaccinations were delivered biweekly, continuing then monthly until patients received 12 vaccinations or showed disease relapse or progression. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by progression-free and overall survival. Immune responses were evaluated by delayed-type hypersensitivity testing and T-cell IFNgamma ELISPOT at specified intervals. In 16 patients who received at least one vaccination, 10 completed the planned course of six vaccinations and six continued for up to six additional monthly vaccinations. Vaccinations were well tolerated, with no patients discontinuing due to toxicity. One of two patients with high-risk MDS experienced a prolonged decrease in transfusion dependence. Two of 14 AML patients demonstrated relapse-free survival >1 year. Both patients were in CR2 at time of vaccination, with duration of their remission exceeding duration of their first remission, suggesting a potential benefit. Our WT1 vaccine was well-tolerated. The clinical benefit that we observed in several patients suggests engagement of a protective immune response, indicating a need for further trials.","['Brayer, Jason', 'Lancet, Jeffrey E', 'Powers, John', 'List, Alan', 'Balducci, Lodovico', 'Komrokji, Rami', 'Pinilla-Ibarz, Javier']","['Brayer J', 'Lancet JE', 'Powers J', 'List A', 'Balducci L', 'Komrokji R', 'Pinilla-Ibarz J']","['Department of Malignant Hematology, H.

Among the key aberrant intracellular signaling pathways involved in AML, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K/AKT/mTOR) axis is of major interest. This axis modulates a wide array of critical cellular functions, including proliferation, metabolism, and survival. Pharmacologic inhibitors of components of this pathway have been developed over the past decade, but none has an established role in the treatment of AML. This review will discuss the preclinical data and clinical results driving ongoing attempts to exploit the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in patients with AML and address issues related to negative feedback loops that account for leukemic cell survival. Targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is of high interest for the treatment of AML, but combination therapies with other targeted agents may be needed to block negative feedback loops in leukemia cells.","['Carneiro, Benedito A', 'Kaplan, Jason B', 'Altman, Jessica K', 'Giles, Francis J', 'Platanias, Leonidas C']","['Carneiro BA', 'Kaplan JB', 'Altman JK', 'Giles FJ', 'Platanias LC']","['a Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University ; Chicago , IL , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/*metabolism']",2015/03/25 06:00,2016/03/02 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2015.1026510 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2015;16(5):648-56. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2015.1026510.,,PMC4622839,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Akt', 'HDAC, histone deacetylase', 'MAPK', 'MNK, MAPK-interacting kinase', 'PDK1, phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1', 'PI3K', 'PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase', 'mTOR', 'mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin', 'targeted therapy']",,,,"['R01 CA121192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077816/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA155566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77816/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA060553/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA161196/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA155566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'I01CX000916/CX/CSRD VA/United States', 'CA121192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, additional genetic mutations cooperating with oncogenic RAS in JMML/ CMML progression and/or their transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain largely unknown. Here we tested the potential genetic interaction of DNMT3A mutations and oncogenic RAS mutations in leukemogenesis. We found that Dnmt3a(-/-) induces multiple hematopoietic phenotypes after a prolonged latency, including T-cell expansion in the peripheral blood, stress erythropoiesis in the spleen and myeloid malignancies in the liver. Dnmt3a(-/-) significantly promoted JMML/CMML progression and shortened the survival of Kras(G12D/+) mice in a cell-autonomous manner. Similarly, downregulating Dnmt3a also promoted myeloid malignancies in Nras(G12D/+) mice. Further studies show that Dnmt3a deficiency rescues Kras(G12D/+)-mediated depletion of hematopoietic stem cells and increases self-renewal of Kras(G12D/+) myeloid progenitors (MPs). Moreover, ~33% of animals developed an AML-like disease, which is driven by Kras(G12D/+); Dnmt3a(-/-) MPs. Consistent with our result, COSMIC database mining demonstrates that the combination of oncogenic RAS and DNMT3A mutations exclusively occurred in patients with JMML, CMML or AML. Our results suggest that DNMT3A mutations and oncogenic RAS cooperate to regulate hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells and promote myeloid malignancies.","['Chang, Y-I', 'You, X', 'Kong, G', 'Ranheim, E A', 'Wang, J', 'Du, J', 'Liu, Y', 'Zhou, Y', 'Ryu, M-J', 'Zhang, J']","['Chang YI', 'You X', 'Kong G', 'Ranheim EA', 'Wang J', 'Du J', 'Liu Y', 'Zhou Y', 'Ryu MJ', 'Zhang J']","['McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Institute of Physiology, National Yang-Ming University, Taipei City, Taiwan.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center, Madison, WI, USA.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.', 'Department of Medical Science, School of Medicine, Yonsei University, Seoul, Korea.', 'McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, WI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNMT3A protein, human)', '0 (Dnmt3a protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA Methyltransferase 3A)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras))']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/*genetics', 'DNA Methyltransferase 3A', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Down-Regulation', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/metabolism', 'Penetrance', 'Phenotype', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras)/*genetics']",2015/03/25 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/18 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201585 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.85 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Sep;29(9):1847-56. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.85.

However, the biological role of class IIa HDACs (HDAC4, 5, 7 and 9) in cancer cells, including multiple myeloma (MM), remains unclear. Recent studies show HDAC4 interacts with activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and inhibits activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-associated proapoptotic transcription factor C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). In this study, we hypothesized that HDAC4 knockdown and/or inhibition could enhance apoptosis in MM cells under ER stress condition by upregulating ATF4, followed by CHOP. HDAC4 knockdown showed modest cell growth inhibition; however, it markedly enhanced cytotoxicity induced by either tunicamycin or carfilzomib (CFZ), associated with upregulating ATF4 and CHOP. For pharmacological inhibition of HDAC4, we employed a novel and selective class IIa HDAC inhibitor TMP269, alone and in combination with CFZ. As with HDAC4 knockdown, TMP269 significantly enhanced cytotoxicity induced by CFZ in MM cell lines, upregulating ATF4 and CHOP and inducing apoptosis. Conversely, enhanced cytotoxicity was abrogated by ATF4 knockdown, confirming that ATF4 has a pivotal role mediating cytotoxicity in this setting. These results provide the rationale for novel treatment strategies combining class IIa HDAC inhibitors with ER stressors, including proteasome inhibitors, to improve patient outcome in MM.","['Kikuchi, S', 'Suzuki, R', 'Ohguchi, H', 'Yoshida, Y', 'Lu, D', 'Cottini, F', 'Jakubikova, J', 'Bianchi, G', 'Harada, T', 'Gorgun, G', 'Tai, Y-T', 'Richardson, P G', 'Hideshima, T', 'Anderson, K C']","['Kikuchi S', 'Suzuki R', 'Ohguchi H', 'Yoshida Y', 'Lu D', 'Cottini F', 'Jakubikova J', 'Bianchi G', 'Harada T', 'Gorgun G', 'Tai YT', 'Richardson PG', 'Hideshima T', 'Anderson KC']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Jerome Lipper Multiple Myeloma Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Death/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', '*Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/drug effects/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism', 'Isoenzymes', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",2015/03/25 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/05 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201583 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.83 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Sep;29(9):1918-27. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.83.

Overall, 217 patients with ET (number 197) and early-PMF (number 20) were included in the analysis. Median follow-up time was 10.2 years. The cumulative incidence of thrombosis, hemorrhages and disease evolution into myelofibrosis/acute leukemia were 16.6%, 8.6% and 3% at 15 years, respectively. No differences were detectable between ET and early-PMF patients, although the latter cohort showed a trend for worse combined-event free survival (EFS). Mutation frequency were 61% for JAK2V617F, 25% for CALR and 1% for MPLW515K, and were comparable across WHO diagnosis; however, JAK2V617F allele burden was higher in the early-PMF group. Compared with JAK2V617F-positive patients, CALR-mutated patients displayed higher platelet count and lower hemoglobin level. CALR mutations significantly correlated with lower thrombotic risk (9.1% versus 21.7%, P = 0.04), longer survival (100% versus 96%, P = 0.05) and better combined-EFS (86% versus 71%, P = 0.02). However, non-type 1/type 2 CALR mutations ('minor' mutations) and abnormal karyotype were found to correlate with increased risk of disease evolution. At last contact, six patients had died; in five cases, the causes of death were related to the hematological disease and occurred at a median age of 64 years (range: 53-68 years). Twenty-eight patients (13%) were unmutated for JAK2, CALR and MPL: no event was registered in these 'triple-negative' patients.","['Palandri, F', 'Latagliata, R', 'Polverelli, N', 'Tieghi, A', 'Crugnola, M', 'Martino, B', 'Perricone, M', 'Breccia, M', 'Ottaviani, E', 'Testoni, N', 'Merli, F', 'Aversa, F', 'Alimena, G', 'Cavo, M', 'Martinelli, G', 'Catani, L', 'Baccarani, M', 'Vianelli, N']","['Palandri F', 'Latagliata R', 'Polverelli N', 'Tieghi A', 'Crugnola M', 'Martino B', 'Perricone M', 'Breccia M', 'Ottaviani E', 'Testoni N', 'Merli F', 'Aversa F', 'Alimena G', 'Cavo M', 'Martinelli G', 'Catani L', 'Baccarani M', 'Vianelli N']","[""Department of Experimental, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, Institute of Hematology 'L. and A.

The predominant subtypes of DLBCL display features of chronic or tonic B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling. However, it is not known whether the spatial organization of the BCR contributes to the regulation of pro-survival signaling pathways and cell growth. Here, we show that primary DLBCL tumors and patient-derived DLBCL cell lines contain high levels of phosphorylated Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin (ERM) proteins. The surface BCRs in both activated B cell and germinal B cell subtype DLBCL cells co-segregate with phosphoERM suggesting that the cytoskeletal network may support localized BCR signaling and contribute to pathogenesis. Indeed, ablation of membrane-cytoskeletal linkages by dominant-negative mutants, pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of ERM proteins disrupted cell surface BCR organization, inhibited proximal and distal BCR signaling, and reduced the growth of DLBCL cell lines. In vivo administration of the ezrin inhibitor retarded the growth of DLBCL tumor xenografts, concomitant with reduction in intratumor phosphoERM levels, dampened pro-survival signaling and induction of apoptosis. Our results reveal a novel ERM-based spatial mechanism that is coopted by DLBCL cells to sustain tumor cell growth and survival.","['Pore, D', 'Bodo, J', 'Danda, A', 'Yan, D', 'Phillips, J G', 'Lindner, D', 'Hill, B T', 'Smith, M R', 'Hsi, E D', 'Gupta, N']","['Pore D', 'Bodo J', 'Danda A', 'Yan D', 'Phillips JG', 'Lindner D', 'Hill BT', 'Smith MR', 'Hsi ED', 'Gupta N']","['Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Institute of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology, Institute of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Department of Immunology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETV5 protein, human)', '0 (NSC668394)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Quinolones)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Biopsy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Microvilli/metabolism', 'Phenols/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'Quinolones/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Burden/drug effects']",2015/03/25 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/18 00:00 [revised]', '2015/03/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['leu201586 [pii]', '10.1038/leu.2015.86 [doi]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2015 Sep;29(9):1857-67. doi: 10.1038/leu.2015.86.

The small-molecule RETRA has been described to disrupt this interaction and to suppress carcinoma cells (Kravchenko et al., 2008). RETRA's anticancer activity was restricted to tumour cells bearing mutant p53; it was not active in p53 negative and in p53 wild-type cells. Here, we explored the responsiveness of Ewing's sarcoma (ES) cells with mutant p53 to RETRA. For comparison, we also tested RETRA in p53 null and in p53 wild-type ES cells. We found RETRA to be effective in the three mutant p53 ES cell lines investigated. Strikingly, however, RETRA was similarly effective in the p53-deficient and in the two p53 wild-type ES cell lines examined. RETRA elicited apoptosis, as assessed by flow cytometric analyses of mitochondrial depolarisation and DNA fragmentation, caspase 3/7 activity assay and PARP-1 cleavage immunodetection, and G2/M cell cycle arrest completely independent of the cellular TP53 status. In contrast, various p53-deficient and -proficient carcinoma, osteosarcoma and leukaemia cells were unresponsive to RETRA. RETRA also induced gene expression of p53 target genes PUMA and p21 in ES cells irrespective of their TP53 status. These in vitro findings provide a rationale for an in vivo exploration of RETRA's potential as an effective therapeutic approach for patients with ES.","['Sonnemann, Jurgen', 'Grauel, Desiree', 'Blumel, Lisa', 'Hentschel, Julia', 'Marx, Christian', 'Blumrich, Annelie', 'Focke, Katharina', 'Becker, Sabine', 'Wittig, Susan', 'Schinkel, Sandra', 'Kramer, Oliver H', 'Beck, James F']","['Sonnemann J', 'Grauel D', 'Blumel L', 'Hentschel J', 'Marx C', 'Blumrich A', 'Focke K', 'Becker S', 'Wittig S', 'Schinkel S', 'Kramer OH', 'Beck JF']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Children's Clinic, Jena University Hospital, Jena, Germany.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Ovarian reserve seems to be particularly reduced in survivors who received procarbazine (in most cases for Hodgkin lymphoma) or high-dose chemotherapy; procarbazine but not cyclophosphamide dose is associated with diminished ovarian reserve. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: A few studies have demonstrated diminished ovarian reserve in survivors after various combination therapies, but the individual role of each treatment is difficult to assess. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study, involving 105 survivors and 20 controls. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: One hundred and five survivors aged 17-40 years and 20 controls investigated on Days 2-5 of a menstrual cycle or Day 7 of an oral contraceptive pill-free interval. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: ovarian surface area (OS), total number of antral follicles (AFC), serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Survivors had a lower OS than controls: 3.5 versus 4.4 cm(2) per ovary (P = 0.0004), and lower AMH levels: 10.7 versus 22 pmol/l (P = 0.003). Ovarian markers (OS, AMH, AFC) were worse in patients who received high-dose compared with conventional-dose alkylating agents (P = 0.01 for OS, P = 0.002 for AMH, P < 0.0001 for AFC). Hodgkin lymphoma survivors seemed to have a greater reduction in ovarian reserve than survivors of leukaemia (P = 0.04 for AMH, P = 0.01 for AFC), sarcoma (P = 0.04 for AMH, P = 0.04 for AFC) and other lymphomas (P = 0.04 for AFC). A multiple linear regression analysis showed that procarbazine but not cyclophosphamide nor ifosfamide dose was associated with reduced OS (P = 0.0003), AFC (P = 0.0007), AMH (P < 0.0001) and higher FSH levels (P < 0.0001). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The small percentage of participating survivors (28%) from the total cohort does not allow conclusion on fertility issues because of possible response bias. The association between procarbazine and HL makes it impossible to dissociate their individual impacts on ovarian reserve. The number of controls is small, but ovarian volume and AMH levels in survivors were compared with published normal values and results were unchanged. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Early detection and follow-up of compromised ovarian function after cancer therapy should help physicians to counsel young survivors about their fertility window. However, longitudinal follow-up is required to determine the rate of progression from low ovarian reserve to premature ovarian failure.

However, carbohydrate-carbohydrate interactions (CCIs) have largely been overlooked. Here, we investigate the concept of CCI-mediated drug delivery. Lactose-functionalized beta-cyclodextrin (L-beta-CD) hosting doxorubicin (Dox) was evaluated for site-specific delivery to cancer cells via interaction with GM3 , a cell-surface carbohydrate. The host-guest complex was evaluated in B16 melanoma cells, which express exceptionally high levels of GM3 , and acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) and mouse fibroblast (NIH-3T3) cells, which lack GM3 on the cell surface. Doxorubicin (Dox) was delivered more efficiently into B16 cells compared with NIH-3T3 and THP-1 cells. In B16 cells pretreated with sialidase or sodium periodate, thus preventing CCI formation, drug uptake was significantly decreased. Taken together, the results of these studies strongly support CCI-mediated uptake via the GM3 -lactose interaction as the mechanism of controlled drug delivery.","['Murthy, Raghavendra Vasudeva', 'Bavireddi, Harikrishna', 'Gade, Madhuri', 'Kikkeri, Raghavendra']","['Murthy RV', 'Bavireddi H', 'Gade M', 'Kikkeri R']","['Department of Chemistry, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune, Dr. Homi Bhabha Road, Pashan Pune, 411021 (India).']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,ChemMedChem,ChemMedChem,101259013,"['0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'J2B2A4N98G (Lactose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/*chemistry/*pharmacokinetics', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lactose/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Conformation', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2015/03/25 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/cmdc.201500046 [doi]'],ppublish,ChemMedChem. 2015 May;10(5):792-6. doi: 10.1002/cmdc.201500046.

We investigated the risks for and outcomes of CDI in hospitalized leukemia patients. METHODS Adults with a primary diagnosis of leukemia were extracted from the United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample database, 2005-2011. The primary outcomes of interest were CDI incidence, CDI-associated mortality, length of stay (LOS), and charges. In a secondary analysis, we sought to identify independent risk factors for CDI in leukemia patients. Logistic regression was used to derive odds ratios (ORs) adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS A total of 1,243,107 leukemia hospitalizations were identified. Overall CDI incidence was 3.4% and increased from 3.0% to 3.5% during the 7-year study period. Leukemia patients had 2.6-fold higher risk for CDI than non-leukemia patients, adjusted for LOS. CDI was associated with a 20% increase in mortality of leukemia patients, as well as 2.6 times prolonged LOS and higher hospital charges. Multivariate analysis revealed that age >65 years (OR, 1.13), male gender (OR, 1.14), prolonged LOS, admission to teaching hospital (OR, 1.16), complications of sepsis (OR, 1.83), neutropenia (OR, 1.35), renal failure (OR, 1.18), and bone marrow or stem cell transplantation (OR, 1.27) were significantly associated with CDI occurrence. CONCLUSIONS Hospitalized leukemia patients have greater than twice the risk of CDI than non-leukemia patients. The incidence of CDI in this population increased 16.7% from 2005 to 2011. Development of CDI in leukemia patients was associated with increased mortality, longer LOS, and higher hospital charges.","['Luo, Ruihong', 'Greenberg, Alan', 'Stone, Christian D']","['Luo R', 'Greenberg A', 'Stone CD']","['1Department of Internal Medicine,University of Nevada School of Medicine,Las Vegas,Nevada.', '2Infectious Disease Specialists,University Medical Center,Las Vegas,Nevada.', '3Section of Gastroenterology and Hepatology,University of Nevada School of Medicine,Las Vegas,Nevada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,Infection control and hospital epidemiology,8804099,,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', '*Clostridioides difficile', 'Enterocolitis, Pseudomembranous/economics/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Female', 'Hospital Charges', 'Hospitalization', 'Hospitals, Teaching/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Length of Stay', 'Leukemia/economics/*mortality', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/economics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/economics/mortality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/economics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/economics/mortality', 'Renal Insufficiency/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Sepsis/epidemiology', 'Sex Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",2015/03/25 06:00,2016/03/30 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/30 06:00 [medline]']","['S0899823X15000549 [pii]', '10.1017/ice.2015.54 [doi]']",ppublish,Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2015 Jul;36(7):794-801. doi: 10.1017/ice.2015.54.

Pten deletion induces myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and/or T-ALL in mice. Previous studies attributed Pten-loss-related hematopoietic defects and leukemogenesis to excessive activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR signaling. Although inhibition of this signal dramatically suppresses the growth of PTEN-null T-ALL cells in vitro, treatment with inhibitors of this pathway does not cause a complete remission in vivo. Here, we report that focal adhesion kinase (Fak), a protein substrate of Pten, also contributes to T-ALL development in Pten-null mice. Inactivation of the FAK signaling pathway by either genetic or pharmacologic methods significantly sensitizes both murine and human PTEN-null T-ALL cells to PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibition when cultured in vitro on feeder layer cells or a matrix and in vivo.","['You, Dewen', 'Xin, Junping', 'Volk, Andrew', 'Wei, Wei', 'Schmidt, Rachel', 'Scurti, Gina', 'Nand, Sucha', 'Breuer, Eun-Kyoung', 'Kuo, Paul C', 'Breslin, Peter', 'Kini, Ameet R', 'Nishimura, Michael I', 'Zeleznik-Le, Nancy J', 'Zhang, Jiwang']","['You D', 'Xin J', 'Volk A', 'Wei W', 'Schmidt R', 'Scurti G', 'Nand S', 'Breuer EK', 'Kuo PC', 'Breslin P', 'Kini AR', 'Nishimura MI', 'Zeleznik-Le NJ', 'Zhang J']","['Oncology Institute, Loyola University Chicago, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.

In the current work, we report that the Bcr-Abl inhibitor and anti-leukemia agent ponatinib is also a first-in-class dual inhibitor of RIPK1 and RIPK3. Ponatinib potently inhibited multiple paradigms of RIPK1- and RIPK3-dependent cell death and inflammatory tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) gene transcription. We further describe design strategies that utilize the ponatinib scaffold to develop two classes of inhibitors (CS and PN series), each with greatly improved selectivity for RIPK1. In particular, we detail the development of PN10, a highly potent and selective ""hybrid"" RIPK1 inhibitor, capturing the best properties of two different allosteric RIPK1 inhibitors, ponatinib and necrostatin-1. Finally, we show that RIPK1 inhibitors from both classes are powerful blockers of TNF-induced injury in vivo. Altogether, these findings outline promising candidate molecules and design approaches for targeting RIPK1- and RIPK3-driven inflammatory pathologies.","['Najjar, Malek', 'Suebsuwong, Chalada', 'Ray, Soumya S', 'Thapa, Roshan J', 'Maki, Jenny L', 'Nogusa, Shoko', 'Shah, Saumil', 'Saleh, Danish', 'Gough, Peter J', 'Bertin, John', 'Yuan, Junying', 'Balachandran, Siddharth', 'Cuny, Gregory D', 'Degterev, Alexei']","['Najjar M', 'Suebsuwong C', 'Ray SS', 'Thapa RJ', 'Maki JL', 'Nogusa S', 'Shah S', 'Saleh D', 'Gough PJ', 'Bertin J', 'Yuan J', 'Balachandran S', 'Cuny GD', 'Degterev A']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Rep,Cell reports,101573691,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyridazines)', '4340891KFS (ponatinib)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (RIPK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (RIPK3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Pyridazines/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Receptor-Interacting Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry', 'Substrate Specificity']",2015/03/25 06:00,2015/10/27 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/13 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['S2211-1247(15)00210-7 [pii]', '10.1016/j.celrep.2015.02.052 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Rep. 2015 Mar 24;10(11):1850-60. doi: 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.02.052.,,PMC4494889,,,,,,"['R01 CA168621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS082257/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA190542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM084205/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI113469/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM080356/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS668357'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to establish the clinical significance of minimal residual disease in a prospective trial that used sequential minimal residual disease measurements to guide treatment decisions. METHODS: Between June 7, 2000, and Oct 24, 2007, 498 assessable patients with newly diagnosed ALL were enrolled in a clinical trial at St Jude Children's Research Hospital. We provisionally classified the risk of relapse as low, standard, or high according to patients' baseline clinical and laboratory features. Final risk assignment to establish treatment intensity was based mainly on minimal residual disease levels measured on days 19 and 46 of remission induction, and on week 7 of maintenance treatment. Additional measurements of minimal residual disease were made on weeks 17, 48, and 120 (end of treatment). The primary aim was to establish the association between event-free survival and patients' minimal residual disease levels during remission induction and sequentially post-remission. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00137111. FINDINGS: Irrespective of the provisional risk classification, 10-year event-free survival was significantly worse for patients with 1% or greater minimal residual disease levels on day 19 compared with patients with lower minimal residual disease levels (69.2%, 95% CI 49.6-82.4, n=36 vs 95.5%, 91.7-97.5, n=244; p<0.001 for the provisional low-risk group and 65.1%, 50.7-76.2, n=56 vs 82.9%, 75.6-88.2, n=142; p=0.01 for the provisional standard-risk group). 12 patients with provisional low-risk ALL and 1% or higher minimal residual disease levels on day 19 but negative minimal residual disease (<0.01%) on day 46 were treated for standard-risk ALL and had a 10-year event-free survival of 88.9% (43.3-98.4). For the 280 provisional low-risk patients, a minimal residual disease level of less than 1% on day 19 predicted a better outcome, irrespective of the minimal residual disease level on day 46. Of provisional standard-risk patients with minimal residual disease of less than 1% on day 19, the 15 with persistent minimal residual disease on day 46 seemed to have an inferior 10-year event-free survival compared with the 126 with negative minimal residual disease (72.7%, 42.5-88.8 vs 84.0%, 76.3-89.4; p=0.06) after receiving the same post-remission treatment for standard-risk ALL. Of patients attaining negative minimal residual disease status after remission induction, minimal residual disease re-emerged in four of 382 studied on week 7, one of 448 at week 17, and one of 437 at week 48; all but one of these six patients died despite additional treatment. By contrast, relapse occurred in only two of the 11 patients who had decreasing minimal residual disease levels between the end of induction and week 7 of maintenance therapy and were treated with chemotherapy alone. INTERPRETATION: Minimal residual disease levels during remission induction treatment have important prognostic and therapeutic implications even in the context of minimal residual disease-guided treatment. Sequential minimal residual disease monitoring after remission induction is warranted for patients with detectable minimal residual disease.

However, the role of HPIP in colorectal cancer (CRC) is unknown. Here, we report that HPIP is overexpressed in most of CRC patients and predicts poor clinical outcome in CRC. HPIP promotes CRC cell proliferation via activation of G1/S and G2/M checkpoint transitions, concomitant with a marked increase of the positive cell cycle regulators, including cyclin D1, cyclin A, and cyclin B1. HPIP inhibits CRC cell apoptosis accompanied by the decreased levels of BAX and PIG3, the inducers of apoptosis, and the increased level of the apoptosis inhibitor BCL2. HPIP blocks caspase-3-mediated cleavage of PARP, an important apoptosis marker. HPIP promotes CRC cell migration and invasion, and regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), which plays a critical role in cancer cell migration and invasion. Activation of MAPK/ERK1/2 and PI3k/AKT pathways is required for HPIP modulation of CRC cell proliferation, migration and EMT. Moreover, HPIP knockdown suppresses colorectal tumor growth in nude mice. These data highlight the important role of HPIP in CRC cell proliferation and progression and suggest that HPIP may be a useful target for CRC therapy.","['Feng, Yingying', 'Xu, Xiaojie', 'Zhang, Yunjing', 'Ding, Jianhua', 'Wang, Yonggang', 'Zhang, Xiaopeng', 'Wu, Zhe', 'Kang, Lei', 'Liang, Yingchun', 'Zhou, LiYing', 'Song, Santai', 'Zhao, Ke', 'Ye, Qinong']","['Feng Y', 'Xu X', 'Zhang Y', 'Ding J', 'Wang Y', 'Zhang X', 'Wu Z', 'Kang L', 'Liang Y', 'Zhou L', 'Song S', 'Zhao K', 'Ye Q']","[""1] Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China [2] Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China [3] Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""1] Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China [2] Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory of Vaccine and Antibody Engineering, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Nuclear Medicine, Peking University First Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.', ""Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Affiliated Hospital of Academy of Military Medical Sciences, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Colorectal Surgery, the Second Artillery General Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Medical Molecular Biology, Beijing Institute of Biotechnology, Beijing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (HCFC1R1 protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Movement/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",2015/03/25 06:00,2015/12/31 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2014/11/11 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/31 06:00 [medline]']","['srep09429 [pii]', '10.1038/srep09429 [doi]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2015 Mar 24;5:9429. doi: 10.1038/srep09429.,20150324,PMC4371107,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we present a case of AML with MYC amplification in marker chromosomes and a microdeletion of chromosome 7 below cytogenetic resolution. The karyotype of the patient's bone marrow aspirate showed three to five marker chromosomes in all dividing cells without other structural or numerical chromosomal abnormalities. Analysis by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a probe specific for the human MYC gene revealed amplification of the oncogene localized to the marker chromosomes. Using whole genome single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analysis, an approximately 4.4 Mb amplicon containing the MYC gene was identified with an estimated amplification of about 30 copies per leukemic cell and, thus, an average of about 8 copies per marker chromosome. A 6.4 Mb hemizygous microdeletion of chromosome 7 within band q36.1 was also found by SNP microarray analysis in a cellular-equivalent dosage of 50%. The microdeletion spans multiple genes, including EZH2, a gene with well-known cancer association. No mutation was found in the remaining EZH2 allele by next generation gene sequencing. The combination of MYC amplification and EZH2 deletion, which has not been described previously in AML, may suggest a synergistic role of the two oncogenes in the pathogenesis of the patient's acute leukemia.","['Xiang, Zhifu', 'Abdallah, Al-Ola', 'Govindarajan, Rangaswamy', 'Mehta, Paulette', 'Emanuel, Peter D', 'Papenhausen, Peter', 'Schichman, Steven A']","['Xiang Z', 'Abdallah AO', 'Govindarajan R', 'Mehta P', 'Emanuel PD', 'Papenhausen P', 'Schichman SA']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Winthrop P.

Based on data from a randomized clinical trial demonstrating a reduction of proven and probable invasive fungal disease (IFD), posaconazole has been approved for prophylaxis of fungal infections in AML patients during induction chemotherapy. Nevertheless, recently published observational studies show contradictory results concerning the efficacy of posaconazole in this clinical setting. Furthermore, oral suspension posaconazole is associated with an unpredictable bioavailability that especially depends on nutritional factors or gastric pH value. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the impact of posaconazole prophylaxis in 70 consecutively evaluable AML patients who underwent induction chemotherapy at a tertiary care hospital. The incidence of IFD classified as proven, probable or possible, antifungal therapy including empiric treatment in high-risk patients and tolerability of posaconazole were determined. In addition, important clinical cofactors such as co-treatment with proton pump inhibitors and risk factors for pneumonia were analyzed in this study. RESULTS: We can demonstrate that posaconazole is well tolerated and had to be stopped in only six patients (8.6%). The overall incidence of IFD was 30% including two patients with proven (2.8%), four patients with probable (5.7%) and 15 patients with possible IFD (21.4%). Importantly, 24 out of 49 patients (49.0%) who did not fulfill the criteria of IFD received empiric antifungal therapy. Including patients classified as possible IFD, 39 of 70 patients (55.7%) underwent at least first-line antifungal treatment. CONCLUSION: Our ""real-life"" data obtained from 70 AML patients after induction chemotherapy demonstrate the frequent necessity of systemic antifungal treatment despite prophylaxis with oral suspension posaconazole.","['Schrenk, Karin G', 'Schnetzke, Ulf', 'Stegemann, Katy', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal, Marie', 'Hochhaus, Andreas', 'Scholl, Sebastian']","['Schrenk KG', 'Schnetzke U', 'Stegemann K', 'von Lilienfeld-Toal M', 'Hochhaus A', 'Scholl S']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin II (Abteilung Hamatologie und Internistische Onkologie), Universitatsklinikum Jena, Erlanger Allee 101, 07747, Jena, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Suspensions)', '0 (Triazoles)', '6TK1G07BHZ (posaconazole)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/*prevention & control', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Suspensions', 'Triazoles/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/25 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-015-1962-x [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2015 Sep;141(9):1661-8. doi: 10.1007/s00432-015-1962-x.

Patients with +12 are known to have unique features and to carry an intermediate prognosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to better define this large group, we reviewed the characteristics of 250 untreated patients with +12. RESULTS: When compared to 516 untreated patients negative for +12 by FISH, patients with +12 showed a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia, Richter transformation, and second malignant neoplasms (SMN), in addition to the expected increased rate of CD38 positivity and atypical immunophenotype. At a median follow-up of 51 months, 57% of patients needed first-line treatment; median time to first treatment was 38 months, and on multivariate analysis (MVA), it was found to be shorter in patients with advanced Rai stage, palpable splenomegaly, and deletion of 14q by conventional cytogenetic analysis. The overall response rate with first-line treatment was 94%. The median failure-free survival has not been reached, but on MVA, it was found to be shorter in patients whose disease responded in a manner other than complete remission or with FISH negativity for deletion 13q. The median overall survival for the entire group has not been reached, but MVA revealed it to be shorter in patients with an absolute lymphocyte count of > 30 x 10(9)/L or who developed SMN. Eighteen deaths have been observed so far, and Richter transformation and SMN were the leading causes of death (3 and 6, respectively). CONCLUSION: Patients with +12 CLL show characteristic clinical and biologic features, and may benefit from increased surveillance for second cancers.","['Strati, Paolo', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Wierda, William G', ""O'Brien, Susan"", 'Ferrajoli, Alessandra', 'Keating, Michael J']","['Strati P', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Wierda WG', ""O'Brien S"", 'Ferrajoli A', 'Keating MJ']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is associated with a tumor-supportive microenvironment and a dysfunctional immune system, as shown by ""exhausted"" T cells, defective immunologic synapse formation, and immunosuppressive myeloid cells. These defects involve aberrant expression of PD-L1 and are closely mirrored in the Emicro-TCL1 mouse model for CLL. In this study, we treated mice after adoptive transfer of Emicro-TCL1 CLL with PD-L1-blocking antibodies, which prevented CLL development and was accompanied by a reactivation of immune effector functions. This included restoration of mature macrophages and major histocompatibility complex class II-expressing dendritic cells and prevention of aberrant and exhaustion-like T-cell phenotypes. In addition, PD-L1 blockade restored CD8 T-cell cytotoxicity and immune synapse formation and normalized T-cell cytokines and proliferation ex vivo and in vivo. Our data demonstrate that early PD-L1 blockade effectively corrects leukemia-induced immune dysfunction and thus prevents CLL development in mice. Targeting PD-L1/PD-1 interactions should therefore be further explored in clinical studies with CLL patients, ideally in combination with novel compounds to help eliminate CLL.","['McClanahan, Fabienne', 'Hanna, Bola', 'Miller, Shaun', 'Clear, Andrew James', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Gribben, John G', 'Seiffert, Martina']","['McClanahan F', 'Hanna B', 'Miller S', 'Clear AJ', 'Lichter P', 'Gribben JG', 'Seiffert M']","['Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom; and Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Centre for Haemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, London, United Kingdom; and.', 'Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Cd274 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/*pharmacology', 'B7-H1 Antigen/*antagonists & inhibitors/immunology/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dendritic Cells/drug effects/physiology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Immune System Diseases/*prevention & control', 'Inflammation/prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL']",2015/03/25 06:00,2015/10/07 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/07 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31458-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2015-01-622936 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Jul 9;126(2):203-11. doi: 10.1182/blood-2015-01-622936.

In approximately 25% of cases, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells carry the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase (Philadelphia chromosome positive), which mimics constitutively active pre-BCR signalling. Current therapeutic approaches are largely focused on the development of more potent tyrosine kinase inhibitors to suppress oncogenic signalling below a minimum threshold for survival. We tested the hypothesis that targeted hyperactivation--above a maximum threshold--will engage a deletional checkpoint for removal of self-reactive B cells and selectively kill ALL cells. Here we find, by testing various components of proximal pre-BCR signalling in mouse BCR-ABL1 cells, that an incremental increase of Syk tyrosine kinase activity was required and sufficient to induce cell death. Hyperactive Syk was functionally equivalent to acute activation of a self-reactive BCR on ALL cells. Despite oncogenic transformation, this basic mechanism of negative selection was still functional in ALL cells. Unlike normal pre-B cells, patient-derived ALL cells express the inhibitory receptors PECAM1, CD300A and LAIR1 at high levels. Genetic studies revealed that Pecam1, Cd300a and Lair1 are critical to calibrate oncogenic signalling strength through recruitment of the inhibitory phosphatases Ptpn6 (ref. 7) and Inpp5d (ref. 8). Using a novel small-molecule inhibitor of INPP5D (also known as SHIP1), we demonstrated that pharmacological hyperactivation of SYK and engagement of negative B-cell selection represents a promising new strategy to overcome drug resistance in human ALL.","['Chen, Zhengshan', 'Shojaee, Seyedmehdi', 'Buchner, Maike', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Lee, Jae Woong', 'Klemm, Lars', 'Titz, Bjorn', 'Graeber, Thomas G', 'Park, Eugene', 'Tan, Ying Xim', 'Satterthwaite, Anne', 'Paietta, Elisabeth', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Willman, Cheryl L', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Jung, Jae U', 'Coligan, John E', 'Bolland, Silvia', 'Mak, Tak W', 'Limnander, Andre', 'Jumaa, Hassan', 'Reth, Michael', 'Weiss, Arthur', 'Lowell, Clifford A', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Chen Z', 'Shojaee S', 'Buchner M', 'Geng H', 'Lee JW', 'Klemm L', 'Titz B', 'Graeber TG', 'Park E', 'Tan YX', 'Satterthwaite A', 'Paietta E', 'Hunger SP', 'Willman CL', 'Melnick A', 'Loh ML', 'Jung JU', 'Coligan JE', 'Bolland S', 'Mak TW', 'Limnander A', 'Jumaa H', 'Reth M', 'Weiss A', 'Lowell CA', 'Muschen M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging, Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Crump Institute for Molecular Imaging, Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Rosalind Russell-Ephraim P.

While the antibodies were modestly effective at preventing tumor growth at the primary injection site, both antibodies strongly suppressed end-organ tumor formation following intravenous tumor cell injection. Capacity of anti-OFA/iLRP antibodies to suppress tumor spread through the blood in the leukemia model suggests their use as a therapy for individuals with leukemic disease (either for patients in remission or even as part of an induction therapy).

We sought to characterize the effects of dexamethasone on sleep over an entire 28-day treatment cycle using actigraphy, an objective measure of sleep. METHODS: The sleep of 25 children aged 2-9 years (mean 4.5 years) with ALL treated with dexamethasone were evaluated during maintenance chemotherapy using a within-subject experimental design, actigraphy, and standardized questionnaires to assess sleep, sleep problems, and fatigue. RESULTS: During the five days of dexamethasone treatment, sleep time increased during the night (535 vs. 498 min; p = 0.004) and daytime napping increased the following day (14 vs. 0 min; p = 0.002), and the number of wake episodes during the night was lower (14 vs. 20; p = </= 0.001). However, when assessed individually, sleep-onset time, efficiency, and wake after sleep onset during the night were unchanged during dexamethasone treatment; when the cumulative effect of all of these factors was assessed, there was a statistically and clinically significant increase in nighttime sleep duration during dexamethasone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: During the five days of treatment with dexamethasone, an increase in nighttime sleep as well as daytime napping was observed in young children with ALL. The increases in sleep duration return to baseline one day after the discontinuation of dexamethasone.","['Rosen, Gerald', 'Harris, Anne K', 'Liu, Meixia', 'Dreyfus, Jill', 'Krueger, James', 'Messinger, Yoav H']","['Rosen G', 'Harris AK', 'Liu M', 'Dreyfus J', 'Krueger J', 'Messinger YH']","[""Sleep Medicine, Children's Hospitals and Clinics of Minnesota, St. Paul, MN, United States.

A serum half-life time of some non-glycosylated IFN-alpha products was extended by a chemical attachment of a branched polyethylene glycol (PEG) to give PEGylated IFN-alpha. The therapy with recombinant interferons proves expensive and hence much hope is concerned with their production in other platforms assumed to be cheaper, like transgenic plants. Currently, tobacco, botanically species Nicotiana tabacum, its cultivars and some related species, especially N. benthamiana, is one of the most important plant expression systems tested for the production of therapeutical polypeptides and proteins (so-called biopharmaceuticals or biologics), especially vaccines, by using either greenhouse or field cultivated plants or cell suspension culture. IFN-alpha subtypes were expressed in tobacco nuclear genom e (IFN-alpha2a and 2b), chloroplast genome (IFN-alpha2b) and by transient expression (IFN-alpha2b). The IFalpha-a2b chimera fusions with O-glycosylated protein with O-a-rabinogalactans expressed in tobacco BY-2 cell culture showed increased half-life time similar to that obtained by PEGylation. The production of IFN-alpha2b (non-glycosydated) in tobacco glasshouse or field cultivation has been also elaborated. One report concerned expression of IFN-beta but with low yield. N-glycosylated IFN-gamma could be efficiently expressed in tobacco protoplast infected with recombinant brome mosaic virus (BMV) with the yield of 5-10% of total extracted protein. This type interferon (non-glycosylated), when expressed in chloroplast genome, proved unstable and could be obtained with reasonable yield as a fusion with GUS (beta-glucuronidase).","['Budzianowski, Jaromir']",['Budzianowski J'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Przegl Lek,Przeglad lekarski,19840720R,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Phytochemicals)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Vaccines)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)']",IM,"['Biopharmaceutics/*methods', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Interferon-alpha/*biosynthesis', 'Interferon-beta/*biosynthesis', 'Phytochemicals/*biosynthesis', 'Plants, Genetically Modified', 'Recombinant Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Species Specificity', 'Tobacco/*metabolism', 'Vaccines/*biosynthesis']",2014/01/01 00:00,2015/04/10 06:00,['2015/03/25 06:00'],"['2015/03/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/10 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Przegl Lek. 2014;71(11):639-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the formation of dG-dC crosslinks can be prevented by O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT), ultimately leading to drug resistance. Therefore, the level of AGT expression is related to the formation of dG-dC crosslinks and the sensitivity of cells to CENUs. In this work, we determined the CENU-induced dG-dC crosslink in mouse L1210 leukemia cells and in human glioblastoma cells (SF-763, SF-767 and SF-126) containing different levels of AGT using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicate that nimustine (ACNU) induced more dG-dC crosslinks in L1210 leukemia cells than those induced by carmustine (BCNU), lomustine (CCNU) and fotemustine (FTMS). This result was consistent with a previously reported cohort study, which demonstrated that ACNU had a better survival gain than BCNU, CCNU and FTMS for patients with high-grade glioma. Moreover, we compared the crosslinking levels and the cytotoxicity in SF-763, SF-767 and SF-126 cells with different AGT expression levels after exposure to ACNU. The levels of dG-dC crosslink in SF-126 cells (low AGT expression) were significantly higher than those in SF-767 (medium AGT expression) and SF-763 (high AGT expression) cells at each time point.

Individual predisposing factors, including polymorphisms in detoxification enzymes, have been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis and heterogeneity of the disease. Genetic polymorphisms of glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) that alter enzyme activity could be an additional factor that increases the risk of acute leukemia, but data are lacking in Argentina. We assessed the association of GST polymorphisms and the susceptibility to childhood leukemia in Argentina by conducting an exploratory case-control study and correlated patients' genotype to clinical and biological features. METHODS: Deletion polymorphisms in GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes and the single nucleotide polymorphism in GSTP1 c.313A>G (rs1695; p.105Ile>Val) were genotyped by PCR-RFLP in 36 patients and 133 healthy individuals. RESULTS: GSTM1-null genotype was associated with a lower risk of developing acute leukemia (P = 0.013; OR: 0.31; CI: 0.12-0.80), while GSTP1-GG variants displayed an increased risk (P = 0.01; OR: 3.9; CI: 1.85-8.2). However, no differences were found for GSTT1 gene. Conclusion These preliminary results, to be validated in a larger population from Argentina, suggest that the development of pediatric leukemia may be differentially influenced by polymorphic variants in GST genes.","['Weich, N', 'Nunez, M C', 'Galimberti, G', 'Elena, G', 'Acevedo, S', 'Larripa, I', 'Fundia, A F']","['Weich N', 'Nunez MC', 'Galimberti G', 'Elena G', 'Acevedo S', 'Larripa I', 'Fundia AF']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['EC 2.5.1.- (glutathione S-transferase T1)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (GSTP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione S-Transferase pi)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)', 'EC 2.5.1.18 (glutathione S-transferase M1)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Argentina', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi/*genetics', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mutation', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/pathology', 'Risk Factors']",2015/03/24 06:00,2016/07/13 06:00,['2015/03/24 06:00'],"['2015/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/07/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000007 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2015 Oct;20(9):511-6. doi: 10.1179/1607845415Y.0000000007.

NMR mainly provides local structural information of protons and works most effectively on relatively small biomacromolecules. Hence structural characterization of large RNAs can be difficult for NMR alone. Electron microscopy (EM) provides global shape information of macromolecules at nanometer resolution, which should be complementary to NMR for RNA structure determination. Here we developed a new energy term in Xplor-NIH against the density map obtained by EM. We conjointly used NMR and map restraints for the structure refinement of three RNA systems-U2/U6 small-nuclear RNA, genome-packing motif (Psi(CD))2 from Moloney murine leukemia virus, and ribosome-binding element from turnip crinkle virus. In all three systems, we showed that the incorporation of a map restraint, either experimental or generated from known PDB structure, greatly improves structural precision and accuracy. Importantly, our method does not rely on an initial model assembled from RNA duplexes, and allows full torsional freedom for each nucleotide in the torsion angle simulated annealing refinement. As increasing number of macromolecules can be characterized by both NMR and EM, the marriage between the two techniques would enable better characterization of RNA three-dimensional structures.","['Gong, Zhou', 'Schwieters, Charles D', 'Tang, Chun']","['Gong Z', 'Schwieters CD', 'Tang C']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems, National Magnetic Resonance Center at Wuhan, State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430071, China.', 'Division of Computational Bioscience, Center for Information Technology, National Institutes of Health, Building 12A, Bethesda, MD 20892, United States of America.', 'CAS Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance in Biological Systems, National Magnetic Resonance Center at Wuhan, State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic Molecular Physics, Wuhan Institute of Physics and Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Wuhan, Hubei Province 430071, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['63231-63-0 (RNA)'],IM,"['Genome, Viral/genetics', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy/*methods', 'Microscopy, Electron/*methods', 'Models, Molecular', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA/*chemistry']",2015/03/24 06:00,2016/02/19 06:00,['2015/03/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0120445 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-42278 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 23;10(3):e0120445. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0120445. eCollection 2015.,20150323,PMC4370883,,,,,,"['Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As similar truncated RUNX1 proteins are generated by genetic aberrations including chromosomal translocations and point mutations, we used the t(1;21)(p32;q22) chromosomal translocation as a model to explore whether C-terminally truncated RUNX1 proteins trigger effects similar to those induced by well-characterized leukemogenic RUNX1 fusion genes. In vitro analysis of transduced human hematopoietic/progenitor stem cells showed that truncated RUNX1 proteins increase proliferation and self-renewal and disrupt the differentiation program by interfering with RUNX1b. These effects are similar to but milder than those induced by the RUNX1/ETO fusion protein. GSEA analysis confirmed similar altered gene expression patterns in the truncated RUNX1 and RUNX1/ETO models, with both models showing alterations in genes involved in self-renewal and leukemogenesis, including homeobox genes, primitive erythroid genes and leukemogenic transcription factors. We propose that C-terminally truncated RUNX1 proteins can contribute to leukemogenesis in a similar way to RUNX1 fusion genes but through a milder phenotype.","['Rodriguez-Perales, S', 'Torres-Ruiz, R', 'Suela, J', 'Acquadro, F', 'Martin, M C', 'Yebra, E', 'Ramirez, J C', 'Alvarez, S', 'Cigudosa, J C']","['Rodriguez-Perales S', 'Torres-Ruiz R', 'Suela J', 'Acquadro F', 'Martin MC', 'Yebra E', 'Ramirez JC', 'Alvarez S', 'Cigudosa JC']","['Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre-CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Viral Vector Technical Unit, Fundacion Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovascular (CNIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre-CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre-CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre-CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hematology Service, Hospital Severo Ochoa, Madrid, Spain.', 'Viral Vector Technical Unit, Fundacion Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovascular (CNIC), Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre-CNIO, Madrid, Spain.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics Group, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre-CNIO, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2015/03/24 06:00,2016/06/09 06:00,['2015/03/24 06:00'],"['2014/05/29 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/09 06:00 [medline]']","['onc201570 [pii]', '10.1038/onc.2015.70 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2016 Jan 7;35(1):125-34. doi: 10.1038/onc.2015.70.

We conducted a study to investigate the association of race with allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) outcomes. We identified 789 patients (58 African Americans and 731 whites) who underwent allogeneic HCT for hematologic disorders. There were no significant differences between African Americans and white patients in gender, performance status or comorbidity score. However, African Americans were younger than whites (median 40 years versus 47 years, P=0.003) and were more likely to be in remission at HCT (74% versus 57%, P=0.011), to have an HLA-mismatched donor (36% versus 14%, P<0.001), to have positive donor or recipient CMV serostatus (90% versus 69%, P<0.001) and to have received a cord blood transplant (21% versus 6%, P<0.001). In univariate analysis, African Americans had worse overall survival (OS) (HR 1.41, P=0.026) compared with whites, with no significant differences in acute or chronic GvHD, non-CMV infection or relapse. However, after adjusting for several transplant and disease-related factors in multivariate analysis, the OS difference between African Americans and whites became nonsignificant (HR 1.27, P=0.18). These results suggest that race in and of itself does not lead to worse survival post HCT.","['Hamilton, B K', 'Rybicki, L', 'Sekeres, M', 'Kalaycio, M', 'Hanna, R', 'Sobecks, R', 'Dean, R', 'Duong, H', 'Hill, B T', 'Bolwell, B', 'Copelan, E']","['Hamilton BK', 'Rybicki L', 'Sekeres M', 'Kalaycio M', 'Hanna R', 'Sobecks R', 'Dean R', 'Duong H', 'Hill BT', 'Bolwell B', 'Copelan E']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Quantitative Health Sciences, Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Department of Hematologic Oncology and Blood Disorders, Cleveland Clinic, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Levine Cancer Institute, Carolinas HealthCare System, Charlotte, NC, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*African Americans', 'Aged', 'Allografts', '*Cytomegalovirus Infections/ethnology/mortality', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Graft vs Host Disease/ethnology/mortality', '*Hematologic Neoplasms/ethnology/mortality/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Survival Rate', '*Whites']",2015/03/24 06:00,2016/02/24 06:00,['2015/03/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/02 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/21 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/24 06:00 [medline]']","['bmt201544 [pii]', '10.1038/bmt.2015.44 [doi]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2015 Jun;50(6):834-9. doi: 10.1038/bmt.2015.44.

ATRA combined with anthracycline-based chemotherapy has significantly improved the long-term outcome for low-to-intermediate-risk APL patients; thus, the efficacy of maintenance therapy for patients achieving molecular complete remission (MCR) following consolidation therapy has become debatable. To evaluate the efficacy of maintenance therapy, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 11 consecutive patients with low-to-intermediate-risk APL who received induction and consolidation therapy with ATRA and anthracyclines according to the PETHEMA LPA protocols at our hospital between January, 2001 and March, 2013. All the patients achieved MCR following consolidation therapy. Of these patients, 7 were followed without maintenance therapy, including 2 patients who discontinued maintenance therapy within 2 months. With a median follow-up of 85 months, the overall survival for all the patients was 100%, while the disease-free survival estimate at 5 years with and without maintenance therapy was 100 and 85.7%, respectively; the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.45). Two patients treated with maintenance therapy later developed secondary primary malignancy. Thus, even without maintenance therapy, ATRA combined with anthracyclines exhibited significant efficacy in low-to-intermediate-risk APL patients, suggesting that maintenance therapy, which is associated with adverse events, may be dispensable for patients achieving MCR following adequate consolidation therapy.","['Yamamoto, Masahide', 'Okada, Keigo', 'Akiyama, Hiroki', 'Kurosu, Tetsuya', 'Miura, Osamu']","['Yamamoto M', 'Okada K', 'Akiyama H', 'Kurosu T', 'Miura O']","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,,,,2015/03/24 06:00,2015/03/24 06:01,['2015/03/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/mco.2014.476 [doi]', 'mco-03-02-0449 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2015 Mar;3(2):449-453. doi: 10.3892/mco.2014.476.

HLA-associated susceptibility to childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may provide clues to leukemogenesis in general and to the role of other risk factors. The present study aimed to determine the association between the HLA-DRB1 genotype and susceptibility to ALL in children and to assess the prognostic value of HLA-DRB1 alleles in these patients. This study included 50 ALL patients who were consecutively admitted to the Pediatric Oncology Unit of Zagazig University Hospital and 50 gender-matched healthy volunteers as a control group. The patients were subjected to full clinical history, thorough clinical examination and routine laboratory investigations. Molecular HLA-DRB1 typing for patients and controls using the reverse sequence-specific oligonucleotide probe technique was performed. HLA-DRB1*04 allele frequency was significantly higher in female patients compared to that in female controls (P=0.03) and in patients aged <10 years compared to those aged >/=10 years at the time of diagnosis (P=0.01). HLA-DRB1*11 allele frequency was significantly higher in high-risk compared to standard-risk patients (P=0.01) and in refractory patients compared to those who achieved remission (P=0.02). In conclusion, the HLA-DRB1*04 allele appears to be a female-specific susceptibility factor for the acquisition of childhood ALL and it may affect the age of onset of ALL. In addition, the HLA-DRB1*11 allele may be of prognostic significance in childhood ALL. However, further larger studies are required to support the conclusions drawn from this study.","['El Ansary, Mervat M', 'Mohammed, Lamiaa A', 'Hassan, Tamer H', 'Baraka, Ahmed', 'Ahmed, Alshymaa A']","['El Ansary MM', 'Mohammed LA', 'Hassan TH', 'Baraka A', 'Ahmed AA']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Cairo 11562.', 'Departments of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig 44111, Egypt.', 'Departments of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig 44111, Egypt.', 'Departments of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig 44111, Egypt.', 'Departments of Clinical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University, Zagazig 44111, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Clin Oncol,Molecular and clinical oncology,101613422,,,,2015/03/24 06:00,2015/03/24 06:01,['2015/03/24 06:00'],"['2014/10/09 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/24 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3892/mco.2014.466 [doi]', 'mco-03-02-0425 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Clin Oncol. 2015 Mar;3(2):425-429. doi: 10.3892/mco.2014.466.

Mutation in the FLT3 gene is the most frequent genetic alteration in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is well known as an important driver mutation for the development of myeloid malignancies. FLT3 mutation is a strong poor prognostic factor for the long-term survival in AML patients, while neither high-dose chemotherapy nor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation can overcome a poor prognosis. Development of an FLT3 inhibitor is, therefore, much awaited. To date, several potent FLT3 inhibitors have been developed and some of them were evaluated for efficacy in clinical trials, although no FLT3 inhibitor has been yet approved. Moreover, several problems for clinical use, such as adverse effects, blood concentration and resistance have been apparent. Recently developed AC220 is a highly selective and sensitive FLT3 inhibitor. In Phase I and II trials, AC220 so far showed the best efficacy of AML cells harboring FLT3 mutation among clinically evaluated FLT3 inhibitors, while severe bone marrow suppression and QTc prolongation should be resolved for the clinical use. In this review, I summarize the characteristics of FLT3 inhibitors in clinical development and discuss important issues to be resolved for clinical use.","['Kiyoi, Hitoshi']",['Kiyoi H'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Review'],Japan,Nagoya J Med Sci,Nagoya journal of medical science,0412011,,,,2015/03/24 06:00,2015/03/24 06:00,['2015/03/24 06:00'],"['2014/09/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/10/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Nagoya J Med Sci. 2015 Feb;77(1-2):7-17.,,PMC4361503,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3', 'inhibitors', 'leukemia', 'molecular target', 'resistance']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If initial antifungal medical treatment does not result in clearance of candiduria and disappearance of CB on ultrasound in dilated kidneys, invasive interventions like insertion of nephrostomy tubes (NT) or surgical interventions to drain the kidney are sometimes advocated(.). However, NT placement can be a technical challenge, especially in pre- and dysmature neonates, and NT displacement or obstruction by the CB can lead to suboptimal treatment. Identification of those children who will benefit from invasive renal drainage is important. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the management of patients with CB in three tertiary referral hospitals to determine criteria for intervention. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective multicenter chart analysis was conducted of children with candiduria and ultrasonographic demonstration of CB (diagnosed between March 1995 and August 2012). The indication for invasive renal drainage (if performed) and subsequent clinical outcome, serum creatinine levels and ultrasound findings were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 12 children were included, two of which were premature neonates. Eight children had congenital urogenital anomalies. One older child with acute myeloid leukemia had CB during chemotherapy and one ex-premature developed CB following cerebral candidiasis. All children received systemic antifungal medication; in seven children invasive treatment was added. Indications for invasive treatment were clinical deterioration, progressive renal dilation, pyonephrosis, rising creatinine levels and persistence of CB. Two underwent a Y-cutaneous ureterostomy and nephrostomy tubes were inserted in five children. Percutaneous renal drainage by nephrostomy led to complications in 3 of 6 procedures. In all patients, irrespective of therapeutic modality, follow-up ultrasound demonstrated no de novo changes. No additional parenchymal defects or deterioration of split renal function were seen on DMSA or MAG-3 scan. DISCUSSION: In the literature renal drainage is suggested in case of complete obstruction. However dilatation is a frequent finding in children as part of the congenital renal anomaly and does not necessarily mean that there is obstruction of the urinary tract. Even in children without candida infections the diagnosis of obstruction is not straightforward, while the results of a MAG 3 scan can be obscured by compromised kidney function, parenchymal bacterial infiltration and neonatal immaturity of the kidney. If candiduria and CB persist despite intensive medical treatment, intensive consultation is required before renal drainage, because NT insertion might be a surgical challenge. Complications such as displacement of the NT, urinoma development, or NT obstruction can occur and was seen in three of six procedures. Premature neonates seem to be more prone to complications due to their small anatomical proportions, requiring medical equipment with small diameters prone to displacement and obstruction. Some studies describe successful pharmaceutical management in the majority of patients with CB. Other studies describe unilateral surgical intervention in children with bilateral CB where unilateral drainage did not influence overall renal outcome. This is in line with our results. A limitation of the present study is its retrospective design. In this population, the motivation for invasive renal drainage or conservative management was not well documented in all cases, and was mainly based on clinical and diagnostic parameters like creatinine levels and radiographic findings. CONCLUSION: Renal drainage should be considered in selected cases after failure of systemic antifungal treatment. Inserting and maintaining a nephrostomy tube in young children is associated with a high rate of complications; conservative treatment is likely to be sufficient in the majority of patients with candiduria and CB.","['de Wall, L L', 'van den Heijkant, M M C', 'Bokenkamp, A', 'Kuijper, C F', 'van der Horst, H J R', 'de Jong, T P V M']","['de Wall LL', 'van den Heijkant MM', 'Bokenkamp A', 'Kuijper CF', 'van der Horst HJ', 'de Jong TP']","['Department of Pediatric Urology, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

The addition of rituximab to FC has been used, a combination known as FCR. OBJECTIVES: To perform a systematic review with meta-analysis of clinical trials between 2000 and 2012 comparing FC and FCR in patients with CLL. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Electronic databases were searched using keywords related to the objectives of this review. The outcomes examined were progression-free survival and complete remission. RESULTS: The progression-free survival and the overall survival showed significant difference between the two regimens, with complete remission being more frequent in FCR-treated patients (odds ratio=2.58; 95% CI: 2.13-3.13). Patients treated with FCR showed significantly higher neutropenia and serious adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: Despite the favorable results of the FCR regimen on outcomes including complete remission, progression-free survival, and overall survival, there is a lack of methodological rigor and appropriate analyses in many of these studies, and thus, there is a need for further studies examining the effect of rituximab in CLL patients.","['Nunes, Altacilio Aparecido', 'da Silva, Anderson Soares', 'Souza, Kathiaja Miranda', 'Koury, Christine de Nazare Silva', 'de Mello, Luane Marques']","['Nunes AA', 'da Silva AS', 'Souza KM', 'Koury Cde N', 'de Mello LM']","['Department of Social Medicine, Ribeirao Preto Medical School, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.

The in vivo results indicated that low concentrations of tetrandrine inhibited leukemia cells proliferation and induced autophagy and then facilitated their differentiation, by activating ROS and Notch1 signaling. We suggest that tetrandrine is a potential agent for the treatment of APL by inducing differentiation of leukemia cells.","['Liu, Ting', 'Men, Qiuxu', 'Wu, Guixian', 'Yu, Chunrong', 'Huang, Zan', 'Liu, Xin', 'Li, Wenhua']","['Liu T', 'Men Q', 'Wu G', 'Yu C', 'Huang Z', 'Liu X', 'Li W']","['College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.

Herein, we investigate the ability of ABT-199, the Bcl-2-selective BH3 mimetic, to kill MCL cells. Among MCL cell lines tested (n = 8), only three were sensitive (LD50 < 200 nM). In contrast, all primary MCL samples tested (n = 11) were highly sensitive to ABT-199 (LD50 < 10 nM). Mcl-1 and Bcl-xL both confer resistance to ABT-199-specific killing and BCL2/(BCLXL+MCL1) mRNA ratio is a strong predictor of sensitivity. By mimicking the microenvironment through CD40 stimulation, we show that ABT-199 sensitivity is impaired through activation of NF-kB pathway and Bcl-x(L) up-regulation. We further demonstrate that resistance is rapidly lost when MCL cells detach from CD40L-expressing fibroblasts. It has been reported that ibrutinib induces lymphocytosis in vivo holding off malignant cells from their protective microenvironment. We show here for two patients undergoing ibrutinib therapy that mobilized MCL cells are highly sensitive to ABT-199. These results provide evidence that in situ ABT-199 resistance can be overcome when MCL cells escape from the lymph nodes. Altogether, our data support the clinical application of ABT-199 therapy both as a single agent and in sequential combination with BTK inhibitors.","['Chiron, David', 'Dousset, Christelle', 'Brosseau, Carole', 'Touzeau, Cyrille', 'Maiga, Sophie', 'Moreau, Philippe', 'Pellat-Deceunynck, Catherine', 'Le Gouill, Steven', 'Amiot, Martine']","['Chiron D', 'Dousset C', 'Brosseau C', 'Touzeau C', 'Maiga S', 'Moreau P', 'Pellat-Deceunynck C', 'Le Gouill S', 'Amiot M']","['INSERM, UMR892 - CNRS, UMR 6299, Universite de Nantes, France.', 'INSERM, UMR892 - CNRS, UMR 6299, Universite de Nantes, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Unite d'Investigation Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, France."", 'CIC, INSERM, Nantes, France.', 'INSERM, UMR892 - CNRS, UMR 6299, Universite de Nantes, France.', 'INSERM, UMR892 - CNRS, UMR 6299, Universite de Nantes, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Unite d'Investigation Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, France."", 'INSERM, UMR892 - CNRS, UMR 6299, Universite de Nantes, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Unite d'Investigation Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, France."", 'INSERM, UMR892 - CNRS, UMR 6299, Universite de Nantes, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Unite d'Investigation Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, France."", 'INSERM, UMR892 - CNRS, UMR 6299, Universite de Nantes, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Unite d'Investigation Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, France."", 'INSERM, UMR892 - CNRS, UMR 6299, Universite de Nantes, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Unite d'Investigation Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, France."", 'CIC, INSERM, Nantes, France.', 'INSERM, UMR892 - CNRS, UMR 6299, Universite de Nantes, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Unite d'Investigation Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nantes, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'CD40 Antigens/*physiology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/genetics', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Piperidines', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/physiology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects', 'bcl-X Protein/biosynthesis/genetics']",2015/03/24 06:00,2016/02/13 06:00,['2015/03/24 06:00'],"['2015/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/24 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['3275 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3275 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Apr 20;6(11):8750-9. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3275.,,PMC4496181,['NOTNLM'],"['ABT-199', 'Bcl-2 family members', 'apoptosis', 'ibrutinib', 'mantle cell lymphoma']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemia resistance and secondary graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) are major obstacles to success with DLI. The aim of this study was to identify pre-DLI factors associated with prolonged survival in remission without secondary GVHD. We retrospectively analyzed 500 patients treated with DLI for CML relapse (16% molecular, 30% cytogenetic, and 54% hematological) after alloSCT. The overall probabilities of failure- and secondary GVHD-free survival (FGFS) were 29% and 27% at 5 and 10 years after DLI, respectively. The type of relapse was the major factor influencing FGFS (40% for molecular and/or cytogenetic relapse and 20% for hematological relapse at 5 years, P < .001). Chronic GVHD before DLI and an interval <1 year between alloSCT and first DLI were independently associated with inferior FGFS in patients with molecular and/or cytogenetic relapse. Consequently, FGFS was 13%, 35%, to 56% at 5 years in patients with 2, 1, and 0 adverse features, respectively. In patients with hematological relapse, independent adverse prognostic factors for FGFS were initial dose of CD3(+) cells >/= 50 x 10(6)/kg, donor-recipient sex mismatch, and chronic GVHD before DLI. FGFS was 0%, 17%, 33%, to 37% in patients with 3, 2, 1, and 0 adverse features, respectively. The probability of survival in remission without secondary GVHD was highest (>50% at 5 years) when DLI were given beyond 1 year from alloSCT for molecular and/or cytogenetic CML relapse that was not preceded by chronic GVHD.","['Radujkovic, Aleksandar', 'Guglielmi, Cesare', 'Bergantini, Stefania', 'Iacobelli, Simona', 'van Biezen, Anja', 'Milojkovic, Dragana', 'Gratwohl, Alois', 'Schattenberg, Antonius V M B', 'Verdonck, Leo F', 'Niederwieser, Dietger W', 'de Witte, Theo', 'Kroger, Nicolaus', 'Olavarria, Eduardo']","['Radujkovic A', 'Guglielmi C', 'Bergantini S', 'Iacobelli S', 'van Biezen A', 'Milojkovic D', 'Gratwohl A', 'Schattenberg AV', 'Verdonck LF', 'Niederwieser DW', 'de Witte T', 'Kroger N', 'Olavarria E']","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.

Postgrafting immunosuppression consisted of cyclophosphamide 50 mg/kg/day on days 3 and 4, mycophenolate mofetil through day 35, and tacrolimus through day 180. Median patient age was 46.5 years (range, 24 to 60). Transplantation diagnosis included acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 16), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 6), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 5), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 2). Using the Dana Farber/Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research/Disease Risk Index (DRI), patients were classified as low (n = 4), intermediate (n = 12), high (n = 11), and very high (n = 3) risk. All patients engrafted with a median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery of 16 and 25 days, respectively. All evaluable patients achieved sustained complete donor T cell and myeloid chimerism by day +30. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV and III and IV was seen in 43% and 23%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 56% (severe in 10%). After a median follow-up of 24 months, the estimated 2-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), nonrelapse mortality, and relapse rate were 78%, 73%, 3%, and 24%, respectively. Two-year DFS and relapse rate in patients with low/intermediate risk disease was 100% and 0%, respectively, compared with 39% and 53% for patients with high/very high risk disease. When compared with a contemporaneously treated cohort of patients at our institution receiving myeloablative HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) transplantation (acute myelogenous leukemia [n = 17], acute lymphoblastic leukemia [n = 15], chronic myelogenous leukemia [n = 7], myelodysplastic syndrome [n = 7], non-Hodgkin lymphoma [n = 1], chronic lymphoblastic leukemia [n = 1]), outcomes were statistically similar, with 2-yr OS and DFS being 78% and 73%, respectively after haplo transplantation versus 71% and 64%, respectively, after MUD transplantation. In patients with DRI low/intermediate risk disease, 2-yr DFS was superior after haplo compared with MUD transplantations (100% versus 74%, P = .032), whereas there was no difference in DFS in patients with high/very high risk disease (39% versus 37% for haplo and MUD respectively, P = .821). Grade II to IV acute GVHD was seen less often after haplo compared with MUD transplantation (43% versus 63%, P = .049), as was moderate-to-severe chronic GVHD (22% versus 58%, P = .003). Myeloablative haplo transplantation using this regimen is a valid option for patients with advanced hematologic malignancies who lack timely access to a conventional donor.

During induction therapy, he developed severe pneumonia. Although meropenem and micafungin were started, he died of circulatory failure owing to massive gastrointestinal bleeding. Autopsy specimens obtained from the stomach revealed fungal hyphae, which had invaded diffusely into submucosal vessels and caused the massive gastric bleeding. The same hyphae were also observed in both lungs. A diagnosis of disseminated zygomycosis was confirmed by its characteristic histopathological findings. Because zygomycetes are spontaneously resistant to the newer antifungal agents, such as voriconazole or micafungin, it seems likely that the prevalence of zygomycosis as a breakthrough infection may increase in the future. Zygomycosis is a rare, but life-threatening, deep fungal infection that appears in immunologically or metabolically compromised hosts. Its manifestations are clinically similar to those of invasive aspergillosis. In addition to the well-established epidemiology of zygomycosis, this case suggests the following new characteristics. (1) Although the gastrointestinal manifestation of zygomycosis is relatively rare, it is observed more frequently than invasive aspergillosis. (2) Gastrointestinal zygomycosis occasionally leads to the development of necrotic ulcers and may induce hemorrhagic shock.(3) We should be cautious of an occurrence of breakthrough zygomycosis when we use echinocandins for patients with known risk factors, especially steroid use and neutropenia. (4) For patients who are receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics and echinocandins, who are negative for culture studies and aspergillus antigen, and who present with unresolved fever, it is important to make a prompt clinical diagnosis of zygomycosis.","['Suzuki, Kei', 'Sugawara, Yumiko', 'Sekine, Takao', 'Nakase, Kazunori', 'Katayama, Naoyuki']","['Suzuki K', 'Sugawara Y', 'Sekine T', 'Nakase K', 'Katayama N']",,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Kansenshogaku Zasshi,Kansenshogaku zasshi.

Lymphoblastic leukemogenesis is a complex process caused by abnormalities occurring during lymphocyte differentiation, and can be initiated by various triggers. Each leukemia subtype has distinct characteristics that can be identified in the corresponding cell lines; the detection of the exclusive genetic signatures of these varying cell lines is critical. Our analysis revealed that approximately 8000 human genes were differentially expressed between samples. Signaling pathways such as the NOD-like signaling pathway, cell surface receptor signaling pathways, and leukemia-related pathways were significantly regulated, as determined by KEGG annotation. Furthermore, several oncogenes and differentiation-related genes were differentially expressed between leukemia cell lines and lymphocyte types, respectively. Our miRNA analysis demonstrated that the expression of approximately one-third of all expressed miRNAs appeared to be significantly different between the leukemia cell lines studied. We also analyzed the mRNA-miRNA regulatory networks of both lymphocyte differentiation and leukemogenesis to determine key regulators of interest. We combined the results of the mRNA and miRNA analyses in order to investigate the regulatory relationship between them. This study not only identifies differences in the pathways and networks of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) relative to normal lymphocytes, but also identifies unique functional characteristics of lymphoid cells and distinct gene expression patterns during lymphoid development. The discovery of leukemia-related miRNAs may provide meaningful insights into the biology of the disease.","['Hu, Yang', 'Xiong, Qian', 'Yang, Yadong', 'Wang, Hai', 'Shu, Chang', 'Xu, Wei', 'Fang, Xiangdong', 'Hu, Songnian']","['Hu Y', 'Xiong Q', 'Yang Y', 'Wang H', 'Shu C', 'Xu W', 'Fang X', 'Hu S']","['CAS Key Laboratory of Genome Sciences and Information, Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, No. 1-104 Beichen West Road, Chaoyang, Beijing 100101, China.

We examined the secretion of ADAM-10 in biological fluids from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the role it plays in monocyte migration. ADAM-10 levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and immunofluorescence. To examine the role of ADAM-10 in RA synovial fluids (SFs), we studied THP-1 (human acute monocyte leukemia cell line) and monocyte chemotaxis. To determine whether ADAM-10 plays a role in cell proliferation in the RA synovium, we assayed the proliferation of ADAM-10 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs). The ADAM-10 level in RA serum was significantly higher than that in normal serum and was correlated with a disease activity score of 28. ADAM-10-depleted RA SFs showed a decrease in THP-1 and monocyte migratory activity compared with that of sham-depleted controls. ADAM-10 siRNA inhibited monocyte adhesion to RA FLSs. Finally, blocking ADAM-10 secretion in RA FLSs resulted in decreased production of fractalkine/CX3CL1 and vascular endothelial cell growth factor. These data indicate that ADAM-10 plays a role in monocyte migration in RA and suggest that targeting ADAM-10 may provide a method of decreasing inflammation and potentially treating other inflammatory diseases.","['Isozaki, Takeo', 'Ishii, Sho', 'Nishimi, Shinichiro', 'Nishimi, Airi', 'Oguro, Nao', 'Seki, Shinya', 'Miura, Yoko', 'Miwa, Yusuke', 'Oh, Koei', 'Toyoshima, Yoichiro', 'Nakamura, Masanori', 'Inagaki, Katsunori', 'Kasama, Tsuyoshi']","['Isozaki T', 'Ishii S', 'Nishimi S', 'Nishimi A', 'Oguro N', 'Seki S', 'Miura Y', 'Miwa Y', 'Oh K', 'Toyoshima Y', 'Nakamura M', 'Inagaki K', 'Kasama T']","['Department of Medicine, Showa University School of Medicine, Shinagawa-ku, Tokyo, Japan.

The potential of the dendrimers as nanocarriers for anticancer Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, Mcl-1 siRNAs and additionally a scrambled sequence siRNA has been explored. Dendrimer/siRNA complexes were characterised by various methods including fluorescence, zeta potential, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism, gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy. In this part of study, the transfection of complexes in HeLa and HL-60 cells was analyzed using both single apoptotic siRNAs and a mixture (cocktail) of them. Cocktails were more effective than single siRNAs, allowing one to decrease siRNAs concentration in treating cells.

Resistance to small molecule inhibitors has emerged as a common theme. The most frequent mode of acquired resistance is the acquisition of point mutations in the kinase domain. FLT3 inhibitors have improved response rates in FLT3-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The occurrence of the ATP-binding site and activation loop mutations confers varying degrees of resistance to the individual FLT3 inhibitors. Second-generation FLT3 inhibitors such as crenolanib may overcome the resistance of these mutations. Furthermore, nonmutational mechanisms of resistance such as prosurvival pathways and bone marrow signaling may be upregulated in FLT3 inhibitor-resistant AML with secondary kinase domain mutations. More recently, point mutations conferring resistance to the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, arsenic trioxide in acute promyelocytic leukemia, and the BH3-mimetic ABT199 in lymphoma have been identified. In chronic myeloid leukemia, the emergence of tyrosine kinase domain mutations has historically been the dominant mechanism of resistance. The early identification of secondary point mutations and their downstream effects along with the development of second- or third-generation inhibitors and rationally designed small molecule combinations are potential strategies to overcome mutation-mediated resistance.","['Daver, Naval', 'Cortes, Jorge', 'Ravandi, Farhad', 'Patel, Keyur P', 'Burger, Jan A', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kantarjian, Hagop']","['Daver N', 'Cortes J', 'Ravandi F', 'Patel KP', 'Burger JA', 'Konopleva M', 'Kantarjian H']","['Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Hematopathology and Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.', 'Department of Leukemia and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics']",2015/03/22 06:00,2015/07/29 06:00,['2015/03/22 06:00'],"['2014/10/10 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/29 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31653-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-605808 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 21;125(21):3236-45. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-605808.

Here, we explore the mechanisms underlying these observations and show that ATO/ATRA induce proteasome-dependent degradation of NPM1 leukemic protein and apoptosis in NPM1-mutated AML cell lines and primary patients' cells. We also show that PML intracellular distribution is altered in NPM1-mutated AML cells and reverted by arsenic through oxidative stress induction. Interestingly, similarly to what was described for PML, oxidative stress also mediates ATO-induced degradation of the NPM1 mutant oncoprotein. Strikingly, NPM1 mutant downregulation by ATO/ATRA was shown to potentiate response to the anthracyclin daunorubicin. These findings provide experimental evidence for further exploring ATO/ATRA in preclinical NPM1-mutated AML in vivo models and a rationale for exploiting these compounds in chemotherapeutic regimens in clinics.","['Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Gionfriddo, Ilaria', 'Mezzasoma, Federica', 'Milano, Francesca', 'Pierangeli, Sara', 'Mulas, Floriana', 'Pacini, Roberta', 'Tabarrini, Alessia', 'Pettirossi, Valentina', 'Rossi, Roberta', 'Vetro, Calogero', 'Brunetti, Lorenzo', 'Sportoletti, Paolo', 'Tiacci, Enrico', 'Di Raimondo, Francesco', 'Falini, Brunangelo']","['Martelli MP', 'Gionfriddo I', 'Mezzasoma F', 'Milano F', 'Pierangeli S', 'Mulas F', 'Pacini R', 'Tabarrini A', 'Pettirossi V', 'Rossi R', 'Vetro C', 'Brunetti L', 'Sportoletti P', 'Tiacci E', 'Di Raimondo F', 'Falini B']","['Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.', 'Institute of Hematology, University of Catania, Catania, Italy.', 'Institute of Hematology, Centro di Ricerca Emato-Oncologico (CREO), University of Perugia, Perugia, Italy; and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Oxides)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mutant Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2015/03/22 06:00,2015/08/26 06:00,['2015/03/22 06:00'],"['2014/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31610-4 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-11-611459 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 May 28;125(22):3455-65. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-11-611459.

Here, we investigated the role of the two Flvcr1 isoforms during erythropoiesis. We showed that, in mice and zebrafish, Flvcr1a is required for the expansion of committed erythroid progenitors but cannot drive their terminal differentiation, while Flvcr1b contributes to the expansion phase and is required for differentiation. FLVCR1a-down-regulated K562 cells have defective proliferation, enhanced differentiation, and heme loading in the cytosol, while FLVCR1a/1b-deficient K562 cells show impairment in both proliferation and differentiation, and accumulate heme in mitochondria. These data support a model in which the coordinated expression of Flvcr1a and Flvcr1b contributes to control the size of the cytosolic heme pool required to sustain metabolic activity during the expansion of erythroid progenitors and to allow hemoglobinization during their terminal maturation. Consistently, reduction or increase of the cytosolic heme rescued the erythroid defects in zebrafish deficient in Flvcr1a or Flvcr1b, respectively. Thus, heme export represents a tightly regulated process that controls erythropoiesis.","['Mercurio, Sonia', 'Petrillo, Sara', 'Chiabrando, Deborah', 'Bassi, Zuni Irma', 'Gays, Dafne', 'Camporeale, Annalisa', 'Vacaru, Andrei', 'Miniscalco, Barbara', 'Valperga, Giulio', 'Silengo, Lorenzo', 'Altruda, Fiorella', 'Baron, Margaret H', 'Santoro, Massimo Mattia', 'Tolosano, Emanuela']","['Mercurio S', 'Petrillo S', 'Chiabrando D', 'Bassi ZI', 'Gays D', 'Camporeale A', 'Vacaru A', 'Miniscalco B', 'Valperga G', 'Silengo L', 'Altruda F', 'Baron MH', 'Santoro MM', 'Tolosano E']","['Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences and Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences and Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences and Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences and Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences and Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences and Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute and Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology and Departments of Developmental and Regenerative Biology and Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Veterinary Science, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences and Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences and Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences and Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Italy.', 'Tisch Cancer Institute and Black Family Stem Cell Institute, Division of Hematology and Medical Oncology and Departments of Developmental and Regenerative Biology and Oncological Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences and Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Italy Vesalius Research Center, VIB-KUL, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences and Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Italy emanuela.tolosano@unito.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (FLVCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Zebrafish']",2015/03/22 06:00,2016/02/13 06:00,['2015/03/22 06:00'],"['2014/07/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/13 06:00 [medline]']","['haematol.2014.114488 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2014.114488 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2015 Jun;100(6):720-9. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2014.114488.

The mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes convert alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG) to the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG), which dysregulates a set of alpha-KG-dependent dioxygenases. To determine whether mutant IDH enzymes are valid targets for cancer therapy, we created a mouse model of AML in which mice were transplanted with nucleophosmin1 (NPM)(+/-) hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells cotransduced with four mutant genes (NPMc, IDH2/R140Q, DNMT3A/R882H, and FLT3/ITD), which often occur simultaneously in human AML patients. Conditional deletion of IDH2/R140Q blocked 2-HG production and maintenance of leukemia stem cells, resulting in survival of the AML mice. IDH2/R140Q was necessary for the engraftment or survival of NPMc(+) cells in vivo. Gene expression analysis indicated that NPMc increased expression of Hoxa9. IDH2/R140Q also increased the level of Meis1 and activated the hypoxia pathway in AML cells. IDH2/R140Q decreased the 5hmC modification and expression of some differentiation-inducing genes (Ebf1 and Spib). Taken together, our results indicated that IDH2 mutation is critical for the development and maintenance of AML stem-like cells, and they provided a preclinical justification for targeting mutant IDH enzymes as a strategy for anticancer therapy.","['Ogawara, Yoko', 'Katsumoto, Takuo', 'Aikawa, Yukiko', 'Shima, Yutaka', 'Kagiyama, Yuki', 'Soga, Tomoyoshi', 'Matsunaga, Hironori', 'Seki, Takahiko', 'Araki, Kazushi', 'Kitabayashi, Issay']","['Ogawara Y', 'Katsumoto T', 'Aikawa Y', 'Shima Y', 'Kagiyama Y', 'Soga T', 'Matsunaga H', 'Seki T', 'Araki K', 'Kitabayashi I']","['Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Institute for Advanced Biosciences, Keio University, Tsuruoka, Yamagata, Japan.', 'R&D Division, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.', 'R&D Division, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.', 'R&D Division, Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Hematological Malignancy, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan. ikitabay@ncc.go.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (MEIS1 protein, human)', '0 (Meis1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Npm1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (homeobox protein HOXA9)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (isocitrate dehydrogenase 2, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Hypoxia', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Myeloid Ecotropic Viral Integration Site 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Up-Regulation']",2015/03/22 06:00,2015/07/28 06:00,['2015/03/22 06:00'],"['2014/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['0008-5472.CAN-14-2200 [pii]', '10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2200 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 2015 May 15;75(10):2005-16. doi: 10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-14-2200.

Salirasib (Concordia Pharmaceuticals) is an oral RAS inhibitor that causes dislocation of RAS by competing directly with farnesylated RAS in binding to its putative membrane-binding proteins. Salirasib does not inhibit farnesyl transferase enzyme. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We report on a phase I study of Salirasib in patients with relapsed/refractory hematologic malignancies. Salirasib was administered orally twice daily on days 1 to 21 of a 28-day cycle in a ""3+3"" dose escalation design. RESULTS: Seventeen patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia were treated for a median of 4 cycles (range, 1-29). Three patients each were enrolled at a dose level of 100, 200, 400, 600, and 800 mg twice daily and 2 patients at a dose level of 900 mg twice daily. No dose-limiting toxicities were encountered. Grade 1/2 diarrhea was the only frequent nonhematologic toxicity observed in 14 of 17 (82%) patients and was resolved with oral antidiarrheal agents. Eight (47%) patients (4 with myelodysplastic syndrome, 2 with acute myeloid leukemia, 1 with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and 1 with chronic myeloid leukemia) had hematological improvement; 1 in 3 lineages, 1 in 2 lineages, and 6 in 1 lineage. None of the patients achieved complete remission. The responses lasted for a median of 10 weeks (range, 5-115). The study was discontinued because of financial constraints.

Drugs, sarcoidosis, and infections are responsible for most cases of GIN. Malignancy is not an established cause of GIN. Here, we report a series of 5 patients with GIN secondary to chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). Patients were mostly elderly white males with an established history of CLL/SLL who presented with severe renal impairment (median peak serum creatinine, 7.3 mg/dL), leukocyturia, and mild proteinuria. One had nephromegaly. In 2 patients, the development and relapse of renal insufficiency closely paralleled the level of lymphocytosis. Kidney biopsy in all patients showed GIN concomitant with CLL/SLL leukemic interstitial infiltration. Granulomas were nonnecrotizing and epithelioid and were associated with giant cells. One biopsy showed granulomatous arteritis. One patient had a granulomatous reaction in lymph nodes and skin. Steroids with/without CLL/SLL-directed chemotherapy led to partial improvement of kidney function in all patients except 1 who had advanced cortical scarring on biopsy. In conclusion, we report an association between CLL/SLL and GIN. Patients typically present with severe renal failure due to both GIN and leukemic interstitial infiltration, which tends to respond to steroids with/without CLL/SLL-directed chemotherapy. The pathogenesis of GIN in this clinical setting is unknown but may represent a local hypersensitivity reaction to the CLL/SLL tumor cells.","['Nasr, Samih H', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Hanson, Curtis A', 'Fidler, Mary E', 'Cornell, Lynn D', 'Sethi, Sanjeev', 'Chaffee, Kari G', 'Morris, Joseph', 'Leung, Nelson']","['Nasr SH', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Hanson CA', 'Fidler ME', 'Cornell LD', 'Sethi S', 'Chaffee KG', 'Morris J', 'Leung N']","['Division of Anatomic Pathology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.

Existing assays for the measurement of soluble, activated complement proteins are based on the detection of conformational neoepitopes. We tested an alternative approach based on detection of short linear neoepitopes exposed at the cleavage sites after activation of the actual complement component. Obtained antibodies reactive to C4d and C5b fragments enabled us to set up highly specific sandwich ELISAs, which ensured trustful measurements without false positive readouts characteristic for some of the widely used assays.","['Blom, Anna M', 'Osterborg, Anders', 'Mollnes, Tom E', 'Okroj, Marcin']","['Blom AM', 'Osterborg A', 'Mollnes TE', 'Okroj M']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine Malmo, Section of Medical Protein Chemistry, Lund University, Inga Marie Nilssons Street 53, 20502 Malmo, Sweden.', 'Immune and Gene Therapy Laboratory, Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institute, 17176 Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Hematology, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, 17176 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital Rikshospitalet, 0372 Oslo, Norway; K.G.

AML peripheral blood or bone marrow mononuclear cells were cultured in medium supplemented with GM-CSF/IL-4 to induce dendritic cell (DC) differentiation of AML blasts (AML-DC). The impact of TNF-alpha, LPS, R848 and their combinations on AML-DC cultures was analyzed. Significantly enhanced CD80, CD40, CD83, CD54, HLA-DR and CD86 expression of AML cells was observed by addition of TNF-alpha, LPS, R848 alone or combinations. Induced CD80 expression of AML cells was significantly higher through the combination of TNF-alpha, LPS and R848 (T + L + R) than that by T alone. CTL induced from T + L + R, T + R, T + L, L + R and R, but not T, L alone stimulated cultures showed significantly higher IFN-gamma release than the medium control in response to autologous AML cells. IFN-gamma release by T + L + R was significantly higher than T or L alone, and T + R was significantly higher than T alone. CTL generated from T + L + R, T + L, T + R, L + R and L alone exerted significantly higher AML cell killing than medium control. AML cell killing by T + L + R and T + R was significantly higher than T or R alone. These results indicate that the combination of T + L + R induces a significantly enhanced antigen presentation effect of AML-DC.

The increased risk of thyroid cancer among exposed children and adolescents is well established but the impact of radioactive contamination on the risk of other types of cancer is much less certain. To provide data on a public health issue of major importance, we have analyzed the incidence of non-thyroid cancers during the post-Chernobyl period in a well-defined cohort of 13,203 individuals who were <18 years of age at the time of the accident. The report is based on standardized incidence ratio (SIR) analysis of 43 non-thyroid cancers identified through linkage with the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine for the period 1998 through 2009. We compared the observed and expected number of cases in three cancer groupings: all solid cancers excluding thyroid, leukemia, and lymphoma. Our analyses found no evidence of a statistically significant elevation in cancer risks in this cohort exposed at radiosensitive ages, although the cancer trends, particularly for leukemia (SIR=1.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.69; 4.13), should continue to be monitored.","['Hatch, M', 'Ostroumova, E', 'Brenner, A', 'Federenko, Z', 'Gorokh, Y', 'Zvinchuk, O', 'Shpak, V', 'Tereschenko, V', 'Tronko, M', 'Mabuchi, K']","['Hatch M', 'Ostroumova E', 'Brenner A', 'Federenko Z', 'Gorokh Y', 'Zvinchuk O', 'Shpak V', 'Tereschenko V', 'Tronko M', 'Mabuchi K']","['Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.

Herein, we investigated the effect of Mir155 deletion on Fas-induced liver injury. Wild-type (WT) mice and Mir155 knockout (KO) mice were i.p. administered with the anti-Fas antibody (Jo2) to determine animal survival and the extent of liver injury. After Jo2 injection, the Mir155 KO mice exhibited prolonged survival versus the WT mice (P < 0.01). The Mir155 KO mice showed lower alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, less liver tissue damage, fewer apoptotic hepatocytes, and lower liver tissue caspase 3/7, 8, and 9 activities compared with the WT mice, indicating that Mir155 deletion prevents Fas-induced hepatocyte apoptosis and liver injury. Hepatocytes isolated from Mir155 KO mice also showed resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis, in vitro. Higher protein level of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) was also observed in Mir155 KO hepatocytes compared to WT hepatocytes. A miR-155 binding site was identified in the 3'-untranslated region of Mcl-1 mRNA; Mcl1 was identified as a direct target of miR-155 in hepatocytes. Consistently, pretreatment with a siRNA specific for Mcl1 reversed Mir155 deletion-mediated protection against Jo2-induced liver tissue damage.

As part of the California Childhood Leukemia Study, dust samples were collected from 6 homes occupied by smokeless tobacco users, 6 homes occupied by active smokers, and 20 tobacco-free homes. To assess children's potential for exposure to tobacco constituents, vacuum-dust concentrations of five tobacco-specific nitrosamines, including N'-nitrosonornicotine [NNN] and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone [NNK], as well as six tobacco alkaloids, including nicotine and myosmine, were quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We used generalized estimating equations derived from a multivariable marginal model to compare levels of tobacco constituents between groups, after adjusting for a history of parental smoking, income, home construction date, and mother's age and race/ethnicity. The ratio of myosmine/nicotine was used as a novel indicator of the source of tobacco contamination, distinguishing between smokeless tobacco products and tobacco smoke. Median dust concentrations of NNN and NNK were significantly greater in homes with smokeless tobacco users compared to tobacco-free homes. In multivariable models, concentrations of NNN and NNK were 4.8- and 6.9-fold higher, respectively, in homes with smokeless tobacco users compared to tobacco-free homes. Median myosmine/nicotine ratios were lower in homes with smokeless tobacco users (1.8%) compared to homes of active smokers (7.7%), confirming that cigarette smoke was not the predominant source of tobacco constituents in homes with smokeless tobacco users. Children living with smokeless tobacco users may be exposed to carcinogenic tobacco-specific nitrosamines via contact with contaminated dust and household surfaces.","['Whitehead, Todd P', 'Havel, Christopher', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Benowitz, Neal L', 'Jacob, Peyton 3rd']","['Whitehead TP', 'Havel C', 'Metayer C', 'Benowitz NL', 'Jacob P 3rd']","['daggerSchool of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 1995 University Avenue, Berkeley, California 94704, United States.', 'double daggerSchool of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco General Hospital Campus, 1001 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, California 94143, United States.', 'daggerSchool of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, 1995 University Avenue, Berkeley, California 94704, United States.', 'double daggerSchool of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco General Hospital Campus, 1001 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, California 94143, United States.', 'double daggerSchool of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco General Hospital Campus, 1001 Potrero Avenue, San Francisco, California 94143, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Chem Res Toxicol,Chemical research in toxicology,8807448,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Dust)', '0 (Nitrosamines)', '0 (Tobacco Smoke Pollution)', '7S395EDO61 (4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone)', ""X656TZ86DX (N'-nitrosonornicotine)""]",IM,"['Air Pollution, Indoor/*analysis', 'Alkaloids/*analysis', 'Carcinogens/analysis', 'Child', 'Chromatography, Liquid', 'Dust/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Nitrosamines/*analysis', 'Tandem Mass Spectrometry', 'Tobacco/chemistry', 'Tobacco Smoke Pollution/*analysis', 'Tobacco, Smokeless/*analysis']",2015/03/21 06:00,2016/02/11 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1021/acs.chemrestox.5b00040 [doi]'],ppublish,Chem Res Toxicol. 2015 May 18;28(5):1007-14. doi: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.5b00040.

We investigated the roles of hypoxia and epigenetics in the regulation of WT1 expression in myeloid leukemia cells. WT1 expression correlates with hypomethylation of the CpG island in Intron 1, and pharmacologic demethylation of this CpG island induces WT1 mRNA expression. Hypoxia causes decreases in DNMT expression and activity and increased expression and activity of TET2 and TET3, resulting in demethylation of this CpG island and expression of WT1 mRNA. Demethylation of the CpG island, either from pharmacologic treatment or induction of hypoxia, results in transcription of an antisense-oriented lncRNA, and inhibiting lncRNA expression with shRNA blocks WT1 mRNA expression. These results reveal a novel model of hypoxia-mediated epigenetic gene regulation. In addition, this is the first report that TET2 and TET3, increasingly recognized as important epigenetic regulators of gene expression in stem cells and in cancer cells, can be regulated by hypoxia, providing a solid mechanistic link between hypoxia and epigenetic regulation of gene expression with important implications for the role of hypoxia in stem cell function.","['McCarty, Gregory', 'Loeb, David M']","['McCarty G', 'Loeb DM']","['Department of Oncology, Division of Pediatric Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.', 'Department of Oncology, Division of Pediatric Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', 'EC 1.- (TET3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'CpG Islands', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/metabolism', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Dioxygenases/genetics/metabolism', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genetic Loci', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/*genetics', 'Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit/genetics/metabolism', 'Introns', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/chemistry/*genetics', 'WT1 Proteins/chemistry/*genetics']",2015/03/21 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2014/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0119837 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-49681 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 20;10(3):e0119837. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0119837. eCollection 2015.,20150320,PMC4368825,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current in vivo models based on the use of patient samples are not easy to establish and manipulate in the laboratory. Our objective was to develop robust xenograft models of human AML using well-characterized cell lines as a more accessible and faster alternative to those incorporating the use of patient-derived AML cells. Five widely used AML cell lines representing various AML subtypes were transplanted and expanded into highly immunodeficient non-obese diabetic/LtSz-severe combined immunodeficiency IL2Rgammac(null) mice (for example, cell line-derived xenografts). We show here that bone marrow sublethal conditioning with busulfan or irradiation has equal efficiency for the xenotransplantation of AML cell lines. Although higher number of injected AML cells did not change tumor engraftment in bone marrow and spleen, it significantly reduced the overall survival in mice for all tested AML cell lines. On the basis of AML cell characteristics, these models also exhibited a broad range of overall mouse survival, engraftment, tissue infiltration and aggressiveness. Thus, we have established a robust, rapid and straightforward in vivo model based on engraftment behavior of AML cell lines, all vital prerequisites for testing new therapeutic agents in preclinical studies.","['Saland, E', 'Boutzen, H', 'Castellano, R', 'Pouyet, L', 'Griessinger, E', 'Larrue, C', 'de Toni, F', 'Scotland, S', 'David, M', 'Danet-Desnoyers, G', 'Vergez, F', 'Barreira, Y', 'Collette, Y', 'Recher, C', 'Sarry, J-E']","['Saland E', 'Boutzen H', 'Castellano R', 'Pouyet L', 'Griessinger E', 'Larrue C', 'de Toni F', 'Scotland S', 'David M', 'Danet-Desnoyers G', 'Vergez F', 'Barreira Y', 'Collette Y', 'Recher C', 'Sarry JE']","['1] Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM, U1037, Toulouse, France [2] University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', '1] Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM, U1037, Toulouse, France [2] University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', '1] Cancer Research Center of Marseille, INSERM, U1068, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France [4] CNRS, UMR7258, Marseille, France.', '1] Cancer Research Center of Marseille, INSERM, U1068, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France [4] CNRS, UMR7258, Marseille, France.', '1] Centre Mediterraneen de Medecine Moleculaire, INSERM, U1065, Nice, France [2] Universite de Nice Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France.', '1] Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM, U1037, Toulouse, France [2] University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', '1] Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM, U1037, Toulouse, France [2] University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', '1] Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM, U1037, Toulouse, France [2] University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', '1] Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM, U1037, Toulouse, France [2] University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.', '1] Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM, U1037, Toulouse, France [2] University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Experimentation Animale, UMS006, 31059, Toulouse cedex, France."", '1] Cancer Research Center of Marseille, INSERM, U1068, Marseille, France [2] Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille, France [3] Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France [4] CNRS, UMR7258, Marseille, France.', ""1] Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM, U1037, Toulouse, France [2] University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France [3] Departement d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse cedex, France."", '1] Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, INSERM, U1037, Toulouse, France [2] University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cancer J,Blood cancer journal,101568469,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays/*methods']",2015/03/21 06:00,2015/09/17 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2015/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/17 06:00 [medline]']","['bcj201519 [pii]', '10.1038/bcj.2015.19 [doi]']",epublish,Blood Cancer J. 2015 Mar 20;5:e297. doi: 10.1038/bcj.2015.19.,20150320,PMC4382660,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of Robo4 was recently found in solid tumors and leukemia stem cells. However, the clinical implications of Robo4 expression in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remain unclear. METHODS: We investigated the clinical and prognostic relevance of mRNA expression of Robo4 in bone marrow (BM) mononuclear cells from 218 adult patients with de novo AML. We also performed immunohistochemical staining to assess the Robo4 protein expression in the BM biopsy specimens from 30 selected AML patients in the cohort. RESULTS: Higher Robo4 expression was closely associated with lower white blood cell counts, expression of HLA-DR, CD13, CD34 and CD56 on leukemia cells, t(8;21) and ASXL1 mutation, but negatively correlated with t(15;17) and CEBPA mutation. Compared to patients with lower Robo4 expression, those with higher expression had significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). This result was confirmed in an independent validation cohort. Furthermore, multivariate analyses showed that higher Robo4 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor for DFS and OS in total cohort and patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, irrespective of age, WBC count, karyotype, and mutation status of NPM1/FLT3-ITD, and CEBPA. CONCLUSIONS: BM Robo4 expression can serve as a new biomarker to predict clinical outcomes in AML patients and Robo4 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in patients with higher Robo4 expression.","['Chen, Yin-Kai', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Tang, Jih-Luh', 'Jhuang, Jie-Yang', 'Lai, Yan-Jun', 'Lee, Ming-Cheng', 'Kuo, Yuan-Yeh', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Liu, Chieh-Yu', 'Lin, Chung-Wu', 'Chuang, Shih-Sung', 'Chen, Chien-Yuan', 'Tseng, Mei-Hsuan', 'Huang, Chi-Fei', 'Chiang, Ying-Chieh', 'Lee, Fen-Yu', 'Liu, Ming-Chih', 'Liu, Chia-Wen', 'Yao, Ming', 'Huang, Shang-Yi', 'Ko, Bor-Sheng', 'Hsu, Szu-Chun', 'Wu, Shang-Ju', 'Tsay, Woei', 'Chen, Yao-Chang', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Chen YK', 'Hou HA', 'Tang JL', 'Jhuang JY', 'Lai YJ', 'Lee MC', 'Kuo YY', 'Chou WC', 'Liu CY', 'Lin CW', 'Chuang SS', 'Chen CY', 'Tseng MH', 'Huang CF', 'Chiang YC', 'Lee FY', 'Liu MC', 'Liu CW', 'Yao M', 'Huang SY', 'Ko BS', 'Hsu SC', 'Wu SJ', 'Tsay W', 'Chen YC', 'Tien HF']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan;

We sought to investigate the effect of birth by (a) prelabor and (b) during-labor CD on the risk of early-onset (</=3 years) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), specifically of its prevailing precursor B (B-ALL) subtype. A total of 1099 incident cases of ALL (957 B-ALL), 131 of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and their 1 : 1 age-matched and sex-matched controls, derived from the Nationwide Registry for Childhood Hematological Malignancies (1996-2013), were analyzed using multivariate regression models. A null association was found between prelabor and/or during labor CD and either ALL (B-ALL) or AML in the 0-14 age range. By contrast, birth by CD increased significantly the risk of early-onset ALL [odds ratioCD (ORCD)=1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-2.24] mainly on account of prelabor CD (ORprelaborCD=1.66, 95% CI: 1.13-2.43). The respective figures were even higher for the early-onset precursor B-ALL (ORCD=1.66, 95% CI: 1.15-2.40 and ORprelaborCD=1.79, 95% CI: 1.21-2.66), whereas no association emerged for early-onset AML. Prelabor CD, which deprives exposure of the fetus/infant to the presumably beneficial effect of stress hormones released in both vaginal labor and during labor CD, was associated exclusively with an increased risk of early-onset ALL, particularly the precursor B-ALL subtype. If confirmed, these adverse long-term outcomes of CD may point to re-evaluation of prelabor CD practices and prompt scientific discussion on the best ways to simulate the effects of vaginal delivery, such as a precesarean induction of labor.","['Thomopoulos, Thomas P', 'Skalkidou, Alkistis', 'Dessypris, Nick', 'Chrousos, George', 'Karalexi, Maria A', 'Karavasilis, Theodoros G', 'Baka, Margarita', 'Hatzipantelis, Emmanuel', 'Kourti, Maria', 'Polychronopoulou, Sophia', 'Sidi, Vasiliki', 'Stiakaki, Eftichia', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Loutradis, Dimitrios', 'Petridou, Eleni Th']","['Thomopoulos TP', 'Skalkidou A', 'Dessypris N', 'Chrousos G', 'Karalexi MA', 'Karavasilis TG', 'Baka M', 'Hatzipantelis E', 'Kourti M', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Sidi V', 'Stiakaki E', 'Moschovi M', 'Loutradis D', 'Petridou ET']","[""aDepartment of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Medical Statistics, School of Medicine bFirst Department of Pediatrics, 'Aghia Sophia' Children's Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Athens cDepartment of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, 'Pan. & Agl.

Adequate model systems are required for preclinical studies to improve understanding of AML biology and to develop novel, rational treatment approaches. Xenografts in immunodeficient mice allow performing functional studies on patient-derived AML cells. We have established an improved model system that integrates serial retransplantation of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells in mice, genetic manipulation by lentiviral transduction, and essential quality controls by immunophenotyping and targeted resequencing of driver genes. 17/29 samples showed primary engraftment, 10/17 samples could be retransplanted and some of them allowed virtually indefinite serial transplantation. 5/6 samples were successfully transduced using lentiviruses. Neither serial transplantation nor genetic engineering markedly altered sample characteristics analyzed. Transgene expression was stable in PDX AML cells. Example given, recombinant luciferase enabled bioluminescence in vivo imaging and highly sensitive and reliable disease monitoring; imaging visualized minimal disease at 1 PDX cell in 10000 mouse bone marrow cells and facilitated quantifying leukemia initiating cells. We conclude that serial expansion, genetic engineering and imaging represent valuable tools to improve the individualized xenograft mouse model of AML. Prospectively, these advancements enable repetitive, clinically relevant studies on AML biology and preclinical treatment trials on genetically defined and heterogeneous subgroups.","['Vick, Binje', 'Rothenberg, Maja', 'Sandhofer, Nadine', 'Carlet, Michela', 'Finkenzeller, Cornelia', 'Krupka, Christina', 'Grunert, Michaela', 'Trumpp, Andreas', 'Corbacioglu, Selim', 'Ebinger, Martin', 'Andre, Maya C', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Schneider, Stephanie', 'Subklewe, Marion', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Spiekermann, Karsten', 'Jeremias, Irmela']","['Vick B', 'Rothenberg M', 'Sandhofer N', 'Carlet M', 'Finkenzeller C', 'Krupka C', 'Grunert M', 'Trumpp A', 'Corbacioglu S', 'Ebinger M', 'Andre MC', 'Hiddemann W', 'Schneider S', 'Subklewe M', 'Metzeler KH', 'Spiekermann K', 'Jeremias I']","['Group Apoptosis, Department of Gene Vectors, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Munich, Germany;

Nevertheless, these studies scarcely study regions that are implicated in non-coding molecules such as microRNAs (miRNAs). Abnormalities in miRNAs, as altered expression patterns and mutations, have been described in CLL, suggesting their implication in the development of the disease. Genetic variations in miRNAs can affect levels of miRNA expression if present in pre-miRNAs and in miRNA biogenesis genes or alter miRNA function if present in both target mRNA and miRNA sequences. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate whether polymorphisms in pre-miRNAs, and/or miRNA processing genes contribute to predisposition for CLL. A total of 91 SNPs in 107 CLL patients and 350 cancer-free controls were successfully analyzed using TaqMan Open Array technology. We found nine statistically significant associations with CLL risk after FDR correction, seven in miRNA processing genes (rs3805500 and rs6877842 in DROSHA, rs1057035 in DICER1, rs17676986 in SND1, rs9611280 in TNRC6B, rs784567 in TRBP and rs11866002 in CNOT1) and two in pre-miRNAs (rs11614913 in miR196a2 and rs2114358 in miR1206). These findings suggest that polymorphisms in genes involved in miRNAs biogenesis pathway as well as in pre-miRNAs contribute to the risk of CLL. Large-scale studies are needed to validate the current findings.","['Martin-Guerrero, Idoia', 'Gutierrez-Camino, Angela', 'Lopez-Lopez, Elixabet', 'Bilbao-Aldaiturriaga, Nerea', 'Pombar-Gomez, Maria', 'Ardanaz, Maite', 'Garcia-Orad, Africa']","['Martin-Guerrero I', 'Gutierrez-Camino A', 'Lopez-Lopez E', 'Bilbao-Aldaiturriaga N', 'Pombar-Gomez M', 'Ardanaz M', 'Garcia-Orad A']","['Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Bilbao, Spain.', 'Hospital Txagorritxu, Vitoria, Spain.', 'Department of Genetics, Physical Anthropology and Animal Physiology, Faculty of Medicine and Odontology, University of the Basque Country, UPV/EHU, Bilbao, Spain; BioCruces Health Research Institute, UPV/EHU, Leioa, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['0 (MicroRNAs)'],IM,"['*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genetic Variation', 'Genotyping Techniques', 'Haplotypes/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'MicroRNAs/chemistry/*genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional/*genetics', 'Risk Factors']",2015/03/21 06:00,2015/12/17 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2014/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0118905 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-27429 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 20;10(3):e0118905. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0118905. eCollection 2015.,20150320,PMC4368096,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Up regulation of MYC is also commonly observed in human T-ALLs. We previously demonstrated that expression of a constitutively active form of Lck-Akt2 alone is sufficient to initiate T-cell lymphoma in mice, and that tumor formation typically requires up regulation of Myc or Dlx5 caused by specific chromosomal rearrangements. Furthermore, Lck-Dlx5 mice develop T-ALLs that consistently acquire overexpression of Myc and activation of Akt, the latter due to loss of Pten expression. Proliferation of T-ALL cells from Lck-Dlx5 mice was found to be highly sensitive to the Akt pathway inhibitors BEZ235 and RAD001, as well as to JQ1, an inhibitor of bromodomain proteins, one of which (BRD4) regulates Myc transcription. Additionally, low concentrations of BEZ235 were found to cooperate with JQ1 to enhance cell cycle arrest. Higher concentrations of BEZ235 (>/=0.5 microM) promoted cell death, although the addition of JQ1 did not result in a further increase in apoptosis. In contrast, the specific Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 caused apoptosis, and when combined with BEZ235 (>/=0.5 microM), an enhanced effect on apoptosis was consistently observed. In addition, BEZ235 and RAD001 potentiated vincristine-induced apoptosis when the cells were treated with both drugs simultaneously, whereas pretreatment with BEZ235 antagonized the cell-killing effect of vincristine. Collectively, these experimental findings provide rationale for the design of novel combination therapies for T-ALL that includes targeting of AKT and MYC.","['Tan, Yinfei', 'Sementino, Eleonora', 'Pei, Jianming', 'Kadariya, Yuwaraj', 'Ito, Timothy K', 'Testa, Joseph R']","['Tan Y', 'Sementino E', 'Pei J', 'Kadariya Y', 'Ito TK', 'Testa JR']","['a Cancer Biology Program; Fox Chase Cancer Center ; Philadelphia , PA USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 ((+)-JQ1 compound)', '0 (5-(4-ethylbenzylidene)-2-thioxothiazolidin-4-one)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (Dlx5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Quinolines)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Triazoles)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '9HW64Q8G6G (Everolimus)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'RUJ6Z9Y0DT (dactolisib)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azepines/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/genetics', 'Everolimus/pharmacology', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*metabolism', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*metabolism', 'Quinolines/pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Triazoles/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",2015/03/21 06:00,2016/01/21 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/15384047.2015.1018495 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2015;16(4):580-8. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2015.1018495.

However, the contribution of MIR223 loss to leukemic transformation and HSC function is largely unknown. Herein, we characterize HSC function and myeloid differentiation in Mir223 deficient mice. We show that Mir223 loss results in a modest expansion of myeloid progenitors, but is not sufficient to induce a myeloproliferative disorder.

Despite these common features, the 4 vertebrate tenascins exhibit vastly different expression patterns. Tenascin-R is specific to the central nervous system. Tenascin-C is an ""oncofetal"" protein controlled by many stimuli (growth factors, cytokines, mechanical stress), but with restricted occurrence in space and time. In contrast, tenascin-X is a constituitive component of connective tissues, and its level is barely affected by external factors. Finally, the expression of tenascin-W is similar to that of tenascin-C but even more limited. In accordance with their highly regulated expression, the promoters of the tenascin-C and -W genes contain TATA boxes, whereas those of the other 2 tenascins do not. This article summarizes what is currently known about the complex transcriptional regulation of the 4 tenascin genes in development and disease.","['Chiovaro, Francesca', 'Chiquet-Ehrismann, Ruth', 'Chiquet, Matthias']","['Chiovaro F', 'Chiquet-Ehrismann R', 'Chiquet M']","['a Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research ; Basel , Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cell Adh Migr,Cell adhesion & migration,101469464,"['0 (Tenascin)', '0 (tenascin X)', '147604-77-1 (tenascin R)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Central Nervous System/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Tenascin/*metabolism']",2015/03/21 06:00,2015/12/19 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/19336918.2015.1008333 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Adh Migr. 2015;9(1-2):34-47. doi: 10.1080/19336918.2015.1008333.,,PMC4422812,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog', 'ALK, anaplastic lymphoma kinase', 'AP-1, activator protein-1', 'ATF, activating transcription factor', 'BMP, bone morphogenetic protein', 'CBP, CREB binding protein', 'CREB, cAMP response element-binding protein', 'CREB-RP, CREB-related protein', 'CYP21A2, cytochrome P450 family 21 subfamily A polypeptide 2', 'ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation', 'EBS, Ets binding site', 'ECM, extracellular matrix', 'EGF, epidermal growth factor', 'ERK1/2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2', 'ETS, E26 transformation-specific', 'EWS-ETS, Ewing sarcoma-Ets fusion protein', 'Evx1, even skipped homeobox 1', 'FGF, fibroblast growth factor', 'HBS, homeodomain binding sequence', 'IL, interleukin', 'ILK, integrin-linked kinase', 'JAK, Janus kinase', 'JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase', 'MHCIII, major histocompatibility complex class III', 'MKL1, megakaryoblastic leukemia-1', 'NFkappaB, nuclear factor kappa B', 'NGF, nerve growth factor; NFAT, nuclear factor of activated T-cells', 'OTX2, orthodenticle homolog 2', 'PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor', 'PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase', 'POU3F2, POU domain class 3 transcription factor 2', 'PRRX1, paired-related homeobox 1', 'RBPJk, recombining binding protein suppressor of hairless', 'ROCK, Rho-associated, coiled-coil-containing protein kinase', 'RhoA, ras homolog gene family member A', 'SAP, SAF-A/B, Acinus, and PIAS', 'SCX, scleraxix', 'SEAP, secreted alkaline phosphatase', 'SMAD, small body size - mothers against decapentaplegic', 'SOX4, sex determining region Y-box 4', 'SRE, serum response element', 'SRF, serum response factor', 'STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription', 'TGF-beta, transforming growth factor-beta', 'TNC, tenascin-C', 'TNF-alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha', 'TNR, tenascin-R', 'TNW, tenascin-W', 'TNX, tenascin-X', 'TSS, transcription start site', 'UTR, untranslated region', 'WNT, wingless-related integration site', 'cancer', 'cytokine', 'development', 'extracellular matrix', 'gene promoter', 'gene regulation', 'glucocorticoid', 'growth factor', 'homeobox gene', 'matricellular', 'mechanical stress', 'miR, micro RNA', 'p38 MAPK, p38 mitogen activated protein kinase', 'tenascin', 'transcription factor']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To evaluate the effects of the genotypic polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) on childhood ALL risk in Taiwan, two well-known polymorphic genotypes of MTHFR, C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131), were analyzed to examine the extent of their associations with childhood ALL susceptibility and to discuss the MTHFR genotypic contribution to childhood ALL risk among different populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In total, 266 patients with childhood ALL and an equal number of non-cancer controls recruited were genotyped utilizing PCR-RFLP methodology. The MTHFR C677T genotype, but not the A1298C, was differently distributed between childhood ALL and control groups. The CT and TT of MTHFR C677T genotypes were significantly more frequently found in controls than in childhood ALL patients (odds ratios=0.60 and 0.48, 95% confidence intervals=0.42-0.87 and 0.24-0.97, respectively). As for gender, the boys carrying the MTHFR C677T CT or TT genotype conferred a lower odds ratio of 0.51 (95% confidence interval=0.32-0.81, P=0.0113) for childhood ALL. As for age, those equal to or greater than 3.5 years of age at onset of disease carrying the MTHFR C677T CT or TT genotype were of lower risk (odds ratio= 0.43 and 95% confidence interval=0.26-0.71, P=0.0016). CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the MTHFR C677T T allele was a protective biomarker for childhood ALL in Taiwan, and the association was more significant in male patients and in patients 3.5 years of age or older at onset of disease.","['Pei, Jen-Sheng', 'Hsu, Chin-Mu', 'Tsai, Chia-Wen', 'Chang, Wen-Shin', 'Ji, Hong-Xue', 'Hsiao, Chieh-Lun', 'Miao, Chia-En', 'Hsu, Yuan-Nian', 'Bau, Da-Tian']","['Pei JS', 'Hsu CM', 'Tsai CW', 'Chang WS', 'Ji HX', 'Hsiao CL', 'Miao CE', 'Hsu YN', 'Bau DT']","['Department of Pediatrics, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC; Graduate Institute of Basic Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Department of Family Medicine, Taoyuan General Hospital, Ministry of Health and Welfare, Taoyuan, Taiwan, ROC.', 'Terry Fox Cancer Research Laboratory, China Medical University Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC; Graduate Institute of Basic Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medical Science, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,['EC 1.5.1.20 (Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2))'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2)/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Risk', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",2015/03/21 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2014/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0119776 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-25536 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 20;10(3):e0119776. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0119776. eCollection 2015.,20150320,PMC4368437,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, we here searched for genes directly influenced by the repression of various MLL fusions. METHODS: For this, we performed gene expression profiling after siRNA-mediated repression of MLL-AF4, MLL-ENL, and AF4-MLL in MLL-rearranged ALL cell line models. The obtained results were compared with various already established gene signatures including those consisting of known MLL-AF4 target genes, or those associated with primary MLL-rearranged infant ALL samples. RESULTS: Genes that were down-regulated in response to the repression of MLL-AF4 and MLL-ENL appeared characteristically expressed in primary MLL-rearranged infant ALL samples, and often represented known MLL-AF4 targets genes. Genes that were up-regulated in response to the repression of MLL-AF4 and MLL-ENL often represented genes typically silenced by promoter hypermethylation in MLL-rearranged infant ALL. Genes that were affected in response to the repression of AF4-MLL showed significant enrichment in gene expression profiles associated with AF4-MLL expressing t(4;11)+ infant ALL patient samples. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the here identified genes readily responsive to the loss of MLL fusion expression potentially represent attractive therapeutic targets and may provide additional insights in MLL-rearranged acute leukemias.","['van der Linden, Marieke H', 'Seslija, Lidija', 'Schneider, Pauline', 'Driessen, Emma M C', 'Castro, Patricia Garrido', 'Stumpel, Dominique J P M', 'van Roon, Eddy', 'de Boer, Jasper', 'Williams, Owen', 'Pieters, Rob', 'Stam, Ronald W']","['van der Linden MH', 'Seslija L', 'Schneider P', 'Driessen EM', 'Castro PG', 'Stumpel DJ', 'van Roon E', 'de Boer J', 'Williams O', 'Pieters R', 'Stam RW']","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology Unit, University College London Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom.', 'Molecular Haematology and Cancer Biology Unit, University College London Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands; Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Transcriptome', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2015/03/21 06:00,2016/02/10 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2014/08/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/10 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0120326 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-34160 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 20;10(3):e0120326. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0120326. eCollection 2015.,20150320,PMC4368425,,,,,,,,,,,,"['GEO/GSE13351', 'GEO/GSE19475']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first manifestation of these disorders are present in childhood and adolescence, but infrequently it may be presented in young and middle ages. Genetic base has been known for all types of periodic fever syndromes except periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis, and cervical adenitis (PFAPA). Common periodic fever disorders are Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and PFAPA. In each patient with periodic fever, acquired infection with chronic and periodic nature should be ruled out. It depends on epidemiology of infectious diseases. Some of them such as Familial Mediterranean fever and PFAPA are common in Iran. In Iran and other Middle East countries, brucellosis, malaria and infectious mononucleosis should be considered in differential diagnosis of periodic fever disorders especially with fever and arthritis manifestation. In children, urinary tract infection may be presented as periodic disorder, urine analysis and culture is necessary in each child with periodic symptoms. Some malignancies such as leukemia and tumoral lesions should be excluded in patients with periodic syndrome and weight loss in any age. After excluding infection, malignancy and cyclic neutropenia, FMF and PFAPA are the most common periodic fever disorders.

METHODS: We obtained information on 5788 cases and 5788 controls by linking California cancer and birth registries. We evaluated relative risk of childhood leukaemia by race and ethnicity of the child and their parents using conditional logistic regression, with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Compared with Whites, Black children had lower risk of ALL (OR=0.54, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.66) as well as children of Black/Asian parents (OR=0.31, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.94). Asian race was associated with increased risk of AML with OR=1.643, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.46 for Asian vs Whites; and OR=1.67, 95% CI 1.04 to 2.70 for Asian/Asian vs White/White. Hispanic ethnicity was associated with increased risk of ALL (OR=1.37, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.52). A gradient in risk of ALL was observed while comparing Hispanic children with both parents Hispanic, one parent Hispanic and non-Hispanic children (p Value for trend <0.0001). The highest risk of ALL was observed for children with a combination of Hispanic ethnicity and White race compared with non-Hispanic whites (OR=1.27, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.44). The lowest risk was observed for non-Hispanic blacks (OR=0.46, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.60). Associations for total childhood leukaemia were similar to ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm that there are ethnic and racial differences in the incidence of childhood leukaemia. These differences indicate that some genetic and/or environmental/cultural factors are involved in aetiology of childhood leukaemia.","['Oksuzyan, Sona', 'Crespi, Catherine M', 'Cockburn, Myles', 'Mezei, Gabor', 'Vergara, Ximena', 'Kheifets, Leeka']","['Oksuzyan S', 'Crespi CM', 'Cockburn M', 'Mezei G', 'Vergara X', 'Kheifets L']","['Department of Epidemiology, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Department of Biostatistics, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Computational Biology, Exponent Engineering and Scientific Consulting, Menlo Park, California, USA.', 'Environment Department, Electric Power Research Institute, Palo Alto, California, USA.', 'Department of Epidemiology, UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",England,J Epidemiol Community Health,Journal of epidemiology and community health,7909766,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'African Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'Asian Americans/statistics & numerical data', 'California/epidemiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hispanic or Latino/statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Indians, North American/statistics & numerical data', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*ethnology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*ethnology', 'Registries', 'Risk', 'Whites/statistics & numerical data']",2015/03/21 06:00,2016/06/02 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2014/09/19 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['jech-2014-204975 [pii]', '10.1136/jech-2014-204975 [doi]']",ppublish,J Epidemiol Community Health. 2015 Aug;69(8):795-802. doi: 10.1136/jech-2014-204975.

In the present study, we investigated whether the crude extract of Polygonum cuspidatum (CEPC) could affect immune responses of murine leukemia cells in vivo. Normal BALB/c mice were i.p. injected with WEHI-3 cells to generate leukemic mice and then were treated orally with CEPC at 0, 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg for three weeks. Animals were weighed and blood, liver, spleen samples were collected for further analyses. Results indicated that CEPC did not significantly affect the body and liver weight of animals, but reduced the weight of spleen when compared to control groups. Flow cytometric assay demonstrated that CEPC increased the percentage of CD3- (T-cell marker) and CD19- (B-cell marker) positive cells, but reduced that of CD11b-positive ones (monocytes). However, it did not significantly affect the proportion of Mac-3-positive cells (macrophages), compared to control groups. Results indicated that CEPC promoted phagocytosis by macrophages from blood samples at all examined doses but did not affect that of macrophages from the peritoneal cavity. CEPC also promoted natural killer cell activity of splenocytes at 200 mg/kg of CEPC. CEPC promoted B-cell proliferation at 200 mg/kg treatment when cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharides but did not promote T-cell proliferation at three doses of CEPC treatment on concanavalin A stimulation.","['Chueh, Fu-Shin', 'Lin, Jen-Jyh', 'Lin, Jing-Pin', 'Yu, Fu-Shun', 'Lin, Ju-Hwa', 'Ma, Yi-Shih', 'Huang, Yi-Ping', 'Lien, Jin-Cherng', 'Chung, Jing-Gung']","['Chueh FS', 'Lin JJ', 'Lin JP', 'Yu FS', 'Lin JH', 'Ma YS', 'Huang YP', 'Lien JC', 'Chung JG']","['Department of Health and Nutrition Biotechnology, Asia University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.', 'School of Chinese Medicine, China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan, R.O.C.

Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to obtain a comprehensive description of the RNAs packaged by a model retrovirus, murine leukemia virus. The major encapsidated host RNAs are noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) and members of the VL30 class of endogenous retroviruses. Remarkably, although Moloney leukemia virus (MLV) assembles in the cytoplasm, precursors to specific tRNAs, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are all enriched in virions. Consistent with their cytoplasmic recruitment, packaging of both pre-tRNAs and U6 snRNA requires the nuclear export receptor Exportin-5. Adenylated and uridylated forms of these RNAs accumulate in cells and virions when the cytoplasmic exoribonuclease DIS3L2 and subunits of the RNA exosome are depleted. Together, our data reveal that MLV recruits RNAs from a novel host cell surveillance pathway in which unprocessed and unneeded nuclear ncRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for degradation.","['Eckwahl, Matthew J', 'Sim, Soyeong', 'Smith, Derek', 'Telesnitsky, Alice', 'Wolin, Sandra L']","['Eckwahl MJ', 'Sim S', 'Smith D', 'Telesnitsky A', 'Wolin SL']","['Department of Cell Biology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06536, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06536, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06536, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, 48109, USA.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06536, USA Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06536, USA Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, Connecticut 06520 sandra.wolin@yale.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (RNA, Untranslated)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cytoplasm', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Host-Pathogen Interactions/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*metabolism', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Protein Transport', 'Proteolysis', 'RNA, Untranslated/*metabolism', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism']",2015/03/21 06:00,2015/10/08 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/10/08 06:00 [medline]']","['29/6/646 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.258731.115 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2015 Mar 15;29(6):646-57. doi: 10.1101/gad.258731.115.,,PMC4378196,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA surveillance', 'exoribonucleases', 'noncoding RNAs', 'retrovirus']",['(c) 2015 Eckwahl et al.; Published by Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.'],,,"['P50 GM103297/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 AI094059/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM007223/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32GM007223/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,['SRA/SRP053582'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, several clinical trials are being conducted with arsenic-based drugs for the treatment of other hematological malignancies and solid tumors. However, ATO's modest clinical efficacy on some cancers, and potential toxic effects on humans have been reported. Determining how best to reduce these adverse effects while increasing its therapeutic efficacy is obviously a critical issue. Previously, we demonstrated that the JNK-induced complex formation of phosphorylated c-Jun and TG-interacting factor (TGIF) antagonizes ERK-induced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor CDKN1A (p21(WAF1/CIP1)) expression and resultant apoptosis in response to ATO in A431 cells. Surprisingly, at low-concentrations (0.1-0.2 muM), ATO increased cellular proliferation, migration and invasion, involving TGIF expression, however, at high-concentrations (5-20 muM), ATO induced cell apoptosis. Using a promoter analysis, TGIF was transcriptionally regulated by ATO at the FOXO3A binding site (-1486 to -1479bp) via the c-Src/EGFR/AKT pathway. Stable overexpression of TGIF promoted advancing the cell cycle into the S phase, and attenuated 20 muM ATO-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, blockage of the AKT pathway enhanced ATO-induced CDKN1A expression and resultant apoptosis in cancer cells, but overexpression of AKT1 inhibited CDKN1A expression. Therefore, we suggest that TGIF is transcriptionally regulated by the c-Src/EGFR/AKT pathway, which plays a role as a negative regulator in antagonizing ATO-induced CDKN1A expression and resultant apoptosis.

Mechanisms of interaction.,261-9,10.1016/j.ijpharm.2015.03.024 [doi] S0378-5173(15)00240-9 [pii],"This paper examines a perspective on the use of newly engineered nanomaterials as effective and safe carriers of genes for the therapy of cancer. Three different groups of cationic dendrimers (PAMAM, phosphorus and carbosilane) were complexed with anticancer siRNA and their biophysical properties of the dendriplexes analyzed. The potential of the dendrimers as nanocarriers for anticancer siBcl-xl, siBcl-2, siMcl-1 siRNAs and a siScrambled sequence was explored. Dendrimer/siRNA complexes were characterized by methods including fluorescence, zeta potential, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism, gel electrophoresis and transmission electron microscopy. Some of the experiments were done with heparin to check if siRNA can be easily disassociated from the complexes, and whether released siRNA maintains its structure after interaction with the dendrimer. The results indicate that siRNAs form complexes with all the dendrimers tested. Oligoribonucleotide duplexes can be released from dendriplexes after heparin treatment and the structure of siRNA is maintained in the case of PAMAM or carbosilane dendrimers. The dendrimers were also effective in protecting siRNA from RNase A activity. The selection of the best siRNA carrier will be made based on cell culture studies (Part B).","['Ionov, Maksim', 'Lazniewska, Joanna', 'Dzmitruk, Volha', 'Halets, Inessa', 'Loznikova, Svetlana', 'Novopashina, Darya', 'Apartsin, Evgeny', 'Krasheninina, Olga', 'Venyaminova, Alya', 'Milowska, Katarzyna', 'Nowacka, Olga', 'Gomez-Ramirez, Rafael', 'de la Mata, Francisco Javier', 'Majoral, Jean-Pierre', 'Shcharbin, Dzmitry', 'Bryszewska, Maria']","['Ionov M', 'Lazniewska J', 'Dzmitruk V', 'Halets I', 'Loznikova S', 'Novopashina D', 'Apartsin E', 'Krasheninina O', 'Venyaminova A', 'Milowska K', 'Nowacka O', 'Gomez-Ramirez R', 'de la Mata FJ', 'Majoral JP', 'Shcharbin D', 'Bryszewska M']","['Department of General Biophysics, Faculty of Biology and Environmental Protection, University of Lodz, Poland.

Here, we assessed the BM microenvironment of AML patients and demonstrate that the leukemia stem cells induce a change in the transcriptional programming of the normal mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC). The modified leukemic niche alters the expressions of cross-talk molecules (i.e., CXCL12 and JAG1) in MSCs to provide a distinct cross-talk between normal and leukemia cells, selectively suppressing normal primitive hematopoietic cells while supporting leukemogenesis and chemoresistance. Of note, AML patients exhibited distinct heterogeneity in the alteration of mesenchymal stroma in BM. The distinct pattern of stromal changes in leukemic BM at initial diagnosis was associated with a heterogeneous posttreatment clinical course with respect to the maintenance of complete remission for 5 to 8 years and early or late relapse. Thus, remodeling of mesenchymal niche by leukemia cells is an intrinsic self-reinforcing process of leukemogenesis that can be a parameter for the heterogeneity in the clinical course of leukemia and hence serve as a potential prognostic factor.","['Kim, Jin-A', 'Shim, Jae-Seung', 'Lee, Ga-Young', 'Yim, Hyeon Woo', 'Kim, Tae-Min', 'Kim, Myungshin', 'Leem, Sun-Hee', 'Lee, Jong-Wook', 'Min, Chang-Ki', 'Oh, Il-Hoan']","['Kim JA', 'Shim JS', 'Lee GY', 'Yim HW', 'Kim TM', 'Kim M', 'Leem SH', 'Lee JW', 'Min CK', 'Oh IH']","['Catholic High-Performance Cell Therapy Center, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

Patients were diagnosed between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2009, >66 years, and continuously enrolled in Medicare Part A and B in the year prior to diagnosis. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression assessed overall survival by treatment. There were 3327 (40 %) patients who received chemotherapy within 3 months of diagnosis. Treated patients were more likely younger, male, and married, and less likely to have secondary AML and poor performance indicators and comorbidity score compared to untreated patients. In multivariate survival analysis, treated patients exhibited a significant 33 % lower risk of death compared to untreated patients. Significant survival benefits were noted with receipt of intensive and hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapies compared to no therapy.

We have previously shown that NPM-RAR is a binding partner of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor type-I-associated DEATH domain protein, TRADD. Binding of TNF to its receptor, TNF-R, induces recruitment of TRADD, and subsequent recruitment of a cascade of proteins that ultimate activate caspase 3, nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). We have previously shown that NPM-RAR interaction with TRADD blocks TNF activation of caspase 3, caspase 8, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage and, ultimately, apoptosis. We now report that NPM-RAR expression is permissive for TNF activation of NFkappaB and JNK. We propose that inhibition of TNF activation of apoptosis, while preserving TNF activation of NFkappaB and JNK pathways that stimulate cell growth and survival, represents a novel mechanism through which NPM-RAR contributes to development of the leukemic phenotype.","['Chattopadhyay, Anuja', 'Abecassis, Irina', 'Redner, Robert L']","['Chattopadhyay A', 'Abecassis I', 'Redner RL']","['Department of Medicine and University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh PA 15213 USA.', 'Department of Medicine and University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh PA 15213 USA.', 'Department of Medicine and University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh PA 15213 USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NPM-RARalpha protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Transport', 'TNF Receptor-Associated Death Domain Protein/*metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",2015/03/21 06:00,2016/09/22 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/22 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3109/10428194.2015.1023799 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2015;56(12):3401-3406. doi: 10.3109/10428194.2015.1023799.

Here, we aim to comprehensively characterize the mechanisms associated with its cytotoxicity in the human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. We focused at studying the involvement of apoptotic pathway and cell cycle effects. 5'-Br significantly inhibited proliferation by inducing caspase-dependent apoptosis. Involvement of caspase independent mechanism is also possible due to observed inability of z-VAD-FMK to rescue apoptotic cells. 5'-Br was found to trigger intrinsic apoptotic pathway as indicated by depolarization of the mitochondrial inner membrane, decreased level of cellular ATP, modulated expression and phosphorylation of Bcl-2 leading to loss of its association with Bax, and increased release of cytochrome c. 5'-Br treated cells were found arrested at G0/G1 phase with modulation in protein levels of cyclins, dependent kinases and their inhibitors. Expression and enzymatic activity of CDK2 and CDK4 was found inhibited. Retinoblastoma protein (Rb) phosphorylation was also inhibited whereas p21 protein levels were increased. These results suggest that the antiproliferative mechanisms of action of 5'-Br could involve apoptotic pathways, dysregulation of mitochondrial functions and disruption of cell cycle checkpoint.","['Saleh, Ayman M', 'El-Abadelah, Mustafa M', 'Aziz, Mohammad Azhar', 'Taha, Mutasem O', 'Nasr, Amre', 'Rizvi, Syed A A']","['Saleh AM', 'El-Abadelah MM', 'Aziz MA', 'Taha MO', 'Nasr A', 'Rizvi SA']","['Department of Basic Medical Sciences, College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences (KSAU-HS), National Guard Health Affairs, P.O.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Studies published in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Controlled Trial Register were searched till June 2014 using the search terms 'MDM2', 'polymorphism' and 'leukemia'. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included in this meta-analysis, with a total of 2,478 patients accrued. There were 8 studies providing data on single nucleotide polymorphism at position 309 (SNP309) and risk of leukemia and 7 studies providing data on SNP309 and overall survival. Our analysis showed that patients having G/G mutations had a significantly higher risk of developing leukemia (HR 1.90, 95% CI 1.56-2.31, p < 0.00001), while the association between G/T and leukemia was not significant (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.96-1.45, p = 0.11). In addition, SNP309 was not significantly associated with patient survival (HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.79-2.13, p = 0.31).

METHODS: This retrospective chart review analyzes all immunosuppressed patients diagnosed with any stage NMSC at an academic tertiary care institution from 2006-2011. RESULTS: Thirty four patients are analyzed. Odds of mortality is significantly increased for patients who required multiple surgeries (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)=23.98, 95%CI=(1.411, 407.599)) and those who were immunocompromised secondary to leukemia (aOR=28.27, 95%CI=(1.838, 434.73)). CONCLUSION: Patients with leukemia and NMSC may have an increased risk of mortality compared to other immunocompromised patients with NMSC. Immunocompromised patients with NMSC may have a worse prognosis if multiple surgeries are required.

This study aimed to explore the association of tubal pregnancy with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) expression in oviduct tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed to probe the differential expression of LIF and LIFR in oviduct tissues among a control group (including NP group, n = 11; and IP group, n = 12), tubal pregnancy group (Ect-N group, n = 31; and Ect-A group, n = 40), and chronically inflamed group (including Inf-S group, n = 11; and Inf-P group, n = 9), followed by semiquantitative analysis. RESULTS: Semiquantitative immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that there was no significant difference in LIF expression in either the epithelial or stromal cells of oviduct tissues between the tubal pregnancy group and the control group (P < 0.05). However, LIF expression was remarkably elevated in the Inf-S and Inf-P group compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). In the epithelial cells of the fallopian tubes, LIFR expression was highest in the chronically inflamed group, followed by the tubal pregnancy group, outnumbering the control group (P < 0.05). More interestingly, an opposite expression trend of LIFR was observed in the stromal cells of the fallopian tubes among these groups (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: Aberratn expression of LIF and LIFR might be associated with the occurrence of tubal pregnancy.","['Li, Yong', 'Sun, Lizhou', 'Zhao, Denmei', 'Ouyang, Jun', 'Xiang, Mei']","['Li Y', 'Sun L', 'Zhao D', 'Ouyang J', 'Xiang M']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Turkey,Turk J Med Sci,Turkish journal of medical sciences,9441758,"['0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Fallopian Tubes/chemistry/cytology/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/analysis/*metabolism', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, Tubal/*metabolism', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF/analysis/*metabolism', 'Salpingitis/metabolism']",2015/03/21 06:00,2015/04/29 06:00,['2015/03/21 06:00'],"['2015/03/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/21 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/04/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3906/sag-1307-103 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Med Sci. 2015;45(1):214-20. doi: 10.3906/sag-1307-103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we use deep whole-exome sequencing to describe the clonal architecture and evolution of 20 pediatric B-acute lymphoblastic leukaemias from diagnosis to relapse. We show that clonal diversity is comparable at diagnosis and relapse and clonal survival from diagnosis to relapse is not associated with mutation burden. Six pathways were frequently mutated, with NT5C2, CREBBP, WHSC1, TP53, USH2A, NRAS and IKZF1 mutations enriched at relapse. Half of the leukaemias had multiple subclonal mutations in a pathway or gene at diagnosis, but mostly with only one, usually minor clone, surviving therapy to acquire additional mutations and become the relapse founder clone. Relapse-specific mutations in NT5C2 were found in nine cases, with mutations in four cases being in descendants of the relapse founder clone. These results provide important insights into the genetic basis of treatment failure in ALL and have implications for the early detection of mutations driving relapse.","['Ma, Xiaotu', 'Edmonson,

We used prescriptions of antibiotics from Danish pharmacies as a proxy measure for the occurrence of infections. PROCEDURE: We investigated the association between exposure to antibiotics, from conception to leukaemia diagnosis, and the risk of leukaemia. Incident cases of leukaemia among children in Denmark, 1995-2008, with mothers having their earliest conception date in 1995, were individually matched to population controls by age, sex and municipality. Conditional logistic regression analyses assessed antibiotic redemptions in different time periods from conception up to 6 months before the diagnoses of all leukaemia types, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia [ALL] and ALL in 2- to 5-year-old children, adjusting for several potential confounders. RESULTS: A total of 120/360 (33.3%) leukaemia mothers and 1,081/3,509 (30.8%) control mothers redeemed antibiotics during pregnancy (P = 0.32). For children, the equivalent numbers were 276 (76.7%) and 2,665 (75.9%) (P = 0.76). Histograms of antibiotic redemptions showed no temporal differences between leukaemia mothers/children and controls, which was confirmed in adjusted regression analyses (OR [95% CI]: 1.02 [0.75-1.38]). Only antibiotics redeemed during the first year after birth differed from this (OR [95% CI] for ALL diagnosed in 2- to 5-year-old children: 0.46 [0.31-0.66]). CONCLUSIONS: In this hypothesis generating study, the similar amount and pattern of antibiotic redemptions in children with and without leukaemia indicate that infections play a minor role in the aetiology of childhood leukaemia. However, less antibiotic redemptions during the first year of life conform to Greaves' 'delayed infection hypothesis'.","['Gradel, Kim Oren', 'Kaerlev, Linda']","['Gradel KO', 'Kaerlev L']","['Research Unit of Clinical Epidemiology, Institute of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Research Unit of Clinical Epidemiology, Institute of Clinical Research, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark.', 'Center for Clinical Epidemiology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/*complications/drug therapy', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mothers', 'Pregnancy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/20 06:00,2015/09/24 06:00,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25477 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Jul;62(7):1155-61. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25477.

In mammary carcinoma, KLF4/5 can each impact the malignant phenotype, but potential linkages to drug resistance remain unclear. In primary human breast cancers, we observed a positive correlation between KLF4/5 transcript abundance, particularly in the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched subtype. Furthermore, KLF4/5 protein was rapidly upregulated in human breast cancer cells following treatment with the HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, lapatinib. In addition, we observed a positive correlation between these factors in the primary tumors of genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). In particular, the levels of both factors were enriched in the basal-like tumors of the C3(1) TAg (SV40 large T antigen transgenic mice under control of the C3(1)/prostatein promoter) GEMM. Using tumor cells derived from this model as well as human breast cancer cells, suppression of KLF4 and/or KLF5 sensitized HER2-overexpressing cells to lapatinib. Indicating cooperativity, greater effects were observed when both genes were depleted. KLF4/5-deficient cells had reduced basal mRNA and protein levels of the anti-apoptotic factors myeloid cell leukemia 1 (MCL1) and B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-XL). Moreover, MCL1 was upregulated by lapatinib in a KLF4/5-dependent manner, and enforced expression of MCL1 in KLF4/5-deficient cells restored drug resistance. In addition, combined suppression of KLF4/5 in cultured tumor cells additively inhibited anchorage-independent growth, resistance to anoikis and tumor formation in immunocompromised mice. Consistent with their cooperative role in drug resistance and other malignant properties, KLF4/5 levels selectively stratified human HER2-enriched breast cancer by distant metastasis-free survival. These results identify KLF4 and KLF5 as cooperating protumorigenic factors and critical participants in resistance to lapatinib, furthering the rationale for combining anti-MCL1/BCL-XL inhibitors with conventional HER2-targeted therapies.","['Farrugia, M K', 'Sharma, S B', 'Lin, C-C', 'McLaughlin, S L', 'Vanderbilt, D B', 'Ammer, A G', 'Salkeni, M A', 'Stoilov, P', 'Agazie, Y M', 'Creighton, C J', 'Ruppert, J M']","['Farrugia MK', 'Sharma SB', 'Lin CC', 'McLaughlin SL', 'Vanderbilt DB', 'Ammer AG', 'Salkeni MA', 'Stoilov P', 'Agazie YM', 'Creighton CJ', 'Ruppert JM']","['1] Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA [2] Program in Cancer Cell Biology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA [2] Program in Cancer Cell Biology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA [2] The Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', 'The Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA [2] Program in Cancer Cell Biology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', 'The Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', '1] The Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA [2] Department of Medicine, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA [2] Program in Cancer Cell Biology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA [3] The Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA [2] Program in Cancer Cell Biology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA [3] The Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.', 'Department of Medicine and Dan L Duncan Cancer Center, Division of Biostatistics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', '1] Department of Biochemistry, West Virginia University Health Sciences Center, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA [2] Program in Cancer Cell Biology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA [3] The Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Center, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV 26506, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (KLF5 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0VUA21238F (Lapatinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ERBB2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Lapatinib', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Quinazolines/administration & dosage', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2015/03/20 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/12 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/10 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']","['cddis201565 [pii]', '10.1038/cddis.2015.65 [doi]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2015 Mar 19;6:e1699. doi: 10.1038/cddis.2015.65.,20150319,PMC4385942,,,,,,"['P20 RR016440/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'S10RR026378/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA125123/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 RR032138/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 RR016477/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20GM103434/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30GM103488/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR026378/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'S10 RR020866/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM103434/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 GM103488/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 RR032138/GM103488/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA127405/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR020866/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like stem cells in other tissues, hematopoietic stem cells are defined by their ability to self-renew, in order to maintain the stem cell population for the lifetime of the organism, and to differentiate, in order to give rise to the multiple lineages of the hematopoietic system. In recent years, increasing evidence has suggested a role for the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage in the decision for hematopoietic stem cells to exit quiescence and to differentiate. In this review, we will examine recent work supporting the idea that detection of cell stressors, such as oxidative and genetic damage, is an important mediator of cell fate decisions in hematopoietic stem cells. We will explore the benefits of such a system in avoiding the development and progression of malignancies, and in avoiding tissue exhaustion and failure. Additionally, we will discuss new work that examines the accumulation of DNA damage and replication stress in aging hematopoietic stem cells and causes us to rethink ideas of genoprotection in the bone marrow niche.","['Weiss, Cary N', 'Ito, Keisuke']","['Weiss CN', 'Ito K']","['Ruth L. and David S.

The SNF2 family comprises helicase-like ATPases, originally discovered in yeast, that can remodel chromatin by changing chromatin structure and composition. The human genome encodes 30 different SNF2 enzymes. SNF2 family enzymes are often part of multisubunit chromatin remodeling complexes (CRCs), which consist of noncatalytic/auxiliary subunit along with the ATPase subunit. However, blood cells express a limited set of SNF2 ATPases that are necessary to maintain the pool of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and drive normal blood cell development and differentiation. The composition of CRCs can be altered by the association of specific auxiliary subunits. Several auxiliary CRC subunits have specific functions in hematopoiesis. Aberrant expressions of SNF2 ATPases and/or auxiliary CRC subunit(s) are often observed in hematological malignancies. Using large-scale data from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) we observed frequent mutations in genes encoding SNF2 helicase-like enzymes and auxiliary CRC subunits in leukemia. Hence, orderly function of SNF2 family enzymes is crucial for the execution of normal blood cell developmental program, and defects in chromatin remodeling caused by mutations or aberrant expression of these proteins may contribute to leukemogenesis.","['Prasad, Punit', 'Lennartsson, Andreas', 'Ekwall, Karl']","['Prasad P', 'Lennartsson A', 'Ekwall K']","['Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, 141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, 141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.', 'Department of Biosciences and Nutrition, Karolinska Institute, 141 57 Huddinge, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Blood Cells/*pathology', 'Carcinogenesis/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/*pathology', 'Nucleosomes/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2015/03/20 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2015/347571 [doi]'],ppublish,Biomed Res Int. 2015;2015:347571. doi: 10.1155/2015/347571.

METHODS: Forty young adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, at the beginning of maintenance course of their chemotherapy, were eligible for this study. The study population was randomized in a double blind manner to receive either taurine or placebo (2 gram per day orally). Life quality and side effects including febrile episodes were assessed using questionnaire. Data were analyzed using Pearson's Chi square test. RESULTS: Of total forty participants, 43.8% were female and 56.3 % were male. The mean age was 19.16+/-1.95 years (ranges: 16-23 years). The results indicated that the levels of white blood cells are significantly (P<0.05) increased in taurine treated group. There was no elevation in blasts count. A total of 70 febrile episodes were observed during study, febrile episodes were significantly (P<0.05) lower in taurine patients in comparison to the control ones. CONCLUSION: The overall incidence of febrile episodes and infectious complications in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients receiving taurine was lower than placebo group. Taurine's ability to increase leukocyte count may result in lower febrile episodes.","['Islambulchilar, Mina', 'Asvadi, Iraj', 'Sanaat, Zohreh', 'Esfahani, Ali', 'Sattari, Mohammadreza']","['Islambulchilar M', 'Asvadi I', 'Sanaat Z', 'Esfahani A', 'Sattari M']","[""Students' Research Committee and Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran."", 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. ; Neurosciences Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. ; Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Adv Pharm Bull,Advanced pharmaceutical bulletin,101578021,,,,2015/03/20 06:00,2015/03/20 06:01,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/05/18 00:00 [received]', '2014/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2014/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/20 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5681/apb.2015.014 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Pharm Bull. 2015 Mar;5(1):103-8. doi: 10.5681/apb.2015.014.

Over the past four decades, research has advanced the treatment of this cancer from a less than 60% chance of survival to over 85% today. The causal molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we performed sequencing-based genomic DNA methylation profiling of eight paediatric ALL patients using archived bone marrow smear microscope slides. FINDINGS: SOLiD sequencing data was collected from Methyl-Binding Domain (MBD) enriched fractions of genomic DNA. The primary tumour and remission bone marrow sample was analysed from eight patients. Four patients relapsed and the relapsed tumour was analysed. Input and MBD-enriched DNA from each sample was sequenced, aligned to the hg19 reference genome and analysed for enrichment peaks using MACS (Model-based Analysis for ChIP-Seq) and HOMER (Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment). In total, 3.67 gigabases (Gb) were sequenced, 2.74 Gb were aligned to the reference genome (average 74.66% alignment efficiency). This dataset enables the interrogation of differential DNA methylation associated with paediatric ALL. Preliminary results reveal concordant regions of enrichment indicative of a DNA methylation signature. CONCLUSION: Our dataset represents one of the first SOLiDMBD-Seq studies performed on paediatric ALL and is the first to utilise archival bone marrow smears. Differential DNA methylation between cancer and equivalent disease-free tissue can be identified and correlated with existing and published genomic studies. Given the rarity of paediatric haematopoietic malignancies, relative to adult counterparts, our demonstration of the utility of archived bone marrow smear samples to high-throughput methylation sequencing approaches offers tremendous potential to explore the role of DNA methylation in the aetiology of cancer.","['Wong, Nicholas Cl', 'Meredith, Gavin D', 'Marnellos, George', 'Dudas, Miroslav', 'Parkinson-Bates, Mandy', 'Halemba, Minhee Suh', 'Chatterton, Zac', 'Maksimovic, Jovana', 'Ashley, David M', 'Mechinaud, Francoise', 'Craig, Jeffrey M', 'Saffery, Richard']","['Wong NC', 'Meredith GD', 'Marnellos G', 'Dudas M', 'Parkinson-Bates M', 'Halemba MS', 'Chatterton Z', 'Maksimovic J', 'Ashley DM', 'Mechinaud F', 'Craig JM', 'Saffery R']","[""Cancer and Disease Epigenetics Research Group, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, 3052 Victoria Australia ; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne, Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, 3052 Victoria Australia ; Translational Genomics and Epigenomics Research Group, Ludwig Cancer Research, Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre, Austin Hospital, Burgundy Street, Heidelberg, 3084 Victoria Australia ; Pacific Edge Limted, 84 St David Street, Dunedin 9016, New Zealand."", 'Life Technologies, Carlsbad, 92008 CA USA.', 'Life Technologies, Carlsbad, 92008 CA USA ; Current Address: Science Division Informatics Group, Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Harvard University, MA 02138, Cambridge USA.', 'Life Technologies, Carlsbad, 92008 CA USA.', ""Cancer and Disease Epigenetics Research Group, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, 3052 Victoria Australia."", ""Cancer and Disease Epigenetics Research Group, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, 3052 Victoria Australia."", ""Cancer and Disease Epigenetics Research Group, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, 3052 Victoria Australia."", ""Bioinformatics Group, Quantitative Sciences Core, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, 92008, Parkville, 3052 Victoria Australia."", 'Andrew Love Cancer Centre, Deakin Universit, Swanston Street, Geelong, 3220 Victoria Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Centre, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, 3052 Victoria Australia."", ""Early Life Epigenetics Research Group, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, 3052 Victoria Australia ; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne, Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, 3052 Victoria Australia."", ""Cancer and Disease Epigenetics Research Group, Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, Royal Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, 3052 Victoria Australia ; Department of Paediatrics, The University of Melbourne, Children's Hospital, Flemington Road, Parkville, 3052 Victoria Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gigascience,GigaScience,101596872,,IM,"['Bone Marrow', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', '*DNA Methylation', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/methods']",2015/03/20 06:00,2015/03/20 06:01,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/01/26 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13742-015-0050-0 [doi]', '50 [pii]']",epublish,Gigascience. 2015 Mar 18;4:11. doi: 10.1186/s13742-015-0050-0. eCollection 2015.,20150318,PMC4364676,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood leukaemia', 'DNA methylation', 'Epigenetics', 'NGS', 'SOLiD MBD-Seq']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20150319']

The CNAs have been reported to be associated with various diseases and cancers including acute myeloid leukemia. However, there are multiple challenges to the use of current CNA detection tools that lead to high false-positive rates and thus impede widespread use of such tools in cancer research. In this paper, we discuss these issues and propose possible solutions. First, since the entire genome cannot be mapped due to some regions lacking sequence uniqueness, current methods cannot be appropriately adjusted to handle these regions in the analyses. Thus, detection of medium-sized CNAs is also being directly affected by these mappability problems. The requirement for matching control samples is also an important limitation because acquiring matching controls might not be possible or might not be cost efficient. Here we present an approach that addresses these issues and detects medium-sized CNAs in cancer genomes by (1) masking unmappable regions during the initial CNA detection phase, (2) using pool of a few normal samples as control, and (3) employing median filtering to adjust CNA ratios to its surrounding coverage and eliminate false positives.","['Ozer, Hatice Gulcin', 'Usubalieva, Aisulu', 'Dorrance, Adrienne', 'Yilmaz, Ayse Selen', 'Caligiuri, Michael', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Huang, Kun']","['Ozer HG', 'Usubalieva A', 'Dorrance A', 'Yilmaz AS', 'Caligiuri M', 'Marcucci G', 'Huang K']","['Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Inform,Cancer informatics,101258149,,,,2014/01/01 00:00,2014/01/01 00:01,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/06/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/29 00:00 [revised]', '2015/01/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2014/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2014/01/01 00:01 [medline]']","['10.4137/CIN.S14023 [doi]', 'cin-suppl.3-2014-105 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Inform. 2015 Mar 5;13(Suppl 3):105-11. doi: 10.4137/CIN.S14023. eCollection 2014.,20150305,PMC4356486,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'copy number alteration (CNA)', 'whole-genome sequencing']",,,,"['P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA140158/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to determine the prognostic significance of Trp catabolism in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We quantified serum Trp and Kyn in 96 ATL patients, 38 human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 asymptomatic carriers (HTLV-1 ACs), and 40 healthy adult volunteer controls. The relationships between various clinical parameters including overall survival were analyzed. IDO expression was evaluated in the affected lymph nodes of ATL patients. RESULTS: Serum Kyn concentrations and Kyn/Trp ratios were significantly higher in HTLV-1 ACs than healthy controls. Both increased significantly with progression from HTLV-1 AC to ATL. However, there were no significant differences in the serum Trp concentrations between ATL patients, HTLV-1 ACs, and controls. IDO was possibly produced by ATL and/or cells of the microenvironment. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that a high serum Kyn/Trp ratio and high Kyn level, but not a high Trp level, were significantly independent detrimental prognostic factors in ATL, as well as in that subset of patients with aggressive variant ATL. CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of serum Kyn and Trp is useful for predicting prognosis of an individual ATL patient. Furthermore, ATL, especially in patients with a high serum Kyn/Trp ratio, is an appropriate disease for testing novel cancer immunotherapies targeting IDO.","['Masaki, Ayako', 'Ishida, Takashi', 'Maeda, Yasuhiro', 'Suzuki, Susumu', 'Ito, Asahi', 'Takino, Hisashi', 'Ogura, Hiroka', 'Totani, Haruhito', 'Yoshida, Takashi', 'Kinoshita, Shiori', 'Narita, Tomoko', 'Ri, Masaki', 'Kusumoto, Shigeru', 'Inagaki, Atsushi', 'Komatsu, Hirokazu', 'Niimi, Akio', 'Ueda, Ryuzo', 'Utsunomiya, Atae', 'Inagaki, Hiroshi', 'Iida, Shinsuke']","['Masaki A', 'Ishida T', 'Maeda Y', 'Suzuki S', 'Ito A', 'Takino H', 'Ogura H', 'Totani H', 'Yoshida T', 'Kinoshita S', 'Narita T', 'Ri M', 'Kusumoto S', 'Inagaki A', 'Komatsu H', 'Niimi A', 'Ueda R', 'Utsunomiya A', 'Inagaki H', 'Iida S']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan.

In this study, we investigated the prognostic outcome of AML patients requiring intensive care treatment due to severe sepsis or septic shock. DESIGN: We present a retrospective cohort study in a medical intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital that serves as a tertiary care center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Here we present data from 44 AML patients of our ICU with 29 requiring invasive mechanical ventilation due to sepsis and compared multiple clinical and laboratory parameters of ICU survivors and non-survivors. RESULTS: Mean age was 59.5 years, the overall mortality rate was 41% (18/44), and the mortality rate among patients who received mechanical ventilation was 55% (16/29). The mortality rate among younger patients (aged 60 years or less) was 17% (3/18), while 58% of the older patients died (15/26). The mortality rate among younger patients who received mechanical ventilation was 23% (3/13) compared with 81% (13/16) of the older patients. The mean invasive ventilation time was 415 h in non-survivors compared with 667 h in survivors. No differences could be identified between survivors and non-survivors, concerning multiple laboratory parameters or AML prognostic and therapeutic parameters; our analysis, however, confirmed a statistically significant difference in the patients' age. CONCLUSIONS: In previous studies, age was one of the most important prognostic factors in AML patients receiving mechanical ventilation due to severe sepsis or septic shock. In spite of improvements in diagnostic and treatment over the last couple of years, our study indicates that this fact still is true. However, the overall outcome has improved over the years due to improvements in intensive care medicine.","['Sippel, Christoph', 'Kim, Young', 'Wallau, Anja', 'Brossart, Peter', 'Schmidt-Wolf, Ingo', 'Walger, Peter']","['Sippel C', 'Kim Y', 'Wallau A', 'Brossart P', 'Schmidt-Wolf I', 'Walger P']","['Johanniter Hospital, Johanniterstrasse 3, 53113, Bonn, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*microbiology/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Respiration, Artificial', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/*etiology/*therapy', 'Shock, Septic/etiology/therapy']",2015/03/20 06:00,2015/12/15 06:00,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2015/01/06 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00432-015-1955-9 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2015 Sep;141(9):1645-51. doi: 10.1007/s00432-015-1955-9.

No significant differences were observed between Germinal Center B (GCB) and non-GCB DLBCL types. GEP data and WB confirmed elevated CK2 mRNA and protein levels as well as active phosphorylation of specific targets in NHL cells. CX-4945 caused a dose-dependent growth-arresting effect on GCB, non-GCB DLBCL and BL cell-lines and it efficiently shut off phosphorylation of NF-kappaB RelA and CDC37 on CK2 target sites. Thus, CK2 is highly expressed and could represent a suitable therapeutic target in BL, FL and DLBCL NHL.","['Pizzi, Marco', 'Piazza, Francesco', 'Agostinelli, Claudio', 'Fuligni, Fabio', 'Benvenuti, Pietro', 'Mandato, Elisa', 'Casellato, Alessandro', 'Rugge, Massimo', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Pileri, Stefano A']","['Pizzi M', 'Piazza F', 'Agostinelli C', 'Fuligni F', 'Benvenuti P', 'Mandato E', 'Casellato A', 'Rugge M', 'Semenzato G', 'Pileri SA']","['Department of Medicine, Surgical Pathology and Cytopathology Unit, DIMED University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology and Clinical Immunology Branch, DIMED University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine (VIMM), Padua, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental, Hematopathology and Hematology Sections, Diagnostic and Specialty Medicine, S.

This pathway is currently under clinical trials with small molecules inhibitors (SMI).To verify whether a multi-inhibition treatment against Akt protein could enhance the efficacy of individual drug administration and overcome drug resistance as well as to obtain a decrease in single drug concentration, we tested on T-ALL cell lines the effects of combined treatments with three Akt inhibitors with different mode of action, GSK690693, MK-2206 and Perifosine.In cells with hyperactivated Akt, combined administration of the drugs displayed a significant synergistic and cytotoxic effect and affected PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway at much lower concentration than single drug use. Highest synergistic effect for full inhibition of Akt was also related to the timing of every drug administration. Furthermore the triple treatment had greater efficacy in inducing cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and both apoptosis and autophagy.Targeting Akt as a key protein of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway with multiple drugs might represent a new and promising pharmacological strategy for treatment of T-ALL patients.","['Cani, Alice', 'Simioni, Carolina', 'Martelli, Alberto M', 'Zauli, Giorgio', 'Tabellini, Giovanna', 'Ultimo, Simona', 'McCubrey, James A', 'Capitani, Silvano', 'Neri, Luca M']","['Cani A', 'Simioni C', 'Martelli AM', 'Zauli G', 'Tabellini G', 'Ultimo S', 'McCubrey JA', 'Capitani S', 'Neri LM']","['Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical and Neuromotor Sciences, University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine, University of Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC, USA.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'LTTA Center, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.', 'Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (GSK690693)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (MK 2206)', '0 (Oxadiazoles)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '107-73-3 (Phosphorylcholine)', '2GWV496552 (perifosine)', 'EC 2.7.1.1 (MTOR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Oxadiazoles/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphorylcholine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/enzymology/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism']",2015/03/20 06:00,2016/01/20 06:00,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/20 06:00 [medline]']","['3260 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.3260 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Mar 30;6(9):6597-610. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.3260.,,PMC4466637,['NOTNLM'],"['Akt', 'GSK690693', 'MK-2206', 'Perifosine', 'T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, we monitored pre-HD-MTX erythrocyte levels of methylated 6MP metabolites (Ery-MeMP) and of thioguanine nucleotides (Ery-6TGN) as well as DNA-incorporated thioguanine nucleotides (DNA-TGN) in circulating leucocytes to identify patients at highest risk of post-HD-MTX myelosuppression. In multiple linear regression analyses of neutrophil and thrombocyte nadir values (adjusted for gender, age, risk group and 6MP dose) after 48 HD-MTX courses in 17 childhood ALL patients on MTX/6MP maintenance therapy, the pre-HD-MTX DNA-TGN levels in neutrophils (P < 0.0001), Ery-MeMP (P < 0.0001) and Ery-6TGN (P = 0.01) levels were significant predictors of post-HD-MTX neutrophil nadirs, whereas Ery-MeMP (P < 0.0001) was the only predictor of post-HD-MTX thrombocyte nadir.

Despite the progress in treatment efficacy of chemotherapy, a poor outcome consequent upon chemoresistance against conventional anti-cancer drugs still remains to be solved. In this study, we report 5-diphenylacetamido-indirubin-3'-oxime (LDD398) as a novel mitochondria-targeting anti-leukemic agent, which is a derivative of indirubin used in traditional medicine. Treatment with LDD398 resulted in caspase activation, cell death, and growth arrest at G2/M phases in leukemia cells. Interestingly, LDD398 quickly collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) within 1 h, accompanied by cytochrome c release into cytosol and severe depletion of cellular ATP. However, the LDD398-induced cellular events was significantly mitigated by blockage of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening with chemical and genetic modifications, strongly supporting that LDD398 executes its anti-leukemic activity via an inappropriate opening of MPTP and a consequent depletion of ATP. The most meaningful finding was the prominent effectiveness of LDD398 on primary leukemia cells and also on malignant leukemia cells resistant to anticancer drugs. Our results demonstrate that, among a series of indirubin derivatives, LDD398 induces leukemia cell death via a different mode from indirubin or conventional chemotherapeutics, and can be employed as a potent anti-cancer agent in the treatment for newly diagnosed and relapsed leukemia.","['Song, Ju Han', 'Lee, Jung-Eun', 'Cho, Kyung-Min', 'Park, Su-Ho', 'Kim, Hyeoung-Joon', 'Kim, Yong-Chul', 'Kim, Tae Sung']","['Song JH', 'Lee JE', 'Cho KM', 'Park SH', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim YC', 'Kim TS']","['Division of Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Genome Research Center for Hematopoietic Diseases, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Hwasun, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Life Science, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Life Sciences, School of Life Sciences and Biotechnology, Korea University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore)', '0 (Oximes)', ""0 (indirubin-3'-monoxime)"", 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Caspases/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Indoles/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Membrane Transport Proteins/drug effects', 'Mitochondrial Permeability Transition Pore', 'Oximes/*pharmacology']",2015/03/20 06:00,2016/09/07 06:00,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/09/03 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/14 00:00 [revised]', '2015/02/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/09/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/mc.22307 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2016 May;55(5):611-21. doi: 10.1002/mc.22307.

An example is the identification of arginine missense mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenases-1 and -2 (IDH1/2) in glioma, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chondrosarcomas, and cholangiocarcinoma. These alterations are closely associated with the production of a new stereospecific metabolite, (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG).

VCD was found to be non-inferior to PAd with respect to VGPR rates (37.0 versus 34.3%, P=0.001). The rates of progressive disease (PD) were 0.4% (VCD) versus 4.8% (PAd; P=0.003). In the PAd arm, 11 of 12 patients with PD had either renal impairment (creatinine 2 mg/dl) at diagnosis or the cytogenetic abnormality gain 1q21, whereas no PD was observed in these subgroups in the VCD arm. Leukocytopenia/neutropenia (3 degrees ) occurred more frequently in the VCD arm (35.2% versus 11.3%, P<0.001). Neuropathy rates (2 degrees ) were higher in the PAd group (14.9 versus 8.4%, P=0.03). Serious adverse events, both overall and those related to thromboembolic events, were higher in the PAd group (32.7 versus 24.0%, P=0.04 and 2.8 versus 0.4%, P=0.04). Stem cell collection was not impeded by VCD. VCD is as effective as PAd in terms of achieving VGPR rates with fewer PD and has a favorable toxicity profile. Therefore, VCD is preferable to PAd as induction therapy.","['Mai, E K', 'Bertsch, U', 'Durig, J', 'Kunz, C', 'Haenel, M', 'Blau, I W', 'Munder, M', 'Jauch, A', 'Schurich, B', 'Hielscher, T', 'Merz,

However, its efficacy in these settings is limited by thrombocytopenia caused by BCL-XL inhibition. This prompted the generation of the BCL-2-selective inhibitor venetoclax (ABT-199/GDC-0199), which demonstrates robust activity in these cancers but spares platelets. Navitoclax has also been shown to enhance the efficacy of docetaxel in preclinical models of solid tumors, but clinical use of this combination has been limited by neutropenia. We used venetoclax and the BCL-XL-selective inhibitors A-1155463 and A-1331852 to assess the relative contributions of inhibiting BCL-2 or BCL-XL to the efficacy and toxicity of the navitoclax-docetaxel combination. Selective BCL-2 inhibition suppressed granulopoiesis in vitro and in vivo, potentially accounting for the exacerbated neutropenia observed when navitoclax was combined with docetaxel clinically. By contrast, selectively inhibiting BCL-XL did not suppress granulopoiesis but was highly efficacious in combination with docetaxel when tested against a range of solid tumors. Therefore, BCL-XL-selective inhibitors have the potential to enhance the efficacy of docetaxel in solid tumors and avoid the exacerbation of neutropenia observed with navitoclax. These studies demonstrate the translational utility of this toolkit of selective BCL-2 family inhibitors and highlight their potential as improved cancer therapeutics.","['Leverson, Joel D', 'Phillips, Darren C', 'Mitten, Michael J', 'Boghaert, Erwin R', 'Diaz, Dolores', 'Tahir, Stephen K', 'Belmont, Lisa D', 'Nimmer, Paul', 'Xiao, Yu', 'Ma, Xiaoju Max', 'Lowes, Kym N', 'Kovar, Peter', 'Chen, Jun', 'Jin, Sha', 'Smith, Morey', 'Xue, John', 'Zhang, Haichao', 'Oleksijew, Anatol', 'Magoc, Terrance J', 'Vaidya, Kedar S', 'Albert, Daniel H', 'Tarrant, Jacqueline M', 'La, Nghi', 'Wang, Le', 'Tao, Zhi-Fu', 'Wendt, Michael D', 'Sampath, Deepak', 'Rosenberg, Saul H', 'Tse, Chris', 'Huang, David C S', 'Fairbrother, Wayne J', 'Elmore, Steven W', 'Souers, Andrew J']","['Leverson JD', 'Phillips DC', 'Mitten MJ', 'Boghaert ER', 'Diaz D', 'Tahir SK', 'Belmont LD', 'Nimmer P', 'Xiao Y', 'Ma XM', 'Lowes KN', 'Kovar P', 'Chen J', 'Jin S', 'Smith M', 'Xue J', 'Zhang H', 'Oleksijew A', 'Magoc TJ', 'Vaidya KS', 'Albert DH', 'Tarrant JM', 'La N', 'Wang L', 'Tao ZF', 'Wendt MD', 'Sampath D', 'Rosenberg SH', 'Tse C', 'Huang DC', 'Fairbrother WJ', 'Elmore SW', 'Souers AJ']","['AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL 60064, USA. joel.leverson@abbvie.com.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, IL 60064, USA.', 'Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.', 'Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia.

While both oncologists and parents report a preference that these children die at home rather than in a hospital, there are limited data exploring this issue in depth. PROCEDURE: We performed a retrospective analysis of national-level data from 1999 to 2011 from the National Center for Health Statistics ""Underlying Cause of Death"" database. Characteristics investigated included sex, race, age, ethnicity, cancer type, geographic location, and population density where the child lived. RESULTS: Of the 2,130 children with a death attributable to neoplasm in 2011, 37.6% (95% CI, 35.5-39.6%) died at home compared to 36.9% (95% CI, 35.0-38.8%) in 1999. In 2011, there were statistically significant racial differences between white, black, and Hispanic children across nearly every age group, with white children consistently most likely to die at home. Children of non-Hispanic origin were significantly more likely to die at home than Hispanic children (40.3% vs. 29.3%, P < 0.001). Children with CNS tumors are more likely to die at home than children with neoplasms as a whole, while children with leukemia are less likely. Statistically significant differences by race and ethnicity persist regardless of cancer type. CONCLUSIONS: There has been no significant change in the rate of children with cancer who die at home over the past decade. Racial and ethnic differences have persisted in end of life care for children with cancer with white non-Hispanic children being most likely to die at home.","['Cawkwell, Philip B', 'Gardner, Sharon L', 'Weitzman, Michael']","['Cawkwell PB', 'Gardner SL', 'Weitzman M']","['Department of Pediatrics, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology; Department of Pediatrics, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Department of Environmental Medicine, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York.', 'Global Institute of Public Health, New York University, New York, New York.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'African Americans', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Ethnicity/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Health Services Accessibility/statistics & numerical data', 'Healthcare Disparities', 'Hispanic or Latino', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Palliative Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Terminal Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'United States', 'Whites']",2015/03/20 06:00,2015/09/12 06:00,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2015/01/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/09/12 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1002/pbc.25479 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2015 Aug;62(8):1403-8. doi: 10.1002/pbc.25479.

Genetic diagnostics has become an essential component in the initial work-up for disease classification, prognostication, and genotype-specific therapies. A major prerequisite for such individualized treatment strategies is a rapid pretherapeutic genetic analysis, which includes screening for the recurrent AML-associated gene fusions as well as mutations in the genes NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA. Some of these molecular markers can be used for monitoring minimal residual disease and therefore provide clinically relevant information. There is an increasing number of promising molecularly targeted therapies in clinical development for distinct genetic AML subgroups. Solid data exist for the combination of all-trans retinoic acid and arsentrioxid in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia; the addition of the immunoconjugate gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO) to induction therapy has been shown to improve outcome in cytogenetic low- and intermediate-risk AML. Furthermore, there are encouraging data on the combination of intensive chemotherapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with AML harboring FLT3 mutations or with core-binding factor AML. Other novel therapeutic approaches address mutations or alterations in epigenetic regulators, such as IDH or DOT1L inhibitors. The comprehensive characterization of the underlying genetic mechanisms is essential for the development of novel target-specific compounds with the aim of improving outcome in AML patients.","['Dohner, K', 'Paschka, P', 'Dohner, H']","['Dohner K', 'Paschka P', 'Dohner H']","['Klinik fur Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinikum Ulm, Albert-Einstein-Allee 23, 89081, Ulm, Deutschland, konstanze.doehner@uniklinik-ulm.de.']",['ger'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Internist (Berl),Der Internist,0264620,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Early Detection of Cancer/methods', 'Genetic Testing/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/*methods', 'Nucleophosmin']",2015/03/20 06:00,2015/12/29 06:00,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/12/29 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00108-014-3596-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Internist (Berl). 2015 Apr;56(4):354-63. doi: 10.1007/s00108-014-3596-5.,,,,,,,,,,Akute myeloische Leukamie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is tremendous diversity of potential Ig transcripts (>1 x 10(12)) as a result of hundreds of germ-line gene segments, random nucleotide incorporation during joining of gene segments into a complete transcript, and the process of somatic hypermutation at individual nucleotides. This recombination and mutation process takes place in the maturing B cell and is responsible for the diversity of potential epitope recognition. Cancers arising from mature B cells are characterized by clonal production of Ig heavy (IGH@) and light chain transcripts, although whether the sequence has undergone somatic hypermutation is dependent on the maturation stage at which the neoplastic clone arose. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults and arises from a mature B cell with either mutated or unmutated IGH@ transcripts, the latter having worse prognosis and the assessment of which is routinely performed in the clinic. Currently, IGHV mutation status is assessed by Sanger sequencing and comparing the transcript to known germ-line genes. In this paper, we demonstrate that complete IGH@ V-D-J sequences can be computed from unselected RNA-seq reads with results equal or superior to the clinical procedure: in the only discordant case, the clinical transcript was out-of-frame. Therefore, a single RNA-seq assay can simultaneously yield gene expression profile, SNP and mutation information, as well as IGHV mutation status, and may one day be performed as a general test to capture multidimensional clinically relevant data in CLL.","['Blachly, James S', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Zhao, Weiqiang', 'Long, Susan', 'Flynn, Joseph', 'Flinn, Ian', 'Jones, Jeffrey', 'Maddocks, Kami', 'Andritsos, Leslie', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'de la Chapelle, Albert', 'Byrd, John C']","['Blachly JS', 'Ruppert AS', 'Zhao W', 'Long S', 'Flynn J', 'Flinn I', 'Jones J', 'Maddocks K', 'Andritsos L', 'Ghia EM', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ', 'de la Chapelle A', 'Byrd JC']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Hematologic Malignancies Research Program, Sarah Cannon Research Institute, Nashville, TN 37203;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92092-0820;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92092-0820;', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92092-0820;', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology, and Medical Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; and Albert.delaChapelle@osumc.edu john.byrd@osumc.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210; College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210 Albert.delaChapelle@osumc.edu john.byrd@osumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/chemistry/genetics', 'Genome', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulins/*chemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/*methods', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Somatic Hypermutation, Immunoglobulin', 'Transcriptome', 'VDJ Recombinases/genetics']",2015/03/20 06:00,2015/06/30 06:00,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/30 06:00 [medline]']","['1503587112 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1503587112 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2015 Apr 7;112(14):4322-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1503587112.

HAM/TSP typifies a chronic progressive spastic paraparesis with neurogenic bladder and minimal sensory signs. The neuropathology of HAM/TSP is concentrated in the thoracic spinal cord and is typically biphasic. Initially, there is a perivascular lymphocytic cuffing and mild parenchymal mononuclear infiltrates. Subsequently, this is replaced by gliosis and scarring.

In the current study, we identified a novel effect of IL-26 on transplant-related obliterative bronchiolitis. Sublethally irradiated NOD/Shi-scidIL2rgamma(null) mice transplanted with human umbilical cord blood (HuCB mice) gradually developed clinical signs of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) such as loss of weight, ruffled fur, and alopecia. Histologically, lung of HuCB mice exhibited obliterative bronchiolitis with increased collagen deposition and predominant infiltration with human IL-26(+)CD26(+)CD4 T cells. Concomitantly, skin manifested fat loss and sclerosis of the reticular dermis in the presence of apoptosis of the basilar keratinocytes, whereas the liver exhibited portal fibrosis and cholestasis. Moreover, although IL-26 is absent from rodents, we showed that IL-26 increased collagen synthesis in fibroblasts and promoted lung fibrosis in a murine GVHD model using IL-26 transgenic mice. In vitro analysis demonstrated a significant increase in IL-26 production by HuCB CD4 T cells following CD26 costimulation, whereas Ig Fc domain fused with the N-terminal of caveolin-1 (Cav-Ig), the ligand for CD26, effectively inhibited production of IL-26. Administration of Cav-Ig before or after onset of GVHD impeded the development of clinical and histologic features of GVHD without interrupting engraftment of donor-derived human cells, with preservation of the graft-versus-leukemia effect. These results therefore provide proof of principle that cGVHD of the lungs is caused in part by IL-26(+)CD26(+)CD4 T cells, and that treatment with Cav-Ig could be beneficial for cGVHD prevention and therapy.","['Ohnuma, Kei', 'Hatano, Ryo', 'Aune, Thomas M', 'Otsuka, Haruna', 'Iwata, Satoshi', 'Dang, Nam H', 'Yamada, Taketo', 'Morimoto, Chikao']","['Ohnuma K', 'Hatano R', 'Aune TM', 'Otsuka H', 'Iwata S', 'Dang NH', 'Yamada T', 'Morimoto C']","['Department of Therapy Development and Innovation for Immune Disorders and Cancers, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan;', 'Department of Therapy Development and Innovation for Immune Disorders and Cancers, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan;', 'Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232;', 'Department of Therapy Development and Innovation for Immune Disorders and Cancers, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan;', 'Department of Therapy Development and Innovation for Immune Disorders and Cancers, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan;', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610; and.', 'Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Therapy Development and Innovation for Immune Disorders and Cancers, Graduate School of Medicine, Juntendo University, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan; morimoto@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CAV1 protein, human)', '0 (Caveolin 1)', '0 (IL26 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dpp4 protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Caveolin 1/genetics/pharmacology', '*Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Dermis/immunology/pathology', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/genetics/*immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukins/genetics/*immunology', 'Lung/*immunology/pathology', 'Lung Diseases/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Knockout', 'NIH 3T3 Cells', 'Receptors, Fc/genetics/immunology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/immunology']",2015/03/20 06:00,2015/06/13 06:00,['2015/03/20 06:00'],"['2014/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/06/13 06:00 [medline]']","['jimmunol.1402785 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1402785 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2015 Apr 15;194(8):3697-712. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1402785.

High IGF1R gene expression was significantly associated with IGHV unmutated (IGHV-UM) status (p<0.0001), high CD38 expression (p<0.0001), trisomy 12 (p<0.0001), and del(11)(q23) (p=0.014).

The absence of B and myeloid cell-related signaling protein expression in these NK cell subsets correlated with promoter DNA hypermethylation. Genome-wide DNA methylation patterns were strikingly similar between HCMV-associated adaptive NK cells and cytotoxic effector T cells but differed from those of canonical NK cells. Functional interrogation demonstrated altered cytokine responsiveness in adaptive NK cells that was linked to reduced expression of the transcription factor PLZF. Furthermore, subsets of adaptive NK cells demonstrated significantly reduced functional responses to activated autologous T cells. The present results uncover a spectrum of epigenetically unique adaptive NK cell subsets that diversify in response to viral infection and have distinct functional capabilities compared to canonical NK cell subsets.","['Schlums, Heinrich', 'Cichocki, Frank', 'Tesi, Bianca', 'Theorell, Jakob', 'Beziat, Vivien', 'Holmes, Tim D', 'Han, Hongya', 'Chiang, Samuel C C', 'Foley, Bree', 'Mattsson, Kristin', 'Larsson, Stella', 'Schaffer, Marie', 'Malmberg, Karl-Johan', 'Ljunggren, Hans-Gustaf', 'Miller, Jeffrey S', 'Bryceson, Yenan T']","['Schlums H', 'Cichocki F', 'Tesi B', 'Theorell J', 'Beziat V', 'Holmes TD', 'Han H', 'Chiang SC', 'Foley B', 'Mattsson K', 'Larsson S', 'Schaffer M', 'Malmberg KJ', 'Ljunggren HG', 'Miller JS', 'Bryceson YT']","['Centre for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden; Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', ""Childhood Cancer Research Unit, Department of Women's and Children's Health, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, 17164 Stockholm, Sweden; Clinical Genetics Unit, Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, and Center for Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Solna, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden."", 'Centre for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation, Department of Medicine, University of Minnesota Cancer Center, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.', 'Centre for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology and Transfusion Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Centre for Infectious Medicine, Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, 14186 Stockholm, Sweden; K.G.

This often occurs through mutation of the genes encoding RAS and RAF proteins which are involved in signal transduction in this pathway. BRAF is one of three RAF kinases which act as downstream effectors of growth factor signaling leading to cell cycle progression, proliferation, and survival. Initially reported as a point mutation (V600E) in the majority of metastatic melanomas, other alterations in the BRAF gene have now been reported in a variety of human cancers including papillary thyroid cancer, colon carcinomas, hairy cell leukemia, and more recently in gliomas. The identification of oncogenic mutations in the BRAF gene have led to a revolution in the treatment of metastatic melanoma using targeted molecular therapies that affect the MAPK pathway either directly through BRAF inhibition or downstream through inhibition of MEK. This review describes the molecular biology of BRAF in the context of pediatric low-grade gliomas, the role of BRAF as a diagnostic marker, the prognostic implications of BRAF, and evidence for therapeutic targeting of BRAF.","['Penman, Catherine Louise', 'Faulkner, Claire', 'Lowis, Stephen P', 'Kurian, Kathreena M']","['Penman CL', 'Faulkner C', 'Lowis SP', 'Kurian KM']","['Brain Tumour Research Group, Institute of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Bristol , Bristol , UK.', 'Bristol Genetics Laboratory, Pathology Sciences Southmead Hospital, Westbury on Trym , Bristol , UK.', 'Department of Paediatric Oncology, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Upper Maudlin Street , Bristol , UK.', 'Brain Tumour Research Group, Institute of Clinical Neurosciences, University of Bristol , Bristol , UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,2015/03/19 06:00,2015/03/19 06:01,['2015/03/19 06:00'],"['2014/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2015/02/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/03/19 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2015.00054 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2015 Mar 3;5:54. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2015.00054. eCollection 2015.,20150303,PMC4347423,['NOTNLM'],"['BRAF', 'brain tumor', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'glioma', 'prognostic biomarker', 'therapeutic targeting']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we identify Hairy and Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1), a transcriptional repressor controlled by NOTCH1, as a critical mediator of NOTCH1-induced leukemogenesis strictly required for tumor cell survival. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that HES1 directly downregulates the expression of BBC3, the gene encoding the PUMA BH3-only proapoptotic factor in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Finally, we identify perhexiline, a small-molecule inhibitor of mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, as a HES1-signature antagonist drug with robust antileukemic activity against NOTCH1-induced leukemias in vitro and in vivo.","['Schnell, Stephanie A', 'Ambesi-Impiombato, Alberto', 'Sanchez-Martin, Marta', 'Belver, Laura', 'Xu, Luyao', 'Qin, Yue', 'Kageyama, Ryoichiro', 'Ferrando, Adolfo A']","['Schnell SA', 'Ambesi-Impiombato A', 'Sanchez-Martin M', 'Belver L', 'Xu L', 'Qin Y', 'Kageyama R', 'Ferrando AA']","['Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY;', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY;', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY;', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY;', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY;', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY;', 'Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; and.', 'Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY; Department of Pathology and Department of Pediatrics, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Transcription Factor HES-1)', '149348-15-2 (HES1 protein, human)', 'KU65374X44 (Perhexiline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Gene Silencing', 'Gene Targeting/*methods', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Microarray Analysis', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Perhexiline/therapeutic use', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/*therapy', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics', 'Transcription Factor HES-1']",2015/03/19 06:00,2015/08/04 06:00,['2015/03/19 06:00'],"['2014/10/27 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/08/04 06:00 [medline]']","['S0006-4971(20)31742-0 [pii]', '10.1182/blood-2014-10-608448 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2015 Apr 30;125(18):2806-14. doi: 10.1182/blood-2014-10-608448.

Addiction to MYC is a consequence of both cell-autonomous mechanisms, such as proliferative arrest, cellular senescence, and apoptosis, as well as non-cell autonomous mechanisms, such as shutdown of angiogenesis, and recruitment of immune effectors. Here, we show, using transgenic mouse models of MYC-induced T-ALL, that the loss of either p19ARF or p53 abrogates the ability of MYC inactivation to induce sustained tumor regression. Loss of p53 or p19ARF, influenced the ability of MYC inactivation to elicit the shutdown of angiogenesis; however the loss of p19ARF, but not p53, impeded cellular senescence, as measured by SA-beta-galactosidase staining, increased expression of p16INK4A, and specific histone modifications. Moreover, comparative gene expression analysis suggested that a multitude of genes involved in the innate immune response were expressed in p19ARF wild-type, but not null, tumors upon MYC inactivation. Indeed, the loss of p19ARF, but not p53, impeded the in situ recruitment of macrophages to the tumor microenvironment. Finally, p19ARF null-associated gene signature prognosticated relapse-free survival in human patients with ALL. Therefore, p19ARF appears to be important to regulating cellular senescence and innate immune response that may contribute to the therapeutic response of ALL.","['Yetil, Alper', 'Anchang, Benedict', 'Gouw, Arvin M', 'Adam, Stacey J', 'Zabuawala, Tahera', 'Parameswaran, Ramya', 'van Riggelen, Jan', 'Plevritis, Sylvia', 'Felsher, Dean W']","['Yetil A', 'Anchang B', 'Gouw AM', 'Adam SJ', 'Zabuawala T', 'Parameswaran R', 'van Riggelen J', 'Plevritis S', 'Felsher DW']","['Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Molecular Imaging Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Molecular Imaging Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Molecular Imaging Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Molecular Imaging Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Molecular Imaging Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Molecular Imaging Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Department of Radiology, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.', 'Division of Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Molecular Imaging Program, Stanford University, Stanford, California, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Cdkn2a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cellular Senescence/genetics/immunology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/*genetics/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Silencing', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/*immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics/immunology']",2015/03/19 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2015/03/19 06:00'],"['2014/11/04 00:00 [received]', '2014/12/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['2969 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2969 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 28;6(6):3563-77. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2969.,,PMC4414137,,,,,,"['R01 CA170378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA034233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA188383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA089305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA196585/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA089305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U54 CA149145/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The secondary purpose was to determine if patients' knowledge about their diagnosis, treatment, and risk for future adverse events improved with the SCP. METHODS: Sixty-seven English-speaking women older than age 18 years with stage I-III breast cancer were enrolled at their postoperative appointment. The participants' treatment was tracked through the electronic medical record; SCPs were generated based on information abstracted from the records. After treatment completion, participants received an SCP during a routine follow-up appointment. Knowledge of tumor, treatments, adverse events, and screening recommendations were assessed before receiving the SCP and 2 months later. Accuracy at baseline and follow-up were compared using the McNemar test. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine visits were screened to identify 75 eligible participants. Seventy-five eligible participants (100%) agreed to enroll, and 71 (95%) were given an SCP. Participants were more accurate in reporting details about their history, screening recommendations, and potential adverse events at follow-up than they were at baseline for most measures, but the only statistically significant changes were found with stage (P = .0016) and increased risk of leukemia (P = .0348). CONCLUSION: It is feasible to identify and deliver SCPs to women with breast cancer who are approached during the postoperative visit in a surgical clinic. Additionally, SCPs seem to improve patient knowledge in several areas.","['Bulloch, Kaleigh J', 'Irwin, Melinda L', 'Chagpar, Anees B', 'Pusztai, Lajos', 'Killelea, Brigid K', 'Horowitz, Nina R', 'Hofstatter, Erin W', 'Abu-Khalaf, Maysa M', 'DiGiovanna, Michael', 'Chung, Gina G', 'Sanft, Tara B']","['Bulloch KJ', 'Irwin ML', 'Chagpar AB', 'Pusztai L', 'Killelea BK', 'Horowitz NR', 'Hofstatter EW', 'Abu-Khalaf MM', 'DiGiovanna M', 'Chung GG', 'Sanft TB']","['Yale University School of Public Health; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale University School of Public Health; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale University School of Public Health; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale University School of Public Health; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale University School of Public Health; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale University School of Public Health; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale University School of Public Health; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale University School of Public Health; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale University School of Public Health; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale University School of Public Health; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Yale University School of Public Health; and Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT tara.sanft@yale.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Oncol Pract,Journal of oncology practice,101261852,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis/therapy', '*Continuity of Patient Care', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Care Planning/*statistics & numerical data', 'Postoperative Period', '*Survivors']",2015/03/19 06:00,2016/02/09 06:00,['2015/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/09 06:00 [medline]']","['11/2/e170 [pii]', '10.1200/JOP.2015.005173 [doi]']",ppublish,J Oncol Pract. 2015 Mar;11(2):e170-6. doi: 10.1200/JOP.2015.005173.,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2015 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.'],,,,['J Oncol Pract. 2015 May;11(3):265.

A third cyclo[DKP-RGD]-PTX conjugate with a nonpeptide ""uncleavable"" linker (8) was also synthesized to be tested as a negative control. These three SMDCs were able to inhibit biotinylated vitronectin binding to the purified alphaVbeta3-integrin receptor at nanomolar concentrations and showed good stability at pH 7.4 and pH 5.5. Cleavage of the two peptide linkers was observed in the presence of lysosomal enzymes, whereas conjugate 8, which possesses a nonpeptide ""uncleavable"" linker, remained intact under these conditions. The antiproliferative activities of the conjugates were evaluated against two isogenic cell lines expressing the integrin receptor at different levels: the acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line CCRF-CEM (alphaVbeta3-) and its subclone CCRF-CEM alphaVbeta3 (alphaVbeta3+). Fairly effective integrin targeting was displayed by the cyclo[DKP-RGD]-Val-Ala-PTX conjugate (6), which was found to differentially inhibit proliferation in antigen-positive CCRF-CEM alphaVbeta3 versus antigen-negative isogenic CCRF-CEM cells. The total lack of activity displayed by the ""uncleavable"" cyclo[DKP-RGD]-PTX conjugate (8) clearly demonstrates the importance of the peptide linker for achieving the selective release of the cytotoxic payload.","['Dal Corso, Alberto', 'Caruso, Michele', 'Belvisi, Laura', 'Arosio, Daniela', 'Piarulli, Umberto', 'Albanese, Clara', 'Gasparri, Fabio', 'Marsiglio, Aurelio', 'Sola, Francesco', 'Troiani, Sonia', 'Valsasina, Barbara', 'Pignataro, Luca', 'Donati, Daniele', 'Gennari, Cesare']","['Dal Corso A', 'Caruso M', 'Belvisi L', 'Arosio D', 'Piarulli U', 'Albanese C', 'Gasparri F', 'Marsiglio A', 'Sola F', 'Troiani S', 'Valsasina B', 'Pignataro L', 'Donati D', 'Gennari C']","['Universita degli Studi di Milano, Dipartimento di Chimica, Via C.

Pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic signals are tightly regulated in normal breast epithelial cells. Dysregulation of this balance is required for breast tumorigenesis and increases acquired resistance to treatments, including molecularly targeted therapies, radiation and chemotherapies. The pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members interact with each other to maintain mitochondrial integrity and regulate cellular commitment to apoptosis. Among the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Mcl-1 is uniquely regulated by numerous oncogenic signaling pathways. This review will focus on the role of Bcl-2 family proteins in normal breast development, breast tumorigenesis and acquired resistance to breast cancer treatment strategies, while highlighting Mcl-1 as a promising target to improve breast cancer tumor cell killing.","['Williams, Michelle M', 'Cook, Rebecca S']","['Williams MM', 'Cook RS']","['Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville TN 27232, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville TN 27232, USA.', 'Department of Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,"['0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Breast/cytology/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Mammary Glands, Animal/cytology/*growth & development/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics/metabolism/*physiology']",2015/03/19 06:00,2016/01/13 06:00,['2015/03/19 06:00'],"['2014/08/27 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/01/13 06:00 [medline]']","['2792 [pii]', '10.18632/oncotarget.2792 [doi]']",ppublish,Oncotarget. 2015 Feb 28;6(6):3519-30. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.2792.,,PMC4414133,,,,,,"['F31 CA195989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA143126/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are of infectious or inflammatory origin. They pose potential challenges to successful hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) transplant as they may be niches for infection reactivation or sites susceptible to subsequent infections. We retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 20 AML patients with multiple PNs who underwent allogeneic HPC transplants (12 related, 8 unrelated). There were 13 males and seven females (median age 52 yrs). Nine patients were in CR1, seven in CR2, and four with residual disease. The median times from appearance of PNs and from last positive CT scans to transplant were three and two months, respectively. The median time from pretransplant CT scans to transplant was one month. Multiple PNs were still reported in 5/20 of the pretransplant scans. The PNs in all five patients did not worsen after transplant. Four patients (one with positive pretransplant CT scan) died within the first 100 d after transplant, but none from primary pulmonary pathology. The median survival of this group of patients was 350 d. Our results, therefore, suggest that multiple PNs of uncertain etiology in patients with AML do not impact adversely on the outcome of allogeneic HPC transplant.","['Lim, Sara J', 'Lim, Matthew J', 'Raptis, Anastasios', 'Hou, Jing-Zhou', 'Farah, Rafic', 'Marks, Stanley', 'Im, Annie', 'Dorritie, Kathleen', 'Sehgal, Alison', 'Agha, Mounzer', 'Lim, Seah H']","['Lim SJ', 'Lim MJ', 'Raptis A', 'Hou JZ', 'Farah R', 'Marks S', 'Im A', 'Dorritie K', 'Sehgal A', 'Agha M', 'Lim SH']","['Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Adult Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant Program, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Allografts', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Solitary Pulmonary Nodule/mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Survival Rate']",2015/03/19 06:00,2016/10/11 06:00,['2015/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/03/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/10/11 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/ejh.12547 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2016 Jan;96(1):55-9. doi: 10.1111/ejh.12547.

Even with empiric therapy, case fatality rates of neutropenic pneumonias remain unacceptably high. However, recent advances in the management of neutropenic pneumonia offer hope for improved outcomes in the cancer setting. This review summarizes recent literature regarding the clinical presentation, microbiologic trends, diagnostic advances and therapeutic recommendations for cancer-related neutropenic pneumonia. RECENT FINDINGS: Although neutropenic patients acquire pathogens both in community and nosocomial settings, patients' obligate healthcare exposures result in the frequent identification of multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms on conventional culture-based assessment of respiratory secretions. Modern molecular techniques, including expanded use of galactomannan testing, have further facilitated identification of fungal pathogens, allowing for aggressive interventions that appear to improve patient outcomes. Multiple interested societies have issued updated guidelines for antibiotic therapy of suspected neutropenic pneumonia. The benefit of antibiotic medications may be further enhanced by agents that promote host responses to infection. SUMMARY: Neutropenic cancer patients have numerous potential causes for pulmonary infiltrates and clinical deterioration, with lower respiratory tract infections among the most deadly. Early clinical suspicion, diagnosis and intervention for neutropenic pneumonia provide cancer patients' best hope for survival.","['Evans, Scott E', 'Ost, David E']","['Evans SE', 'Ost DE']","['Department of Pulmonary Medicine, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Pulm Med,Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,9503765,,IM,"['Humans', 'Neoplasms/*blood/*microbiology', 'Neutropenia/*etiology/*microbiology', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/*blood/*etiology']",2015/03/19 06:00,2015/07/17 06:00,['2015/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1097/MCP.0000000000000156 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2015 May;21(3):260-71. doi: 10.1097/MCP.0000000000000156.,,PMC4429304,,,,,,"['DP2 HL123229/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL117976/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['NIHMS685038'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditionally, myeloablative conditioning regimens improve disease control, but at the risk of greater nonrelapse mortality. Because fludarabine with myeloablative doses of intravenous busulfan using pharmacokinetic monitoring has excellent tolerability, we reasoned that this regimen would limit relapse without substantially elevating toxicity when compared to reduced intensity conditioning. We retrospectively analyzed 148 consecutive AML patients in remission receiving T cell replete HCT conditioned with fludarabine and intravenous busulfan at doses defined as reduced (6.4 mg/kg; FluBu2, n = 63) or myeloablative (12.8 mg/kg; FluBu4, n = 85). Early and late nonrelapse mortality (NRM) was similar among FluBu4 and FluBu2 recipients, respectively (day + 100: 4 vs 0 %; 5 years: 19 vs 22 %; p = 0.54). NRM did not differ between FluBu4 and FluBu2 in patients >50 years of age (24 vs 22 %, p = 0.75). Relapse was lower in recipients of FluBu4 (5 years: 30 vs 49 %; p = 0.04), especially in patients with poor risk cytogenetics (22 vs 59 %; p = 0.02) and those >50 years of age (28 vs 51 %; p = 0.02). Overall survival favored FluBu4 recipients at 5 years (53 vs 34 %, p = 0.02), a finding confirmed in multivariate analysis (HR: 0.57; 95 % CI: 0.34-0.95; p = 0.03). These data suggest that myeloablative FluBu4 may provide equivalent NRM, reduced relapse, and improved survival compared to FluBu2, emphasizing the importance of busulfan dose in conditioning for AML.","['Magenau, John M', 'Braun, Thomas', 'Reddy, Pavan', 'Parkin, Brian', 'Pawarode, Attaphol', 'Mineishi, Shin', 'Choi, Sung', 'Levine, John', 'Li, Yumeng', 'Yanik, Gregory', 'Kitko, Carrie', 'Churay, Tracey', 'Frame, David', 'Riwes, Mary Mansour', 'Harris, Andrew', 'Bixby, Dale', 'Couriel, Daniel R', 'Goldstein, Steven C']","['Magenau JM', 'Braun T', 'Reddy P', 'Parkin B', 'Pawarode A', 'Mineishi S', 'Choi S', 'Levine J', 'Li Y', 'Yanik G', 'Kitko C', 'Churay T', 'Frame D', 'Riwes MM', 'Harris A', 'Bixby D', 'Couriel DR', 'Goldstein SC']","['University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, johnmage@med.umich.edu.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'G1LN9045DK (Busulfan)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Busulfan/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloablative Agonists/*administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate/trends', 'Transplantation Conditioning/*methods/mortality', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods/mortality', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Young Adult']",2015/03/19 06:00,2015/07/25 06:00,['2015/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/01/05 00:00 [received]', '2015/03/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2015/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/s00277-015-2349-4 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2015 Jun;94(6):1033-41. doi: 10.1007/s00277-015-2349-4.

CD26+ cells, a fraction of CD34+cells, are a major population of UCB cells which negatively regulate the in vivo homing and engraftment of HSCs. CD26 is highly expressed in various cells such as HSCs, immune cells, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells. It has been shown that the inhibition of the CD26 on CD34+ cells improves the efficiency of Hematopoietic Stem and Progenitor Cell (HPC) transplantation. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between the production of B, T, and NK cells from the CD26+ fraction of cord blood mononuclear cells. METHODS: Cord blood mononuclear cells were cultured for 21 days using different combinations of stem cell factors (SCF), Flt3 ligand (FL), IL-2, IL-7, and IL-15. The harvested cells were then analyzed by flowcytometry every week for 21 days. RESULTS: T cell differentiation from CD26 subset of cord blood mononuclear cells increased by using IL-2 and IL-7. Our data showed that IL-2 and IL-7 significantly affected the generation of B cells from CD26 positive cord blood mononuclear cells. On the other hand, NK (NKp46+) derived CD26+ cells increased by IL-15 and IL-2. CONCLUSION: Taking all into account, we conclude that B, T, and NK cells can differentiate from the CD26+ subset of mononuclear cord blood cells by using key regulatory cytokines.","['Aliyari, Zeynab', 'Alemi, Forogh', 'Brazvan, Balal', 'Tayefi Nasrabadi, Hamid', 'Nozad Charoudeh, Hojjatollah']","['Aliyari Z', 'Alemi F', 'Brazvan B', 'Tayefi Nasrabadi H', 'Nozad Charoudeh H']","['Stem Cell Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran, e-mail: z_aliyari@yahoo.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Iran,Iran J Immunol,Iranian journal of immunology : IJI,101282932,"['0 (Cytokines)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (DPP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cytokines/immunology/pharmacology', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*immunology', 'Fetal Blood/cytology/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/immunology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology']",2015/03/19 06:00,2016/03/24 06:00,['2015/03/19 06:00'],"['2015/03/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/03/24 06:00 [medline]']","['02 [pii]', 'IJIv12i1A2 [doi]']",ppublish,Iran J Immunol. 2015 Mar;12(1):16-26. doi: IJIv12i1A2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All cases of newly diagnosed Philadelphia positive, BCR-ABL1+ CML that occurred in a sample of 92.5 million adults living in 20 European countries, were registered over a median period of 39 months. 94.3% of the 2904 CML patients were diagnosed in chronic phase (CP). Median age was 56 years. 55.5% of patients had comorbidities, mainly cardiovascular (41.9%). High-risk patients were 24.7% by Sokal, 10.8% by EURO, and 11.8% by EUTOS risk scores. The raw incidence increased with age from 0.39/100,000/year in people 20-29 years old to 1.52 in those >70 years old, and showed a maximum of 1.39 in Italy and a minimum of 0.69 in Poland (all countries together: 0.99). The proportion of Sokal and Euro score high-risk patients seen in many countries indicates that trial patients were not a positive selection. Thus from a clinical point of view the results of most trials can be generalized to most countries. The incidences observed among European countries did not differ substantially.

Diagnostic features include pancytopenia, splenomegaly, bone marrow reticulin fibrosis, and circulating hairy cells. Less commonly, there may be involvement of the liver and lymph nodes. We present a case of a 53-year-old man with HCL who was found to have soft tissue masses within the mediastinum and neck during pretreatment workup. An F-FDG PET/CT scan was requested to assess these lesions before treatment. These extensive infiltrates were FDG avid, and core biopsy of the mediastinal tissue was undertaken.

We demonstrate here that the major JAK2 mutation observed in these diseases (JAK2V617F) enforces Mcl-1 transcription via STAT3 signaling. Targeting this lesion with JAK inhibitor I (JAKi-I) attenuates STAT3 binding to the Mcl-1 promoter and suppresses Mcl-1 transcript and protein expression. The neutralization of Mcl-1 in JAK2V617F-harboring myelodyssplastic syndrome cell lines sensitizes them to apoptosis induced by the BH3-mimetic and Bcl-xL/Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT-263. Moreover, simultaneously targeting JAK and Bcl-xL/-2 is synergistic in the presence of the JAK2V617F mutation. These findings suggest that JAK/Bcl-xL/-2 inhibitor combination therapy may have applicability in a range of hematological disorders characterized by activating JAK2 mutations.","['Guo, Jun', 'Roberts, Lisa', 'Chen, Zhui', 'Merta, Philip J', 'Glaser, Keith B', 'Shah, O Jameel']","['Guo J', 'Roberts L', 'Chen Z', 'Merta PJ', 'Glaser KB', 'Shah OJ']","['Oncology Division, Research & Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Oncology Division, Research & Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Oncology Division, Research & Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Oncology Division, Research & Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Oncology Division, Research & Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.', 'Oncology Division, Research & Development, AbbVie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', '*Mutation', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology', 'bcl-X Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors']",2015/03/18 06:00,2016/02/05 06:00,['2015/03/18 06:00'],"['2014/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2014/11/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/03/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2016/02/05 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0114363 [doi]', 'PONE-D-14-29403 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2015 Mar 17;10(3):e0114363. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0114363. eCollection 2015.,20150317,PMC4362760,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
