The therapeutic response of mice bearing the in vitro line of L1210 cells (L1210/C2) to combination therapy with 2'-dCF and 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyladenine 5'-phosphate was comparable to that reported elsewhere for therapy of mice bearing the parent in vivo line. Continuous exposure of cultured L1210 cells to ara-A and 2'-dCF induced a prolonged period of unbalanced growth, characterized by inhibition of proliferation and DNA synthesis while RNA and protein synthesis continued; exposure periods in excess of a single population doubling were required to achieve significant cell kill. Potentiation of ara-A activity against the relatively insensitive mouse leukemia L1210 was attributed to increased stability of ara-A resulting from 2'-dCF inhibition of adenosine deaminase.","['Cass, C E', 'Au-Yeung, T H']","['Cass CE', 'Au-Yeung TH']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Azepines)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Purine Nucleosides)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)']",IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Azepines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Purine Nucleosides/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Vidarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1976/04/01 00:00,1976/04/01 00:01,['1976/04/01 00:00'],"['1976/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1976 Apr;36(4):1486-91.,,,,,,,,,,,

It was found that AM induced a greater reduction in the number of antibody-producing cells after primary stimulation with sheep erythrocytes, whereas DM was more suppressive on the secondary response to the same antigen. Primary reactivity to the T-independent antigen S-III was reduced by AM, whereas DM was ineffective in the same conditions even at high doses. In addition, when a tumor allograft model was investigated, DM was significantly more immunosuppressive than was AM administered at equitoxic doses. In contrast, these agents displayed similar activity in reducing bone marrow stem cells and in inhibiting DNA synthesis in this organ. The possibility that the different immunosuppressive capacity of AM and DM contributes to the greater antitumoral activity of the former is advanced.","['Vecchi, A', 'Mantovani, A', 'Tagliabue, A', 'Spreafico, F']","['Vecchi A', 'Mantovani A', 'Tagliabue A', 'Spreafico F']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (Polysaccharides, Bacterial)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation/*drug effects', 'Antibody-Producing Cells/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Immunization, Secondary', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polysaccharides, Bacterial', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1976/04/01 00:00,1976/04/01 00:01,['1976/04/01 00:00'],"['1976/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1976 Apr;36(4):1222-7.,,,,,,,,,,,

In the presence of either deoxyguanosine or guanosine, the concentration of MMPR that caused 50% inhibition of growth was 35 times lower than in the absence of these nucleosides. Similar potentiation was also observed against Sarcoma 180 cells in culture by guanosine. The metabolic basis of this synergism was approached in a study of the incorporation of [14C]glycine into 5'-phosphoribosyl-N-formylglycinamide in Sarcoma 180 cells. The results show that the site of inhibition resulting in synergism is an early step in purine biosynthesis, probably phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate amidotransferase (EC 2.4.2.14). In the L1210 cell system, the addition of hypoxanthine to the medium prevented the potentiation of MMPR by guanine nucleosides supporting the conclusion that the site of the synergistic interaction involves purine biosynthesis de novo. While hypoxanthine partially reversed the growth-inhibitory effects of MMPR, an even higher degree of protection was observed in the presence of both uridine and hypoxanthine, suggesting that MMPR may have additional sites of action concerned with pyrimidine metabolism.","['Grindey, G B', 'Lowe, J K', 'Divekar, A Y', 'Hakala, M T']","['Grindey GB', 'Lowe JK', 'Divekar AY', 'Hakala MT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Purines)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '342-69-8 (Methylthioinosine)', '5A614L51CT (Inosine)', '7724-76-7 (Isopentenyladenosine)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Glycine/metabolism', 'Guanosine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Hypoxanthines/*pharmacology', 'Inosine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Isopentenyladenosine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methylthioinosine/*pharmacology', 'Purines/biosynthesis', 'Sarcoma 180/*metabolism']",1976/02/01 00:00,1976/02/01 00:01,['1976/02/01 00:00'],"['1976/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1976 Feb;36(2 Pt 1):379-83.,,,,,,,,,,,

The transport of methotrexate by Sarcoma 180, Ehrlich carcinoma, P388, P288, and L1210 leukemia cells is qualitatively similar. Influx of drug exhibits saturation kinetics and is highly temperature dependent (Q10, 6.1 to 9.4). Efflux of exchangeable methotrexate from all of the different tumor cells exhibited first-order kinetics and the same high temperature dependence seen for influx (Q10, 6.1 to 8.0). The major kinetic determinant of responsiveness is the Km for influx. Values vary from 3.1 to 11.2 X 10(-6) M and are highest in cells from a nonresponsive Sarcoma 180 tumor, somewhat lower in the poorly responsive Ehrlich tumor, lower in moderately responsive P388 and P288 leukemias, and lowest in the highly responsive L1210 leukemia. Values for the influx Vmax differ to some extent, but in a manner not correlatable with responsiveness. The level of responsiveness of the P388 leukemia in vivo can also be partially attributed to an efflux rate that is lower than that measured for the other tumor cells. Steady-state levels of drug accumulation in vitro reflected influx and efflux rates and were consistently correlatable with therapeutic responsiveness. There was no significant difference in the extent to which folate and reduced 5-substituted folate derivatives compete with methotrexate for uptake in cells from all five tumors.

A suitable model for exploring the effectiveness of killed oncornavirus vaccines in the cat has been provided by the use of feline sarcoma virus. Immunization of seven pregnant queens over a 6-week period with ultraviolet light-inactivated Gardner-Arnstein feline sarcoma virus resulted in significant protection among 12 kittens challenged with a tumor-forming Dose 90 at 7 days of age. This immunity was not present in kittens challenged at 35 days of age. Among 12 kittens born of queens immunized during pregnancy with ultraviolet light-inactivated Kawakami-Theilen feline leukemia virus and challenged with the same live virus at 4 days of age, significant protection was noted, ranging from prolongation of survival time to complete protection in 3 kittens. In general, the higher the antibody titer in the mother, the more effective the protection afforded the kittens. Immunization of 43 kittens during their first 5 weeks of life with the same vaccines used in adult cats did not immunize sufficiently to protect against feline sarcoma virus challenge at 5 weeks of age. Neutralizing antibody responses in these kittens were significantly lower than in pregnant queens. That kittens of this age are immunologically responsive was established, since complete protection of 9 kittens to feline sarcoma virus was obtained by immunization with a crude tumor extract inactivated with 5 to 7 megarads of gamma-irradiation. All these kittens developed feline oncornavirus-associated membrane antibodies while 3 developed demonstrable levels of virus-neutralizing antibodies.

This suppression can be mediated by irradiated leukemic cells, requires cell contact between leukemic and normal cells, and may occur at any time during the in vitro culture period. Leukemic AKR cells do not suppress antibody responses of allogeneic cells, even when allogeneic cells have H-2 or background genes homologous with AKR. Leukemic cells do, however, suppress cells that are unable to respond allogeneically to leukemic AKR cells, such as cells of the F1s of AKR. Suppression of normal AKR antibody responses by leukemic AKR cells may be overcome by addition of irradiated allogeneic cells. The fact that leukemic AKR cells are able to suppress normal lymphocyte responses may be of significance in pathogenesis of leukemia in these mice.","['Roman, J M', 'Golub, E S']","['Roman JM', 'Golub ES']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', '*Antibody Formation', '*Antibody-Producing Cells/transplantation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Liver/immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Radiation Chimera', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1976/03/01 00:00,1976/03/01 00:01,['1976/03/01 00:00'],"['1976/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1976 Mar 1;143(3):482-96. doi: 10.1084/jem.143.3.482.,,PMC2190145,['10.1084/jem.143.3.482 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

As a consequence, we have numberous therapeutical diagrams with leukosis. As a consequence, we have numerous therapeutical diagrams in which there is adomination of pharmacological substances having cytostatic effects of anti-microbal, substitutional and symptomatical therapies. Cytostatics represent an expressedly different therapy. Various, very powerful cytostatic combinations and procedures applied with a desire to bring the patient into remission often cause the therapeutist to have another, very important problem: how to prevent the haematological complications using the cytostatic therapy, primarily the leukopenia and thrombocytopenia which, in bodies damaged by malign processes, can cause difficult complications. In order to avoid these, a series of new methods have been developed within the cytophoresis and haemotherapy. With the advent of separators of blood components it seems that the problem of selective and precise haemotherapy has been solved completely. Namely, if the components are applied precisely, in the stage when the patient lacks them in the desired concentration, the possibility of manifold therapeutical applications offer a possibility for an adequate subtitutional therapy. This paper brings forward our initial results from this field. The CENTRIFUGE-- AMINCO was used for seperation. The seperation in it takes place in a closed system (infection impossible), and thanks to special construction which simulates the internal medium of blood vessels, the mechanical decay of tangible components in the extracorporal medium has been reduced to a minimum. By means of adjustment of peristaltic pumps, the desired seperation is possible to be achieved. Concentrated components obtained by means of separation (leukocytes and thrombocytes, separated or together), have been applied with patients having leukosis once or several times, in the stage when they, due to cytostatic treatment, had very low values of these components with the existing or threatening complications. The substitional therapy has been applied with 14 patients and very efficient effects have been observed.","['Boskovic, S', 'Haracic, M']","['Boskovic S', 'Haracic M']",['srp'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Serbia,Bilt Hematol Transfuz,Bilten za hematologiju i transfuziju,7601504,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blood Platelets', '*Blood Transfusion', 'Centrifugation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukocytes', 'Methods']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bilt Hematol Transfuz. 1976;4(1-2):97-104.,Rezultati aplikacije citoferezom separisanih elemenata krvi kod leukemija tretiranih citostaticima,,,,,,,,,,

Collimation and shielding at the higher energy are facilitated by the greater degree of forward-peaking and by the fact that a higher dose-rate allows longer collimators to be used. Attenuation in iron was found to be similar at the two energies. The radiobiological properties of the two neutron beams are very similar.

About half of the chickens of each strain had been vaccinated with turkey herpesvirus (HVT) one week before challenge in the wing web with TLT. Tumors which developed at the site of inoculation usually reached maximum size within 2 weeks and then regressed. In some chickens, however, tumors developed in visceral organs and caused death in the 2nd through 5th weeks postinoculation. Comparisons among strains of chickens in Expt. 1 revealed no differences in mortality. Vaccination with HVT reduced mortality and also the incidence of wing-web tumors (WWT) in all strains of chickens.

Other tumours are further divided into: kidney tumours (96), eye tumours (37) and bone tumours (56). No significant correlations were found between potential aetiologic factors and the cases of cancer. The risk ratio for leukaemia in the group with pelvic radiography was 1.9, and in the group given vaccination against polio 1.8.

Paradoxical effects were also seen with the biologic immunopotentiator C. parvum in solid tumor systems. Treatment with C. parvum either potentiated disease or had no effect on the life span of most mice bearing the Lewis lung carcinoma. In contrast, the same treatment could produce a high percentage of tumor regressions in mice bearing the MCA 2182 sarcoma, although the effect was somewhat variable.

The log P values were calculated via the method of Hansch and Leo from literature f values and the observed log P values were obtained by direct determination after equilibration between octanol and water. Calculations of log P for hydroxyurea were found to be appreciably more hydrophilic than the values obtained experimentally. Differences in calculated and observed log P (delta log P) for the substituted analogues were lowest with the 1-N and the bulky 3-N substituents and greatest with the 3-N-substituted straight-chain analogues (delta log P = 0.70). Different structural species were observed by infrared spectroscopy in dry octanol vs. octanol after water equilibration and drying, and this is proposed as due to changes in conformational equilibrium in the hydroxyurea systems. Differences between calculated and observed log P are explained via the stabilization of internally hydrogen-bonded conformers in the case of 1-N or bulky 3-N analogues or destabilization of various conformers allowing maximal interactions with solvent or water which is the case with straight chain 3-N analogues.","['Parker, G R', 'Lemke, T L', 'Moore, E C']","['Parker GR', 'Lemke TL', 'Moore EC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,['X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)'],IM,"['Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', '*Hydroxyurea/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Molecular Conformation']",1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1977 Sep;20(9):1221-5. doi: 10.1021/jm00219a024.,,,['10.1021/jm00219a024 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

A9HT cells, an L-cell subline, react with the antibodies against the viral envelope antigen only; this reaction can be completely inhibited by virus or purified gp71. Reactivity to Moloney lymphoma cells (YAC) was only partially inhibited (maximum 30%) or not at all. This can be attributed to the reaction of the YAC cells with antibodies directed against MCSA, a nonvirion cell surface component according to both biological and biochemical evidence. Antibody-induced capping of gp71 or p15(E) did not change the membrane distribution of MCSA or H-2, indicating that these antigens represent distinct entities on the cell surface. MCSA showed only minimal capping and thereby differed in behavior from both H-2 and virion antigens. gp71 could be capped by the mouse antiserum as revealed by subsequent staining with monospecific anti-gp71 antiserum. Under ordinary test conditions this reactivity is overshadowed by the reaction against MCSA. The lack of MCSA capping reflects a difference in anchorage of this antigen.","['Fenyo, E M', 'Yefenof, E', 'Klein, E', 'Klein, G']","['Fenyo EM', 'Yefenof E', 'Klein E', 'Klein G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)']",IM,"['*Antibodies, Viral/*biosynthesis', 'Antigens, Viral', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Immunologic Capping', '*Lymphoma', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Virion/*immunology']",1977/12/01 00:00,1977/12/01 00:01,['1977/12/01 00:00'],"['1977/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1977 Dec 1;146(6):1521-33. doi: 10.1084/jem.146.6.1521.,,PMC2181915,['10.1084/jem.146.6.1521 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

On the basis of these data the authors indicate the advantage of the method, prepared by them, because it alows objective checking of phagocytosis on a large number of cells and thus increases the possibilities of obtaining significant results.","['Fifi, F', 'Nedialkova, M', 'Serafimov-Dimitrov, V']","['Fifi F', 'Nedialkova M', 'Serafimov-Dimitrov V']",['bul'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Bulgaria,Eksp Med Morfol,Eksperimentalna meditsina i morfologiia,0007506,['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chickens/immunology', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Methods', 'Mice', '*Phagocytosis', 'Radiometry']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eksp Med Morfol. 1977;16(3):132-6.,Radiometrichen netod za opredeliane fagotsitnata aktivnost na makrofagi in vitro.,,,,,,,,,,

These animals carried one copy of M-MuLV DNA in their germ line and were heterozygous for the M-MuLV locus (Jaenisch, 1976). Experiments were performed to investigate whether homozygosity at the M-MuLV locus would be compatible with normal development. Animals heterozygous for the M-MuLV locus were mated [female (+/-) X male(+/-)] and the genotype of the offspring was analyzed. Molecular hybridization experiments revealed three classes of offspring carrying two copies (++), one copy (+/-) and no (--) M-MuLV-specific DNA sequences, respectively, in their liver DNA. Genetic experiments indicated that males of the first class transmitted the virus to 100% of their offspring, males of the second class to 50% and males of the third class not at all when mated with normal females. These results demonstrated that homozygosity at the M-MuLV locus has no detectable effect on normal development of the animals and that the M-MuLV gene is transmitted from one generation to the next strictly according to Mendelian expectations.

The immediate binding of radioactive actinomycin D to sensitive and resistant cells was similar, and the uptake of the drug by the resistant cells was only about 27% less than the rate of uptake by sensitive cells. There was a dramatic difference in efflux of drug from sensitive and resistant sublines. Equivalent cytotoxicity of actinomycin D for the sensitive and resistant sublines was obtained at concentrations of the drug that resulted in approximately equivalent levels of net retention of actinomycin D (retained drug minus background levels of immediate binding of the drug to the cells). Incubation of cells in the presence of actinomycin D plus either Tween 80 or acridine orange incresed the rate of uptake and the percentage of actinomycin D retained by the resistant cells on short-term assays but did not reverse the resistance.

It was possible to discriminate quantitatively between the non-specific enhancement of splenomegaly in MuLV-R infected mice due to antigenic stimulation with normal rabbit globulin and the effects due to elimination of endogenous interferon by specific antibodies. The difference in the spleen-enlarging activity between the anti-interferon IgG and normal rabbit IgG was found to be maximal 3-4 weeks after infection when potent, diluted anti-interferon IgG (58 microgram protein per dose) was used.

The varied forms in childhood can be classified as those secondary to some other disease and primary forms of the disorder which include the genetically determined osteogenesis imperfecta types and idiopathic forms of osteoporosis. A plea is made for greater clinical application in attempting to discriminate differing forms of these primary disorders. Osteogenesis imperfecta it is argued is a heterogeneous condition with the evidence favouring both dominantly and recessively transmitted forms in different kindreds. Another possible osteogenesis imperfecta variant is characterized by dwarfing, scoliosis and peculiar cystic lesions of the proximal humeri. Idiopathic juvenile osteoporosis is a term reserved for the acute osteoporosis beginning in the immediate prepubertal years and may differ in its cause from idiopathic osteoporosis beginning rather earlier in childhood. It is emphasized that immobilization osteoporosis is of very great importance and may become superimposed upon other osseous dysplasias. A complete understanding of these conditions will be helped by elucidation of the basic underlying defects in collagen and other constituents of bone matrix.","['Dent, C E']",['Dent CE'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Postgrad Med J,Postgraduate medical journal,0234135,['SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Calcium/deficiency', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Osteogenesis Imperfecta/*diagnostic imaging', 'Osteoporosis/*diagnostic imaging/etiology', 'Radiography']",1977/08/01 00:00,1977/08/01 00:01,['1977/08/01 00:00'],"['1977/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Postgrad Med J. 1977 Aug;53(622):450-7. doi: 10.1136/pgmj.53.622.450.,,PMC2496749,['10.1136/pgmj.53.622.450 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Seven cases showed cirrhosis of the liver; six of them belonged to the immunocytoma group. Four cases were positive for HBsAg. Three of them were found among the group combining cirrhosis and immunocytoma. They presented the abundant nodular distribution of HBsAg typical of inactive cirrhosis.A parallel is drawn between the often reported association of Waldenstrom's syndrome and cirrhosis and the association of immunocytoma and cirrhosis observed in this study. The analogy is all the more justified since most of the lymphomas associated with Waldenstrom's syndrome happen to be immunocytomas. Therefore the association between HB virus infection and cirrhosis on the one hand and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders on the other may not be purely coincidental. A chronic antigenic stimulus such as persisting HBsAg could trigger the proliferation of a malignant lymphoid clone.,"['Heimann, R', 'Ray, M B', 'Desmet, V J']","['Heimann R', 'Ray MB', 'Desmet VJ']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,['0 (Hepatitis B Surface Antigens)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B Surface Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Liver/immunology', 'Liver Cirrhosis/complications/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1977 Sep;30(9):817-21. doi: 10.1136/jcp.30.9.817.,,PMC476566,['10.1136/jcp.30.9.817 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The anti-tumor activity of ara-C was markedly enhanced by encapsulation in liposomes when given in a single IP injection. Among the four types of liposomes, a physically stable and positively charged liposome consisting of sphingomyelin, stearylamine and cholesterol (20:2:15 molar ratio) most effectively enhanced the effect of ara-C. A single IP dose of 50 mg/kg of ara-C, encapsulated in this kind of liposome exhibited high activity, producing a survival rate of 60% of the treated mice at 60 days. This enhanced effect of ara-C encapsulated in liposomes was also demonstrated when the drug was administered either IV or SC, and the range between the minimum effective and the maximum tolerable doses was wide enough to allow the safe use of the encapsulated ara-C. Intraperitoneal administration of encapsulated ara-C induced a more prolonged survival of mice inocualted with L1210 than did free ara-C, regardless of whether it was given in single or multiple doses.","['Kobayashi, T', 'Kataoka, T', 'Tsukagoshi, S', 'Sakurai, Y']","['Kobayashi T', 'Kataoka T', 'Tsukagoshi S', 'Sakurai Y']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Amines)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'FFV58UNY7O (stearylamine)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Amines/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Cholesterol/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Sphingomyelins/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",1977/10/15 00:00,1977/10/15 00:01,['1977/10/15 00:00'],"['1977/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1977/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1977 Oct 15;20(4):581-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910200416.,,,['10.1002/ijc.2910200416 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Clones of Chinese hamster V79 cells microinjected with chromosomes isolated from murine D56 cells [V79 (D56) cells] were tested for tumorigenicity in immunodeficient nude mice and for colony-forming ability in soft agar. Untreated recipient V79 cells were highly tumorigenic and had a high colony-forming ability in soft agar. In contrast, two out of the 21 microinjected clones tested were non-tumorigenic in nude mice and had only weak colony-forming ability in soft agar. The chromosome banding pattern was analyzed in microinjected clones and tumors derived from cells of these clones. In cells of the two non-tumorigenic clones, a telocentric chhromosome 1 (t1) was specifically involved in translocations with other chromosomes or chromosome fragments. In all tumor cells obtained from nude mice, a supernumerary piece or a whole biarmed chromosome 14 (b14) was specifically found. The results suggest that the t1 chromosome bears the gene which controls in vitro transformation and that the additional genetic change, i.e. the extra piece of b14 chromosome, was required for tumor formation in vivo.","['Ebina, T', 'Koi, M', 'Ishida, N']","['Ebina T', 'Koi M', 'Ishida N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosomes', 'Clone Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Metaphase', 'Methods', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Microinjections/instrumentation', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1977/10/15 00:00,1977/10/15 00:01,['1977/10/15 00:00'],"['1977/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1977/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1977 Oct 15;20(4):572-80. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910200415.,,,['10.1002/ijc.2910200415 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The treatment of tied observations is a particularly troublesome point in both theory and application. It appears that grouping rather than discrete time is the right way to handle ties. This paper studies methodology for grouped observations. A logistic model, which makes explicit use of Cox's earlier binary data methods, is introduced and illustrated with a numerical example. The model leads back to Cox's proportional failure rates when the lengths of the grouping intervals approach zero. This limiting process provides some enlightenment on controversial issues such as ignoring intervals in which no failures occur, determining whether the covariates may be functions of time, and treating ties.","['Thompson, W A Jr']",['Thompson WA Jr'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', '*Life Expectancy', 'Mathematics', 'Models, Biological', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Statistics as Topic']",1977/09/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biometrics. 1977 Sep;33(3):463-70.,,,,,,,,,,,

For the purpose of investigating whether the glass cylinder model could also modify the immune response of the host to a second tumour challenge, a leukaemia virus known to crossreact with MS was used. Regressors were challenged i.p. with a lethal dose of a leukaemia virus, PLLV. Regressors bearing a glass cylinder showed a 22% survival rate which was significantly lower than that of the s.c. inoculated regressors (71%).

Criteria for patient selection included a proved infection, a granulocyte count of less than 300/mm3, availability of a suitable donor and failure to respond to at least 72 horus of appropriate antibiotic therapy. Thirty patients were assigned at random to receive either granulocyte transfusions or to serve as a control group. Antibiotic therapy was continued in both groups. Responses were judged by the degree of diminution of infectious episodes and survival. The results showed that 11 of 13 control patients failed to respond during the period of observation, whereas 10 of 17 patients given transfusions responded. The results were statistically significantly different (p less than 0.05). The median survival was 22.5 days in the group given transfusions (group 2) and 7.7 in the control group (group 1) (p less than 0.01). The granulocyte transfusions were most effective in patients with hypocellular marrows who failed to recover during the period of observation.

Since SDS binding is a general property of proteins, this method of noncovalently altering electrophoretic mobility appears to be applicable to other antigen-antibody systems.","['Robinson, O R Jr', 'Shibley, G P', 'Sevoian, M']","['Robinson OR Jr', 'Shibley GP', 'Sevoian M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Infect Immun,Infection and immunity,0246127,"['0 (Carbamates)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '368GB5141J (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate)']",IM,"['Carbamates', 'Immunoelectrophoresis/*methods', 'Isoelectric Point', 'Rauscher Virus/*analysis', 'Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate', 'Viral Proteins/*analysis/immunology']",1977/10/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1977/10/01 00:00'],"['1977/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1977/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infect Immun. 1977 Oct;18(1):60-7. doi: 10.1128/iai.18.1.60-67.1977.,,PMC421193,['10.1128/iai.18.1.60-67.1977 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Many of the patients so treated subsequently develop serious infections. Poor marrow reserve has been implicated but lacks supporting evidence as the cause of the granulocytopenia. In six patients we studied with leukemic reticuloendotheliosis, bone marrow showed severe granulocytopenia, blood neutrophil response after intravenous hydrocortisone injection was poor, and leukocyte migration to the site of inflammation showed suboptimal neutrophilia and poor or no mononuclear response. Splenic hypersequestration and pooling were probably not important factors in causing neutropenia, since similar results were seen in patients without spleens. These findings suggest that in this disease the marrow granulocyte reserve and leukocyte mobilization are impaired and the neutropenia is due to poor granulocyte production and not to increased migration of leukocytes to tissues.

Deaths in AL constituted 36% of the deaths observed in the groups treated with alkylating agents and 23% of the total number of deaths in these series. All patients who developed AL had active disease but they had no distinctive features predicting a malignant development. The time interval between PV diagnosis and development of AL was relatively short for those patients who were induced and maintained with alkylating agents alone. It is remarkable that 3 out of 8 patients had erythroleukaemia. Cytogenetic pretreatment studies were performed in 3 patients and all were normal. 7 patients were studied with banding techniques during the leukaemic state and all but one have shown multiple and complex abnormalities indicating several super-imposed cell lines.

They were immunodeficient because of (1) high-dose steroids (HDS) for sagittal sinus thrombosis, (2) HDS for systemic lupus erythematosus, (3) HDS for chronic myelogenous leukemia and myelofibrosis, (4) HDS for multiple myeloma, (5) hemolytic anemia with pulmonary infiltrates, (6) chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, (7) diabetes mellitus with Kimmelstiel-Wilson disease, and (8) diabetes mellitus with chronic glomerulonephritis. Six of the eight patients survived and were discharged with completely healed incisions 3 to 6 weeks after operation. This compares well with the survival rates reported by others.

This interference has been observed by using two different SFFV preparations, one contained in an NB-tropic stock of Friend virus (FV) complex, and the second present in a C57BL-adapted strain of FV complex containing an associated B-tropic LLV-F helper. The LLV-F in NB-tropic FV complex effectively induced XC plaques in C57BL/6 (Fv-1(bb); Fv-2(rr)) mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) only in the absence of coinfecting SFFV, indicating that Fv-2-associated resistance to SFFV-induced focus formation in vivo does not necessarily extend to the restriction of SFFV function(s) in vitro (i.e., in Fv-2(rr) C57BL MEF). SFFV interference appears to be an intracellular event since LLV-F can adsorb onto, penetrate, and rescue defective murine sarcoma virus (MSV) from transformed 3T3FL S(+)L(-) cells with equal efficiency in the presence and absence of SFFV. However, significantly fewer LLV-infected S(+)L(-) cells released LLV-F progeny if SFFV was present. These observations suggest that Friend SFFV may be classified as a defective, interfering (DI) particle. Further support for this conclusion has come from studies designed to investigate two physical properties of defective SFFV particles. SFFV layered onto a 0 to 20% sucrose sedimentation gradient was recovered as a symmetrical band of virus that sedimented more slowly than standard LLV-F particles. Pooled SFFV-containing gradient samples contained visualizable type C virus particles and occasionally small amounts of detectable LLV-F. In an attempt to determine the buoyant density of sedimentation gradient-purified SFFV, pooled SFFV samples were layered onto a 25 to 50% sucrose equilibrium density gradient and were centrifuged to equilibrium. Greater than 50% of the infectious SFFV originally layered onto this gradient was recovered and seen as a narrow symmetrical band with peak SFFV infectivity at a sucrose density of 1.14 g/ml. The observed difference between SFFV and LLV-F buoyant densities appears to be related to an inherent physical property of each virus. Mixtures of these two viruses express the buoyant density of that virus population which is in excess in fabricated FV complexes probably due to the formation of SFFV-LLV aggregates. Finally, gradient-purified SFFV failed to induce XC plaques in MEF and did not function to rescue MSV as expected since SFFV itself is replication defective.","['Eckner, R J', 'Hettrick, K L']","['Eckner RJ', 'Hettrick KL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Defective Viruses/*growth & development', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*growth & development/isolation & purification', 'Helper Viruses/growth & development', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', '*Viral Interference']",1977/10/01 00:00,1977/10/01 00:01,['1977/10/01 00:00'],"['1977/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1977 Oct;24(1):383-96. doi: 10.1128/JVI.24.1.383-396.1977.,,PMC515939,['10.1128/JVI.24.1.383-396.1977 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Only the antibody-dependent lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (ADLMC) was correlated with the ascites tumor cell number, since the ADLMC was high only in mice with a tumor cell number less than that of the controls. Furthermore, since mice with a low tumor cell number had predominantly only lymphocytes as the nonmalignant cell type in their peritoneal fluid, ADLMC may have had an important role in BCG-induced control of tumor growth.","['Olsson, L', 'Florentin, I', 'Kiger, N', 'Mathe, G']","['Olsson L', 'Florentin I', 'Kiger N', 'Mathe G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (BCG Vaccine)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/administration & dosage', 'Ascitic Fluid/cytology', 'BCG Vaccine/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', '*Immunity', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1977/10/01 00:00,1977/10/01 00:01,['1977/10/01 00:00'],"['1977/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1977 Oct;59(4):1297-306. doi: 10.1093/jnci/59.4.1297.,,,['10.1093/jnci/59.4.1297 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Chromosome no. 1 was more frequently involved in aberrations than any other chromosome. The most common breakpoints on this chromosome were 1q21, 1q25 and 1q32. Frequent breakpoints were also noticed in the centromeric region in various chromosomes. In chromosome no. 1, however, the centromeric area does not seem to be involved. The more common breakpoints on the various chromosomes were 1q21, 1q25, 1q32, 5p13, 9q13, 11q23, 12q13. No common markers were noticed among these four cases of melanoma, but are noticed in unrelated tumors.","['Kakati, S', 'Song, S Y', 'Sandberg, A A']","['Kakati S', 'Song SY', 'Sandberg AA']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, 1-3', 'Chromosomes, Human, 4-5', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Diploidy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melanoma/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Polyploidy', 'Skin Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1977 Sep;40(3):1173-81. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197709)40:3<1173::aid-cncr2820400328>3.0.co;2-t.,,,['10.1002/1097-0142(197709)40:3<1173::aid-cncr2820400328>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The blasts penetrated extravasal areas not only via passive but also via active migration. The mainly round to oval shape of the perivascular infiltrates of blasts is determined especially by the Virchow-Robins' spaces. The abscence of growth disrupting hemodynamics and texture structures in the unhindered areas of the cerebral ventricle system and retinal detachement favors the formation of leukemic nodules.

Two additional tyrosine-containing tryptic peptides in Pr2a+b that are not detected in gp69/71 are found in p15(E). Thus, gp69/71 and p15(E) peptide sequences account for all the tyrosine tryptic peptides of Pr2a+b. The gene order of the two proteins was determined by pulse-labeling infected cells in the presence and absence of pactamycin at concentrations of the inhibitor that prevent initiation of translation, but not elongation. The gene order was found to be: (2)HN-gp69/71-p15(E)-COOH. A newly identified major viral protein, termed p12(E), migrates in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels in the ""p12"" region. It is related to p15(E) as determined by tryptic mapping experiments. p15(E) and p12(E) are not phosphorylated, and both can be separated from phosphoprotein p12 by guanidine hydrochloride-agarose chromatography. p12(E) and p15(E) elute in the void volume fraction, whereas phosphoprotein p12 elutes between p15 and p10. The two p12 proteins can also be separated from each other by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis involving isoelectric focusing in the first dimension and sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis in the second dimension.","['Karshin, W L', 'Arcement, L J', 'Naso, R B', 'Arlinghaus, R B']","['Karshin WL', 'Arcement LJ', 'Naso RB', 'Arlinghaus RB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '23668-11-3 (Pactamycin)']",IM,"['Genes', 'Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Molecular Weight', 'Pactamycin/pharmacology', 'Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Phosphoproteins/analysis', 'Protein Precursors/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Rauscher Virus/analysis/*metabolism', 'Viral Proteins/analysis/*biosynthesis']",1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1977 Sep;23(3):787-98. doi: 10.1128/JVI.23.3.787-798.1977.,,PMC515890,['10.1128/JVI.23.3.787-798.1977 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The acceptability of a variety of hydrophilic functions, and optimum positioning of these, has now been investigated. A variety of sterically demanding, hydrophilic functions may be acceptably appended to the acridine 4(5) position suggesting considerable site bulk tolerance.

Whole blood histamine levels were abnormal only in patients with basophilia, i.e. chronic myelocytic leukemia or polycythemia vera. Histamine was not detectable (less than 1 ng/ml) in normal plasma but was detected in plasma of some patients witheither mastocytosis or chronic myelocytic leukemia. These patients also had symptoms which could be attributed to histamine release as, for example, hyperchlorhydria and hypotension. Urinary histamine excretion was also abnormally high in these diseases compared to normal subjects (range less than 5-42 microgram/24 h, n = 31). Patients with systemic mastocytosis had higher urine values (greater than 150 microgram/24 h) than those with cutaneous mastocytosis (39-88 microgram/24 h), and the urinary histamine excretion appeared to be an index of the severity of the diseases.

The W Family was ascertained through AW, a 13-year-old girl, who was purportedly born without congenital anomalies and who was normal until 11 1/2 years when she developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia. She died 2 years later with CNS involvement. Her chromosomes, studied in the first weeks after diagnosis of the disease, were apparently normal. Her father had clinodactyly of both 5th fingers and was found to have panmyelocytopenia refractory to all treatment at 26 years. He died within a year of the onset of his anemia. This man's oldest brother was born with congenital malformations of the elbows and the hands and was healthy until 38 years when he was also found to have an ""idopathic anemia"" and panmyelocytopenia which was refractory to treatment except for transfusions; he died at age 42 years. Both men were initially thought to have the Fanconi anemia syndrome. Their mother died at 71 years of leukemia. DT, the propositus of the second family, was noted to have malformations of both hands at birth. At 21 months he had anemia for which he received transfusions. Family history reveals that several people on the paternal side have severe hand anomalies and a history of childhood anemia. The paternal grandfather died at age 51 of acute monocytic leukemia. Barring genetic heterogeneity, we think that the trait in the W and T families in the same. It is a pleiotropic autosomal dominant mutant which affects radial and ulnar development of the upper limbs and is associated with a relatively high risk of transient or permanent bone marrow arrest with or without leukemia. We propose the hypothesis that apparently increased risk of leukemia to Fanconi heterozygotes actually represents admixture with the WT syndrome and that Fanconi heterozygotes may not have an increased risk of leukemia.","['Gonzalez, C H', 'Durkin-Stamm, M V', 'Geimer, N F', 'Shahidi, N T', 'Schilling, R F', 'Rubira, F', 'Opitz, J M']","['Gonzalez CH', 'Durkin-Stamm MV', 'Geimer NF', 'Shahidi NT', 'Schilling RF', 'Rubira F', 'Opitz JM']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Birth Defects Orig Artic Ser,Birth defects original article series,0003403,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*genetics', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fanconi Syndrome/diagnosis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Radius/*abnormalities', 'Syndrome', 'Ulna/*abnormalities']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Birth Defects Orig Artic Ser. 1977;13(3B):31-8.,,,,,,,,,,,

This new product was known to be active in L 1210 leukemia and immunosuppressive. RPCNU significantly decreases the splenomegaly induced in DBA2 mice by Friend virus when it is given at a time ranging from 7 days before to 14 days after virus inoculation. The survival time in leukemic treated groups is also greatly increased. However, viral content of the spleen extracts of the leukemic treated mice is not reduced. Therefore, RPCNU cannot be considered as an antiviral agent. A comparison between survival of leukemic and non leukemic mice treated with different doses show that the effectiveness of RPCNU is correlated with its toxicity. The effect of RPCNU on Friend leukemia by cytotoxicity on hematopoietic stem cells is discussed in this paper.","['Larnicol, N', 'Augery, Y', 'Jasmin, C', 'Montero, J L', 'Imbach, J L']","['Larnicol N', 'Augery Y', 'Jasmin C', 'Montero JL', 'Imbach JL']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Biomedicine,Biomedicine / [publiee pour l'A.A.I.C.I.G.],0361342,['0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Cytopathogenic Effect, Viral/drug effects', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*therapeutic use/toxicity']",1977/05/01 00:00,1977/05/01 00:01,['1977/05/01 00:00'],"['1977/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomedicine. 1977 May;26(3):176-81.,,,,,,,,,,,

These viruses produce in mice leukemias with a strong erythroid component. However, they are also pancytotic in their action, with demonstrable effects on differentiating myeloid and thromboid cells, the immuno-responsive cells, and the peripheral lymphoid cells as well. In addition, it has been noted that a variety of factors can influence disease expression, including the variety of mouse strain, the hematopoietic cell line being observed, and the tissue microenvironment in which leukemogenesis is taking place, as well as the viral substrain itself. The data available indicates that the target cells are definitely to be found among the most primitive of the hematopoietic progenitor cells of both the marrow and the spleen. However, from an analysis of this data it would appear that the virus target is not exclusively limited to a single type of hematopoietic precursor cell. Rather it is suggested that there is a closely related family of targets, consisting of the uncommitted pluripotent stem cell and the committed progenitor stem cells of the erythroid, myeloid, thromboid and immune cell lines.

Post-mortem histological examination showed intranuclear inclusion bodies in the neurons and glial cells, but inflammatory cell infiltrations were absent. Electron-microscopic and immunofluorescent studies revealed intracellular masses of paramyxovirus nucleocapsid-like structures, which had the morphological and antigenic properties of measles virus. Recent reports have emphasized the possibility of occurrence of a similar encephalopathy in treated childhood leukemia. It is evident, however, that this potentially fatal complication must be borne in mind when measles is contracted during any form of cytotoxic treatment or immunosuppression. Retinal changes may be of value for the diagnosis during life.

There are now considerable data available which indicate that a variety of agents such as cytosine arabinoside, methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 5-fluorouracil, procarbazine, melphalan, and cyclophosphamide, as well as the nitrosoureas, may significantly influence the growth rate of experimentally implanted ic tumors. A number of physicochemical factors may influence the penetration of the blood-brain barrier. These include pKa values, log-P values, and molecular size.

With a s.c. inoculum of 5 X 10(7) tumor cells, circulating tumor antigens were first detected at Day 8, and a maximum concentration was reached by Day 13 to 14, which coincided with the peak of tumor growth and was followed by the sudden death of the animals. Pooled serum from tumor-bearing rats was fractioned on Sephadex G-150 and resulted in one peak that contained all of the antigenic activity. The molecular weight of this fraction was estimated to be 50,000 to 60,000 daltons. Presensitization of normal rats with soluble tumor antigens resulted in a specific acceleration of tumor growth and delay in tumor rejection.

Macrophage activation was highly dose dependent. The validity of the inhibition of DNA synthesis assay for measuring macrophage-induced cytostasis of target cells was proven by demonstrating a concurrent decrease in RNA synthesis and a reduction in viable tumor cell number. Moreover, conditioned supernatants from pyran-activated macrophages did not significantly decrease [3H]thymidine incorporation by freshly added leukemia cells. Biological or synthetic agents that activated macrophages were generally effective systemic antitumor agents against the M109 lung carcinoma. Drugs that did not activate macrophages, such as typhoid vaccine, tilorone, levamisole, WY-13876, and thymosin, were ineffective in prolonging the life of tumor-bearing mice. Pyran treatment i.p. was the most effective antitumor adjuvant in two separate tumor models, and suppression of tumor growth appeared to be related not only to an increase in macrophage tumoricidal function, but also to a larger influx of macrophages responding at the tumor site.","['Schultz, R M', 'Papamatheakis, J D', 'Luetzeler, J', 'Chirigos, M A']","['Schultz RM', 'Papamatheakis JD', 'Luetzeler J', 'Chirigos MA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BCG Vaccine)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Polysaccharides)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (Typhoid-Paratyphoid Vaccines)', '27100-68-1 (Pyran Copolymer)', '2880D3468G (Levamisole)', '39225-26-8 (Wy 13876)', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', 'O6W7VEW6KS (Tilorone)', 'O84C90HH2L (Poly I-C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'BCG Vaccine/pharmacology', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Dextrans/pharmacology', 'Immunotherapy', 'Levamisole/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Poly I-C/pharmacology', 'Polysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Pyran Copolymer/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/pharmacology', 'Thymosin/pharmacology', 'Tilorone/pharmacology', 'Typhoid-Paratyphoid Vaccines/pharmacology']",1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Sep;37(9):3338-43.,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro incubation of leukemic lymphocytes in normal serum resulted in a decrease in the fluidity of cellular membranes, whereas incubation of normal lymphocytes in leukemic serum resulted in an increase in the fluidity of membrane lipids. These observations suggest that normal and leukemic lymphocytes can be quantitatively characterized by monitoring degree of fluidity of cellular membrane lipids and that the fluidity difference between normal and leukemic lymphocytes is controlled by components in the blood serum.","['Inbar, M', 'Goldman, R', 'Inbar, L', 'Bursuker, I', 'Goldman, B', 'Akstein, E', 'Segal, P', 'Ipp, E', 'Ben-Bassat, I']","['Inbar M', 'Goldman R', 'Inbar L', 'Bursuker I', 'Goldman B', 'Akstein E', 'Segal P', 'Ipp E', 'Ben-Bassat I']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Viscosity']",1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Sep;37(9):3037-41.,,,,,,,,,,,

Frozen sections were layered with untreated sheep red blood cells (SRBC) for the detection of the E receptor on T cells, SRBC coated with 7S antibody for the detection of the Fc receptor (IgGEA) and SRBC coated with 19S antibody and complement (IgMEAC) for the detection of the C3 receptor. In normal lymphoreticular tissue, IgGEA selectively bound to areas colonized by macrophages, IgMEAC to B-dependent areas, whereas E showed no adherence. In chronic lymphatic leukemia, a predominant and selective adherence of IgMEAC was found in lymphoreticular organs which supports the B-cell nature of the neoplastic cells; in leukemic reticuloendotheliosis a selective IgMEAC adherence was observed and this favors a monocytoid origin of the hairy cells. Adherence of any indicator cell was practically absent from skin infiltrates of mycosis fungoides, which represents an additional piece of evidence for the T-cell nature of this disease process. In psoriasis, a considerable binding of IgGEA was observed, whereas IgMEAC did not adhere at all. This result indicates that the lymphocytic part of the infiltrate in this disease consists mainly of T cells.","['Stingl, G', 'Wolff, K', 'Diem, E', 'Baumgartner, G', 'Knapp, W']","['Stingl G', 'Wolff K', 'Diem E', 'Baumgartner G', 'Knapp W']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immune Adherence Reaction', 'Immunoglobulin G/isolation & purification', 'Immunoglobulin M/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Mycosis Fungoides/*immunology', 'Psoriasis/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*isolation & purification', 'Reticulocytes/*immunology', 'Skin/immunology']",1977/08/01 00:00,1977/08/01 00:01,['1977/08/01 00:00'],"['1977/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1977 Aug;69(2):231-5. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12506348.,,,"['S0022-202X(15)45091-2 [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12506348 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Immune cytolysis has now been assayed by determination of cell volume distribution with a Coulter multi-channel particle size analyser used in conjunction with a Coulter counter. For Ehrlich ascites and sarcoma-180 cells, volume degradation corresponding to vital staining was obtained only if trypsin (final concentration 625 microgram/ml) was added immediately after the usual 1 h incubation period for cells, antibody and complement. For L1210 leukaemia cells, trypsin was added at 0 degrees just 1 min before Coulter evaluation, to avoid potentiation of antibody-mediated cell lysis by trypsin. Immune cytolysis of mouse thymic, splenic and lymph node lymphocytes required addition of pronase (final concentration 625 microgram/ml) at 0 degrees for further disruption of antibody-damaged cells, prior to determination of cell volume distribution in the Coulter equipment. Scanning electron micrographs of L1210 cells undergoing immune cytolysis illustrated the changes in cell volume recorded by the Coulter apparatus.

The mortality in this group was 40.5 per cent. In the patients with solid tumor (group 2), Esch. coli, Staph. aureus, Bacteroides sp. and Candida sp. were most frequent. Mortality was 27.8 per cent. The source of infection in both groups was often indeterminate. High mortality was associated with pulmonary and intraabdominal infection and with Ps. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae or polymicrobic sepsis. Factors of prognostic significance were the causative microorganism, source of infection and shock. Although mortality was higher in patients with leukopenia than in those with normal leukocyte counts, the differences were not significant. The mortality in this series was low considering the severity of the underlying diseases and the immunosuppressed state of many of the patients. In a prospective, randomly controlled study, mortality was further diminished by infectious disease consultation at the time the positive blood culture was reported.

The variation was measured by a series of rank and product-moment correlation coefficients in order to summarize the association between pairs of cancers in white males and in white females. The most notable findings were the high correlations between the incidence rates for the three gastrointestinal sites (stomach, colon, and rectum) and bladder cancer in both men and women and the high correlation between three female sexual sites (breast, corpus, and ovary). These two clusters are also correlated with one another. A number of other substantial correlations between pairs of cancers were observed and discussed.

A new method of analysis of the biology of cancer.,327-44,"1. Cancers, viewed as escape from the normal ""contact inhibition"" of cells in tissues, can be considered to start at some given time and then to require a period of incubation before they cause death. The probability of a start may depend on age, described by a start function. The incubation period may be described by a lethality function of the period between start and the age at which death rates are measured. 2. It can be shown that, provided the loss of tumour-bearers (where cancer has started) in the population by deaths from other causes than cancer is in the same ratio as the loss of total population, the differential curve (dR/dA) of the rate versus age curves must give the product of these two functions (start function X lethality function). 3. The differential curves dR/dA for major sites of cancers are examined for WHO data on deaths. The differential curves prove to be well described by normal Gaussian curves. The presence of more than one type of tumour or of physiological environment, included in a single category, is shown by multiple peaks in the differential curves. The outstanding exception is tumours of the ""brain and other CNS"" where the rate curve itself is Gaussian. 4. The results are consistent with a start rate that is random and independent of age (not exceeding three per 1,000 per year for the commonest tumour), and an astonishingly long incubation period of at least 20-50 years. For most sites, the curves indicate that from 20 to 40% of the cancers that have started do not cause death, because other causes supervene. 5. The implications as to the possibilities of control of cancer and of the relevance of experimental cancer research are discussed.","['Burton, A C']",['Burton AC'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Perspect Biol Med,Perspectives in biology and medicine,0401132,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Aging', 'Altitude', 'Brain Neoplasms/mortality', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Contact Inhibition', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Intestinal Neoplasms/mortality', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*mortality', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Probability', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/mortality', 'Stomach Neoplasms/mortality', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/mortality']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Perspect Biol Med. 1977 Spring;20(3):327-44. doi: 10.1353/pbm.1977.0050.,,,['10.1353/pbm.1977.0050 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

At a 3:1 ratio, Mphi in monolayers efficiently killed (51Cr release) a variety of tumor target cells without regard to antigenic specificity. Within 24 hr most of their cytolytic potential was lost. Killing could be restored, however, if Mphi were replated at higher cell densities. A soluble, heat-stable, dialyzable inhibitor of thymidine incorporation, which did not interfere with cellular proliferation, also was produced by Mphi recovered from Moloney sarcomas. The finding of such a competitive inhibitor, probably cold thymidine, in supernatants further opened to question the validity of radioisotope incorporation into DNA as a measure of Mphi-mediated cytostasis. The data presented suggest that Mphi may participate in the regression process by directly killing tumor cells, thus complementing the antigen-specific cytolytic capabilities of the T lymphocytes that are also found in large numbers within regressing Moloney sarcomas.","['Russell, S W', 'Gillespie, G Y', 'McIntosh, A T']","['Russell SW', 'Gillespie GY', 'McIntosh AT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inflammation/immunology/*pathology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', '*Neoplasm Regression, Spontaneous', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/etiology/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology']",1977/05/01 00:00,1977/05/01 00:01,['1977/05/01 00:00'],"['1977/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 May;118(5):1574-9.,,,,,,,,,,,

MAIQ-1 was shown to be among the most potent known inhibitors of the major target for the expression of antineoplastic activity by this class of agents, the enzyme ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, requiring only 0.06 micronM for 50% inhibition. This potency at the enzymatic level was consistent with its antineoplastic activity against the murine neoplasms Sarcoma 180, Leukemia L1210, Leukemia P388, and the B16 melanoma. The acetylation of the 5-amino group of the model substrate 5-amino-1,4-dimethylisoquinoline was lower than that of 5-amino-1-methylisoquinoline when incubated with acetyl-coenzyme A and rat liver homogenate. This finding suggests that the presence of the 4-methyl function offers steric hinderance to enzymatic substitution of the adjacent 5-amino group. In vivo metabolism of MAIQ-1 in mice, studied with [3'-14C]MAIQ-1 showed that relatively slow excretion of this agent occurred, since the cumulative urinary excretion of radioactivity was only 35% in 48 HR. About 51% of excreted urinary radioactivity was present in chromatograms in an area corresponding to the iron chelate of MAIQ-1, and only a minor quantity of material migrating like acetylated MAIQ-1 was present in urine, a finding consistent with enzymatic data with liver homogenates. The results indicate that MAIQ-1 has the antineoplastic activity, enzyme inhibitory potency, and relative resistance to metabolic inactivation required of an agent of this class for clinical trials.","['Agrawal, K C', 'Schenkman, J B', 'Denk, H', 'Mooney, P D', 'Moore, E C', 'Wodinsky, I', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Agrawal KC', 'Schenkman JB', 'Denk H', 'Mooney PD', 'Moore EC', 'Wodinsky I', 'Sartorelli AC']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Thiosemicarbazones)', '59261-39-1 (4-methyl-5-amino-1-formylisoquinoline thiosemicarbazone)', 'EC 1.17.4.1 (Ribonucleoside Diphosphate Reductase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Isoquinolines/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Melanoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Ribonucleoside Diphosphate Reductase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Sarcoma 180/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiosemicarbazones/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1977/06/01 00:00,1977/06/01 00:01,['1977/06/01 00:00'],"['1977/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Jun;37(6):1692-6.,,,,,,,,,,,

Chartreusin was very slowly absorbed from the small intestine, thus explaining the lack of activity when administered p.o.

This is an exceptionally large pool when compared with that found in myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative disorders with the same degree of splenomegaly. It is consistent with the histological features which show marked red cell accumulation in the splenic cord areas. The red cell pooling in the spleen thus appears to be a significant factor in the anaemia and there was fairly good correlation between the percentage of improvement in the anaemia and the percentage of red cell volume contained in the spleen. By direct measurement of the splenic red cell pool, it is possible to predict the extent to which splenectomy will benefit the anaemia and this may also provide an indirect measure of the extent of bone marrow dysfunction in the causation of the anaemia.","['Lewis, S M', 'Catovsky, D', 'Hows, J M', 'Ardalan, B']","['Lewis SM', 'Catovsky D', 'Hows JM', 'Ardalan B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Female', 'Hematocrit', 'Hemoglobins/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Lymphatic Diseases/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spleen/*cytology/pathology', 'Splenectomy', 'Time Factors']",1977/03/01 00:00,1977/03/01 00:01,['1977/03/01 00:00'],"['1977/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1977 Mar;35(3):351-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1977.tb00594.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1977.tb00594.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

They were detected by finding excess IgG on the surface of washed platelets either directly or after incubation of the serum with normal platelets. The technique used was a modification of that described recently (Dixon et al, 1975) in which the greater the amount of anti-IgG consumed by the reaction with platelets the less the subsequent lysis of sheep red cells coated with IgG. This test could be calibrated by adding known quantities of IgG to the antisera and thus the amount of bound IgG could be measured. Platelets from normal donors and those with thrombocytopenia due to non-immunological causes such as aplastic anaemia or acute leukaemia were found to have 15-70 ng IgG/10(7) platelets (mean 53 ng). 37 out of 38 thrombocytopenic patients in whom immune destruction of platelets was suspected were found to have excess IgG on their platelets ranging from 70 to 720 ng/10(7) (mean 297 ng, P less than 0.001) and there was a significant inverse correlation between this amount and the platelet count (r = 0.85, P less than 0.001). Antibody in the serum was found in 14 of 22 patients with 'idiopathic' thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), three of four patients with underlying lymphoma and in all five cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Four non-thrombocytopenic patients with autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) due to IgG on the red cells were also studied and were shown to have no increase in platelet-bound IgG. Our results confirm the work of Dixon et al (1975) that platelet antibody as excess IgG can be readily detected on the surface of platelets in patients with immune thrombocytopenia. The clinical implications of these findings are discussed.","['Hegde, U M', 'Gordon-Smith, E C', 'Worlledge, S']","['Hegde UM', 'Gordon-Smith EC', 'Worlledge S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/complications', 'Antibodies/*analysis', 'Blood Platelets/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Thrombocytopenia/*immunology']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1977 Jan;35(1):113-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1977.tb00567.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1977.tb00567.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The expression time was chosen to be 2 days for cells grown in vitro and 5 days for those grown in vivo. The dose response curve can be described as cumulative for cells grown in vitro and linear for those grown in vivo. A dose-rate effect was observed in both systems. The cells grown in vivo were less sensitive to gamma-ray with respect to both mutation rate per rad and cell killing as compared to cells grown in vitro. The delayed expression and reduced sensitivity of cells in vivo with respect to induced mutation may be due to factors such as hypoxia and/or reduced availability of essential nutrients.

The oncogenicity of the low and high passages of the cultivated cells was compared with the ascites cells. The results indicated that the oncogenic potential of the cells gradually decreased during in vitro passage. The accumulation or retention of CM antigen on the membrane of the high-passage cells suggested that their decreased oncogenic potential might be due to increased immunogenicity and/or immunosensitivity.

Immuno-depressed allogeneic mice were more resistant to lymphoma challenge when inoculated with the DIC-sublines than with the parental lines. On adoptive transfer of immune lymphocytes there was increased survival of allogeneic animals challenged with DIC cells, attributable to an additional immune response to DIC-induced antigens.

For the Colton-Kidd relationship the lod score was + 2.57. The Kidd system has earlier been tentatively assigned to chromosome 7 (Schokeir et al. 1973). The present data therefore permit a tentative assignment to chromosome 7 of the Colton system as well. The data also suggest that the discovery by Chapelle et al.

The drug-responsive tumor showed a 20:1 concentration ratio, whereas the drug-resistant tumor only had a 4:1 concentration ratio. We postulate that these differences, observed here in this animal tumor model, may be a reflection of similar ratio differences in humans.

These effects are a typical result of exposure of cellular DNA to alkylating agents or ionizing radiation. The extent of DNA damage caused by 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea has been related to the same amount of damage resulting from exposure of cells to low doses of gamma-irradiation. The rate and extent of repair of 1-(2-chloroethyl)-3-cyclohexyl-1-nitrosourea-induced damage is slow and incomplete, compared with the repair of gamma-irradiation damage to DNA.

Lymphoblasts were incubated with 2,3-dihydro-1H-imidazo[1,2-b]pyrazole in order to block them in G1-early S. The block was then reversed by incubating the cells in fresh media. Within 2 to 4 hr, approximately 90% of the cells were in S phase and, by 6 hr, approximately 80% were in late S. Aliquots of these latter cells then were incubated with podophyllotoxin to block them in G2-M. These cells divided within 4 hr of reversal of the podophyllotoxin block. Lymphoblast populations in G1-early S, mid-S, or G2-M were then incubated with 4 micronM OP. OP blocked entry of G1 cells into S as well as progression through S but had no effect on progression from G2-M to G1. The OP effects were reversed by addition of Zn2+, Cu2+, or Fe2+ or by dilution of the chelating agent in the growth media. Incubation of CCRF-CEM lymphoblasts with 1,7-phenanthroline, a nonchelating analog of OP, did not affect the cell cycle. The data indicate that OP reversibly blocks progression of cells from G1 to S and through S by chelation of metals involved in processes essential for those cell cycle events.","['Falchuk, K H', 'Krishan, A']","['Falchuk KH', 'Krishan A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Phenanthrolines)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/analysis', 'Isomerism', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/analysis/cytology/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phenanthrolines/*pharmacology', 'Zinc/metabolism']",1977/07/01 00:00,1977/07/01 00:01,['1977/07/01 00:00'],"['1977/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Jul;37(7 Pt 1):2050-6.,,,,,,,,,,,

It is noteworthy that the first case in current literature of AD-P associated with a malignancy was described in 1916. The brief clinical report of a patient with proximal muscle weakness and skin lesions, with the obvious association with a malignancy (adenocarcinoma of the stomach), describes an example that has been repeated many times with different types of tumors but with essentially no variations in the clinical findings. In 1959 Williams identified 590 cases of AD with an overall tumor rate of 15%, and recently Barnes identified 258 cases of AD associated with a malignancy. The original designation, dermatomyositis or AD, has now been expanded to include proximal muscle polymyositis with systemic involvement, which syndrome at the current state of the art is indistinguishable clinically and pathologically from AD except for the lack of skin lesions. It may be that at some future time one or more immunologic features may differnetiate the clinical entity polymyositis from AD and further subdivide each of these entitites from similar clinical syndromes associated with a malignancy. However, the problem in management in either AD or polymyositis is similar. A number of patients with a malignancy and muscle weakness or neuropathy have been reported. These associations have been mentioned briefly, but insufficient data are available to determine whether these should be considered as a variant of AD-P or only casually related conditions with certain clinical features in common. Most of the patients described in the literature of AD-P with an associated malignancy have had skin lesions; a minority only have lacked this feature. However, unless a patient is followed carefully, it is possible for a transient or evanescent erythema or insignificant skin lesions to be present and not recorded in the case record.","['Talbott, J H']",['Talbott JH'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Semin Arthritis Rheum,Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism,1306053,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Carcinoma/*complications/pathology', 'Dermatomyositis/*complications', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphoma/pathology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/pathology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/pathology']",1977/05/01 00:00,1977/05/01 00:01,['1977/05/01 00:00'],"['1977/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Arthritis Rheum. 1977 May;6(4):305-60. doi: 10.1016/0049-0172(77)90033-6.,,,"['0049-0172(77)90033-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0049-0172(77)90033-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Possible explanations of these findings are considered. Some, perhaps many, of the cases within such sibships may be due to associations between malignant disease and various genetically determined conditions at a suclinical level or in the heterozygous state. Alternatively, the observed familial aggregations may be attributable to the fact that sibs share a common environment. Childhood cancer in twins is discussed and findings compared with those from the United States. Attention is drawn to a number of interesting combinations of tumours in sibs, particularly brain tumours and bone cancers. The implications of the findings for genetic counselling are discussed; it is emphasized that, though there appears to be an increased risk that sibs of children with malignant disease will also be affected by such diseases, this amounts overall only to a doubling of the general population risk.

The degree of fluidity of the surface membrane lipid core was monitored quantitatively by fluorescence polarization analysis using the probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene embedded in lipid regions of the surface membrane of intact cells. Mobility of Con A surface receptors was determined by the cap-forming ability after binding of fluorescent Con A. The present studies were performed on lymphocytes from 28 patients with malignant lymphomas, 22 patients with leukemia, 28 individuals who either were healthy or had nonmalignant disorders, and 5 patients with carcinoma. The results showed that lymphocytes and mononuclear cells from patients with malignant lymphomas and leukemias have a more fluid lipid layer in their surface membrane than do lymphocytes obtained from healthy individuals or from patients with other malignant and nonmalignant disorders. This increase in membrane fluidity was less pronounced in lymphocytes isolated from leukemic patients in clinical remission and from leukemic patients receiving treatment with steroids. The results also show a marked difference in the cap-forming ability of lymphocytes from patients with malignant lymphomas or leukemia as compared with lymphocytes from patients with non-malignant disorders or carcinoma. Lymphocytes isolated from lymphoma and chronic lymphatic leukemia patients during remission stages of the disease exhibited a higher cap-forming ability. The cap-forming ability of cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia was unaffected by treatment with steroids. The present results, which are in line with previous observations, have shown that normal lymphocytes can be characterized by a low degree of lipid fluidity but a high degree of mobility of Con A receptors, whereas leukemic lymphocytes are characterized by a high degree of lipid fluidity but a low degree of mobility of Con A receptors. These results confirmed our general hypothesis on the dynamic interrelation between membrane lipids and membrane protein receptors, and they indicate that the widely accepted term ""membrane fluidity"" requires better consideration for different membrane components.","['Ben-Bassat, H', 'Polliak, A', 'Rosenbaum, S M', 'Naparstek, E', 'Shouval, D', 'Inbar, M']","['Ben-Bassat H', 'Polliak A', 'Rosenbaum SM', 'Naparstek E', 'Shouval D', 'Inbar M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Receptors, Concanavalin A)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)']",IM,"['Carcinoma/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Fluorometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/*metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Receptors, Concanavalin A/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Drug/*metabolism', 'Remission, Spontaneous']",1977/05/01 00:00,1977/05/01 00:01,['1977/05/01 00:00'],"['1977/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 May;37(5):1307-12.,,,,,,,,,,,

It is postulated that the cancer mortalities in the U.S. and other Western industrialized nations would decline significantly if the dietary selenium intakes were increased to approximately twice the current average amount supplied by the U.S. diet.","['Schrauzer, G N', 'White, D A', 'Schneider, C J']","['Schrauzer GN', 'White DA', 'Schneider CJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Bioinorg Chem,Bioinorganic chemistry,1305411,['H6241UJ22B (Selenium)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Breast Neoplasms/mortality', '*Diet', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', '*Selenium/blood']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bioinorg Chem. 1977;7(1):23-31. doi: 10.1016/s0006-3061(00)80126-x.,,,"['S0006-3061(00)80126-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-3061(00)80126-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Serum from CLL patients has been found to enhance viability of the leukaemic cells in culture and the interaction of these serum factors with the CLL cell membrane gives rise to rapid replacement of surface proteins.

Injection of cells and CS from non-LCL and normal human lymphocytes induced few or no lesions. Irradiated chick embryos were more sensitive to lesion formation than were nonirradiated embryos. The log10 CAM lesions induced in irradiated (500 rads) embryos were a linear function of the log10 cells (from LCL) in the inoculum; the slope was 1.0, within experimental error. The formation of CAM lesions did not depend on the presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) since lesions were also induced by cells and extracts derived from EBV genome-free LCL. Lesion-inducing activity associated with CS was filterable through 0.22-mu filters, sedimented at 78,000 x g, and sensitive to inactivation by heat (56 degrees C for 30 min), UV irradiation, chloroform, sera from chickens immunized against CS, and certain human sera. Lesion-inducing activity associated with cells and extracts was resistant to 5,000 rads of gamma-radiation. B2/B2 embryos (the B locus is the major histocompatibility locus of chickens) were more sensitive to lesion formation than were B15/B21 and outbred embryos; this suggested a genetic influence on lesion formation. Our data suggest that the irradiated chicken embryo may be a highly sensitive and useful means for the detection of an unidentified or unknown agent or agents that may play an important role in human oncogenic lymphocyte transformation or might interact with transforming viruses.","['Longenecker, B M', 'Menezes, J', 'Sanders, E J', 'Pazderka, F', 'Ruth, R F']","['Longenecker BM', 'Menezes J', 'Sanders EJ', 'Pazderka F', 'Ruth RF']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '7V31YC746X (Chloroform)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)']",IM,"['Allantois/pathology', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral', 'Bromodeoxyuridine/pharmacology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/microbiology', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chick Embryo/radiation effects', 'Chloroform/pharmacology', 'Chorion/pathology', 'Extraembryonic Membranes/*pathology', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Idoxuridine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/microbiology', 'Lymphocytes/*microbiology', 'Oncogenic Viruses/*isolation & purification', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Virology/*methods', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1977/04/01 00:00,1977/04/01 00:01,['1977/04/01 00:00'],"['1977/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1977 Apr;58(4):853-62. doi: 10.1093/jnci/58.4.853.,,,['10.1093/jnci/58.4.853 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

This chromosome translocation therefore may be an important event in the development of human lymphocytic malignancy, analogous to the occurrence of the Philadelphia chromosome rearrangement in chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['Kaiser-McCaw, B', 'Epstein, A L', 'Kaplan, H S', 'Hecht, F']","['Kaiser-McCaw B', 'Epstein AL', 'Kaplan HS', 'Hecht F']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Africa', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Child', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', 'Humans', 'Male', 'North America', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1977/04/15 00:00,1977/04/15 00:01,['1977/04/15 00:00'],"['1977/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1977 Apr 15;19(4):482-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910190408.,,,['10.1002/ijc.2910190408 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of chronic hypoxemia. There was a high correlation between the weight of individual carotid bodies in each case. Among the 12 patients with chronic hypoxemia, eight patients had carotid bodies heavier than predicted by statistical analysis. Of these eight patients, six had cystic fibrosis and two had cyanotic heart disease. Morphometric and cell population analyses of the carotid bodies from these eight patients and from those of the control population indicated that enlargement of the carotid bodies during normal or abnormal growth results from proportionate increases in lobule parenchyma and stroma. There was also an increase in the width and length of the lobules without an increase in the diameter of the cell cords or a change in the size or proportion of the chief cells. Growth and development of the carotid bodies were studied in a control group of 59 patients without chronic hypoxemia. There were no sex related differences in carotid body weights. The combined weight of the carotid bodies correlated most strongly with body weight, although there was some correlation with age and body length. A regression equation reflecting the data relating to body weight (BW) is: Combined weight of carotid bodies (in mg.) = 0.29 BW (in kg.) +3.0. Leukemic infiltrates were present in two patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia, and diffuse lymphocytic infiltration with nodule formation was present in one patient with mental retardation. Metaplastic cartilage was present in a carotid body of one patient.","['Lack, E E']",['Lack EE'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Autopsy', 'Carotid Body/anatomy & histology/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cystic Fibrosis/complications/*pathology', 'Female', 'Heart Defects, Congenital/complications/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Hypertrophy', 'Hypoxia/complications', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Organ Size']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1977 Jan;8(1):39-51. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(77)80064-6.,,,"['S0046-8177(77)80064-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(77)80064-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Long complementary DNA transcripts of the M-MLV RNA were hybridized to M-MSV RNA, and the structures of the hybrids were observed in the electron microscope. Beginning at the 5' end, the two RNAs are homologous for a region of length 2.25 kb (kilobases). In the next region, of length approximately 4.2 kb on the MLV genome, there are several homology segments between MLV and MSV, but there are also several short sequences present on MLV and deleted in MSV. There is then a major substitution loop; with a sequence (beta L) of length 2.9 kb present on MLV and missing on MSV, and a sequence (beta S) of length 1.5 kb present on MSV and missing on MLV. At the 3' end, there is a homology sequence of length 0.8 kb. On the basis of these results, other data on genes expressed in M-MSV-transformed cells, and by analogy with the avian gene map, we suggest that the gag genes (internal structural proteins) lie in the 2.25 kb region of homology near the 5' ends of M-MSV and M-MLV RNAs, and that the beta S segment contains a sarcoma (src) gene.

Cranial radiotherapy often produces signs of mild encephalopathy, with predominance of somnolence. In rare cases, it appears that CNS radiotherapy may be followed by progressive encephalopathy. Intrathecal methotrexate frequently causes symptoms of meningeal irritation. Occasionally cases of weakness and paralysis, and rare instances of severe encephalopathy, may occur. However, in leukemic children treated with intensive chemotherapy and CNS radiotherapy who develop neurological complications, it is often difficult to determine which of many possible factors may be causing the CNS symptoms. The pathogenesis of the various forms of methotrexate neurotoxicity is poorly understood. The best-established cause for these symptoms is high concentrations of methotrexate in the CSF or porlonged exposure of the brain to low CSF concentrations of methotrexate. These elevated concentrations of the drug may in turn be due to impaired elimination of the drug from the cerebrospinal fluid (usually due to overt CNS leukemia) or to increased dosage in relation to cerebrospinal fluid volume (due to adolescent age). Leukoencephalopathy is occasionally found at autopsy in children given intensive therapy with CNS radiotherapy and intrathecal methotrexate, together with intensive systemic chemotherapy. It was proposed that alteration of the blood-brain barrier by cranial radiotherapy allows systemically administered anti-leukemic drugs to enter the brain and to cause necrotic changes in the CNS white matter. Leukoencephalopathy also occurs following intraventricular administration of methotrexate. CNS-toxicity due to intrathecal cytosine arabinoside is clinically similar to the symptoms seen following intrathecal methotrexate.","['Pochedly, C']",['Pochedly C'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Brain Diseases/chemically induced', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*chemically induced/etiology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Methotrexate/*adverse effects', 'Paralysis/chemically induced', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Spinal Cord Diseases/chemically induced']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1977;3(1):101-15. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950030114.,,,['10.1002/mpo.2950030114 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Optimal conditions for freezing of both effector and target cells were quite similar. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 7.5-10.0% was employed as the cryoprotective agent and cells were frozen at the rate of -1 degrees C/minute. The handling procedures for the cells before and after freezing were important. Factors affecting recovery of functional reactivity were related to toxicity of DMSO for the cells, the osmotic stress placed upon the cells as the DMSO was being removed after thawing, the handling temperature of the freshly thawed cells, and the susceptibility of cells to mechanical damage immediately after thawing. The recovery of lymphocytes after freezing was about 70%; the recovery of cytotoxicity was around 85%. Syngeneic cytotoxic reactivity induced by inoculation with the Moloney strain of murine sarcoma virus was cryopreserved, as were allogeneic cytotoxicity and natural cytotoxic reactivity. Multiple tests employing effector cells from the same frozen pool gave reproducible results; the standard error of the mean percent cytotoxicity was less than 1.5%. Cryopreserved target cells gave decreased day-to-day variability in susceptibility to lysis, since the same population of cells could be employed in each assay.

Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases appear to exist in three general forms; 'free' enzyme of about 4-9 S, one or more 'enzyme complexes' of about 18-25 S, and in association with ribosomes. The aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity for many individual amino acids was surprisingly similar in cell types chosen to be diverse with respect to differentiation state, transformation, and growth rate. Total activity for all amino acids varied about 4-fold, based on a constant volume of cells. Embryonic tissues had a comparatively high proportion of total synthetase activity associated with ribosomes, whereas this value was relatively low for mouse liver. Distinctive distribution patterns with common and variable features were observed for individual enzymes. The only aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases found not to be associated in significant amounts with either 18-25 S enzyme complexes or ribosomes in any of the cell types examined were the enzymes for alanine, histidine, and serine. All cell types evidenced 18-25-S synthetase activity for arginine, aspartic acid, glutamine, glutamic acid, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, proline, and valine, although in quite variable porportions of the total activity observed for these amino acids. For example, of the valyl-tRNA synthetase activity not associated with ribosomes, 35% and 100% were found to sediment at 18-25 S in Friend leukemia cells and mouse liver respectively. All cells had two easily distinguishable peaks of arginyl tRNA synthetase activity at 4-9S and 18-25S respectively; however, the relative proportion of enzyme activity in the peaks differed between cell types. Phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase was not observed to occur in an 18-25-S complex in any of the cell types examined but was bound to ribosomes in variable but generally relatively high proportions. Numerous other specific differences are described. No underlying physiological or biochemical principle has been recognized to account for the specific distribution patterns observed.

In each case, the ability of a compound to bind to DNA correlate with its ability to inhibit the activity of DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (EC 2.7.7.7) extracted from mouse leukemia L1210 cells. For example, all the aromatic bis-guanylhydrazones and diamidine (hydroxystilbamidine), which were good inhibitors of the enzyme activity, showed a biphasic interaction with DNA. All the aliphatic compounds displayed no detectable interaction with DNA in the Tris buffer used, and were also poor inhibitors of the polymerase activity. Interaction of decamethylene diguanide (Synthalin with DNA could not be determined because the compound does not absorb light in the UV-VIS region. However, in similarity with other aliphatic compounds, this agent was a poor inhibitor of DNA polymerase reduction. The p-quinone-bis(guanyl-hydrazone) and p-phenylbenzaldehyde-monoguanylhydrazone showed only a monophasic interaction with DNA and caused an intermediate inhibition of the enzyme activity. When tested for possible anti-leukemic activity against i.p. L1210 leukemia in syngeneic DBA/2J mice, all the aromatic bis-guanylhydrazones as well as hydroxystilbamidine caused prolongation of survival of tumor-bearing mice. Among the aliphatic bisguanylhydrazones, all of which showed no binding to DNA and caused at the most only a very slight inhibition of DNA polymerase, only methylglyoxal-bis(guanylhydrazone) (CH3--G) had antileukemic activity. Synthalin also inhibited leukemia growth. Evidences presented indicate that the mechanisms of action of aliphatic and aromatic bisguanylhydrazones may be quite different. Furthermore, the ability to bind to DNA may be a useful criterion to predict the antileukemic activity of aromatic guanylhydrazones and possibly other aromatic-bis-cationic compounds, but not that of aliphatic congeners.","['Dave, C', 'Ehrke, M J', 'Mihich, E']","['Dave C', 'Ehrke MJ', 'Mihich E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Hydrazones)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Female', 'Hydrazones/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymus Gland']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1977 Jan;16(1):57-68. doi: 10.1016/0009-2797(77)90153-3.,,,"['0009-2797(77)90153-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0009-2797(77)90153-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Effects of alpha-methyl-(+/-)-ornithine and methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) on growth and polyamine content of L1210 leukemic cells of mice.,249-53,"L1210 leukemic cells of mice were incubated for a period of two generations in the presence of either alpha-methyl-(+/-)-ornithine, an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase, or methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydroazone), an inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase. alpha-Methyl-(+/-)-ornithine produced a 50% decrease in spermidine levels, reduced putrescine to nondetectable levels, and caused a slight increase in spermine levels of the cells. However, DNA content of the cell suspension was not altered by alpha-methyl-(+/-) ornithine. Thus putrescine and 50% of the cellular content of spermidine are not essential for DNA synthesis in these cells. Methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) produced a large increase inputrescine levels, the same decrease in spermidine levels as did alpha-methyl-(+/-)-ornithine, and approximately a 45% decrease in spermine levels. These changes were accompanied by a large decrease in the DNA content of the cell suspension. Since the two inhibitors caused a similar decrease in spermidine levels, it is unlikely that the inhibition of DNA synthesis by methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) is a result of a decrease in the cellular levels of spermidine. Rather, it seems likely that methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) inhibits DNA synthesis through a mechanism other than a decrease in polyamine levels.","['Newton, N E', 'Abdel-Monem, M M']","['Newton NE', 'Abdel-Monem MM']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'E524N2IXA3 (Ornithine)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Guanidines/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mitoguazone/*pharmacology', 'Ornithine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/metabolism', 'Polyamines/*metabolism', 'Putrescine/metabolism', 'Spermidine/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Spermine/metabolism']",1977/02/01 00:00,1977/02/01 00:01,['1977/02/01 00:00'],"['1977/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1977 Feb;20(2):249-53. doi: 10.1021/jm00212a012.,,,['10.1021/jm00212a012 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Sensitivity and specificity of the assays and characteristics of effector and sensitizing cells.,331-7,"Three assays of cell-mediated cytotoxicity in mice, involving release of either 51Cr (CRA), 125iododeoxyuridine (IRA), or [3H]proline (PRA), were compared under identical test conditions. Experiments were performed with effector cells from mice immunized with FBL-3 tumor cells, a syngeneic Friend virus-induced leukemia, or with allogeneic normal spleen cells. With established tissue culture cells as targets, similar results were obtained in all three assays. The cytotoxicity produced by cells from in vivo-immunized mice and the induction of cytotoxicity in vitro were T-cell-dependent. When short-term culture target cells were used, the IRA gave a more selective pattern of cytotoxicity than did the other two assays. However, when remaining target cells at the end of the assay were treated with trypsin, higher levels of 125iododeoxyuridine (125IUDR) release were seen, and the results were then comparable to those in the CRA and PRA.

It was found that several parameters could affect considerably the results obtained with these tests, such as: baseline controls, preparation of target cells, and methods of calculation. In comparison of three different baseline controls, the normal control gave the most consistent results, whereas the other two controls (autologous and medium controls) gave varying results depending upon the condition of the target cells. For use as target cells, established tissue culture cells were usually superior because of a much lower spontaneous release of the isotope, when compared to fresh ascites tumor cells or short-term tissue culture cells. The advantage of established culture cells was particularly noted in isotopic assays with prolonged incubation (20-40 hr). In addition, the methods used for calculation were also shown to affect the apparent outcome of the results.","['Ting, C C', 'Park, J Y', 'Nunn, M E', 'Herberman, R B']","['Ting CC', 'Park JY', 'Nunn ME', 'Herberman RB']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic/*methods', 'Idoxuridine/metabolism', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*immunology', 'Proline/metabolism', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'Tritium']",1977/02/01 00:00,1977/02/01 00:01,['1977/02/01 00:00'],"['1977/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1977 Feb;58(2):323-30. doi: 10.1093/jnci/58.2.323.,,,['10.1093/jnci/58.2.323 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The increase in DNA synthesis correlated with an increase in tumor cell number in the cultures. The adherent PEC population was responsible for most of the enhancement. This effect was abrogated by pretreating the adherent cells with the metabolic inhibitors iodoacetamide, KCN, NaF, and dinitrophenol, or with glutaraldehyde, or by heating at 56 degrees. Pretreatment with mitomycin C did not eliminate the stimulatory effect. PEC supernatants did not enhance tumor growth, but effector-to-target cell proximity was shown to be necessary for stimulation. PEC from tumor-immunized mice also stimulated tumor target cell growth, but to a consistently smaller degree than did nonimmune PEC. This immune inhibition correlated with in vivo survival of mice to live tumor challenge and with ability of effector cells to increase life-span in adoptive immunity tests. Differential production of thymidine by normal and immune PEC appeared not to be a factor in these assays. Fractionation of PEC showed that the immune nonadherent cells were inhibitory in vitro and were able to increase survival time in adoptive immunity tests. On the other hand, the adherent PEC from immune mice either inhibited, stimulated, or had no effect on tumor cell DNA synthesis, compared with nonimmune adherent PEC, thus exhibiting no correlation with the immune status of the donor. In one example, administration of the macrophage activator lipopolysaccharide to mice resulted in PEC that were inhibitory in the in vitro assay, although the agent did not produce in vivo immunity. The inhibition of tumor DNA synthesis assay, with unfractionated PEC, exhibited a consistent correlation with the immune status of the host when mice were sensitized to lymphoma cells. However, the variable influence of the adherent PEC population on tumor growth reduced or nullified the immune inhibitory effect in a few cases.","['Gordon, W C', 'Prager, M D']","['Gordon WC', 'Prager MD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/cytology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis', 'Female', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunization', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1977/02/01 00:00,1977/02/01 00:01,['1977/02/01 00:00'],"['1977/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Feb;37(2):507-13.,,,,,,,,,,,

Host DBA/2 mice were treated with methotrexate, after which leukemic cells were harvested from ascitic fluid and levels of methotrexate and metabolites in them were determined by Sephadex G-15 gel chromatography. The level of methotrexate in L1210/MTX cells was 12.5 times greater than that in L1210 cells, reflecting the increased level of dihydrofolate reductase that characterizes this mutant cell line. Synthesis of methotrexate polyglutamates in each cell line required a dose of methotrexate (2.4 mg/kg) 10 times greater than the dose that yielded extensive methotrexate polyglutamate synthesis in rat liver and kidney in previous studies. Total methotrexate polyglutamates synthesized in 4 hr with this dose were the same in each cell line, demonstrating that this metabolism was not affected by differences in the level of dihydrofolate reductase. Methotrexate polyglutamates comprised 47+/-20% of the total methotrexate in L1210 cells. Methotrexate diglutamate was the predominant form. Levels of methotrexate monoglutamate and diglutamate were similar in L1210/MTX cells, whereas methotrexate monoglutamate was the predominant metabolite in host liver, kidney, and small intestine. These differences may reflect differences in substrate preference of pteroylpolyglutamate synthetase in these different tissues. Twenty-four hr after methotrexate administration, total methotrexate in L1210 cells was one-third of that at 4 hr; but the proportion of metabolites was the same, presumably reflecting cell death and division rather than loss of a freely exchangeable portion of intracellular methotrexate present at the earlier time. The affinity of methotrexate polyglutamates for dihydrofolate reductase was found to be similar to that of methotrexate, providing evidence that these metabolites may be as potent antagonists of folate metabolism as is methotrexate itself. Recent studies indicate that inhibition of folate metabolism in cells requires their exposure to high levels of methotrexate in order to achieve intracellular levels of methotrexate greater than needed to bind to dihydrofolate reductase. Such conditions conform to those required for synthesis of methotrexate polyglutamates. Thus, these metabolites may play a specific role in inhibiting folate metabolism, distinct from the antifolate potential that they appear to share with methotrexate.","['Whitehead, V M']",['Whitehead VM'],['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Peptides)', '25513-46-6 (Polyglutamic Acid)', '82334-40-5 (methotrexate polyglutamate)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Glutamates/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', '*Peptide Biosynthesis', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Polyglutamic Acid/analogs & derivatives', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",1977/02/01 00:00,1977/02/01 00:01,['1977/02/01 00:00'],"['1977/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Feb;37(2):408-12.,,,,,,,,,,,

Conversely the anti-leukaemic effects of 2 courses of methotrexate, in terms of time of onset of leukaemia and time of death in rats transplanted with a syngeneic T-cell leukaemia, are shown to be similar when courses of methotrexate are separated by between 2 and 12 days. Thus in this system, chemotherapeutic schedules using methotrexate may be designed on the basis of minimal host toxicity without prejudicing anti-leukaemic effects. These results are discussed in relation to toxicity and anti-leukaemic effects observed during UKALL trials of treatment in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.","['Harding, B', 'Culvenor, J', 'MacLennan, I C']","['Harding B', 'Culvenor J', 'MacLennan IC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Body Weight/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Count', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Methotrexate/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Neutrophils', 'Rats', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1977 Jan;35(1):40-51. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1977.2.,,PMC2025304,['10.1038/bjc.1977.2 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

These surface features distinguishing LRE cells from lymphocytes and monocytes were appreciated by both SEM and TEM. In addition, TEM revealed significant differences in the incidence of certain ultrastructural alterations. Whereas nuclear pockets were rare in lre cells, they were relatively frequent in lymphocytes of other hematologic disorders. The inclusions of ribosome-lamella complexes were not only more prevalent in patients with LRE but were seen in a higher percentage of leukemic cells from patients with LRE than in those from patients with other hematologic disorders.

In the studies presented here, we evaluated whether in vitro sensitization of immune lymphoid cells before systemic transfer to a nonimmune recipient allows for more effective transfer of tumor immunity. The results show that the passive transfer of immune spleen cells after in vitro cocultivation with mitomycin-treated (C58NT)D cells allows for inhibition of growth of a subcutaneous inoculum of lymphoma cells. In contrast, spleen cells obtained 4 to 6 weeks after primary sensitization or after secondary in vivo sensitization did not effectively confer anti-tumor immunity. As few as 5 x 107 in vitro sensitized cells permitted complete inhibition of 106 (C58NT)D cells and also allowed for inhibition of the growth of 107 (C58NT)D-F cells, which was lethal to control animals. Immune cells sensitized with syngeneic thymocytes or normal spleen cells sensitized with (C58NT)D cells in vitro did not confer in vivo anti-tumor immunity. After systemic transfer of in vitro sensitized cells, delayed hypersensitivity occurred at the site of tumor inoculation and tumor growth was suppressed. Specificity of the passive immunity was shown by the failure to inhibit growth of a polyoma virus-induced sarcoma in rats which inhibited growth of the Gross virus-induced lymphoma cells. In vitro sensitized cells were more effective in the transfer of anti-tumor protection after 5 days, as compared to 2 days, of cocultivation with tumor. Results show that in vitro sensitized cells can effectively transfer systemic tumor immunity.","['Bernstein, I D']",['Bernstein ID'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mitomycins)']",IM,"['*AKR murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed/immunology', '*Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunization, Passive', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunotherapy', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/therapy', 'Mitomycins/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred WF', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Jan;118(1):122-8.,,,,,,,,,,,

The interferon was tested and identified by the species-specificity, thermostability and antigenic specificity. During 3 months (the observation period) after a single inoculation of chicken mRNA-IF the L-1210 and BSC cells in response to induction with poly: C produced the homologous (mouse or monkey) and heterologous (chicken) interferons without any signs of decline of the latter's production. Titres of the heterologous interferon exceeded those of homologous interferon by approximately 10-fold. The dynamics of production of chicken interferon after induction and the sensitivity of this process to actinomycin D permit a conclusion on similar mechanisms of transcription and translation of homologous and heterologous interferons. It is suggested that integration of the genetic information for synthesis of chicken interferon with the genome of heterogenous cells may be a possible mechanism of this phenomenon.","['Ershov, F I', 'Tazulakhova, E B', 'Sokolova, T M', 'Kadyrova, A A', 'Novokhatskii, A S']","['Ershov FI', 'Tazulakhova EB', 'Sokolova TM', 'Kadyrova AA', 'Novokhatskii AS']",['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Vopr Virusol,Voprosy virusologii,0417337,"['0 (Interferon Inducers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'Fibroblasts', 'Genetic Code', '*Genetic Engineering', 'Haplorhini', 'Humans', '*Interferon Inducers', 'Interferons/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia L1210', '*RNA, Messenger/administration & dosage/isolation & purification', 'Species Specificity']",1976/11/01 00:00,1976/11/01 00:01,['1976/11/01 00:00'],"['1976/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vopr Virusol. 1976 Nov-Dec;(6):707-13.,Vydelenie mRNK dlia interferona i ee integratsiia v genom chuzherodnogo khoziaina,,,,,,,,,,

RAC positive and T.D. negative occurred in 68 cases; T.D. positive and RAC negative in the other 43. Repetition of the RAC on 100 sera (after complement inactivation at 56 degrees C for 30 min; after permanence at 4 degrees C for 7 days; after congealment at -18 degrees C) has always given the same results obtained on fresh sera. The complement, therefore, has no way influence on the RAC. The study of disagreeing cases has shown the RAC become positive for: 1) an apperance in serum of abnormal lipoproteins (chloestasis, cholangitis, some dislipemias), 2) a rise in gamma-M (biliary cirrhosis, macroglobulinaemia, lymphatic chronic leukema); 3) 1 and 2. It is always necessary to perform T.D. and RAC on the same serum, because these two test express different modification of the serum-proteins picture.

Moreover, knowledge of the specificities of the surface Ig of neoplastic lymphocytes might suggest the nature of agents involved in the generation of the disease.

In vitro studies have provided evidence for immune reactions to leukaemia in man. However, the antigens involved in such reactions are far from being fully identified. Serological studies of the human leukaemia associated antigens have been developed with xenoantisera raised in a variety of animal species, and with human sera obtained either from patients or from some normal individuals. It appears that the xenoantisera and the few human sera yet obtained do not detect the same antigenic structures. Schematically, one can assume that the rabbit antisera react with antigen(s) common to acute leukaemias or even to the four main leukaemia types; primate antisera react with the lymphoid leukaemias (both acute and chronic) or with the myeloid leukaemias. On the other hand, human sera appear to react in a different way, and several antigenic specificities may thus be detected on the cells of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias.

Cross-reactivity with antigens of animal oncornaviruses or of animal leukaemias has been shown with some of the antisera used. The serological identification of human leukaemia associated antigens aims at two different goals: a better control of the promizing immunotherapy attempts as well as a new insight in the etiology of human leukaemias.","['Dore, J F', 'Bertoglio, J', 'Guibout, C']","['Dore JF', 'Bertoglio J', 'Guibout C']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immune Sera)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Haplorhini/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera/isolation & purification', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Rabbits/immunology', 'Species Specificity']",1976/07/01 00:00,1976/07/01 00:01,['1976/07/01 00:00'],"['1976/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1976 Jul-Sep;63(3):353-70.,Les antigenes associes aux leucemies humaines,,,,,,,,,106,

Unusual findings included the rarity of rose spots, patients with fever as their only symptom, two patients with transient papilledema, and two others with peripheral blood smears suggestive of acute leukemia.

Systemic and specific tumor immunity was demonstrated in mice in which tumor growth was suppressed. Tumor growth was also suppressed by oil-attached CWS of BCG or N. rubra in autochthonous autografts of spontaneous mammary adenocarcinoma and methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma in mice. The intravenous injection of oil-attached BCG-CWS prevents the appearance of lung cancer in rabbits by the instillation of chemical carcinogens. It was also shown that treatment with oil-attached BCG-CWS was able to elevate the immunologically depressed state of tumor-bearing mice to a normal level, as determined by a cell-mediated cytotoxicity assay that empolyed chromium release as the standard. Preliminary results suggest that oil-attached BCG-CWS is useful as an immunotherapeutic agent for both lung cancer and for malignant melanoma, leukemia, Hodgkin's disease, and other neoplastic diseases and that this agent operates without any significant complications.","['Yamamura, Y', 'Azuma, I', 'Taniyama, T', 'Sugimura, K', 'Hirao, F', 'Tokuzen, R', 'Okabe, M', 'Nakahara, W', 'Yasumoto, K', 'Ohta, M']","['Yamamura Y', 'Azuma I', 'Taniyama T', 'Sugimura K', 'Hirao F', 'Tokuzen R', 'Okabe M', 'Nakahara W', 'Yasumoto K', 'Ohta M']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,"['0 (BCG Vaccine)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Oils)']",IM,"['Animals', '*BCG Vaccine', 'Cell Wall/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/immunology/prevention & control/therapy', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mitogens', 'Mycobacterium bovis/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology/pathology/therapy', 'Nocardia/immunology', 'Oils', 'Rabbits', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1976;277(00):209-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb41699.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb41699.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Electron microscopy of the bone marrow shows single fibroblastic cells with numerous slender cytoplasmic processes randomly dispersed among the hairy cells.

Using a combined cytochemical radioautographic method the tartrate resistant isoenzyme of the acid phosphatase and immunological markers could be demonstrated simultaneously on single cells. Surface immunoglobulins were detected by 125I-labelled (Fab')2-fragments of monospecific anti-heavy-chain-antibodies. In two patients only mu- and delta-determinants were found on the isoenzyme-positive hairy cells; in one patient 86% and in the other 44% of these cells carried both heavy chains on the same cell. Another patient showed both gamma- and delta-chains on the isoenzyme-positive cells and the fourth patient gamma-chains only. When the hairy cells of one patient were cultured in vitro in human serum-free medium for 14 days, mu- and delta-determinants were found just as on freshly isolated cells suggesting that hairy cells synthesize immunoglobulins. By indirect immunofluorescence the surface-Ig on hairy cells was shown to be capped very rapidly at room temperature. The concentrated surface-Ig was found over that cytoplasmic area where most of the ingested latex particles were located. In addition, using 125I-labelled aggregated human IgG (M.W. 5-15 X 10(6)), Fc-receptors were found on virtually all of the isoenzyme-containing hairy cells in all four patients. Furthermore, a distinct, low-degree stimulation of the isoenzyme-positive hairy cells could be demonstrated when the cells were cultured in the presence of pokeweed mitogen or Lima-bean lectin (B- and T-cell-mitogens), whereas no stimulation was observed by phytohemagglutinin and concanavalin A (T-cell-mitogens). In three patients studied, isoenzyme-positive hairy cells were negative with regard to rosette formation with sheep erythrocytes.","['Rieber, E P', 'Heyden, H W', 'Linke, R P', 'Saal, J G', 'Riethmuller, G', 'Waller, H D']","['Rieber EP', 'Heyden HW', 'Linke RP', 'Saal JG', 'Riethmuller G', 'Waller HD']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Wochenschr,Klinische Wochenschrift,2985205R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Humans', 'Immune Adherence Reaction', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/analysis', 'Isoenzymes/analysis', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Monocytes', 'Phagocytosis', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis']",1976/11/01 00:00,1976/11/01 00:01,['1976/11/01 00:00'],"['1976/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Klin Wochenschr. 1976 Nov 1;54(21):1011-9. doi: 10.1007/BF01469246.,"Haarzell-Leukamie.

This pattern was also found on nonneoplastic granulocytes from patients with leukemoid reactions as well as on granulocytes from normal individuals. These findings suggested that both leukemia cells and nonneoplastic granulocytes had IgG bound to the cell surface by an Fc receptor. This binding of IgG by granulocytes was not tumor-specific and appeared to correlate both with the degree of differentiation and possibly with the degree of activation of the granulocytes.

The effect of malignant disease.,593-604,"Spontaneous human lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity (SLMC) against tumour-cell targets was examined in a series of patients with localized or malignant disease, both treated and untreated, and patients with untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The level of SLMC was assessed by means of two previously established assay systems; the xenogeneic assay involving the mouse mastocytoma line P815, and the allogeneic assay in which the human chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived line, K562, was used. The assay systems involve the use of Ficoll-Isopaque-separated, iron-plus-magnetism-purified lymphocytes in an overnight 51chromium release assay, and reflect the cytotoxic ability of human non-T, complement receptor-, Fc receptor-positive lymphocytes. In the present paper, lymphocytes from all normal donors tested showed significant activity in the SLMC assay, with some variation from day to day. This variation was markedly reduced when different normal donors were tested on the same day and under identical experimental conditions. In contrast, lymphocytes from many patients with malignant disease had decreased SLM activity, and this decrease was highly significant in patients with treated or untreated metastatic disease, or untreated CLL. This was also the case when the data were expressed relative to the number of cytotoxic cells in the normal control population, or in comparison to the relative SLMC activity of lymphocytes from patients with other conditions. Markedly decreased SLMC was observed in some patients in spite of normal T and B lymphocyte proportions, or the presence of the ability to mount a vigorous delayed hypersensitivity reaction to PPD. A comparison of the xenogeneic and allogeneic assays showed that the same information with respect to whether SLMC was normal or abnormal was obtained with both assays in the majority of cases. The significance of the data is discussed with respect to the possible role of SLMC in vivo and the relevance of SLMC to the assessment of specific cell-mediated cytotoxicity in malignant disease.","['Pross, H F', 'Baines, M G']","['Pross HF', 'Baines MG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Complement System Proteins', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1976/11/15 00:00,1976/11/15 00:01,['1976/11/15 00:00'],"['1976/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1976/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1976 Nov 15;18(5):593-604. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910180508.,,,['10.1002/ijc.2910180508 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

However, Burkitt lymphoma, the malignancy in man for which there is a great amount of circumstantial evidence for a viral cancer, has a clonal origin. Of particular interest is the demonstration that early relapses after remissions of Burkitt lymphoma represent reemergence of the original malignant cell lines, whereas some late recurrences may be the result of newly induced malignant clones. Similarly, some recurrences of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in patients treated with marrow transplantation may be new occurrences of disease. These observations have important implications for the etiology and pathogenesis of Burkitt lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Fialkow, P J']",['Fialkow PJ'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Birth Defects Orig Artic Ser,Birth defects original article series,0003403,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/enzymology/*genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Clone Cells', '*Genes', '*Genetic Linkage', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis', 'Heterozygote', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/*genetics', 'Mosaicism', 'Neurofibromatosis 1/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Sex Chromosomes', 'Warts/enzymology']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Birth Defects Orig Artic Ser. 1976;12(1):123-32.,,,,,,,,,,,

Low serum B12 levels can be measured with considerable precision by microbiological assay with the Euglena gracilis assay and B12 deficiency can be recognised with a high level of consistency by either the Euglena or L. leichmannii assays. Either method is ideally suited for the assay of large numbers of specimens. The Lactobacillus leichmanii technique requires preliminary extraction of protein and it has been suggested that this may be a source of inaccuracy. 2. The radioisotope dilution assay should be the ideal method of measuring B12 levels in small or moderate numbers of specimens for it is a simple method that can be carried out in any laboratory with suitable counting equipment. After many false starts the conditions required for accurate assay are now understood. Each of 40 to 50 radioisotopic dilution techniques that have been introduced claims to be capable of differentiating B12 deficiency from control subjects but the reported correlations between the actual levels found in the two different assays are variable and the levels may be much higher with some radioisotopic methods. 3. The subnormal serum levels which are found in pernicious anaemia with all these techniques indicate severe reduction of the liver B12 level. A low serum B12 level in other conditions has, in the absence of associated folate or iron deficiency, the same significance. If the fall in the serum B12 level is associated with folate or iron deficiency, the tissue B12 levels are usually reduced but not to the low levels found in B12 deficiency states. 4. In practice, a subnormal B12 level is a valuable pointer not only to unsuspected pernicious anaemia but also to other gastrointestinal or nutritional disorders. The significance of a fall in the B12 level can only be understood if its cause is defined by a full clinical and gastroenterological investigation. 5. Falsely low serum B12 levels are found under certain iatrogenic conditions and B12 levels may be normal in spite of cellular deficiency of B12 under the rare circumstances of pernicious anaemia being associated with chronic myeloid leukaemia or when there is deficiency of TC 2.","['Mollin, D L', 'Anderson, B B', 'Burman, J F']","['Mollin DL', 'Anderson BB', 'Burman JF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Transcobalamins)', '9008-12-2 (Intrinsic Factor)', 'P6YC3EG204 (Vitamin B 12)', 'PQ6CK8PD0R (Ascorbic Acid)', 'W78I7AY22C (Deoxyuridine)']",IM,"['Anemia, Megaloblastic/blood', 'Anemia, Pernicious/blood', 'Ascorbic Acid/pharmacology', '*Biological Assay', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Deoxyuridine/metabolism', 'Euglena gracilis/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Folic Acid Deficiency/blood', 'Humans', 'Intrinsic Factor/metabolism', 'Lactobacillus/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications/blood', '*Radioisotope Dilution Technique', 'Transcobalamins/metabolism', 'Vitamin B 12/*blood/metabolism', 'Vitamin B 12 Deficiency/blood']",1976/10/01 00:00,1976/10/01 00:01,['1976/10/01 00:00'],"['1976/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1976 Oct;5(3):521-46.,,,,,,,,,,144,

Leucocytes from 16 to 22 AML patients had a similar or lower percentage than normal lymphocyte HEA-RFC, which could be explained by the dilution of peripheral blood leucocytes by poorly or non-rosetting leukaemic blasts. Ten of these 16 patients were diagnosed as having acute myeloblasts leukaemia. Six of the 22 AML patients had high HEA-RFC values of which 5 were diagnosed as having myelomonocytic leukaemia. Cytocentrifuge preparations of HEA-RFC showed that the proportion able to form rosettes was lower in myeloblasts than in monoblasts.

First, lectin and cells were allowed to interact under conditions in which shear forces were minimized and the degree of agglutination was evaluated microscopically by the appearance and size of the cell aggregates. This assay demonstrated that concanavalin A (con A)-, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)- or Ricinus communis agglutinin I (RCAI)-mediated cytoagglutination was unaffected (WGA and RCAI) or somewhat enhanced (con A) by prior fixation of the cells with glutaraldehyde. Secondly, an electronic particle counter was used to measure the disappearance of single cells and concomitant appearance of cell aggregates as a function of the lectin concentration. In this assay, in which the aggregated cells are subjected to significant shear forces during dilution and cell counting, agglutination of GRSL cells by each of the 3 lectins was drastically inhibited by prior fixation of the cells with glutaraldehyde. This assay also demonstrated enhanced nonlectin-induced cell aggregation after fixation. In both cytoagglutination assays about the same lectin concentration was required for threshold agglutination of unfixed cells. Comparatively, the results of the 2 cytoagglutination assays indicate that a fraction of the lectin-mediated bonds between unfixed cells is shear resistant and that fixation of the cells either weakens these bonds or inhibits their formation. Morphologically, cells prefixed with glutaraldehyde were sperical at all lectin concentrations, with a continuous dense distribution of cell surface-bound con A, labelled directly with haemocyanin or indirectly using the peroxidase-diaminobenzidine reaction. Unfixed cells showed angular and toadstool-shaped deformations, especially at the highest lectin concentrations, the agglutinating surfaces being flattened against each other over extended areas. The distribution of con A label was continuous and dense between the apposed surfaces and discontinuous on free surfaces. In the presence of con A the free surfaces of prefixed cells exhibited more microvilli than the surfaces of non-prefixed cells. These results favour the view that fixation prevents the formation of shear-resistant, lectin-mediated bonds between cells, not by restricting the lateral mobility of lectin receptors, but by impairing the apposition of rigid cell surfaces.","['Van Blitterswijk, W J', 'Walborg, E F Jr', 'Feltkamp, C A', 'Hilkmann, H A', 'Emmelot, P']","['Van Blitterswijk WJ', 'Walborg EF Jr', 'Feltkamp CA', 'Hilkmann HA', 'Emmelot P']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,"['0 (Aldehydes)', '0 (Lectins)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'T3C89M417N (Glutaral)']",IM,"['Agglutination/*drug effects', 'Aldehydes/*pharmacology', 'Cell Aggregation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Concanavalin A/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Glutaral/*pharmacology', 'Lectins/*pharmacology']",1976/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1976/08/01 00:00'],"['1976/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1976/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1976 Aug;21(3):579-94.,,,,,,,,,,,

A structured approach to the management of fever was then devised and evaluated during a third period. Among a total of 104 patients with AML, 77 were febrile at presentation. Only agranulocytic patients (15%) had severe infection, while 43% had localized sites which responded to specific antibiotic therapy. The remainder (42%) had fever functionally attributed to leukemia. In contrast, life-threatening infection occurred in most patients (90%) after antileukemic treatment was begun. During the trial therapy period, the empiric use of carbenicillin-gentamicin for fever greater than or equal to 101 degree F during aplasia reduced the incidence of sepsis from 90 to 30% and of bacteremia from 50 to 23%. The fall in the incidence of blood and localized site cultures positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 65 to 15% corresponded to a reduction in the number of distinct organisms per site from 1.6 to 1.0. These data suggest that hematogenously born invasion of infected sites by endogenous organisms has been prevented. Aplastic patients with fever responded to therapy by defervescing (54%) or improving clinically (34%). Stopping antibiotics once started while evaluating persistent fever was detrimental. Although the early empiric use of amphotericin B reduced the incidence of fungemia, its proper use in fever management is yet to be determined.","['Burke, P J', 'Braine, H G', 'Rathbun, H K', 'Owens, A H Jr']","['Burke PJ', 'Braine HG', 'Rathbun HK', 'Owens AH Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Johns Hopkins Med J,The Johns Hopkins medical journal,0072456,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Gentamicins)', 'G42ZU72N5G (Carbenicillin)']",IM,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy', 'Carbenicillin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fever/*drug therapy', 'Gentamicins/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Pseudomonas Infections/drug therapy', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors']",1976/07/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1976/07/01 00:00'],"['1976/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1976/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Johns Hopkins Med J. 1976 Jul;139(1):1-12.,,,,,,,,,,,

Characterization as a glycoprotein.,661-5,"Rat basophilic leukemia cells were labeled either enzymically with 125I or biosynthetically by culture in the presence of 14C-glucosamine or 3H-amino-acids and then extracted with NP-40. IgE-anti-IgE precipitates insolubilized a radiolabeled macromolecule from these extracts largely or entirely absent in control IgG-anti-IgG percipitates. When specific precipitates were boiled in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS, most of the 14C or 125I radioactivity was in the area corresponding to an apparent m.w of 60,000 to 70,000 in 5.9% gels. In 10% and 12% gels, faster mobility was demonstrated indicating an atypical electrophoretic behavior often associated with glycoproteins and a presumptive m.w. of 50,000 or less. Since only IgE-containing precipitates localized label in this region and since such precipitates from cells saturated with IgE prior to surface iodination failed to show this band, the labeled macromolecule appears to be the IgE receptor itself. Analysis of the acid hydrolysates of precipitated 14C radioactivity demonstrated that label was entirely in hexosamines and sialic acid. 125I and 14C labels in the recepotr region were eliminated almost completely with pepsin and pronase and to a lesser extent with trypsin.","['Kulczycki, A Jr', 'McNearney, T A', 'Parker, C W']","['Kulczycki A Jr', 'McNearney TA', 'Parker CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Basophils/*immunology', '*Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Glucosamine/metabolism', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis', '*Immunoglobulin E', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Peptide Hydrolases', 'Rats']",1976/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1976/08/01 00:00'],"['1976/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1976/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1976 Aug;117(2):661-5.,,,,,,,,,,,

The median survival from diagnosis was 30 mo for 52 patients with kappa-LCD and 10 mo for 45 patients with lambda-LCD (p less than 0.0007). A lower proportion of kappa-LCD patients (15.7%) than lambda-LCD patients (42.2%) died within the first 6 mo after diagnosis. The survival of the remaining patients with kappa-LCD was still much longer than of those with lambda-LCD (p = 0.022). The shorter survival of lambda-LCD patients could not be ascribed to an increased incidence of recognized manifestations indicating a poor prognosis (e.g., anemia, hypercalcemia, azotemia, low albumin, the extent of osteolytic lesions, or proteinuria), the incidence of amyloidosis, the clinical stage of the disease at diagnosis, or the response to treatment, and remains unexplained. A comparison of the clinical manifestations of LCD with those of other myelomas revealed some differences. LCD patients were slightly younger than IgA and IgG patients but older than IgD patients. A 1:1 ratio of males to females was similar to the ratios in IgA and IgG myeloma, but differed from the 3:1 ratio reported for IgD myeloma. Plasma-cell leukemia developed in 7/97 LCD patients, an incidence that was higher than has been reported in other myelomas. The initial BUN was more than or equal to 30 mg/100 ml in 54 of 95 LCD patients, an incidence that was higher than has been reported for IgA and IgG myeloma, but lower than the incidence in IgD myeloma.

Early uncritical attempts to treat the graft rather than the host were received with skepticism because of the prevailing belief that the alloantigens on cell surfaces are immutable. However, over the past decade unequivocal evidence has accumulated that the immunogenicity of allografts is susceptible to alteration. Short-term maintenance in vitro of malignant and normal tissue grafts, such as those of the ovary and thyroid. Weakens their susceptibility to rejection. Various agents have been identified which, when applied to tissues or organs in vitro, have a similar effect. Soaking skin in media containing steroids, urethane, thalidomide, antilymphocyte globulin (ALG), and specific alloantibody is also effective. X-irradiation and perfusion of allogeneic dog kidneys with solutions of concanavalin A or of nucleic acid prepared from the future donor or even from indifferent donors or microoorganisms lead to extended survival. There is also equivocal evidence that soaking mouse skin grafts in RNA prepared from unrelated donors causes them to be treated as allogeneic by syngeneic recipients. Skin from animals suffering from certain diseases displays altered immunogenicity. Skin from mice suffering from virus-induced leukemia or lymphocytic choriomeningitis is frequently rejected by syngeneic recipients. By contrast, skin allografts from some cancer patients and from mice bearing certain tumors give evidence of prolonged survival as do grafts from uremic mice. Some treatments of prospective donors, including cytotoxic drugs, ALG, specific alloantisera, hypoxia, and experimentally produced uremia, also extend the lives of allografts. Trophoblast, a fetal epithelial tissue in immediate contact with maternal tissue, represents a natural example of graft adaptation. Despite its origin from precursor cells with normal transplantation properties, trophoblast fails to elicit transplantation immunity and is unaffected by it. Some of the disparate agents or procedures described here probably act by modifying grafts in such a way that they are more likely to evoke ""blocking"" or enhancing antibodies rather than the usual destructive cellular immunity, and many of them deplete the grafts of immunogenically effective ""passenger"" leukocytes. Both of these processes contribute to apparent hypoantigenicity.","['Billingham, R E']",['Billingham RE'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Invest Dermatol,The Journal of investigative dermatology,0426720,"['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '3IN71E75Z5 (Urethane)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'T3C89M417N (Glutaral)']",IM,"['Adrenal Cortex Hormones/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anterior Chamber/surgery', '*Antibody Formation', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/pharmacology', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'DNA/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Glutaral/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kidney/radiation effects', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Parathyroid Glands/transplantation', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA/pharmacology', 'Radiation Effects', 'Skin Transplantation', '*Transplantation Immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Trophoblasts/immunology', 'Urethane/pharmacology', 'X-Rays']",1976/07/01 00:00,1976/07/01 00:01,['1976/07/01 00:00'],"['1976/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Invest Dermatol. 1976 Jul;67(1):149-59. doi: 10.1111/1523-1747.ep12513006.,,,"['S0022-202X(15)44791-8 [pii]', '10.1111/1523-1747.ep12513006 [doi]']",,,,,,,73,

This finding prompted this investigation of the mechanism of hemolysis and a study of the various factors that might ameliorate this effect. Initial experiments demonstrated that human red blood cells were completely hemolyzed at an E concentration of 10(-3) M, while a concentration of 10(-4) M stabilized red blood cells against 150 mOsM NaCl. The extent of hemolysis correlated well with the surface activities, lipophilic properties and cellular uptake of E and some of its derivatives (7,10-dimethylellipticine, isoellipticine, 9-methoxyellipticine and 11-demethylellipticine). The greatest hemolysis occurred with 7,10-dimethylellipticine and the least with 11-demethylellipticine. The cellular uptake of E and its derivatives was linear over a wide concentration range and was not temperature-dependent. Hemolysis could be blocked by citrate, sodium ethylenediamine tetraacetate, oxytetracycline and [(+/-)-1,2-bis(3,5-dioxopiperazin-1-y1)propane]. The inhibition of E uptake by citrate appears to be a noncompetitive process and has a K1 of 1.9 X 10(-3) M.

Immunization of mice with progressing tumors showed markedly depressed hemolytic antibody plaque responses in the spleen. Furthermore, spleen cell cultures derived from immunodepressed mice with the tumors revealed the continued impairment of antibody formation in vitro. Relatively small numbers of splenocytes from the tumor-bearing mice suppressed larger numbers of normal spleen cells from control mice. Immunosuppression in all three tumor systems could be related to subcellular factors in that cell-free extracts of the spleens and tumor bearing mice or even ascites fluid or plasma could suppress the normal antibody responsiveness of normal spleen cell cultures. The virus per se or a virus associated factor seemed important in the leukemia virus model but non-virus tumor associated or related substances seemed to be involved in the immunosuppression induced by the plasmacytoma or mastocytoma. Such results support the view that tumor related subcellular factors may be important mediators of immunologic impairment of a host's immune defense mechanism to a neoplasm.","['Specter, S C', 'Kamo, I', 'Friedman, H']","['Specter SC', 'Kamo I', 'Friedman H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Formation', 'Antibody-Producing Cells/*immunology', 'Ascitic Fluid/immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Hemolytic Plaque Technique', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Plasmacytoma/*immunology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Subcellular Fractions/immunology']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1976;66:457-63. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4613-4355-4_70.,,,['10.1007/978-1-4613-4355-4_70 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The injection of inactivated B 19 R preparations and their lysates three days before infection by klebsiella has allowed to protect mice against a large number of DL50 (100 and 1000 in certain cases). To determine the role of the surface antigen in this type of immunostimulant, the activity of the B 19 R inactivated preparations has also been examined. It appears that the protection obtained by the injection on day J + 3, in relation to the infection, does not depend on the presence of the complete surface antigen, while the long term effect seems to be more dependent on this. The development of Charlotte Friend's leukemia has been favourably influenced by the previous injection of B 19 S or inactivated B 19 R. Immunotherapy on days J + 1 or J + 3 gave encouraging results with B 19 R, but facilitation with B 19 S.

In both these disorders a reversion to a fetal form of erythropoiesis may occur, as judged by both the structure of the Hb F and by the disappearance of Hb A2 and the carbnoic-anhydrase isozymes during the course of the illness. The clinical picture of JCML is not always associated with a reversion to fetal erythropoiesis; there appears to be a heterogeneity of conditions with this clinical label. Thus the reversion to a completely fetal pattern of erythropoiesis seems to occur in a variety of leukaemias which start in early life. This change is associated with a uniformly bad prognosis. Of a group of 17 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia 15 developed an increase in the level of Hb F about 60 days after the commencement of treatment; significantly greater increases were observed in those achieving a clinical remission. The level of Hb F usually declined during remission but high levels persisted in a few cases. Increased levels of Hb F were found also in patients with other haematological malignancies who had undergone periods of marrow aplasia during treatment. In all cases the Hb F was heterogeneously distributed throughout the red cells. Analysis of gamma15 or gammaCB3 peptides of Hb F from a variety of leukaemias gave glycine compositions ranging from 0.20 to 0.85 residues with many values in the fetal range; all cases with a reversion to fetal erythropoiesis had values in the fetal range. Attempts to confirm the 'fetal' origin of the cells containing Hb F by means of other markers was possible only in the cases of JCML and in one child with erythroleukaemia. These studies indicate that in some forms of leukaemia there may be a genuine reversion to fetal erythropoiesis while in others the emergence of cells containing Hb F appears to be part of a rapid regeneration process occurring after a period of marrow aplasia. The diagnostic and prognostic value of these observations is discussed.","['Sheridan, B L', 'Weatherall, D J', 'Clegg, J B', 'Pritchard, J', 'Wood, W G', 'Callender, S T', 'Durrant, I J', 'McWhirter, W R', 'Ali, M', 'Partridge, J W', 'Thompson, E N']","['Sheridan BL', 'Weatherall DJ', 'Clegg JB', 'Pritchard J', 'Wood WG', 'Callender ST', 'Durrant IJ', 'McWhirter WR', 'Ali M', 'Partridge JW', 'Thompson EN']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (I Blood-Group System)', '9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)', 'EC 4.2.1.1 (Carbonic Anhydrases)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Carbonic Anhydrases/blood', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'I Blood-Group System', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood', 'Male']",1976/04/01 00:00,1976/04/01 00:01,['1976/04/01 00:00'],"['1976/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1976 Apr;32(4):487-506. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1976.tb00952.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1976.tb00952.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The mitotic indices of the granulopoietic and erythropoietic precursor cells were lower in the spleen and liver than in the bone marrow. The results indicate that the composition and proliferative activity of the haemopoietic tissue differ in bone marrow and extramedullary sites in CML. The discrepancies may be due to differences in the microenvironment for the haemopoietic cells or to a selective accumulation of cells with a low mitotic activity in extramedullary sites.

Antisera were analyzed by cytotoxicity and immunofluorescence techniques to study the antigenic characteristics of human lymphocytes. In an attempt to obtain a reagent specifically reactive with T (thymus-derived) lymphocytes, an antispleen antiserum was absorbed with cellf from five B- (bone marrow-derived) cell lines. After absorption, the antiserum killed 60-75% of peripheral blood lymphocytes and 40-50% of tonsil cells, so that there was a relationship between the percentage of killed cells and the proportion of T lymphocytes. However, when cells after cytotoxic treatment were assayed for rosette formation with sheep erythrocytes (a T-cell marker) 5-20% of viable rosette-forming lymphocytes were found. Therefore, this antiserum was cytotoxic for only 75-90% of T cells. From studies performed with antisera prepared against spleen and B-cell lines, we conclude that lymphoblastoid cells are antigenically different and deficient in comparison to normal B lymphocytes. In addition, cultured B-cell lines appear to be antigenically heterogenous, as shown by the cytotoxic activity remaining in antispleen and anti-B-cell lines sera after absorption with various numbers and types of lymphoid cell lines. After absorption with normal lymphocytes, an antiserum produced against chronic lymphatic leukemia cells had specific activity associated with 12 chronic lymphatic leukemia cells tested.

A proportion of the cells bear immunoglobulins on their surface, as evidenced by immunofluorescence; these are either cells of the B-lymphocyte line at a stage of producing surface immunoglobulins (antigen receptors) or lymphocytes which acquire immunoglobulins from outside by various mechanisms. Other circulating lymphocytes, attributed at least partly to T-cells, form rosettes with desensitised sheep erythrocytes. Determination of the percentage of surface immunoglobulin positive lymphocytes or rosette forming cells has been used by many investigators to further characterize (subdivide) various diseases. Conflicting results were obtained, mainly due to wide variations in the technique used. Most patients with chronic lymphatic leukemia show a strongly elevated proportion of surface immunoglobulin cells. Also, in non-Hodgkin lymphomas the percentage of such cells is elevated even the absolute number of peripheral lymphocytes and their morphology is normal. Patients with Waldenstrom's disease often displays an elevated proportion of IgM carrying cells. Many other diseases are associated with unbalanced ratios between immunoglobulin positive and rosette forming lymphocytes.

Rosette formation with neuraminidase-untreated HRBC occurs only with a small fraction of normal lymphocytes, but can be increased by preincubating the lymphocytes with neuraminidase. Similar to rosette formation with SRBC. the binding of nHRBC is temperature-dependent, is prevented by pretreatment of the lymphocytes with proteolytic enzymes, but is not inhibited by EDTA.

C57BL/6J mice (H-2b) were immunized intraperitoneally with mastocytoma cells (H-2d) with or without oil-attached BCG-CWS. The cytotoxicity, comparable to that of spleen cells from mice immunized with mastocytoma cells (3 X 10(7)), could be induuced in spleens of mice immunized with a mixture of mastocytoma cells (10(4)) and oil-attached BCG-CWS. The enhancing effect persisted from 55 days or more after the alloantigenic immunization. Oil-attached BCG-CWS enhanced cell-mediated cytotoxicity of T cells in the spleen and the mesenteric lymph node, but not in the thymus. The cytotoxicity showed specificity toward the alloantigen used for immunization. In addition to BCG-CWS, the cell walls of Nocardia rubra and Corynebacterium diphtheriae PW8 and the peptidoglycolipids of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Aoyama B were found to be potent stimulants of cell-mediated cytotoxicity in mice. Oil-attached BCG-CWS did not enhance humoral response to mastocytoma cells but enhanced cell-mediated cytotoxicity when viable mastocytoma cells were used as antigen. The above result was supported by the fact that anti-hapten antibody response induced by viable trinitrophenyl (TNP)-mastocytoma cells (10(4)) plus oil-attached BCG-CWS did not increase to the maximum levels as was observed in mice immunized with a larger number of mastocytoma cells (3 X 10(7)) alone, while cell-mediated cytotoxicity induced by the same treatment increased to the maximum level obtained by immunization with mastocytoma cells (3 X 10(7)) alone.","['Taniyama, T', 'Azuma, I', 'Yamamura, Y']","['Taniyama T', 'Azuma I', 'Yamamura Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Microbiol,Japanese journal of microbiology,0376565,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '8T3HQG2ZC4 (Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid)']",IM,"['*Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Wall/*immunology', 'Corynebacterium diphtheriae/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mycobacterium bovis/*immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Nocardia/immunology', 'Spleen/cytology/immunology', 'Trinitrobenzenesulfonic Acid/pharmacology']",1975/08/01 00:00,1975/08/01 00:01,['1975/08/01 00:00'],"['1975/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Microbiol. 1975 Aug;19(4):255-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.1975.tb00879.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1975.tb00879.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

In both types of cell the newly synthesized RNA includes rapidly hybridizing sequences. There is evidence, although circumstantial, that in leukemic cells these sequences are markedly different from that of normal lymphocytes. In both normal lymphocytes and leukemic blast cells the rapidly hybridizing RNA sequences are in part involved in secondary structure. In fact, a significant fraction of the hnRNA appears in RNase-resistant form with double-stranded properties.

Nine cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) served as controls. The kidneys of the cases of MML showed macroscopically detectable signs of hemorrhagic diathesis and secondary uric acid diathesis more often than those of CLL. In the MML group most of the kidneys weighed more than the normal average for the corresponding age group, but the average renal weights for the 2 groups were about the same. Renal weight and grade of leukemic infiltration, particularly in MML, revealed no significant positive correlation. In most of the cases of MML there were unevenly distributed poorly defined leukemic, infiltrates in the renal cortex and medulla. The histology resembled that of pyelonephritis. In CLL, on the other hand, the leukemic infiltrates were usually sharply defined and localized in foci in the outer cortex and the corticomedullary border region. Renal dysfunction in cases of MML has been attributed by others to hyperlysozymemia. It was found occasionally but there was no MML-typical morphological substrate in our material. Hyaline droplet change of the tubular epithelium was more frequent and more pronounced in MML than in CLL. However, we also determined that it was nonspecific and that it was not a parameter of cell damage. Tubular hyaline droplet change and the morphological criteria of acute renal failure were not positively correlated with the degree of leukemic infiltration of the kidneys or with the leukemic proliferation as a whole. Instead, they were considered to be signs and symptoms of accompanying or secondary diseases which complicated the leukemia.","['Schwarze, E W']",['Schwarze EW'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch A Pathol Anat Histol,"Virchows Archiv.

Their presence can be detected and the quantity of HbF per F-cell estimated by pericellular immunodiffusion reactions with anti-HbF. In normal adults F-cell frequency (range: 1 F-cell per 25 erythrocytes to 1 per 6800) and the mean amount of HbF per F-cell (range: approximately 14 to 28% of mean cell hemoglobin), although they are variables, remain constant over many months. Frequencies are similar in men and women. For a given individual, F-cell lifetimes are probably similar to those of other erythrocytes. F-cell production is not appreciably influenced by short term exposure to high altitude (approximately 4300 m) hypoxia. F-cell frequencies are briefly but substantially increased in many women during midpregnancy. In some women, presumptive 5- to 15-fold increases in F-cell production result in observed 3- to 7-fold increases in F-cell frequency during the 23rd to 31st weeks of gestation. These increases in F-cell frequency arise from selective alterations in maternal erythropoiesis and not from transplacental bleeding from the fetus. Substantial increases in F-cell frequency also occur in most adults with acute leukemia. In both pregnancy and leukemia, F-cell contributions of HbF are sufficient to account for modest elevations found in hemolysate HbF levels.","['Boyer, S H', 'Belding, T K', 'Margolte, L', 'Noyes, A N', 'Burke, P J', 'Bell, W R']","['Boyer SH', 'Belding TK', 'Margolte L', 'Noyes AN', 'Burke PJ', 'Bell WR']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Johns Hopkins Med J,The Johns Hopkins medical journal,0072456,['9034-63-3 (Fetal Hemoglobin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Altitude', 'Anemia, Aplastic/blood', 'Cell Survival', 'Erythrocytes/*analysis', 'Female', 'Fetal Hemoglobin/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Hypoxia/blood', 'Immunodiffusion', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Pregnancy', 'Sex Factors']",1975/09/01 00:00,1975/09/01 00:01,['1975/09/01 00:00'],"['1975/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Johns Hopkins Med J. 1975 Sep;137(3):105-15.,,,,,,,,,,,

Sequential-labeling of Surface Ig and intracellular Ig with antisera conjugated to opposite fluorochromes documented the progressive maturation of the terminal differentiation of the IgA-bearing cell population at a level before morphologically distinct plasma cells. The distribution and pattern of surface and cytoplasmic IgG and IgA staining in individual cells suggest that the direction of switching is from IgG to IgA synthesis. The demonstration of shared idiotypic specificity between the IgG- and IgA-bearing populations is consistent with a transition in Ig heavy chain synthesis resulting from an alternation in the CH gene.

The majority of the chemical-induced leukemias were of the bone marrow-derived (B) lymphocyte origin, although some leukemias were of T lymphocyte origin, and some tumors could not be classified as either T or B leukemias, perhaps representing stem cells which do not carry the characteristic surface antigens for mature T and B cells.","['Haran-Ghera, N', 'Ben-Yaakov, M', 'Chazan, R', 'Peled, A']","['Haran-Ghera N', 'Ben-Yaakov M', 'Chazan R', 'Peled A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Bibl Haematol,Bibliotheca haematologica,0372513,"['57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/etiology/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bibl Haematol. 1975;(40):133-41. doi: 10.1159/000397527.,,,['10.1159/000397527 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Besides distinct ultrastructural differences among HC, RS cells, and lymphocytes, mainly gradual differences have been noted using cytochemical methods and by evaluating the phagocytosis of ferritin particles. A further common trait of HC, RS cells, and B lymphocytes seems to be the presence of surface Fc receptors.

This dihydropteridine was oxidized with potassium permanganate, and the product was treated successively with sodium hydrosulfide to replace the benzylthio group and with aqueous sodium hydroxide to hydrolyze the ester function to give p-[[(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-4-thioxo-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoic acid (N10-methyl-4-thiopteroic acid, 12). Another route to 12 involved the interaction of 2,5-diamino-4,6-dichloropyrimidine (15) with 16 to give methyl p-[[(2-amino-4-chloro-7,8-dihydro-6-pteridinyl)methyl]methylamino]benzoate (13). Displacement of the chloro group of 13 with sodium hydrosulfide followed by the simultaneous air oxidation of the dihydropteridine ring and saponification of the ester group gave 12. After protection of the 2-amino and 4-thioxo moieties of 12, the resulting intermediate benzoic acid was coupled with diethyl L-glutamate. The product of this reaction was deblocked to give 21. Methylation of 21 gave the corresponding 4-(methylthio) derivative 22, which on reaction with hydrazine gave the 4-hydrazino analog 23 of methotrexate. Reduction of 12 and 21 with sodium hydrosulfite gave the dihydropteridines 24 and 25, respectively. The title compound was an excellent inhibitor of the growth of Streptococcus faecium ATCC 8043. However, this and related compounds were ineffective inhibitors of dihydrofolic reductase and showed no significant activity in either the KB cell culture screen or against L1210 leukemia cells in mice.","['Elliott, R D', 'Temple, C Jr', 'Frye, J L', 'Nontgomery, J A']","['Elliott RD', 'Temple C Jr', 'Frye JL', 'Nontgomery JA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Thiones)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma', 'Columbidae', 'Enterococcus faecalis/drug effects', 'Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/metabolism', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mouth Neoplasms', 'Thiones/chemical synthesis/pharmacology']",1975/05/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1975/05/01 00:00'],"['1975/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1975/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1975 May;18(5):492-6. doi: 10.1021/jm00239a011.,,,['10.1021/jm00239a011 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Evidence for humoral immune responses of patients to leukemia-associated antigens.,331-8,"Immunoglobulins were detected on the membranes of human leukemic cells by a microcytotoxicity technique. A significant percentage of lymphocytes from normal donors failed to react with goat antisera to human heavy chain determinants or to lambda-light chains. Lymphocytes from some normal donors, however, did react with antisera to k-light chains. A high percentage (50-90) of cells from some leukemia patients were killed by antisera to light chains and by one or more antisera to heavy chain determinants. Trypsin treatment of leukemic cells resulted in a loss of cytotoxic activity with all immunoglobulin antisera. Reactivity with the k-light chain antiserum was detectable 2 h after trypsinization of chronic myeloid leukemic (CML) cells and 8 h after treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemic (ALL) cells. Reactivity with the antisera to heavy chain determinants and lambda-light chains could not be detected 8 and 48 h after trypsinization of CML and ALL cells, respectively. The cytotoxic activity of the immunoglobulin antisera to heavy chains was abolished by absorption with the specific immunoglobulin used to define the antisera by precipitation. Eluates (pH 3.2) prepared from leukemic cells which reacted by cytotoxicity with the immunoglobulin antisera were shown to contain immunoglobulins of different heavy chain classes. In addition, some of the eluates had cytotoxic antibody activity to human leukemia cells. The specificity of the eluted antibodies is similar to the specificity previously described for cytophilic antibodies from leukemic patients and nonhuman primate antisera to human leukemia cells.

The procedure is a two-phase reaction system where standard MTX concentrations or the sample being assayed in incubated with the reagent lysate in the first phase, and [3H]MTX is then added in the second phase to titrate the remaining unoccupied binding sites on the enzyme. This method eliminates the need for measuring the residual catalytic activity of the enzyme. The sensitivity of the radioassay is limited only by the specific activity of the [3H]MTX and how approximates 10 pg of the drug. Folic acid, methyltetrahydrofolate, formyltetrahydrofolate, and dehydrofolate in concentrations that are physiological do not interfere in the radioassay. Both mercaptoethanol and reduced nicotinamide andnine dinucleotide phosphate increase the binding capacity of the lysate for MTX; but the reduced nucleotide also increases the affinity of the enzyme for the inhibitor. MTX added to serum can be assayed without extraction if the concentration is greater than 500 pg/ml and recovery of the drug added to serum is about 92%. MTX has been assayed in serum, spinal fluid, and urine of patients who were treated with this drug. It has also been assayed in the lysates of L1210 cells from C57BL X DBA/2 F1 mice treated with MTX.

There are enough antigenic similarities between man and nonhuman primates to blunt the immune response of apes and monkeys to huamn species-specific antigens. Their response to allogeneic normal human antigens such as HL-A can now be managed by in vitro absorption procedures. High titered antibodies specific for tumor associated membrane antigens have not been well documented in serological studies with patients' sera. Immunization of nonhuman primates utilizes a fully immunocompetent recipient who has no tumor and is not on chemotherapy. The immunization can utilize adjuvants and other regimens that morally and ethically cannot be easily used for human allogeneic immunization. The simian antisera that are shown to be specific for human tumor membrane antigens can then be utilized for studies on the isolation and characterization of the antigens. Similar studies with HL-A antigens indicated that the solubilized partially purified antigens can then be used to elicit high titered antibodies in other simians. These latter antisera can then be used for more sensitive assays and studies on the association of the antigen(s) with the cell membrane. Although the work summarized here covers leukemia and melamona antigens, it is felt the approach will serve as a model for the detection by simian antisera of tumor-specific membrane antigens of cancer cells from patients with various types of solid tumors.","['Seigler, H F', 'Metzgar, R S', 'Mohanakumar, T', 'Stuhlmiller, G M']","['Seigler HF', 'Metzgar RS', 'Mohanakumar T', 'Stuhlmiller GM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Fed Proc,Federation proceedings,0372771,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fetus/immunology', 'HLA Antigens', 'Haplorhini/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Melanoma/*immunology', 'Pan troglodytes/immunology', 'Rabbits/immunology']",1975/07/01 00:00,1975/07/01 00:01,['1975/07/01 00:00'],"['1975/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Fed Proc. 1975 Jul;34(8):1642-6.,,,,,,,,,,17,

Theis C4 receptor activity was studied in relation to the previously identified C3b and C3d receptors. By assay for inhibition of rosette formation by fluid-phase complement (C), only two different lymphocyte C receptors were demonstrated. The immune adherence receptor, the only one of the two shared in common with erythrocytes, was specific for C4 or the C3c region of C3b, but was unreactive with C3d. The other lymphocyte receptor, the C3d receptor, was specific for C3d fragments, but would also react to a lesser extent with the C3d region of uncleaved C3b. ThC3d receptor did not react with either C3c or C4. This specificity of the C3d receptor allowed certain cells which contained only C3d receptors to form rosettes with EAC1-3b and EAC1-3d, but not with EAC14. However, because C3d receptors bound EAC1-3d or C3d fragments more firmly than they did EAC1-3b or C3b fragments, many other types of cells containing only C3d receptors, formed rosettes with EAC1-3d but not with EAC1-3b. Erythrocytes and those lymphocytes which contained only immune adherence receptors, formed rosettes with EAC14 and EAC1-3D but not with EAC1-3d. A double-label assay was devised for the simultaneous detection of both types of C receptors on individual lymphocytes. This assay involved fluorescence labeling of one of the two C receptors with soluble C fragments in combination with the usual rosette method for labeling the other type of C receptor. With this double-label assay, it was observed that the two different lymphocyte C receptors capped independently and thus were located on different molecules which could each move through the fluid membrane matrix independently of the other.","['Ross, G D', 'Polley, M J']","['Ross GD', 'Polley MJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Binding Sites', 'Calcium', 'Cell Line', '*Complement System Proteins', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Immunoglobulins', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphoid Tissue', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Palatine Tonsil/cytology/immunology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Protein Binding', 'Sheep/immunology', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/immunology']",1975/05/01 00:00,1975/05/01 00:01,['1975/05/01 00:00'],"['1975/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1975 May 1;141(5):1163-80. doi: 10.1084/jem.141.5.1163.,,PMC2189795,['10.1084/jem.141.5.1163 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

It is shown that EL4 cells survive coupling with TNP-sulfonic acid and retain the hapten on their cell surface for a prolonged period of time. Although TNP-EL4 cells are readily lysed by anti-TNP serum in a complement-mediated reaction, they are inefficiently killed in an antibody-dependent cell-mediated reaction. Cytotoxic effector cells, able to lyse TNP-EL4 targets, are induced when C57BL/6 spleen H-2-b cells are cultured with the following cell types which have been coupled with TNP: 1) ALLOGENEIC P815 tumor cells (H-2-d), 2) syngeneic EL4 tumor cells, 3) allogeneic BALB/c spleen cells (H-2-d), 4) syngeneic C57BL/6 spleen cells. Further experiments show that TNP-coupled xenogeneic chicken erythrocytes, which by themselves are unable to induce cytotoxic effectors, are capable of doing so if uncoupled P815 cells are present simultaneously. On the basis of these findings, it can be hypothesized that two stimuli are required for induction of these cytotoxic effector cells--one provided by the hapten, and the other by the P815 cell. Treatment of cytotoxic spleen cells induced by hapten-coupled allogeneic tumor cells with anti-Thy-1 serum and complement abrogates their cytotoxicity, indicating that T cells play a central role in the cytotoxic reaction. TNP-coupled erythrocytes do not serve as targets for these cytotoxic T cells, but do cause competitive inhibition of TNP-EL4 when added to the reaction mixture at high ratios. However, because the inhibition is relatively low, and because no such inhibition can be demonstrated with TNP-lysine, it is concluded that the receptor on the cytotoxic effector cell has a low affinity for hapten. This low affinity could be due to the receptor recognizing an antigen comprising mouse cell surface antigen in addition to the TNP moiety. Supporting this interpretation is the finding that TNP-EL4 cells competitively inhibit cytotoxicity much more efficiently than TNP-CRBC and that even uncoupled EL4 cells inhibit to some extent.","['Dennert, G', 'Hatlen, L E']","['Dennert G', 'Hatlen LE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chickens/immunology', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'Culture Techniques', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', '*Haptens', 'Immune Sera', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lysine', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nitrobenzenes/immunology', 'Rabbits/immunology', 'Radiation Effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/radiation effects']",1975/06/01 00:00,1975/06/01 00:01,['1975/06/01 00:00'],"['1975/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1975 Jun;114(6):1705-12.,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells used were lymphoma, myeloid leukemia, and normal fibroblast cells. With all lectins, cell-to-cell binding was inhibited if both cells were prefixed with glutaraldehyde. However, in most cases cell-to-cell binding was enhanced when only the lectin-coated cell was prefixed. With normal fibroblasts, treatment of either one or both cells with trypsin enhanced the cell-to-cell binding induced by Con A and the wheatgerm lectin. Neuraminidase, which increases the number of receptors for soybean agglutinin, increased cell-to-cell binding only if both cells were treated. Although cell-to-cell binding induced by the lectins from soybean and wheatgerm could be partially reversed by the appropriate competitive saccharide inhibitor, binding induced by Con A could not be reversed. The experiments indicate that cell-to-cell binding induced by a lectin can be prevented by an insufficient density of receptors for the lectin, insufficient receptor mobility, or induced clustering of receptors. These effects can explain the differences in cell-to-cell binding and agglutination observed with different cell types and lectins. They also suggest that cell-to-cell binding induced by different lectins with a variety of cell types is initiated by a mechanism involving the alignment of complementary receptors on the colliding cells for the formation of multiple cell-to-lectin-to-cell bridges.","['Rutishauser, U', 'Sachs, L']","['Rutishauser U', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,"['0 (Lectins)', '0 (Nylons)', '0 (Plant Lectins)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'T3C89M417N (Glutaral)']",IM,"['*Agglutination/drug effects', 'Animals', '*Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Cricetinae', 'Fibroblasts', 'Glutaral/pharmacology', 'Lectins/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphoma', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Nylons', 'Plant Lectins', 'Soybeans', 'Triticum', 'Trypsin/pharmacology', 'Vegetables']",1975/05/01 00:00,1975/05/01 00:01,['1975/05/01 00:00'],"['1975/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1975 May;65(2):247-57. doi: 10.1083/jcb.65.2.247.,,PMC2109424,['10.1083/jcb.65.2.247 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The primary purpose of this paper was to elucidate the metastatic process in myelomas and different types of leukemia. Two mutually exclusive hypotheses were tested, i.e. whether the spread of a cancer from the primary tumor throughout the body was due to a simple diffusion or if a cascade process took place. The basic definition of the ""cascade or multistep"" diffusion of cancer is that it takes place in steps; that is, at least one intermediate step is usually required for the disease to progress from the primary tumor to generalized dissemination throughout the body. It appeared that either the liver or spleen are the two major diffusing sites; that is, no generalized metastasis occurs unless the spleen and/or liver are seeded first.","['Bross, I D', 'Viadana, E', 'Pickren, J W']","['Bross ID', 'Viadana E', 'Pickren JW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Virchows Arch A Pathol Anat Histol,"Virchows Archiv.

These data, together with previous findings suggest that cells secreting all classes of IgG synthesize J chain, even though there is no apparent requirement for J chain in assembly of the IgG molecule. Hence production of J chain does not depend upon secretion of a polymeric immunoglobulin. 2) Intracellular J chain can be found in myeloma variants that do not produce heavy chains showing that production of J chain may not coordinately be linked to the synthesis of heavy chain. 3) J chain was found in cells synthesizing, but not secreting, immunoglobulin. Thus production of J chain is not linked to secretion of immunoglobulin. 4) J chain could not be detected in plasma cells that do not produce immunoglobulins. It was also not found in mouse leukemic cells, suggesting that production of J chain is probably linked in some way to immunoglobulin production.","['Kaji, H', 'Parkhouse, M E']","['Kaji H', 'Parkhouse ME']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin J-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Polymers)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibody Formation', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Goats/immunology', 'Immune Sera', 'Immunoglobulin A/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/*biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin J-Chains/*biosynthesis', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Polymers', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Rabbits/immunology', 'Tritium']",1975/04/01 00:00,1975/04/01 00:01,['1975/04/01 00:00'],"['1975/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1975 Apr;114(4):1218-20.,,,,,,,,,,,

The cytoplasm of hypersegmentated eosinophils shows an abnormally high glycogen content. Besides the eosinophils, monocytic cells and their precursors proliferate in the bone marrow of the first patient. In the second patient myeloblasts, promyelocytes with Auer rods, and monocytic cells characterize further neoplastic cell population. The elements of the monocytic series can be identified by their ultrastructural features, such as irregular configuration of the nuclei, bundles of cytoplasmatic microfilaments, and numerous small electron-dense lysosomal granules.

The serum disappearance of TZT in normal and tumor-bearing mice was similar, with a rapid tissue equilibration phase and a slower elimination phase. Serum disappearance in normal and tumor-bearing rats was 1.5 to 2.2 hr. Serum disappearance in dogs and monkeys was similar, with half-lives of 3 to 4 and 2 to 4 hr, respectively. Urinary excretion of TZT at 24 hr was only 5 to 6% of the injected dose in mice and rats; in contrast, the dogs excreted 60% of the injected dose in 8 hr. TZT accumulated to comparable degrees in the organs of rats and mice, with progressively lesser concentrations in liver, kidney, spleen, and brain. Dihydrofolate reductase activity became almost undectectable in all tissues studied within 15 min after drug adminsitration. An important difference in drug accumulation was in the ascites cells of tumor-bearing animals: in mice, the drug level was consistently lower in the L1210 cells than in the ascites fluid; in contrast, by 30 min after treatment with TZT the drug level in Walker 256 cells was 10-fold higher than the level in the ascites fluid. No evidence for drug metabolism was found in extracts of urine, feces, or organ tissues from either mice or rats. TZT and two related triazines were studied for their ability to accumulate in the cerbrospinal fluid of dogs after i.v. administration. TZT achieved a cerebrospinal fluid level of approximately 15% of the serum concentration at 1 hr; in contrast, the other two triazines reached maximum cerebrospinal fluid values of 1% at 1 hr.","['Cashmore, A R', 'Skeel, R T', 'Makulu, D R', 'Gralla, E J', 'Bertino, J R']","['Cashmore AR', 'Skeel RT', 'Makulu DR', 'Gralla EJ', 'Bertino JR']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Triazines)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/analysis', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Carcinoma 256, Walker/*metabolism', 'Dogs', 'Feces/analysis', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Half-Life', 'Haplorhini', 'Kidney/enzymology/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Liver/enzymology/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Rats', 'Spleen/enzymology/metabolism', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Triazines/blood/cerebrospinal fluid/*metabolism/urine']",1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1975 Jan;35(1):17-22.,,,,,,,,,,,

Both are derivatives of a phenol, gamma-L-glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene. When purified, these quinoids specifically inhibit mitochondrial respiratory enzymes and protein synthesis in the mushroom and have comparable effects with rat liver mitochondria and ribosomes, with intact bacteria, and with bacterial ribosomes and RNA polymerase in vitro. Five species of mouse ascites tumor cells showed prompt and marked inhibitions of nucleic acid and protein synthesis when millimolar concentrations of these quinoids were added to the tissue culture medium of the tumor cells. Only a small percentage of the cells was killed immediately, as judged by trypan blue uptake. When large numbers of exposed BP8 sarcoma and EL4 leukemic cells were reinjected intraperitoneally into histocompatible mice, the survival times of these animals were notably prolonged beyond those of animals injected with tumor cells that had not been exposed to these inhibitors. In a dose-dependent manner, increasing concentrations of inhibitors produced proportionate increments in survival time, while higher concentrations totally abolished tumor cell growth. The findings indicate that these simple quinoid compounds, which initiate the dormant state in spores, produce a cytostatic state in mammalian tumor cells and thus potentially have strong antitumor properties (Am J Pathol 78:33-48, 1975).","['Vogel, F S', 'Kemper, L A', 'McGarry, S J', 'Graham, D G']","['Vogel FS', 'Kemper LA', 'McGarry SJ', 'Graham DG']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '56HH86ZVCT (Uracil)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/metabolism', 'Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Autoradiography', 'Basidiomycota/*analysis/metabolism', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases/metabolism', 'Glutamine/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Male', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/pathology', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Mitochondria, Liver/drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Quinones/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Ribosomes/drug effects', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/pathology', 'Spores, Fungal/analysis', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Tritium', 'Uracil/metabolism']",1975/01/01 00:00,1975/01/01 00:01,['1975/01/01 00:00'],"['1975/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1975/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1975/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1975 Jan;78(1):33-48.,,PMC1915084,,,,,,,,,

Alterations in DNA synthesis induced by a single dose of cyclophosphamide in normal and tumorous tissues in vivo paralleled in many respects the changes seen when the more time-consuming techniques of the LI or granulocyte colony formation were employed. However, the recovery of granulocyte colony formation after cyclophosphamide therapy lagged behind the recovery of DNA synthesis in the bone marrow, obscuring a kinetic event of potential therapeutic significance.

The CSF contained cells suggestive of leukaemia which in view of an assumed myelofibrosis, initially seemed also possible to originate from a haematopoietic focus. The patient complained of intermittent violent headaches, which were controlled by spinal taps to release highly cellularised CSF under high pressure and by intrathecal MTX injection, every 4-6 weeks over a period of 4.5 years. In the terminal stage the patient developed paraplegia which, partly on the basis of neuropathological findings, was ascribed to the large accumulated dose of MTX. The tumour proved to be localised in the fornix; the localisation adjacent to the ventricular system made the intermittent cell eruptions in the CSF possible. On the basis of an erroneous diagnostic assumption, a therapy was instituted which resulted in a survival of 6.5 years, which is exceptionally long for a patient with 'primary reticulum cell sarcoma' of the brain.","['Op de Coul, A A', 'Vauger, A J', 'Slooff, J L']","['Op de Coul AA', 'Vauger AJ', 'Slooff JL']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Clin Neurol Neurosurg,Clinical neurology and neurosurgery,7502039,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', '*Diagnostic Errors', 'Humans', 'Intracranial Pressure', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', 'Prognosis', 'Spinal Puncture']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Neurol Neurosurg. 1976;79(2):133-42. doi: 10.1016/0303-8467(76)90005-6.,,,"['0303-8467(76)90005-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0303-8467(76)90005-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

Among the parameters of immunocompetence vigorous delayed-type hypersensitivity responses to recall antigens or to primary immunization with Keyhole limpet hemocyanin, vigorous in vitro lymphocyte blastogenic responses to mitogens such as PHA, and relatively high B-lymphocyte levels, all correlate with a good prognosis. The spectrum of immune reactivity as measured by established delayed-type hypersensitivity to recall antigens and in vitro blastogenic responses to mitogens and antigens is similar in melanoma patients and their nontumor-bearing spouses. In melanoma, only patients with widespread inoperable metastatic disease show severe immunological deficiency and this is selective for certain antigens. There are highly significant differences in response to specific antigens when patients with melanoma and lung cancer are compared. Immunotherapy with BCG and C. parvum can boost immunocompetence as measured by recall DTH skin testing. However, the relationship between the initial immunocompetence and prognosis still holds in patients receiving BCG immunotherapy to prevent recurrence of melanoma. These data indicate that a broader survey of immunological reactivity in cancer patients is needed, that immunological testing is useful in cancer prognosis clinically, and that the results of immunological testing can be used to evaluate therapy and to indicate new pathways for improved treatment.","['Hersh, E M', 'Gutterman, J U', 'Mavligit, G M', 'Mountain, C W', 'McBride, C M', 'Brugess, M A', 'Lurie, P M', 'Zelen, M', 'Takita, H', 'Vincent, R G']","['Hersh EM', 'Gutterman JU', 'Mavligit GM', 'Mountain CW', 'McBride CM', 'Brugess MA', 'Lurie PM', 'Zelen M', 'Takita H', 'Vincent RG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,['0 (BCG Vaccine)'],IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'BCG Vaccine', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed/immunology', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Male', 'Melanoma/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/immunology', 'Mycobacterium bovis/immunology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/*immunology', 'Neoplasms/*immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Propionibacterium acnes/immunology', 'Skin Tests']",1976/01/01 00:00,1976/01/01 00:01,['1976/01/01 00:00'],"['1976/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1976/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1976/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1976;276:386-406. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb41664.x.,,,['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1976.tb41664.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,
