It has been identified at the plasma membrane of several cell types. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is known to induce differentiation of human leukemia cell lines in vitro. PrPc messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and protein are down-regulated upon ATRA-induced differentiation of HL60 cells. In this report, we have investigated the regulation of PrPc mRNA and protein expression during ATRA-treatment of maturation-sensitive (NB4) and -resistant (NB4-R1 and NB4-R2) cell lines. In ATRA-induced maturation of NB4 cells, down-regulation of PrPc mRNA and protein were observed. We also show that down-regulation of PrPc mRNA is dependent on protein synthesis. Moreover, the same down-regulation of prion protein by ATRA was observed at the surface of maturation-resistant, ATRA-responsive NB4-R1 cells. In contrast, the maturation-resistant and ATRA-unresponsive NB4-R2 subline showed no variation in membrane prion protein expression. These results demonstrate a dissociation between the regulation of prion protein expression by ATRA and the process of granulocyte maturation. We propose that retinoids should be investigated further as a preventive strategy to slow down prion disease progression.","[""INSERM U-496, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie (IUH), Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As subgroups of B-CLL can be distinguished by the pattern of somatic mutation of immunoglobulin variable (V) genes we investigated four lymphomas with IGH/BCL11A involvement for IGH hypermutation. Clonal V(H) gene rearrangements were amplified; in all four cases, sequencing of the amplificates revealed the rearranged V(H) genes to lack somatic mutations. These results suggest that t(2;14)(p13;q32.3) is associated with a subset of B-CLL/immunocytoma characterized by non-mutated IG genes deriving from pre-germinal center B cells.

In 77 selected children with precursor-B-ALL, Southern blotting detected 122 IGK-Kde rearrangements, 12 of which were derived from subclones in six patients (8%).

Comparison between diagnosis and relapse samples from 21 patients with PCR-detectable IGK-Kde rearrangements (using Southern blotting, PCR/heteroduplex analysis, and sequencing) demonstrated that 27 of the 32 rearrangements remained stable at relapse. When patients with oligoclonal IGK-Kde rearrangements were excluded, 25 of the 27 rearrangements remained stable at relapse and at least one stable rearrangement was present in 17 of the 18 patients. Subsequently, RQ-PCR analysis with allele-specific forward primers, a germline Kde TaqMan-probe, and a germline Kde reverse primer was evaluated for 18 IGK-Kde rearrangements. In 16 of the 18 targets (89%) a sensitivity of < or =10(-4) was reached. Analysis of MRD during follow-up of eight patients with IGK-Kde rearrangements showed comparable results between RQ-PCR data and classical dot-blot data. We conclude that the frequently occurring IGK-Kde rearrangements are generally detectable by PCR (90%) and are highly stable MRD-PCR targets, particularly where monoclonal rearrangements at diagnosis (95%) are concerned. Furthermore, most IGK-Kde rearrangements (90%) can be used for sensitive detection of MRD (< or =10(-4)) by RQ-PCR analysis.","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital, Erasmus University Rotterdam, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,['Leukemia. 2008 Dec;22(12):2265-7.

Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic studies were obtained in 38 children over a 24-h period following cytotoxin treatment with or without CsA on days 1 and 4. Drug concentrations were quantitated using validated HPLC methods, and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modeling with an iterative two-stage approach, implemented on ADAPT II software. Etoposide displayed a greater degree of interindividual variability in clearance and systemic exposure than mitoxantrone. With CsA treatment, etoposide and mitoxantrone mean clearance declined by 71% and 42%, respectively. These effects on clearance, in combination with the empiric 40% dose reduction for either cytotoxin, resulted in a 47% and 12% increases in the mean AUC for etoposide and mitoxantrone, respectively. There were no differences in the rates of stomatitis or infection between the two groups. CsA treatment resulted in an increased incidence of hyperbilrubinemia, which rapidly reversed upon conclusion of drug therapy. The variability observed in clearance, combined with the empiric 40% dose reduction of the cytotoxins, resulted in statistically similar systemic exposure and similar toxicity.","['Divisions of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.']","['CA 03161/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 05587/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 07431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 11233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 20543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28383/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28439/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 28473/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29293/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29691/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30969/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33587/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33603/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33625/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 41573/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 69177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 69428/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01 RR 00070/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 52168/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, our goal was to study the spectrum of angiogenic factors and receptors expressed in the CLL B cell. We used ELISA assays to determine the levels of basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), endostatin, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) secreted into culture medium by purified CLL B cells. These data demonstrated that CLL B cells spontaneously secrete a variety of pro- and anti-angiogenic factors, including bFGF (23.9 pg/ml +/- 7.9; mean +/- s.e.m.), VEGF (12.5 pg/ml +/- 2.3) and TSP-1 (1.9 ng/ml +/- 0.3). Out of these three factors, CLL B cells consistently secreted bFGF and TSP-1, while VEGF was expressed in approximately two-thirds of CLL patients. Of interest, hypoxic conditions dramatically upregulated VEGF expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. We also employed ribonuclease protection assays to assay CLL B cell expression of a variety of other angiogenesis-related molecules. These analyses revealed that CLL B cells consistently express mRNA for VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1), thrombin receptor, endoglin, and angiopoietin. Further analysis of VEGFR expression by RT-PCR revealed that CLL B cells expressed both VEGFR1 mRNA and VEGFR2 mRNA. In summary, these data collectively indicate that CLL B cells express both pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules and several vascular factor receptors. Because of the co-expression of angiogenic molecules and receptors for some of these molecules, these data suggest that the biology of the leukemic cells may also be directly impacted by angiogenic factors as a result of autocrine pathways of stimulation.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Mayo Graduate and Medical Schools, Mayo Clinic, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PI3-kinase is a heterodimer consisting of an 85 kDa adapter protein (p85) containing one SH3 domain and two SH2 domains and a 110 kDa catalytic subunit (p110). Recently an oncogenic form of p85 named p65-PI3K lacking the C-terminal SH2 domain has been cloned from an irradiation-induced murine thymic lymphoma and transgenic mice expressing p65-PI3K in T lymphocytes develop a lymphoproliferative disorder. Here we describe the cloning of a C-terminal truncated form of p85 expressed in a human lymphoma cell line (CO) with a T cell phenotype derived from a patient with Hodgkin's disease. As a result of a frame-shift mutation at amino acid 636, p76 is lacking most of the C-terminal SH2 domain, but contains the inter-SH2 domain and is associated with an active form of PI3-kinase. A PI3-kinase-dependent constitutive activation of Akt was detected in CO cells which was only partially reduced after serum starvation. Treatment of CO cells with the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation associated with an increased number of apoptotic cells. This is the first detection of a mutated form of the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase in human hematopoietic cells further underlining a potential role of PI3-kinase/Akt signaling in human leukemogenesis.","['Institut fur Medizinische Biochemie und Molekularbiologie, Abteilung fur Zellulare Signaltransduktion, Universitatsklinikum Hamburg-Eppendorf, Universitat Hamburg, Martinistrasse 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany.']",['CA 55293/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormal HTIF1alpha DNA fragments were never found, whereas loss of HTIF1alpha DNA was observed in the patients with chromosome 7q32 deletion and translocation, and in one case without detectable chromosome 7 abnormality. HTIF1alpha RNA was found in acute myelocytic leukemic blasts, and was almost undetectable in normal mononuclear cells. The expression varied among the patients: higher in M1 to M3 subtypes, with the highest values in M1; low levels were constantly observed in M4 and M5 AML. In addition, HTIF1alpha was significantly overexpressed in MDS-related AML (MDR-AML), but not in MDS. We also found that HTIF1alpha expression was high in myeloid cell lines. In myeloblastic HL60 and promyelocytic NB4 cells, induced to differentiate along the monocytic-macrophage pathway by TPA or vitamin D3, HTIF1alpha expression decreased, whereas it was maintained at high levels on induction to granulocytic differentiation by RA or DMSO. In K562 cells, HTIF1alpha RNA levels did not change after hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. These results suggest that HTIF1alpha could play a role in myeloid differentiation, being distinctly regulated in hematopoietic lineages.","['Centro di Biotecnologie, Sezione di Studi Biochimici, Universita degli Studi di Ferrara, Via L.

To elucidate the role of AML1-MTG8 in leukemogenesis, we used oligonucleotide microarrays to detect alterations in gene expression caused by ectopic expression of AML1-MTG8 in a murine myeloid progenitor cell line, L-G. Microarray analysis of approximately 6500 genes identified 32 candidate genes under the downstream control of AML1-MTG8. Among the 32 genes, 23 were not known to be regulated by AML1-MTG8. These included many granule protein genes and several cell surface antigen genes. Interestingly, AML1-MTG8 enhanced the expression of several genes that are usually induced during granulocytic differentiation, particularly those encoding azurophil granule proteins, including cathepsin G, myeloperoxidase and lysozyme. This indicates that AML1-MTG8 induces partial differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells into promyelocytes in the absence of the usual differentiation signals, while it inhibits terminal differentiation into mature granulocytes. Thus, AML1-MTG8 itself may play a crucial role in defining a unique cytologic type with abnormal maturation, characteristic of t(8;21) acute myelogenous leukemia.","['Cancer Genomics Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, 5-1-1 Tsukiji, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we investigated the potential presence of a circulating soluble form of CD86 (sCD86) in normal individuals and patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) or B cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL). Circulating sCD86 was detected in the plasma of all normal individuals (1.04 +/- 0.33 ng/ml, n = 51) and patients analysed. Plasma collected from AML patients in remission (n = 6) contained only low levels of sCD86 but significantly elevated levels (> or =2.65 ng/ml, P < 0.0001) were detected in 10/24 AML patients analysed at the time of presentation or relapse. Significantly elevated levels of sCD86 were also detected in 2/17 B-CLL patients. There was no correlation between sCD86 levels and other clinical parameters. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that normal monocytes and dendritic cells, as well as isolated AML (n = 2) and B-CLL (n = 4) cells, expressed an alternatively spliced transcript of CD86 which encoded a soluble form absent in normal T, B and NK cells. The finding that a proportion of leukaemia patients contain elevated levels of sCD86 and that at least some leukaemic cells express sCD86 transcript suggests a potential role for sCD86 in modulating mCD86 signalling during the malignant process.","['Haematology Research Group, Christchurch Hospital, PO Box 4345, Christchurch, New Zealand.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The reciprocal evolution of AML and LGLs suggested that these LGLs had an anti-tumor activity. The patient's LGLs killed autologous leukemia cells in a different way to classical T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity since it did not rely on the recognition of target antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules by the CD3/TcRalphabeta complex. This killing was also different from natural killer (NK)-mediated cytotoxicity, which depends on the absence of MHC class I molecule recognition by NK inhibitory receptors. The LGLs were polyclonal, had a CD3+/CD8+/CD56+ phenotype, and did not express the natural killer cell receptors (NKRs) for MHC class I molecules. The LGLs did not express the NK-specific activating natural cytotoxicity receptors but expressed the 2B4 non-MHC restricted triggering receptor, whose ligand CD48 was expressed by leukemic cells and normal bone marrow cells. The 2B4 receptor participated in the ability of LGLs to lyse patient's leukemia. This represents a novel function for 2B4 in man, since this molecule, at variance with the murine system, was considered not to have direct effects on CD8+ T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This case report allowed us to describe a novel T lymphocyte-mediated anti-tumor mechanism which relied on (1) the abnormal expansion of the rare 2B4-positive CD3+/CD8+/CD56+ T lymphocyte subset, (2) an as yet undescribed cytotoxicity mechanism in man which depended on 2B4 molecule. The relevance of this observation in human cancer immunotherapy has to be further investigated.","[""Unite d'Immunologie des Tumeurs, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Universite de la Mediterranee, 232 boulevard Sainte Marguerite, 13009 Marseille, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic blasts from the bone marrow of 152 patients with newly diagnosed AML were analyzed for bcl-2 and wt1 mRNA expression using RT-PCR and quantitative PCR. Therapy outcome was correlated with the level of bcl-2 and wt1 transcripts. Bcl-2-specific mRNA was detectable in 127/152 (84%) patients and wt1 mRNA in 113/152 (74%) patients with AML. In monocytic subtypes the frequency of bcl-2 and wt1 transcripts was significantly lower. The expression of bcl-2 mRNA was correlated significantly with that of wt1 mRNA (P < 0.0001). In AML patients <60 years, high expression of bcl-2 and wt1 was associated with a reduced rate of continuing complete remission (CCR, P = 0.002 and P = 0.005, respectively) and increased death rate (P = 0.0002 and P = 0.04, respectively) in contrast to patients >60 years, where the expression of bcl-2 or wt1 had no prognostic impact. Based on the coexpression of bcl-2 and wt1, we established a prognostic model defining three risk groups with significant differences in CCR rate (P = 0.01), overall survival (P < 0.04) and disease-free survival (P < 0.03). Thus, bcl-2 and wt1 mRNA expression are associated with response and long-term outcome in AMLs. The coexpression of these genes allows determination of prognostic groups with high predictive value for overall and disease-free survival.","['Medical Clinic III, Hematology/Oncology, Ulm/Donau, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early reports have indicated that terminal differentiation of various cells is associated with a rapid inhibition of telomerase activity, preceded by a down-regulation of telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) mRNA. Recently, we have shown that telomerase can be repressed by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) independently of terminal maturation during long-term ATRA treatment of the maturation-resistant promyelocytic leukemia cell line (NB4-R1), leading to shortening of telomeres and cell death, events overcome by ectopic hTERT expression. Here, we report the isolation of a variant of NB4-R1 cells (NB4-R1(SFD)), which bypasses this death step, because of a re-activated telomerase, despite the continuous presence of ATRA. While unresponsive to a long-term maturation independent regulation of telomerase by ATRA, these cells retain a functional pathway of telomerase down-regulation associated with retinoid-induced maturation. These findings reinforce the notion that two distinct pathways of telomerase regulation by retinoids co-exist in APL cells. Noteworthy, we show that the slow developing mechanism, that causes death of maturation-resistant cells, is subjected to a new type of retinoid-resistance as yet not understood.","['INSERM U496, Centre G Hayem, Hopital Saint-Louis, 1 Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75010 Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of annexin V induced by DEX in both cell lines was enlarged, regardless of the presence of DNR. This difference was not observed in patient samples, however, the number of cells expressing annexin V was higher after exposure to DEX +/- DNR in comparison to respective samples not treated with DEX. In conclusion, it seems that DEX possibly has no impact on the sensitivity of childhood leukemic blasts to DNR, however, has weak cytotoxic properties itself.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical University, ul.

However, our recent study suggested that CMA-676 was excreted by a multi- drug-resistance (MDR) mechanism in P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-expressing leukemia cell lines. We analyzed the in vitro effects of CMA-676 on leukemia cells from 27 AML patients in relation to the amount of P-gp, MDR-associated protein 1 (MRP1), CD33 and CD34, using a multi-laser-equipped flow cytometer. The cytocidal effect of CMA-676, estimated by the amount of hypodiploid portion on cell cycle, was inversely related to the amount of P-gp estimated by MRK16 monoclonal antibody (P = 0.004), and to the P-gp function assessed by intracellular rhodamine-123 accumulation in the presence of PSC833 or MS209 as a MDR modifier (P = 0.0004 and P = 0.002, respectively). In addition, these MDR modifiers reversed CMA-676 resistance in P-gp-expressing CD33(+) leukemia cells (P = 0.001 with PSC833 and P = 0.0007 with MS209). In CD33(+) AML cells from 13 patients, CMA-676 was less effective on CD33(+)CD34(+) than CD33(+)CD34(-) cells (P = 0.002). PSC833 partially restored the effect of CMA-676 in CD33(+)CD34(+) cells. These results suggest that the combined use of CMA-676 and a MDR modifier will be more effective on CD33(+) AML with P-gp-related MDR.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine III, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, 1-20-1 Handa-yama, Hamamatsu-shi, 431-3192 Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, early treatment failure was predicted by the presence of constitutive JNK activity. The mechanistic origins of this association was sought. A multidrug resistant leukemic cell line, HL-60/ADR, characterized by hyperexpression of c-jun and JNK activity, was transfected with a mutant c-jun vector, whose substrate N-terminal c-jun serines were mutated. Down-regulated expression occurred of c-jun/AP-1-dependent genes, catalase and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) pi, which participate in cellular homeostasis to oxidative stress and xenobiotic exposure. MRP-efflux was abrogated in HL-60/ADR cells with dominant-negative c-jun, perhaps because MRP1 protein expression was also lost. Heightened sensitivity to daunorubicin resulted in cells subjected to this change. Biochemical analysis in 67 primary adult AML samples established a statistical correlation between cellular expression of c-jun and JNK activity, JNK activity with hyperleukocytosis at presentation of disease, and with exuberant MRP efflux. These findings reflect the survival role for c-jun/AP-1 and its regulatory kinase previously demonstrated for yeast in homeostatic response to oxidative stress and in operation of ATP-binding cassette efflux pumps, and may support evolutionary conservation of such function. Thus, JNK and c-jun may be salient drug targets in multidrug resistant AML.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Indiana University School of Medicine, 1044 W Walnut Street, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']","['CA 63783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 76173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased angiogenesis is observed in chronic B lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and published data reported VEGF and bFGF production in this disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate MMP expression in early stage B-CLL. Elevated MMP-9 concentrations were detected by ELISA in the sera of B-CLL patients (median level 250 ng/ml) compared with healthy donors (67 ng/ml) (P < 0.0001), and immunostaining with antibodies against MMP-9 and B cell antigens (CD19, CD23) substantiated the presence of MMP-9 in tumoral B lymphocytes. By using RT-PCR, ELISA and zymography experiments, we confirmed that B-CLL cells expressed and released the pro-form of MMP-9 with Mr 92 kDa (158-1300 pg/ml/10(6) cells/48 h), p-aminophenylmercuric acetate generating a 82 kDa active form. In contrast, the production of MMP-9 by normal counterpart B cells was significantly low (28-169 pg/ml/10(6)cells/48 h). Moreover, B-CLL culture supernatants contained bFGF (median levels 17 pg/ml/10(6) cells/48 h), VEGF (1.4 pg/ml/10(6) cells/48 h) and TNF-alpha (0.2 pg/ml/10(6) cells/48 h). TNF-alpha and VEGF antibodies blocked MMP-9 at the mRNA and protein levels. Interferons (IFNs) type I or type II repressed MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity in a dose and time dependency, and this was reflected by a parallel inhibition of MMP-9 mRNA and protein. IFNs however did not affect the production of bFGF, VEGF and TNF-alpha. Together, our data show that B-CLL lymphocytes synthesize MMP-9 and emphasize the specific inhibitory actions of IFNs on its expression.","[""Unite 365 INSERM, Section de Recherche, Institut Curie, Pavillon Pasteur, 26 rue d'Ulm, 75248 Paris cedex 05, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have compared the ability of stromal layers from normal (n = 7) and myelodysplastic (n = 9) marrow to alter proliferation and survival of the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor/interleukin-3-dependent cell line F-36P. Co-cultures for 72 h in the absence of exogenous cytokines were either in direct contact with stroma or separated by transwell inserts. On normal stromal layers, the ratio of adherent F-36P cells relative to stromal cells increased from a mean of 0.2 +/- 0.01 (s.d.) at 4 h of co-culture to 0.34 +/- 0.08 after 72 h (n = 7). Corresponding values on myelodysplastic stroma (0.2 +/- 0.02 at 4 h and 0.35 +/- 0.05 at 72 h; n = 9) indicated that the ability of myelodysplastic stromal layers to regulate short-term proliferation of F-36P cells may be similar to normal. Apoptosis of F-36P cells was quantified after co-culture with normal or myelodysplastic stroma: results from myelodysplastic co-cultures were standardized as a fraction of values from co-cultures with paired normal stroma (apoptotic ratio). Augmented apoptosis of F-36P cells was detected in 8/9 co-cultures with myelodysplastic stroma (mean = 15.7 +/- 9.7%, n = 9), compared with corresponding normal stroma (mean = 12.4 +/- 4.6%, n = 7, P < 0.05) with a mean apoptotic ratio of 1.4 +/- 0.5 (P < 0.05). There was no correlation between stroma-related apoptosis and FAB type, tumour necrosis factor-alpha concentrations in the culture supernatant or numbers of stromal macrophages, and no evidence of involvement of the Fas pathway. Increased apoptosis was detected in cells grown in transwell inserts over stroma (23.8 +/- 3%, n = 5) compared to adherent cells in cultures with normal stromal layers, but this survival difference was not observed in co-cultures with myelodysplastic stroma. These results suggest that abnormal stromal function in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes may contribute to increased apoptosis of haemopoietic cells within the marrow microenvironment. The effect appears to be dependent on close cellular contact, rather than the release of soluble factors, but the exact mechanism remains unclear.","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Pathology, University of Dundee, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, Dundee, Scotland, UK.']",,['Leukemia. 2002 May;16(5):960-1; author reply 961.

If proliferating cells fail to coordinate centrosome duplication with DNA replication, this will inevitably lead to a change in ploidy, and the formation of monopolar or multipolar spindles will generally provoke abnormal segregation of chromosomes. Indeed, it has long been recognized that errors in the centrosome duplication cycle may be an important cause of aneuploidy and thus contribute to cancer formation. This view has recently received fresh impetus with the description of supernumerary centrosomes in almost all solid human tumors. As the primary microtubule organizing center of most eukaryotic cells, the centrosome assures symmetry and bipolarity of the cell division process, a function that is essential for accurate chromosome segregation. In addition, a growing body of evidence indicates that centrosomes might be important for initiating S phase and completing cytokinesis. Centrosomes undergo duplication precisely once before cell division. Recent reports have revealed that this process is linked to the cell division cycle via cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2 activity that couples centriole duplication to the onset of DNA replication at the G(1)/S phase transition. Alterations in G(1)/S phase regulating proteins like the retinoblastoma protein, cyclins D and E, cdk4 and 6, cdk inhibitors p16(INK4A) and p15(INK4B), and p53 are among the most frequent aberrations observed in human malignancies. These alterations might not only lead to unrestrained proliferation, but also cause karyotypic instability by uncontrolled centrosome replication. Since several excellent reports on cell cycle regulation and cancer have been published, this review will focus on the role of centrosomes in cell cycle progression, as well as causes and consequences of aberrant centrosome replication in human neoplasias.","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik V, Ruprecht-Karls-Universitat Heidelberg, Hospitalstrasse 3, 69115 Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,127,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten nM Aplidine for 1 h inhibited ornithine decarboxylase activity, with a subsequently strong decrease in putrescine levels. This finding has questionable relevance since addition of putrescine did not significantly reduce the cell cycle perturbations or the cytotoxicity of Aplidine.

Although the mechanism of action of Aplidine is still unclear, the cell cycle phase perturbations and the rapid induction of apoptosis in Molt-4 cells appear to be due to a mechanism different from that of known anticancer drugs.","['Cancer Pharmacology Laboratory, Department of Oncology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, via Eritrea 62, 20157 Milan, Italy. erba@marionegri.it']",,,,,,['Copyright 2002 Cancer Research UK'],PMC2375382,,,,,,,,,,,

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (formerly STI571) was reported to selectively suppress the proliferation of BCR-ABL-positive cells. Assuming that imatinib could be included in pretransplantation conditioning therapies, we tested whether combinations of imatinib and gamma-irradiation or alkylating agents such as busulfan or treosulfan would display synergistic activity in BCR-ABL-positive chronic myelogenous leukaemia BV173 and EM-3 cell lines. Further, primary cells of untreated chronic myelogenous leukaemia patients were assayed for colony forming ability under combination therapy with imatinib. Additionally, the cytotoxic effect of these combinations on BCR-ABL-negative cells was investigated. In the cell lines a tetrazolium based MTT assay was used to quantify growth inhibition after exposure to cytotoxic drugs alone or to combinations with imatinib. Irradiation was applied prior to exposure to imatinib. Interaction of drugs was analysed using the median-effect method of Chou and Talalay. The combination index was calculated according to the classic isobologram equation. The combination imatinib + gamma-irradiation proved to be significantly synergistic over a broad range of cell growth inhibition levels in both BCR-ABL-positive cell lines and produced the strongest reduction in primary chronic myelogenous leukaemia colony-forming progenitor cells. Combinations of imatinib + busulfan and imatinib + treosulfan showed merely additive to antagonistic effects. Imatinib did not potentiate the effects of irradiation or cytotoxic agents in BCR-ABL-negative cells. Our data provide the basis to further develop imatinib-containing conditioning therapies for stem cell transplantation in chronic myelogenous leukaemia.","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Hospitalstrasse 3, D-69115 Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,['Copyright 2002 Cancer Research UK'],PMC2375375,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated whether the inhibition of this tyrosine kinase by the novel compound STI571 (formerly CGP57148B) would render K562, KU812 cell lines and chronic myeloid leukaemia-progenitor cells sensitive to induction of cell kill. Proliferation assays showed STI571 to be an effective cytotoxic agent in chronic myeloid leukaemia-derived cell lines (IC(50) on day 5 of 4.6 microg ml(-1) and 3.4 microg ml(-1) for K562 and KU812 respectively) and in leukaemic blast cells (per cent viability on day 3 at 4 microg ml(-1): 55.5+/-8.7 vs 96.4+/-3.7%). STI571 also appeared to specifically target bcr-abl expressing cells, as results from colony forming assays using the surviving cell fraction from STI571-treated peripheral CD34(+) chronic myeloid leukaemia blast cells, indicated a reduction in the expansion of colonies of myeloid lineage, but no effect on normal colony formation. Our data also showed synergy between STI571 and other anti-leukaemic agents; as an example, there were significant increases in per cent cell kill in cell lines cultured with both STI571 and etoposide compared to the two alone (per cent cell kill on day 3: 73.7+/-11.3 vs 44.5+/-8.7 and 17.8+/-7.0% in cultures with STI571 and etoposide alone respectively; P<0.001).

These electric and magnetic fields are predominantly of low frequency (60 Hz) and generally of low intensity. The prevailing view among physicists is that exposure to these low-frequency, low-intensity fields does not pose a health hazard. However, this view has been challenged by reports linking magnetic field exposure to the development of leukemia and other cancers. Because multiple epidemiologic studies suggested a potential for increased cancer rates with increasing exposure, and because of public concern, the effects of 60-Hz magnetic field exposure were examined in F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice in 8-week full-body-exposure studies. Animals were evaluated for hematology and clinical chemistry (rats only) parameters, pineal gland hormone concentrations, and histopathology. Additional studies were performed in Sprague-Dawley rats to examine teratologic and reproductive effects of magnetic field exposure. In the 8-week toxicity studies, groups of male and female F344/N rats and B6C3F1 mice were exposed for 18.5 hours per day to 60-Hz magnetic fields at intensities of 0 (control), 0.02, 2, and 10 gauss (G). Additional groups of rats and mice were exposed to intermittent 10 G fields (1 hour on/1 hour off) for 18.5 hours per day. No evidence of toxicity associated with exposure to magnetic fields was observed in rats or mice. Clinical observations provided no evidence of adverse effects associated with magnetic field exposure. Compared to control rats and mice, there were no biologically significant differences in hematology or clinical chemistry parameters of rats exposed to magnetic fields. No gross lesions or histopathologic findings in rats or mice were attributed to exposure to 60-Hz magnetic fields. In addition, magnetic field exposure was not associated with a significant reduction in serum melatonin or pineal gland melatonin concentration, or pineal gland activity of N-acetyltransferase in either species. One female rat in the 2 G exposure group died during the 8-week toxicity study from causes unrelated to magnetic field exposure; all other male and female rats and mice in the study survived until the end of the study. Final mean body weights and mean organ weights of a few groups of exposed animals differed from those of the control groups; however, no clear pattern of magnetic field effects was observed, and these differences are not considered to be biologically significant. For the teratology study, groups of 55 pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the same magnetic fields as in the toxicity study on gestation days 6 through 19. Fifteen pregnant females exposed to 85 mg ethylenethiourea/kg body weight served as positive controls. Except for the positive controls, there were no changes in maternal or fetal weights, nor were fetal abnormalities found. The number of pregnant females was significantly lower in groups exposed to magnetic fields than in the control group; however, all breeding in the teratology study was completed prior to the first day of magnetic field or sham exposure. On this basis, this finding is unrelated to magnetic field exposure. In addition, there were no differences between control and exposed groups in the number of pregnant females in the continuous breeding study, in which breeding took place within the magnetic fields. Groups of 40 breeding pairs of Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to the same magnetic fields as in the toxicity study during the breeding and lactation of five litters in a continuous breeding study. The fifth litter was exposed during gestation and lactation; one male and one female from each litter were raised to sexual maturity receiving the same exposures as the parents; rats were mated to nonsibling rats and allowed to deliver the third-generation offspring. The results of the continuous breeding study demonstrated no effects of magnetic field exposure on reproductive performance in either male or female rats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the role of older children in discussing a recent diagnosis of acute leukemia and treatment options, including participation in a randomized, clinical trial (RCT). DESIGN: Our sample was drawn from data collected as part of a larger, National Cancer Institute-funded study in which we observed, tape-recorded, and transcribed the informed consent conference (ICC) for children with leukemia at 6 institutions. We analyzed the data for the child's presence and role, examined 5 discussion categories relevant to assent in the context of pediatric cancer treatment/research, conducted parent interviews, and administered clinician questionnaires to examine these issues. We report a qualitative analysis of 14 cases in which the child was present for the ICC. RESULTS: Clinicians varied with regard to whom they directed specific discussions when patients were present. Questions asked by the children predominantly related to details of the disease and treatment, with few questions about the RCT. Clinicians and parents attribute responsibility for decision-making about participation in RCTs in a variety of ways. In conferences that included the child-patient, parents asked significantly fewer questions than in other ICCs. CONCLUSION: There is significant variation among ICCs that include the older child. Additional empirical study of assent is warranted, and our data suggest several hypotheses that should be tested in future research.","[""Rainbow Center for Pediatric Ethics, Department of Pediatrics, Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital of University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA.""]",['R01 CA83267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined 14 cell lines, 11 reactive lymphoid tissues, and 57 primary hematopoietic neoplasms including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) (n = 10), chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) (n = 11), acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (n = 15), follicular lymphoma (n = 6), peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (n = 3), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (n = 3), hairy cell leukemia (n = 3), Burkitt lymphoma (n = 1), Burkitt-like lymphoma (n = 4), and plasmacytoma (n = 1) for the expression of cyclin D1 mRNA using fluorescently labeled sequence-specific hybridization probes. Fluorescence (F) was plotted against cycle (C) number over 45 cycles. The log-linear portion of the F versus C graph identified a fractional cycle number for threshold fluorescence. A beta-globin mRNA transcript with equivalent amplification efficiency to that of cyclin D1 was used for assessment of RNA integrity and normalization. In general, the MCLs demonstrated substantially higher levels of cyclin D1 mRNA than the other lymphoproliferative processes. Moderately high levels of cyclin D1 mRNA were detected in one PTCL. On average, the CLL/SLL cases showed cyclin D1 mRNA levels two to three orders of magnitude lower than observed in the MCLs. Cell lines derived from non-hematopoietic neoplasms such as fibrosarcoma, small cell carcinoma, and neuroblastoma showed comparable or higher levels of cyclin D1 mRNA than the MCLs. Our results indicate that quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT) polymerase chain reaction is a simple, rapid, and accurate technique for assessing cyclin D1 expression, and while it is not specific, it can reliably be used in the distinction of MCL from CLL/SLL.","['Associated Regional and University Pathologists (ARUP) Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. kojo.elenitobaj@path.utah.edu']",['CA 83984/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC1906992,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the impact and risk factors for such infections from different geographical areas vary, and the use of both immunological and molecular assays to determine HCV infections has been our approach. Children from a hematology-oncology unit (HOU) in Nicaragua were studied for both HBV and HCV serological markers; studies for the latter used both immunological (anti-HCV) and molecular (HCV RNA) assays. The children from the HOU included patients with leukemia, lymphoma, other neoplasias, and anemia and a smaller group with other hematological diseases. As a control group, children from other units at the same hospital were enrolled, as well as health care workers attending both patient populations. Pertinent clinical and personal data for each child at the HOU were obtained for statistical analysis. Of the 625 children from the HOU enrolled in this study 53.3% were infected with HCV and 29.4% had a prior or present HBV infection. In the child patient control group 3.2% had HBV markers and all were negative for HCV. The group of children with leukemia had the highest infection rate for both HBV and HCV. However, the determination of anti-HCV was found to have an overall low sensitivity in children from HOU, and a retest consisting of a molecular assay to determine HCV RNA was performed to better establish the total number of HCV-infected subjects in this group. The highest independent risk factor for infection was hospitalization. The very high prevalence rates for both HBV and HCV infection in this patient group indicate an urgent need to implement better control of known risk factors and to consider the use of both immunological and molecular assays for HCV diagnostic purposes.","['Louisiana State University International Center for Medical Research and Training, San Jose, Costa Rica.']",,,,,,,PMC119972,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of imatinib mesylate on primitive malignant progenitors in CML has not been evaluated, and it is not clear whether suppression of progenitor growth represents inhibition of increased proliferation, induction of apoptosis, or both. We demonstrated here that in vitro exposure to concentrations of imatinib mesylate usually achieved in patients (1-2 microM) for 96 hours inhibited BCR/ABL-positive primitive progenitors (6-week long-term culture-initiating cells [LTCICs]) as well as committed progenitors (colony-forming cells [CFCs]). No suppression of normal LTCICs and significantly less suppression of normal CFCs were observed. A higher concentration of imatinib mesylate (5 microM) did not significantly increase suppression of CML or normal LTCICs but did increase suppression of CML CFCs, and to a lesser extent, normal CFCs. Analysis of cell division using the fluorescent dye carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester indicated that imatinib mesylate (1-2 microM) inhibits cycling of CML primitive (CD34(+)CD38(-)) and committed (CD34(+)CD38(+)) progenitors to a much greater extent than normal cells. Conversely, treatment with 1 to 2 microM imatinib mesylate did not significantly increase the percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis. Although a higher concentration of imatinib mesylate (5 microM) led to an increase in apoptosis of CML cells, apoptosis also increased in normal samples. In summary, at clinically relevant concentrations, imatinib mesylate selectively suppresses CML primitive progenitors by reversing abnormally increased proliferation but does not significantly increase apoptosis. These results suggest that inhibition of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase by imatinib mesylate restores normal hematopoiesis by removing the proliferative advantage of CML progenitors but that elimination of all CML progenitors may not occur.","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation and the Department of Cytogenetics, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']","['CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polymorphisms in methionine synthase (MS A2756G), cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT1 C1420T), and a double (2R2R) or triple (3R3R) 28-bp tandem repeat in the promoter region of thymidylate synthase (TS) were studied and found to modulate ALL risk.

The latter codes for a novel leucine zipper protein, one of many MLL fusion partners of unknown function. In this report, we demonstrate that retroviral-mediated transduction of an MLL-AF10 complementary DNA into primary murine myeloid progenitors enhanced their clonogenic potential in serial replating assays and led to their efficient immortalization at a primitive stage of myeloid differentiation. Furthermore, MLL-AF10-transduced cells rapidly induced acute myeloid leukemia in syngeneic or severe combined immunodeficiency recipient mice. Structure/function analysis showed that a highly conserved 82-amino acid portion of AF10, comprising 2 adjacent alpha-helical domains, was sufficient for immortalizing activity when fused to MLL. Neither helical domain alone mediated immortalization, and deletion of the 29-amino acid leucine zipper within this region completely abrogated transforming activity. Similarly, the minimal oncogenic domain of AF10 exhibited transcriptional activation properties when fused to the MLL or GAL4 DNA-binding domains, while neither helical domain alone did. However, transcriptional activation per se was not sufficient because a second activation domain of AF10 was neither required nor competent for transformation. The requirement for alpha-helical transcriptional effector domains is similar to the oncogenic contributions of unrelated MLL partners ENL and ELL, suggesting a general mechanism of myeloid leukemogenesis by a subset of MLL fusion proteins, possibly through specific recruitment of the transcriptional machinery.","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305, USA.']","['5T32CA09151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BCRP protein expression was measured flow cytometrically with the monoclonal antibodies BXP-34 and BXP-21 in 20 paired samples of de novo and relapsed/refractory AML. BXP-34/immunoglobulin G1 ratios were observed of 1.6 +/- 0.5 (mean +/- SD, range 0.8-2.7) and BXP-21/immunoglobulin G2a ratios of 4.9 +/- 3.0 (range 1.1-14.5) in the patient samples versus 9.8 +/- 6.8 and 6.5 +/- 2.4, respectively, in the MCF-7 cell line. BCRP activity was determined flow cytometrically by measuring mitoxantrone accumulation in absence and presence of the inhibitor fumitremorgin C. Mitoxantrone accumulation, expressed as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI), varied between 44 and 761 MFI (227 +/- 146 MFI) and correlated inversely with BCRP expression (r = -0.58, P <.001). Addition of fumitremorgin C showed a small increase in mitoxantrone accumulation (11 +/- 29 MFI, n = 40) apart from the effect of PSC833 and MK-571. No consistent up-regulation of BCRP expression or activity was observed at relapse/refractory disease; some cases showed an increase and other cases a decrease at relapse. Relatively high BCRP expression correlated with immature immunophenotype, as determined by expression of the surface marker CD34 (r = 0.54, P =.001). In conclusion, this study shows that BCRP protein is expressed at low but variable levels in AML, especially in immature CD34(+) cells.

Stimulation of Notch causes cleavage followed by translocation of the intracellular domain (NotchIC) to the nucleus, where it activates transcription of CBF1 responsive genes. The aim of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms leading to the overexpression of CD23, a striking feature of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells. By electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we identified a transcription factor complex (C1) that binds sequence specific to one known and 4 newly identified putative CBF1 recognition sites in the CD23a core promoter region. With the use of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-infected B cells as a model for CBF1 mediated CD23a expression, C1 was found to be EBV inducible. Supershift assays revealed that the nuclear form of Notch2 is a component of C1 in B-CLL cells, supporting a model in which NotchIC activates transcription by binding to CBF1 tethered to DNA. Transient transfection of REH pre-B cells with an activated form of Notch2 induced endogenous CD23a, confirming that CD23a is a target gene of Notch2 signaling. Finally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and kinetic analysis demonstrated that the Notch2 oncogene is not only overexpressed in B-CLL cells but might also be related to the failure of apoptosis characteristic for this disease. In conclusion, these data suggest that deregulation of Notch2 signaling is involved in the aberrant expression of CD23 in B-CLL.","['Department of Hematology, Clinic of Internal Medicine I, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we analyzed the cytolytic function of NK cells obtained from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In sharp contrast with healthy donors, in most (16 of 18) patients with AML the majority of NK cells displayed low NCR surface density (NCR(dull)). This phenotype correlated with a weak cytolytic activity against autologous leukemic cells that could not be reversed by the monoclonal antibody-mediated disruption of HLA class I/killer immunoglobulinlike receptor interaction. The remaining 2 patients were characterized by NK cells having an NCR(bright) phenotype. Surprisingly, although displaying NCR-mediated cytolytic activity, these NCR(bright) NK cells were unable to kill autologous leukemic blasts. Importantly, the leukemic blasts from these 2 patients were also resistant to lysis mediated by normal NCR(bright) allogeneic NK cells. Our study suggests that in most instances the inability of NK cells to kill autologous leukemic blasts is consequent to low NCR surface expression. In few cases, however, this failure appears to involve a mechanism of tumor escape based on down-regulation of ligands relevant for NCR-mediated target cell recognition.","[""Unite d'Immunologie des Tumeurs Departement d'Hematologie, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Universite de la Mediterranee, Marseille, France. regis.costello@free.fr""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 260 patients with CML were enrolled in a phase II trial, of whom 229 had a confirmed diagnosis of CML in blast crisis. Patients were treated with imatinib in daily oral doses of 400 mg or 600 mg. Imatinib induced hematologic responses in 52% of patients and sustained hematologic responses lasting at least 4 weeks in 31% of patients, including complete hematologic responses in 8%. For patients with a sustained response, the estimated median response duration was 10 months. Imatinib induced major cytogenetic responses in 16% of patients, with 7% of the responses being complete. Median survival time was 6.9 months. Nonhematologic adverse reactions were frequent but generally mild or moderate. Episodes of severe cytopenia were also frequent and were attributable to the underlying condition and treatment with imatinib. Drug-related adverse events led to discontinuation of therapy in 5% of patients, most often because of cytopenia, skin disorders, or gastrointestinal reactions. These results demonstrate that imatinib has substantial activity and a favorable safety profile when used as a single agent in patients with CML in blast crisis. Additional clinical studies are warranted to explore the efficacy and feasibility of imatinib used in combination with other antileukemic drugs.","['Department of Medicine and Molecular Biology Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. csawyers@mednet.ucla.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We thus performed a large retrospective study in 161 adults and children with t(8;21) acute myeloid leukemia, all prospectively enrolled in 6 different trials conducted in France between 1987 and 1998 (median follow-up 4.9 years). Prognostic studies were performed in the 154 patients who achieved a complete remission. Individual data were registered, including sex, age, blood and marrow counts, extramedullary disease, and cytogenetics. The value of allogeneic stem cell transplantation versus chemotherapy as postremission therapy was evaluated according to the intent-to-treat principle. Estimated 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival were 52% and 59%, respectively. Outcome was not significantly better in patients from the stem cell transplantation group (estimated 5-year DFS and survival, 56% vs 52% and 67% vs 57%; P =.55 and.64, respectively). White blood cell count (WBC) was the only identified prognostic factor. To further take into account the spontaneous differentiation potential of the leukemic clone, a WBC index was derived as the product of WBC by the ratio of marrow blast. This WBC index was a more powerful factor than the original WBC, allowing us to distinguish 3 subgroups of patients with different outcomes (low index, < 2.5; intermediate index, 2.5-20; high index, 20 or more). In multivariate analysis, the WBC index was the only prognostic factor for DFS (P =.003), complete remission duration (P =.002), and overall survival (P =.04).","['Department of Hematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach (the 'deep diff') enabled the detection of small numbers of diagnostically significant cells in a majority of patients. We found ringed sideroblasts in 5/7 patients with sideroblastic anaemia and megaloblasts in 9/10 patients with megaloblastic anaemia. We observed centrocytes in seven patients with follicular lymphoma, mantle cells in five patients with mantle cell lymphoma and marginal zone cells in five patients with nodal marginal zone lymphoma. We detected small percentages of lymphoma cells in cytospins of mononuclear leucocytes in 12 patients with large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma and anaplastic large-cell lymphoma. The deep diff was nondiagnostic in 5/6 patients with hairy cell leukaemia and in 9/10 patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma. In these cases, there were insufficient cells to detect light chain restriction. Increased counts of leukaemic cells were found in 12/13 patients with acute leukaemia with < 3% blasts in the conventional white cell differential. Increased blasts were also observed in six patients with refractory anaemia with excess of blasts (RAEB). Decreased blasts were found in five patients with aplastic anaemia and in nine patients with bone marrow aplasia after intensive chemotherapy. Increased plasma cell counts were observed in 13/14 patients with advanced plasma cell myeloma. We conclude that the 'deep diff', augmented by immunocytochemistry, may be useful in the diagnosis of haematological disorders.","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Charite Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Humboldt-University, Berlin, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After hybridization, the arrays were imaged using a fluorescence scanner. The arrays were then treated with 80-nm-diameter gold RLS Particles coated with anti-biotin antibodies and imaged in a white light, CCD-based imaging system. At low probe concentrations, significantly more genes were detected by RLS compared to labeling by Cy3. For example, for hybridizations with a probe concentration of 83.3 pg/microL, approximately 1150 positive genes were detected using RLS compared to approximately 110 positive genes detected with Cy3. In a differential gene expression experiment using human lung and leukemia RNA samples, similar differential expression profiles were obtained for labeling by RLS and fluorescence technologies. The use of RLS Particles is particularly attractive for detection and identification of low-abundance mRNAs and for those applications in which the amount of sample is limited.","['Biochemical Technologies, Science and Technology Division, Coming Incorporated, Coming, New York 14831, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recorded systematically positive blood-cultures and days with intravenous antibiotics. In a subgroup of 13 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the thrombophilia parameters were re-evaluated during asparaginase therapy. RESULTS: Forty-one children were included in the study and observed for a mean of 266 days (range 95-569 days). Eighteen patients (44%) developed venous thrombosis (VT), visualized by Doppler ultrasonography of the catheterized vein. Some clots were transient, but blood clots with diameters > 0.5 cm (n = 11) had a tendency to remain (P = 0.14). Twelve children (29%) were classified as thrombophilic at inclusion, with elevated serum levels of homocysteine and lipoprotein (a) as the most frequent alterations. Transient thrombophilia developed in all patients during asparaginase-therapy. Within the limitations of our study, we did not find any significant correlation between thrombophilia and development of VT, nor thrombosis and infectious disease.

One control was randomly selected for each case and individually matched by sex, month, and year of birth. Children with Down's syndrome were excluded. Exposure data were blindly abstracted from antenatal, obstetric, and other standardized medical records. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated by conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: A history of maternal infection was not significantly associated with childhood leukemia, OR = 1.25 (95% CI 0.95-1.65). Maternal lower genital tract infection significantly increased the risk of childhood leukemia, OR = 1.78 (95% CI 1.17-2.72), and especially for children over 4 years of age at diagnosis, OR = 2.01 (95% CI 1.12-3.80). Neonatal infection was not associated with the risk of leukemia. The results remained unaltered after adjustment for potential confounders, and separate analyses for myeloid and lymphoid leukemia.

PROCEDURE: We studied the relation between t(9;22), determined by karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and in vitro drug resistance, measured by the MTT assay, in precursor B-cell ALL at diagnosis. The findings in twenty-one Ph-positive (Ph+) childhood common/precursorB (c/preB) cases were compared with 254 Ph-negative (Ph-) ALL cases. RESULTS: A large range of LC(50) values was found within the Ph+ patients. Moreover, LC(50) values did not differ significantly between Ph+ and Ph- samples for prednisolone, dexamethasone, L-asparaginase, vincristine, anthracyclines, thiopurines, epipodophyllotoxins, and 4H00-ifosfamide, even after matching for important prognostic features (age, white blood cell count (WBC), and immunophenotype). Adult Ph+ (n = 12) ALL was more resistant to prednisolone (> 270-fold, P = 0.030), and displayed an overall tendency to resistance when compared to matched cases of Ph- (n = 15) adult precursor B-cell ALL. Within Ph+ ALL, in vitro prednisolone resistance increased significantly with age (P = 0.006). The expression of lung resistance protein (LRP), but not P-glycoprotein (P-gp) or multidrug resistance protein (MRP), was significantly higher in all Ph+ patients. CONCLUSIONS: Both childhood and adult Ph+ precursor B-cell ALL samples display a heterogeneous in vitro resistance profile, with relatively sensitive and resistant cases. The adult Ph+ samples, however, are generally more resistant compared to matched Ph- controls, reaching significance for prednisolone. The correlation of prednisolone resistance with age within the Ph+ cases might help explain the poorer prognosis of adult Ph+ ALL.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. ramakersvanwoerden@VUmc.nl']",,,,['Dutch and German Leukemia Study Groups'],,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

This novel phospholipid combines the fatty acid's and the drug's anticancer activities in a molecule amenable to a liposome bilayer for safe, simultaneous delivery of the two agents. Two phosphatidylcholines were synthesized, from 1-stearoyl or 1-docosahexaenoyl, 2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, to contain MTX in the sn-2 position and either stearic acid or DHA in the sn-1 position. The products contain fatty acid, MTX and phosphorus (1:1:1), and the MTX was released by phospholipase A(2), consistent with the proposed phospholipid structure. The predominant product linked MTX to the glycerol moiety through MTX's gamma-carboxyl group. Liposomes composed of 1-stearoyl, 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine plus 1-stearoyl, 2-oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine and various concentrations of the novel phospholipids caused dose-dependent inhibition of murine leukemia cell proliferation in culture. The DHA- and MTX-containing phosphatidylcholine was more effective than that containing stearic acid, and DHA appeared to synergize with MTX when they were added as free agents or covalently linked in the phospholipid. These data show the feasibility of synthesizing, and the inhibitory activity of phosphatidylcholine with DHA in the sn-1 position and MTX in the sn-2 position, and suggest the compound's potential use in cancer chemotherapy.","['Department of Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, IN 46202-5143, USA.']",['GM 57371/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about its therapeutic efficacy in human transitional carcinomas. In this study, the arsenic-mediated apoptotic pathway in transitional carcinoma cells was investigated. Three bladder transitional carcinoma cell lines were used, including a parental sensitive line and two resistant daughter lines (cisplatin and As(2)O(3) resistant). The As(2)O(3)-mediated cytotoxicity to the three cell lines was studied in vitro in the presence or absence of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a chemotherapy modulator. In results, although a lesser extent of apoptosis was seen in cells treated with As(2)O(3) alone, more significant apoptotic events were observed in the combined treatment of As(2)O(3) and non-toxic concentrations of BSO (up to 10 microM). These included the accumulation of sub-G(1) fractions and internucleosomal DNA breakdown, which were preceded by production of reactive oxygen species, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3. In conclusion, As(2)O(3) in the presence of BSO may be an active agent against both chemonaive and cisplatin-resistant transitional carcinomas. The As(2)O(3)-mediated cytotoxicity appeared to go through the conventional apoptotic pathway. Our results have clinical implications and warrant further investigation.","['Department of Urology, National Taiwan University Hospital and National Taiwan University College of Medicine, 7 Chung-Shan South Road, Taipei, Taiwan 100, ROC. yspu@ha.mc.ntu.edu.tw']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, resistance often develops in the treatment of patients and the tumor either never responds to or becomes refractory to these agents. Resistance to the nitrogen mustards in murine and human tumor cells has been reported to be secondary to alterations in (i) the transport of these agents, (ii) their reactivity, (iii) apoptosis and (iv) altered DNA repair activity. In the present review, we will discuss the role of DNA repair in nitrogen mustard resistance in cancer. The nitrogen mustards' lethality is based on the induction of DNA interstrand cross-links (ICLs). Two DNA repair pathways are known to be involved in removal of ICLs: non-homologous DNA end-joining (NHEJ) and Rad51-related homologous recombinational repair (HRR). The reports discussed here lead us to hypothesize that low NHEJ activity defines a hypersensitive state, while high NHEJ activity, along with increased HRR activity, contributes to the resistant state in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Studies on human epithelial tumor cell lines suggest that HRR rather than NHEJ plays a role in nitrogen mustard sensitivity.","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research, Sir Mortimer B Davis Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec H3T 1E2, Canada. lpanasci@hotmail.com']",,,,,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the genes affected by these changes have not been identified, two critically deleted regions (CDRs) are well established. We have identified 76 zebrafish cDNAs orthologous to genes located in these 5q CDRs. Radiation hybrid mapping revealed that 33 of the 76 zebrafish orthologs are clustered in a genomic region on linkage group 14 (LG14). Fifteen others are located on LG21, and two on LG10. Although there are large blocks of conserved syntenies, the gene order between human and zebrafish is extensively inverted and transposed. Thus, intrachromosomal rearrangements and inversions appear to have occurred more frequently than translocations during evolution from a common chordate ancestor. Interestingly, of the 33 orthologs located on LG14, three have duplicates on LG21, suggesting that the duplication event occurred early in the evolution of teleosts. Murine orthologs of human 5q CDR genes are distributed among three chromosomes, 18, 11, and 13. The order of genes within the three syntenic mouse chromosomes appears to be more colinear with the human order, suggesting that translocations occurred more frequently than inversions during mammalian evolution. Our comparative map should enhance understanding of the evolution of the del(5q) chromosomal region. Mutant fish harboring deletions affecting the 5q CDR syntenic region may provide useful animal models for investigating the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia.","[""Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.""]","['R01 CA093152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 93152/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC122915,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2002 Apr 30.,,"An important goal of cancer immunology is the identification of antigens associated with tumor destruction. Vaccination with irradiated tumor cells engineered to secrete granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) generates potent, specific, and long-lasting antitumor immunity in multiple murine tumor models. A phase I clinical trial of this vaccination strategy in patients with advanced melanoma demonstrated the consistent induction of dense CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocyte and plasma cell infiltrates in distant metastases, resulting in extensive tumor destruction, fibrosis, and edema. Antimelanoma antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses were associated with tumor cell death. To characterize the targets of these responses, we screened an autologous cDNA expression library prepared from a densely infiltrated metastasis with postvaccination sera from a long-term responding patient. High-titer IgG antibodies detected ATP6S1, a putative accessory unit of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase complex. A longitudinal analysis of this patient revealed an association between the vaccine-induced increase in antibodies to ATP6S1 and tumor destruction. Three additional vaccinated melanoma patients and three metastatic non-small cell lung carcinoma patients vaccinated with autologous GM-CSF-secreting tumor cells similarly showed a correlation between humoral responses to ATP6S1 and tumor destruction. Moreover, a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient who experienced a complete remission after CD4(+) donor lymphocyte infusions also developed high-titer antibodies to ATP6S1. Lastly, vaccination with GM-CSF-secreting B16 melanoma cells stimulated high-titer antibodies to ATPS1 in a murine model. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that potent humoral responses to ATP6S1 are associated with immune-mediated destruction of diverse tumors.","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']","['CA78880/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA074886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA039542/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC124504,20020430,,,,,,,,,,

EBV is detected in Hodgkin's lymphoma Reed-Sternberg cells from some patients, but in young adult patients, it is detected at a relatively low frequency in these cells. Hodgkin's lymphoma and infectious mononucleosis are both associated with high social class, and unknown confounding factors that are also associated with socioeconomic status might explain or contribute to the apparent association between these diseases. To indirectly assess the importance of socioeconomic status on the association between these diseases, we determined the risk for hematopoietic and lymphatic cancers in first-degree relatives of patients with confirmed EBV-related infectious mononucleosis. METHODS: We identified parents, siblings, and offspring of 17,045 persons with serologically confirmed EBV-related infectious mononucleosis. Subjects in these cohorts were linked with the population-based Danish Cancer Register to identify those developing hematopoietic/lymphatic cancers after the index patient was diagnosed with infectious mononucleosis. The relative risk for cancer in the infectious mononucleosis family members was expressed as standardized incidence ratios (SIRs; i.e., the ratio between the number of cancers observed and the number of cancers expected, obtained from age-specific, sex-specific, and period-specific incidence rates). RESULTS: We identified 8052 parents, 5264 siblings, and 28,605 offspring of patients with EBV-related infectious mononucleosis who were followed for a total of 892,213 person-years at risk. The risk for Hodgkin's lymphoma was unaltered in the combined group of first-degree relatives of these patients (SIR = 0.99; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] = 0.62 to 1.59; number of cases [n] = 17), in the group of parents (SIR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.31 to 2.22; n = 4), in the group of siblings (SIR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.31 to 2.97; n = 3), and in the group of offspring (SIR = 1.08; 95% CI = 0.58 to 2.02; n = 10). CONCLUSION: The unremarkable risk for Hodgkin's lymphoma in family members of patients with EBV-related infectious mononucleosis indicates that socioeconomic confounding is an unlikely explanation for the association between EBV-related infectious mononucleosis and Hodgkin's lymphoma.","['Department of Epidemiology Research, Danish Epidemiology Science Centre, Statens Serum Institut, Copenhagen, Denmark. hhj@ssi.dk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we looked into its mechanism of inhibition. DHMEQ inhibited tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)- and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced transcriptional activity of NF-kappaB in human T cell leukemia Jurkat cells. It also inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced DNA binding of nuclear NF-kappaB but not the phosphorylation and degradation of IkappaB. Moreover, DHMEQ inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced nuclear accumulation of p65, a component of NF-kappaB. It also inhibited TNF-alpha-induced nuclear transport of green fluorescent protein-tagged p65. On the other hand, DHMEQ did not inhibit the nuclear transport of Smad2 and large T antigen. Also, it did not inhibit TNF-alpha-induced activation of JNK but synergistically induced apoptosis with TNF-alpha in Jurkat cells. Taken together, these data indicate that DHMEQ is a unique inhibitor of NF-kappaB acting at the level of nuclear translocation.","['Department of Applied Chemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology, Keio University, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Kohoku-ku, Yokohama 223-0061, Japan.']",,,,,,,,20020430,,,,,,,,,,

Although not correlated with prognosis, the level of MRD after induction course affected the degree of cytoreduction achieved with consolidation. In fact, the patients who entered a MRDCons(-) status had a median number of leukemic residual cells of 1.8 x 10(-4) after induction; at the same stage, the bone marrow of patients who were in a MRDCons(+) condition harbored a median level of 1.7 x 10(-3) malignant residual cells (p = 0.00073). The MRDCons(+) status also correlated significantly with poor/intermediate risk cytogenetics, MDR1 phenotype, short duration of overall survival, and relapse-free survival (p = 0.024, 0.021, 0.00001, and 0.00001, respectively). In multivariate analysis, the MRDCons(+) status was associated with a high probability of relapse (p < 0.00026) and short duration of relapse free survival (p = 0.008). Stem cell transplantation did not seem to alter the prognostic impact of high levels of MRD after consolidation: within the MRDCons(+) group, the relapse rate after transplant was 78%. Thus, a MRD > or = 3.5 x 10(-4) leukemic cells at the end of consolidation strongly predicts relapse, and is significantly associated with MDR1-positive phenotype and intermediate/unfavorable cytogenetics.","['Cattedra di Ematologia, Universita di Roma ""Tor Vergata,"" Divisione di Ematologia, Osp.S.Eugenio, P.le dell\'Umanesimo 10-00144, Rome, Italy.

Generation of functional DC has potential clinical use in treating diseases such as cancer. In this report, we have demonstrated the generation of functional DC from mononuclear cells isolated from human umbilical cord blood cells (UCBC) and peripheral blood cells (PBC) using a defined medium Prime Complete Growth Medium (PCGM) (GenePrime LLC, Gaithersburg, MD). DC generated using PCGM showed the typical phenotype of DC as determined by flow cytometry and electron microscopy. Further analysis of the DC using confocal microscopy showed localization of the antigen and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in the cytoplasm 3-5 days following tumor antigen loading into DC. Subsequently, the tumor antigen-MHC complex was localized on the surface of DC. DC generated from UCBC or PBC also increased (p < 0.001) the allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction, confirming their immune accessory functions compared to a control mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) without DC added. Interestingly, DC generated using PCGM medium also significantly enhanced the hematopoietic colony (CFU-C)-forming ability. Furthermore, addition of 5% DC derived from cord blood loaded with tumor antigen also significantly (p < 0.001) increased peripheral and cord blood-derived antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-mediated killing of human leukemic cells (K562) and breast cancer cells (MDA-231). Thus, these results show that functional DC generated from cord blood using a defined medium are a useful source of accessory cells for augmenting CTL-mediated cytotoxicity and have potential use in cellular therapy for human leukemia and breast cancer.","['Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-6395, USA. ssjoshi@unmc.edu']",['1R44NS 40202/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothezised that the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (Rituxan) may be useful in reducing the number of contaminating CLL cells in stem cell collections for use in autologous transplantation. A pilot study in 5 patients was designed using rituximab 375 mg/m(2) as an in vivo purging step following cyclophosphamide 4 gm/m(2) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor/granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF/GM-CSF) mobilization therapy for patients with advanced-stage CLL undergoing autologous stem cell transplantation. Eligible patients had 0-30% marrow involvement prior to mobilization. A single pre-rituximab leukapheresis product was obtained after the white blood cells (WBC) reached 800/mm(3) to serve as a control but was not reinfused. Rituximab was administered the following day and subsequent leukaphereses were commenced 48 h later to reach a total of >2 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg. Dual-color flow cytometry CD5/CD19 and consensus PCR using primers to the joining region and FR3 of the variable region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) were used to evaluate the degree of contaminating CLL cells in the leukapheresis product and to monitor disease status post transplant. All 5 patients were informative for the consensus PCR assay. Four of 5 patients mobilized >2 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg and proceeded to cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg and total body irradiation (6 x 200 cGy) with stem cell rescue. All leukaphereses products were positive by PCR for the IgH rearrangement and 4/5 contained CD5/CD19 dual-positive cells. Comparing the pre- and post-rituximab leukapheresis products, a reduction in the percentage of CD5(+)/CD19(+) cells was seen in 4/5 patients. All patients engrafted at a median of 13.5 days to ANC > 500/mm(3) and 11 days to platelets >20,000/mm(3). No regimen-related mortality was seen. Although 2 patients tested positive on PCR for the IgH rearrangement early after transplant, all patients had absence of the IgH gene rearrangement at 1 year and no CD5/CD19 dual-positive cells were could be detected in the bone marrow. This includes 1 heavily pretreated patient who received stem cells containing up to 30% CD5(+)/CD19(+) cells. We conclude that purging with Rituximab 48 h prior to stem cell collection was able to reduce significantly (but not eliminate) the percentage of CLL cells in the leukaphereses. However, despite the infusion of CD5(+)/CD19(+) cells in the stem cell coions, patients were able to obtain durable complete molecular remissions, implying that the PCR-positive cells in the leukaphereses may not have long-term clonogenic potential. The results also support the recommendation to test if rituximab should be part of a maintenance regimen after transplant to prevent disease recurrence in high-risk patients.","[""Section of Bone Marrow Transplant & Cell Therapy, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Rush Medical College, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fourteen patients with high-risk malignancies and an HLA-identical sibling (n = 8) or alternative donor (n = 6) but ineligible for a conventional transplant were included. Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen consisted in 2 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) alone, 2 Gy TBI and fludarabine (previously untreated patients) or cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (patients who had previously received > or =12 Gy TBI). Patients 1-4 (controls) received unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) and DLI and patients 5-14 CD8-depleted or CD34-selected PBSC followed by CD8-depleted DLI. Post-transplant immunosuppression was carried out with cyclosporine A (CsA) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Initial engraftment was seen in all patients, but 1 patient (7%) later rejected her graft. The actuarial 180-day incidence of grades II-IV acute GVHD was 75% for patients 1-4 versus 0% for patients 5-14 (p = 0.0019).

High doses of hydroxyurea (HD-HU, 3.5 g/m(2) per day, orally for 7 days) followed by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) (10 microg/kg subcutaneously) were administered to 11 newly diagnosed CML patients.

Immunotherapy with alloreactive donor lymphocytes can eliminate ""the last tumor cell"" even in patients with hematological malignancies resistant to maximally tolerated doses of chemoradiotherapy. Alloreactive lymphocytes that can mediate anti-tumor effects following induction of host-versus-graft tolerance induced by transplantation of donor stem cells, can induce graft-versus-malignancy (GVM) effects which are usually accompanied by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, occasionally GVM effects may also be accomplished independently of clinically overt GVHD. Interestingly, allogeneic donor lymphocytes may also eliminate undesirable host-derived hematopoietic cells in a large number of nonmalignant indications including genetic diseases, diseases caused by deficiency of stem cell products, and autoimmune disorders mediated by self-reactive lymphocytes. The cumulative clinical experience suggests feasibility of effective induction of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL); graft-versus-lymphoma (GVLy); graft-versus-multiple myeloma, as well as graft-versus-solid tumors (GVT), well-documented in patients with renal and breast cancer, even in patients with resistant disease that have failed myeloablative chemoradiotherapy. These observations that suggested that cell therapy by donor lymphocytes is the main therapeutic benefit of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) led to development of the nonmyeloablative approach for safer allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) makes it possible to offer an option for cure to elderly patients with no upper age limit, as well as to patients with poor performance status not considered eligible for conventional BMT. Using well-tolerated NST regimen, allogeneic stem cell transplantation can be accomplished with minimal procedure-related toxicity and mortality, possibly even on an outpatient basis. Immunotherapy mediated by adoptive allogeneic cell-mediated immunotherapy can be further improved by utilizing specifically immune donor lymphocytes, thus maximizing their efficacy against undesirable target cells of host origin on the one hand, while minimizing their ontoward efficacy against normal cells of host origin that could result in GVHD on the other. Taken together, DLI and subsequently NST, may have opened new horizons for treatment of life-threatening malignant and nonmalignant disorders correctable by allogeneic stem cell transplantation. It is anticipated that further improvement of reactivity and specificity of donor lymphocytes will lead to safer clinical application of cell therapy for a larger number of indications toward improving disease-free survival in a large number of indications while minimizing immediate and late procedure-related complications.","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation & Cancer Immunotherapy, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem 91120 Israel.

Its curative potential is largely mediated by an immune-mediated destruction of malignant cells by donor lymphocytes termed graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect. However, because of its toxicity, conventional allogeneic HSCT is restricted to younger and fitter patients. These observations led several groups to set up new (less toxic) transplant protocols (nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation or NMSCT) based on a two-step approach: first, the use of immunosuppressive (but nonmyeloablative) preparative regimens providing sufficient immunosuppression to achieve engraftment of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells and, in a second step, destruction of malignant cells by the GVL effect. Preliminary results showed that NMSCT were feasible with a relatively low transplant-related mortality (TRM), even in patients older than 65 years. In addition, strong antitumor responses were observed in several hematological malignancies as well as in some patients with renal cell carcinoma. After discussing the mechanisms and efficacy of the GVL effect as well as the rationale for NMSCT strategies, this article reviews the first results of ongoing clinical trials.

Cells can acquire a multidrug resistant (MDR) phenotype in response to a wide variety of stress-inducing agents including chemotherapeutic drugs. In addition to the mechanisms expressed in the tumor prior to chemotherapy (presumably these mechanisms allowed tumor cells to escape the control of growth and differentiation), a complex phenotype of pleiotropic resistance is presented in the residual or recurrent tumor. This review analyzes the molecular mechanisms of MDR acquisition with the focus on hematopoietic malignancies. In particular, the chemotherapy-induced up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, a broad-specificity transmembrane efflux pump, is considered a major event in establishment of MDR in leukemia cells that were sensitive before drug exposure. The pharmacological and genetic approaches to prevent the acquisition of Pgp-mediated MDR during chemotherapy are discussed.","['Department of Medicine and Program in Cell Biology and Genetics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. shtilaa@yahoo.com']",,,,,113,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is clear evidence that lineage-restricted transcription factors play a central role in the genesis of mature lineage committed cells from multipotent progenitors. Amongst these, the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family is of key importance for cell fate determination in the development of the hematopoietic system and beyond.

Epub 2002 Mar 26.,,"SUMMARY: The proteases of retroviruses, such as leukemia viruses, immunodeficiency viruses (including the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV), infectious anemia viruses, and mammary tumor viruses, form a family with the proteases encoded by several retrotransposons in Drosophila and yeast and endogenous viral sequences in primates. Retroviral proteases are key enzymes in viral propagation and are initially synthesized with other viral proteins as polyprotein precursors that are subsequently cleaved by the viral protease activity at specific sites to produce mature, functional units. Active retroviral proteases are homodimers, with each dimer structurally related to the larger class of single-chain aspartic peptidases. Each monomer has four structural elements: two distinct hairpin loops, a wide loop containing the catalytic aspartic acid and an alpha helix. Retroviral gene sequences can vary between infected individuals, and mutations affecting the binding cleft of the protease or the substrate cleavage sites can alter the response of the virus to therapeutic drugs. The need to develop new drugs against HIV will continue to be, to a large extent, the driving force behind further characterization of retroviral proteases.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32610, USA. bdunn@college.med.ufl.edu']",,,,,19,,PMC139352,20020326,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2002 Mar 14.,,"BACKGROUND: Methods for extracting useful information from the datasets produced by microarray experiments are at present of much interest. Here we present new methods for finding gene sets that are well suited for distinguishing experiment classes, such as healthy versus diseased tissues. Our methods are based on evaluating genes in pairs and evaluating how well a pair in combination distinguishes two experiment classes. We tested the ability of our pair-based methods to select gene sets that generalize the differences between experiment classes and compared the performance relative to two standard methods. To assess the ability to generalize class differences, we studied how well the gene sets we select are suited for learning a classifier. RESULTS: We show that the gene sets selected by our methods outperform the standard methods, in some cases by a large margin, in terms of cross-validation prediction accuracy of the learned classifier. We show that on two public datasets, accurate diagnoses can be made using only 15-30 genes. Our results have implications for how to select marker genes and how many gene measurements are needed for diagnostic purposes. CONCLUSION: When looking for differential expression between experiment classes, it may not be sufficient to look at each gene in a separate universe. Evaluating combinations of genes reveals interesting information that will not be discovered otherwise. Our results show that class prediction can be improved by taking advantage of this extra information.","['Department of Informatics, University of Bergen, N-5020 Bergen, Norway. trondb@ii.uib.no']",,,,,,,PMC115205,20020314,,,,,,,,,,

Prophylactic supplementation of plasma-derived coagulation products remains controversial. The purposes of this study were to examine the plasma levels of hemostatic proteins during the induction phase and the efficacy of prophylactic replacement of plasma-derived products. METHODS: A multicenter retrospective survey on the incidence of hemostatic complications and the frequency of prophylactic replacement of plasma-derived products among children with ALL who under went ASP therapy was conducted. All patients were treated according to the Japan Association of Childhood Leukemia Study (JACLS) ALL-97 protocol. RESULTS: Thirty-six (67%) of the 54 JACLS-treatment centers responded and provided information on 127 patients. Clinically relevant hemostatic complications occurred in two patients (1.6%;2/127); one patient suffered intracranial bleeding 5 days after beginning the protocol, and the second patient suffered an ischemic attack during an ASP treatment. The administration of ASP(10 000 u/m2 x six doses) led to significant reductions in the plasma fibrinogen (180 +/- 74 to 105 +/- 57 mg/dL),antithrombin III (AT III) (126 +/- 21 to 73 +/- 18%),and plasminogen levels (97 +/- 17 to 52 +/- 18%). These laboratory parameters returned to normal levels 2 weeks after completion of the ASP treatment. Forty-eight patients (38%)received AT III concentrate (AT III-supplement group). The AT III level of the AT III-supplement group was significantly lower than that of the AT III non-supplement group, not only during the ASP therapy, but also prior to the ASP therapy. A greater percentage of patients in the AT III-supplement group received fresh-frozen plasma and in greater amounts than those in the AT III non-supplement group. CONCLUSIONS: Severe hemorrhage and thrombosis were uncommon in the ALL patients who underwent ASP therapy in comparison with the degree of coagulation changes. Prophylactic administration of AT III concentrate or fresh-frozen plasma did not demonstrate clear beneficial effects in the treatment of ALL in preventing thromboembolic events.","['Department of Pediatrics, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Hamamatsu, Japan. hongot@hama-med.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This condition was originally described in HBV-infected recipients after a liver transplantation. Recently, FCH has been reported not only in liver transplant recipients, but also in other immunosuppressed patients. It is characterized clinically by cholestatic hepatic dysfunction, and pathologically by severe periportal fibrosis, cholestasis, widespread balloon degeneration of hepatocytes, and only a mild infiltration of inflammatory cells. Without treatment, FCH is universally fatal within a few months of diagnosis. There have been only two isolated case reports of FCH with long-term patient survival, and one case report with treatment failure after lamivudine therapy. Because of the rarity of this clinical entity, the therapeutic efficacy of lamivudine in patients with FCH cannot be evaluated systematically. Here, we present four patients with HBV-related FCH treated with lamivudine. One received antineoplastic therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and the other three were renal graft recipients. Two patients who developed FCH after a renal transplantation survived with an improvement in liver function and were followed up for 20 and 30 months, respectively, and were found to be in good health. However, the other two patients died of sepsis, possibly as a consequence of the immunosuppression with hepatic failure despite lamivudine treatment. Our experience suggests that lamivudine can alter the grave natural history of FCH.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",,,,,,['Copyright 2001 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd'],,,,,,,,,,,,

As CLL cells retain the capacity to respond to CD40 ligand (CD40L) and as CD4(+) T cells are always present in involved tissues, we asked whether malignant CLL cells might produce T cell-attracting chemokines. We studied the chemokine expression of CD19(+)/CD5(+) malignant B cells from peripheral blood (PB), lymph nodes (LN) or bone marrow (BM) of 32 patients and found a major difference. LN- and BM-, but not PB-derived cells, expressed a readily detectable reverse transcription-PCR band for CCL22 and one for CCL17 of variable intensity. CD40 ligation of PB cells induced the mRNA expression of both CCL22 and CCL17. CCL22 was also released in the culture supernatants. These supernatants induced the migration of activated CD4(+), CD40L(+) T cells expressing the CCL22 receptor, CCR4. T cell migration was abrogated by anti-CCL22 antibodies. Immunohistochemistry and cytofluorography studies revealed that a proportion of CD4(+) T cells in CLL LN and BM expressed CD40L. Our data demonstrate that malignant CLL cells chemo-attract CD4(+) T cells that in turn induce a strong chemokine production by the leukemic clone, suggesting a vicious circle, leading to the progressive accumulation of the neoplastic cells.","['Department of Oncological Sciences, University of Torino, University Division of Clinical Immunology and Hematology, Ospedale Mauriziano Umberto I, Torino, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2002 Feb 16.,,"BACKGROUND: Isolated chloromas (granulocytic sarcomas) are rare tumors. Chloromas are masses composed of immature granulocytic cells. Granulocytic sarcoma occurs primarily in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia, but can also arise in patients with other myeloproliferative disorders, though rarely in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). When dural-based, granulocytic sarcoma may be indistinguishable from meningioma radiologically. CASE HISTORY: We now describe one patient affected by ALL with isolated granulocytic sarcoma mimicking meningioma as initial CNS relapses. A 12-year-old girl who had been diagnosed with ALL and undergone chemotherapy presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizure while in complete remission. Computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging showed a small mass mimicking a meningioma at the anterior falx. The patient was developed speech disturbance 6 days later. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a rapidly growing mass with intralesional hemorrhage. Bone marrow biopsy and cerebrospinal fluid study were negative for leukemia. The patient underwent open surgery. The pathological diagnosis was acute lymphoblastic leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: These unusual clinical manifestations and radiological findings in acute lymphoblastic leukemia should be regarded as a recurrence of leukemia. Early detection and antileukemic treatment of granulocytic sarcoma are necessary and important for a favorable prognosis.","['Department of Neurosurgery, Pundang CHA Hospital, Pochon University College of Medicine, 351, Yatap-dong, Pundang-gu, Sungnam, 463-070, South Korea. jyahn@cha.ac.kr']",,,,,,,,20020216,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism(s) of MPO-mediated apoptosis, in particular caspase-3 activation, and to determine the effects of the antioxidants ascorbate and (dihydro)lipoic acid. Incubation of HL-60 cells (1 x 10(6) cells/ml media) with H(2)O(2) (0-200 microM) resulted in dose-dependent stimulation of caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation, and morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Caspase-3 activity, DNA fragmentation and apoptosis were maximal at approximately 50 microM H(2)O(2). Pre-incubation of the cells with the MPO-specific inhibitor 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide (ABAH) and the heme enzyme inhibitor 3-aminotriazole (100 microM each) resulted in complete and partial inhibition, respectively, of intracellular MPO, caspase-3 activity, and apoptosis following addition of 50 microM H(2)O(2). Enhancement of cellular antioxidant status by pre-incubation of the cells with dehydro-ascorbic acid and lipoic acid, which are reduced intracellularly to ascorbate and dihydrolipoic acid, respectively, afforded protection against caspase-3 activation and apoptosis following addition of H(2)O(2). Addition of high concentrations of H(2)O(2) (200 microM) to cells pre-incubated with lipoic acid, however, resulted in cytotoxicity. Overall, our data indicate that MPO-derived oxidants, rather than H(2)O(2) itself, are involved in caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in HL-60 cells, and the antioxidants ascorbate and (dihydro)lipoic acid inhibit caspase-3 activation and apoptosis in these cells, likely via scavenging the MPO-derived oxidants.","['Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon 97331-6512, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eighty-nine patients (46 in first chronic phase, 43 in advanced phase) received an allogeneic BMT for CML during the study period. Medical outcomes and QOL of patients were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Twenty-eight (31.5%) of 89 patients were alive at 10 years and included in this analysis. Thirteen (46.4%) of 28 long-term survivors never relapsed. Fifteen patients relapsed between 0.5 and 16 years after transplantation. Ten patients showed a hematologic relapse and received salvage treatment. Five patients showed transient low levels of BCR-ABL-positive cells by Southern blot with no subsequent hematologic relapse. One of the 28 patients died in blast crisis at 12 years. The most frequent long-term complications were chronic graft-versus-host disease, osteoporosis, and cataracts. Frequency of clonogenic progenitors remained persistently decreased. QOL assessment yielded lower scores in physical performance as compared with an age-matched normative population, whereas social functioning was equivalent. A high degree of satisfaction was noted with interpersonal relationships. CONCLUSION: Patients with CML surviving their BMT long term do well in terms of medical outcomes. A constant rate of relapse was noted, with a high salvage rate of affected patients, suggesting the need for lifelong monitoring. QOL is perceived as good, particularly as related to social functioning; however, it is inferior to a normative population with regard to physical performance.","['Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Princess Margaret Hospital/University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. thomas.kiss@uhn.on.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed the clinical and biologic features of 298 infants and children with primary AML treated on four consecutive institutional clinical trials. The Kaplan-Meier method was used in survival analysis and the Cox proportional-hazards model was used to analyze the effect of potential prognostic factors on event-free survival (+/- 1 SE). RESULTS: Molecular studies of 152 cases detected 42 with MLL rearrangements. The karyotypes of these 42 revealed the t(9;11) (15 cases), abnormalities of chromosomes 10 and 11 (nine cases), the t(11;19) (four cases), other abnormalities of 11q23 (seven cases), and miscellaneous rearrangements (seven cases). Among these 42 patients, the 15 whose leukemic cells carried the t(9;11) had a better outcome (66% +/- 15%) than the other 27 (25.9% +/- 11.2%; P =.004). Cases with the t(9;11) were also characterized by M5 AML morphology (21 of 23 cases). Of the 63 patients with M5 AML, the 21 whose leukemic cells demonstrated the t(9;11) had a better outcome (71.1% +/- 11%) than the other 42 (25.8% +/- 7.9%; P =.0004). The only independent factors indicating a favorable prognosis were presenting leukocyte count less than 50 x 10(9)/L (relative risk of relapse, 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 0.97; P =.03) and the t(9;11) (relative risk of relapse, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.16 to 0.64; P =.002). CONCLUSION: We conclude that the t(9;11) is the most favorable genetic factor for patients with AML treated at our institution.","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]","['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA71907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One way to improve current tumor vaccines that mainly induce CTLs would be to activate antigen-specific CD4+ T cells that recognize MHC class II restricted tumor associated antigens. Human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTRT) is preferentially expressed by various tumors and, therefore, could be a universal tumor antigen. In this study, we used a combined approach of using the prediction software TEPITOPE to select class II epitope candidates and in vitro T-cell biological analysis to identify class II-restricted epitope(s) in hTRT. We first identified several HLA-DR7-restricted class-II epitope candidates in hTRT by examining human T-cell responses to synthetic peptides. We then characterized these HLA-DR7-restricted hTRT epitope candidates by establishing and analyzing peptide-specific T-cell clones. It was demonstrated that CD4+ T cells specific for the HLA-DR7-restricted hTRT(672) epitope (RPGLLGASVLGLDDI) can respond to naturally processed hTRT proteins. Furthermore, the hTRT(672)-specific T cells recognized hTRT antigen from various tumors, including prostate cancer, breast cancer, melanoma, and leukemia. Thus, the identification of the naturally processed HLA-DR7-restricted hTRT epitope, together with the previous finding of class I-restricted hTRT epitopes, provide a basis for the combined application of class I- and II-restricted hTRT epitopes to induce potent, long-term CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against a broad spectrum of tumors.","['Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['AI48711/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients suffered from acute leukaemia (14 cases), chronic lymphoid leukaemia (two cases), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (two cases) or myeloma (three cases). Seventeen patients displayed a single streptococcal or enterococcal episode, two had two episodes in the course of a single stay in the hospital, two others in the course of two different stays. During 16 episodes (64%), the bacteremia occurred within 15 days after the onset of neutropenia consecutive to antimitotic chemotherapy, and in nine episodes (36%) it has occurred after a period exceeding 15 days. In six cases the patients had already received antibiotics with a large antibacterial activity (beta-lactam, fluoroquinolone and/or glycopeptide +/- aminoside) and in four cases a single antibiotic (synergistine or cotrimoxazole). Most streptococci (20/21) were oral streptococci (ten Streptococcus mitis, five S. oralis, two S. sanguis, three S. pneumoniae). A single strain of beta-hemolytic streptococci has been identified as S. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. The enterococci were one strain of Enterococcus faecalis and three E. faecium. Ten streptococci were susceptible to 0.25 mg/L of penicillin G, ten were less susceptible (0.5 < or = MIC < 32 mg/L), and a strain was resistant (MIC = 32 mg/L). Eighteen strains were susceptible to amoxicillin and cefotaxime. For three strains, the MICs of amoxicillin and cefotaxime (8-16 mg/L and 8-32 mg/L, respectively) were higher. Levels of resistance of the enterococci to the beta-lactam (penicillin, amoxicillin, and piperacillin) were variable. All species were susceptible to glycopeptides.

Among these 12 patients, 11 had undergone allogeneic transplantation. Furthermore, patients who had undergone unrelated transplantation (7/16; 44%) tended to show a higher incidence of increased amylase than those who had undergone related transplantation (4/24; 17%). Six patients were at an advanced stage of acute GVHD (grade III or IV) and all showed an elevated level of serum amylase, whereas only four patients showed an elevated serum amylase level among 34 with mild acute GVHD (grade I or II) or without GVHD. Furthermore, five out of 12 patients who showed an increased amylase level were concurrently diagnosed as having viral infection such as cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, or varicella zoster virus. We conclude that pancreatitis following SCT occurs more often than realized, and is mostly subclinical. This is closely associated with severe acute GVHD, and possibly viral infection.","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamagata University School of Medicine.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes the use of an automated procedure for longitudinal measurement of tissue volume and relaxation times to quantify leukoencephalopathy. Images derived by using this procedure in patients undergoing therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are presented. Five examinations from each of five volunteers (25 examinations) were used to test the reproducibility of quantitated baseline and subsequent, normal-appearing images; the coefficients of variation were less than 2% for gray and white matter. Regions of leukoencephalopathy in patients were assessed by comparison with manual segmentation. Two radiologists manually segmented images from 15 randomly chosen MRI examinations that exhibited leukoencephalopathy. Kappa analyses showed that the two radiologists' interpretations were concordant (kappa = 0.70) and that each radiologist's interpretations agreed with the results of the automated procedure (kappa = 0.57 and 0.55). The clinical application of this method was illustrated by analysis of images from sequential MR examinations of two patients who developed leukoencephalopathy during treatment for ALL. The ultimate goal is to use these quantitative MR imaging measures to better understand therapy-induced neurotoxicity, which can be limited or even reversed with some combination of therapy adjustments and pharmacological and neurobehavioral interventions.","[""Department of Diagnostic Imaging, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105-2794, USA. gene.reddick@stjude.org""]","['R01 CA090246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA90246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA090246-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",PMC2396564,,,['NIHMS49110'],,,,,,,,

Patients were analyzed for ABL1-BCR 1b-b3 and/or 1b-b4 transcription by RT-PCR analysis. ABL1-BCR gene status was analyzed by FISH in 16 CML patients with no ABL1-BCR transcript. FISH revealed a partial or total deletion of the ABL1-BCR gene in 9/16 and localized the 5' portion of ABL1 and the 3' portion of BCR at separated loci in 5/16 patients. The latter FISH pattern resulted from a nonreciprocal translocation in two and a complex translocation in three individuals. In 2/16 patients, FISH could not exclude an intact ABL1-BCR fusion gene. Thus, most CML patients without ABL1-BCR transcript could be characterized cytogenetically to belong to two major subgroups: a silent ABL1-BCR gene was attributed to a deletion in der(9)t(9;22) in 56% of the investigated patients or to variants of a standard t(9;22) (approximately 31%). Conversely, none of the 50 patients with an ABL1-BCR transcript exhibited a variant t(9;22) in GTG-banding analysis. Thus, genomic aberrations such as deletions or complex genomic rearrangements are the basic and most frequent cause for ABL1-BCR RNA negativity in CML. The heterogeneity of the underlying molecular mechanisms may explain divergent clinical implications described for patients with an ABL1-BCR deletion and those with no ABL1-BCR transcript.","['Institute for Human Genetics and Anthropology, FSU, Jena, Germany. ilon@mti-n.uni-jena.de']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified two T-cell lymphoma/leukemia cell lines with different differentiation stages that had breakpoints within the same novel gene, TCBA1 (T-cell lymphoma breakpoint associated target 1). In a T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma cell line, HT-1, the TCBA1 fused to SUSP1 (SUMO-1-specific protease), creating a SUSP1-TCBA1 chimeric gene. However, in an adult T-cell leukemia cell line, ATN-1, no chimeric gene was detected, although aberrant TCBA1 transcripts were produced.

SKY confirmed 10 and refined the interpretation of three balanced aberrations recognized by G-banding and identified another nine balanced aberrations, including a novel translocation involving the RUNX1 gene. Eleven of 32 deletions found by G-banding were shown to be cryptic translocations or insertions, including three of four chromosome 3 deletions, two of three del(7q), and two of 12 del(5q). Of the 92 chromosomes deemed lost entirely by G-banding, 63 (68%) were shown to be involved in structural aberrations. This was especially true for -21 (eight of eight patients), -5 (five of six patients), -20 (seven of nine patients), and -18 (six of 12 patients). Unexpectedly, SKY uncovered a hidden overrepresentation of segments from at least one chromosome in 21 patients. The most frequently overrepresented was 21q, found in eight patients, including four with high-level 21q amplification. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed that the RUNX1 gene was not the target of amplification in seven of these patients. Also frequently gained were 11q (in seven patients, including three with high-level MLL gene amplification) and 22q (in seven patients).

Immunostaining revealed that dELL was localized to nuclei in early embryos and to nuclei of nurse cells and follicle cells in the ovary suggesting its important role in early development of drosophila. To elucidate the function of this gene in drosophila, P-element mobilization was performed by utilizing a P-element inserted upstream of dELL.

To compare incidence rates and trends with international data, we processed records of the regional childhood cancer registry of Northeast Hungary. PROCEDURE: Our computerized database contains population-based information on childhood cancer cases (<15 years) diagnosed in residents of two counties of Hungary: leukaemias from 1973, non-CNS solid tumours from 1978, and CNS tumours from 1984. After a retrospective evaluation of completeness of ascertainment, descriptive epidemiologic analyses were performed for the years of operation of the registry. Age-standardized annual incidence rates and age-specific incidences were calculated. Trends were evaluated in linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The distribution of major histologic groups was similar to those observed in the Western countries with the exception that central nervous system tumours account for a higher percentage (27.3%). Average age-standardized annual incidence rates were as follows: all types of cancer: 120.7 per million; leukaemia: 37.3; CNS tumours: 31.6; lymphomas: 12.2; sympathetic nervous system tumours: 12.5; kidney tumours: 8.8. Significant increases were observed in incidence of leukaemia (average annual percent change AAPC: 0.7%), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (AAPC: 1.9%), and all cancer groups (AAPC: 2.6%), but not in acute non-lymphocytic leukaemia or in CNS tumours. The strongest increases in cancer incidence were detected in the age group of 10-14 years (AAPC: 4.4%) and in infants (AAPC: 12.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Incidences and trends are in accordance with the data in the latest literature, however, the contribution of CNS tumours and the rate of increase in total cancer incidence proved to be higher. Further detailed genetic and environmental studies of cancer registries may shed light on the etiology of the observed differences whether they represent a pattern specific for this region.","['Department of Paediatrics, University Medical School of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary. jakab_zs@gyermek.dote.hu']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine the plasma concentrations of doxorubicin and its active metabolite doxorubicinol in children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). PROCEDURE: Children, 107 in number, aged 1.3-17.3 years, were studied at Day 1 of induction therapy according to the current Nordic protocol. Five infants, 3-9 months old, were also included. Plasma samples were drawn 23 hr after the start of a 24-hr infusion of doxorubicin 40 mg/m(2), and analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography. RESULTS: There was a more than 10-fold difference between patients in dose normalized plasma concentration of doxorubicin, median 62.8 ng/ml, range 22.6-334 ng/ml. The doxorubicin concentrations differed significantly between age groups (P = 0.003). Children aged 4-6 years had the highest doxorubicin concentrations, median 77.9 ng/ml, followed by 2-4-year-old children, median 64.3 ng/ml. Both younger and older children had median values of about 50 ng/ml. Patients with white blood cell (WBC) count > 50 x 10(9)/L at diagnosis had significantly lower doxorubicin concentrations, median 55.3 ng/ml, than those with WBC count < 10 x 10(9)/L, median 64.4 ng/ml (P = 0.015). There was no difference in doxorubicin concentration between boys and girls. No correlation was found between doxorubicin levels and serum aminotransferases or serum creatinine. The concentration of doxorubicinol was 13% (median value) of that of doxorubicin. Four infants, 7-9 months old, had plasma clearance between 350-431 ml/min/m(2), which is in the same range as in older children. A 3-month-old infant had a clearance of 181 ml/min/m(2). CONCLUSIONS: The age groups who had the highest doxorubicin concentrations, (2-) 4-6-year-old children, are known to make up a large proportion of standard risk ALL cases with good prognosis. The correlation between doxorubicin plasma levels and clinical effect needs further study. The influence of age, body composition, and tumor burden on the pharmacokinetics of antineoplastic drugs should also be further explored, aiming at improvements in the current dosing regimen based on BSA.","[""University Children's Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.""]",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

The survivor group is growing steadily. Therefore, the primary purpose of our study is to define the neuropsychological function and to describe which central nervous system (CNS) functions are impaired following the German ALL-BFM and COALL protocols for CNS-negative patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional multicenter study 121 subjects, long-term survivors of childhood ALL in first continuous complete remission were investigated. Seven years ago, the subjects were treated as standard or medium risk patients according to ALL-BFM 81, ALL-BFM 83, or COALL 82 protocols, receiving comparable treatments. According to different CNS-prophylaxes, two subgroups were compared in the study: the non-cranially irradiated MTX-group (methotrexate-group) (n = 38) and the cranially irradiated RT-group (radiotherapy-group) (with MTX i.th.) (n = 83). Intellectual and cognitive abilities of these groups were evaluated using standardized psychometric techniques. The Kaufman factors Verbal Comprehension, Perceptual Organisation and Freedom from Distractibility were calculated. Demographical and clinical data collected at the time of the diagnosis were compared between both groups. The different prognoses for patients within both groups were taken into account using a defined risk factor. Analysis of variance was conducted to relate intellectual performance to age, gender, and CNS-treatment. RESULTS: The RT-group exhibited a lower Full Scale IQ than the MTX-group (101.2 +/- 15.9 vs. 109.9 +/- 14.9, P = 0.031). Particularly for the Kaufman factor Freedom from Distractibility the RT-group showed the lower scores (96.9 +/- 14.1 vs. 105.5 +/- 12.6, P = 0.037). Significant interactions between gender and CNS prophylactic treatment were observed for Full Scale IQ (P = 0.008), Verbal IQ (P = 0.012), Performance IQ (P = 0.024), Verbal Comprehension (P = 0.004), and Perceptual Organisation (P = 0.032). CONCLUSIONS: Cranial irradiation in combination with MTX therapy was associated with deficits in attention, concentration, and the ability of sequencing and processing, measured by the Kaufman factor Freedom from Distractibility. Our results support the strategy of avoiding prophylactic CNS irradiation in low risk patients.","['Department of Pediatric Oncology, University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Erlangen, Germany.']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

For 19 children, antibodies were measured in plasma during and after the re-induction phase (second exposure) following treatment with 30,000 IU/m(2) i.v. or i.m. twice a week for two weeks (Mondays and Thursdays). On the same days of therapy, enzyme activity (spectrophotometric method) and the concentration of asparagine (HPLC) was determined. RESULTS: During the first exposure, none of the patients developed anti-Erwinia asparaginase antibodies. During the second exposure, one patient (1 of 8 patients) treated intravenously developed antibodies, which were associated with disappearance of enzyme activity and reappearance of asparagine. Three of eleven patients developed antibodies of pharmacokinetic importance after i.m. therapy. None of the children had any clinical symptoms of hypersensitivity.

In addition to effluxing toxins, P-gp has been shown to protect tumor cells against caspase-dependent apoptosis mediated by Fas and tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) ligation, serum starvation and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. However, P-gp does not protect against caspase-independent cell death mediated by granzyme B or pore-forming proteins (perforin, pneumolysin and activated complement). We examined the effects of the chemotherapeutic hybrid polar compound suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) on P-gp-expressing MDR human tumor cell lines. In the CEM T-cell line, SAHA, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, induced equivalent death in P-gp-positive cells compared with P-gp-negative cells. Cell death was marked by the caspase-independent release of cytochrome c, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and Bid cleavage that was not affected by P-gp expression. However, consistent with our previous findings, SAHA-induced caspase activation was inhibited in P-gp-expressing cells. These data provide evidence that P-gp inhibits caspase activation after chemotherapeutic drug treatment and demonstrates that SAHA may be of value for the treatment of P-gp-expressing MDR cancers.","['Cancer Immunology Division, The Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute, East Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tetrachoric correlations were used to describe similarity in cancer liability among family members. Structural equation modeling was used to derive estimates of the importance of genetic and environmental effects. Statistically significant estimates of proportion of cancer susceptibility, accounted for by genetic effects, were obtained for all studied cancers except for leukemia. The estimate was highest in thyroid cancer (53%), followed by tumors at endocrine glands (28%), testis (25%), breast (25%), cervix (22%), melanoma (21%), colon (13%), nervous system (12%), rectum (12%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (10%), lung (8%), kidney (8%), urinary bladder (7%), stomach (1%) and leukemia (1%). The estimates of shared environmental effects ranged from 0% (cervix) to 15% (stomach). The childhood shared environmental effects were most important in testicular cancer (17%), stomach cancer (13%) and cervix in situ (13%). Our results indicate that environment has a principal causative role in cancer at all studied sites except for thyroid. The relatively large effect of heritability in cancer at some sites, on the other hand, indicates that even though susceptibility genes have been described at many cancer sites, they are likely to explain only part of the genetic effects.","['Department of Biosciences at Novum, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden. kamila.czene@cnt.ki.se.']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously identified 2 genes, termed OVCA1 and OVCA2, which are located in a small region showing a high frequency of allelic loss in breast and ovarian tumors and share a common exon. Recent studies have suggested that expression of OVCA1 may be influenced by retinoids. Therefore, we analyzed the expression of OVCA1 and OVCA2 in cells in response to treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (RA) and N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide (4HPR), or under conditions of low serum and confluence, to determine further the roles of OVCA1 and OVCA2 in cell growth, apoptosis and differentiation. We show that OVCA2 mRNA and protein are ubiquitously expressed and that they are downregulated in the lung cancer cell line Calu-6 after treatment with RA and 4HPR. In addition, we observed that OVCA2 protein is proteolytically degraded in response to RA and 4HPR treatment in a time- and dose-dependent manner in the promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60. In contrast, expression of the candidate tumor suppressor OVCA1 was not downregulated by these treatments. Furthermore, we demonstrate that OVCA2 is evolutionarily conserved and shows regional homology with dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs), specifically with hydrolase folds found in alpha-beta hydrolases. Our results are in contrast to a previous report and show that OVCA2, not OVCA1 mRNA and protein, is downregulated in response to RA and 4HPR.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.

Viral regulatory regions in PCR-amplified urine and the lung samples were identical to the archetypal structure, WWT. In the brain and CSF, a rearranged sequence predominated, however. A 94-bp deletion preceded a 71-bp tandem duplication because the same 94-bp segment was deleted from both copies. PCR-amplified regulatory region products were cloned and sequenced to define further the extent of the rearranged structures. Two kidney clones were archetypal, whereas two others were rearranged differently from the brain and from each other. In contrast to the brain clones, the kidney rearrangements seemed to involve deletion after duplication. Three of four brain clones sequenced were identical to the rearrangement found to dominate in the PCR product. A fourth clone showed two short deletions without any duplication. The four CSF clones all showed rearrangements identical to that which was amplified by PCR from CSF and brain. This represents the first molecular analysis of a BKV strain obtained from a central nervous system infection, and it reveals regulatory region rearrangements reminiscent of those described in JC virus from brains with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. We suggest that the presence in the CSF of BKV with a dominant rearranged regulatory region may be useful in the diagnosis of BKV meningoencephalitis secondary to BKV nephritis.","['Neurotoxicology Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-4126, USA. stonerg@ninds.nih.gov']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 by the National Kidney Foundation, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Descriptive comparative with patients serving as their own controls. SETTING: Pediatric comprehensive care setting for children and adolescents experiencing catastrophic diseases. SAMPLE: 53 patients who had TVADs, had not received asparaginase during the previous 14 days, and had coagulation studies ordered. Patients ranged in age from 2-20 years (mean = 9.2 years, SD = 5). The most common diagnoses were neuroblastoma and acute myelocytic leukemia. METHODS: Blood was collected through TVADs within seconds of collection of the venipuncture sample. The first 3 ml of blood from a TVAD was discarded; the research nurse then drew three sequential samples of 3 ml each. Laboratory personnel were blinded to the source of all four samples until all analyses had been completed. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES: PT, aPTT, and FBG. FINDINGS: For all patients, results of PT, aPTT, and FBG tests on each of the three blood samples obtained through the TVAD differed significantly from results of the same tests on blood obtained by venipuncture. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that neither a 6 ml, 9 ml, nor 12 ml discard from a heparinized TVAD is sufficient to yield clinically trustworthy PT, aPTT, or FBG values. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING: Nurses who have been persuaded by patients or parents to withdraw blood samples for coagulation indicators from a TVAD rather than from a venipuncture should have access to this research-based information that the three indicators, particularly aPTT, differ significantly from each other as to make it unreliable and potentially unsafe to sample blood from a TVAD to assess coagulation.","[""Division of Patient Care Services, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA. pam.hinds@stjude.org""]",['P30 CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The EBV-BLPDs arose 2-12 months after completion of fludarabine therapy and morphologically resembled the EBV-BLPDs that occur in the setting of iatrogenic immunodeficiency. Molecular genetic studies showed that these lesions were clonally distinct from the low-grade B-cell neoplasm in three of four cases assessed. Two patients did not receive therapy for the EBV-BLPD. The lesions regressed spontaneously in both patients but recurred in one. One patient underwent surgical excision and remains without evidence of the EBV-BLPD. One patient received aggressive multiagent chemotherapy with a complete response initially, but the EBV-BLPD recurred after 12 months. One patient received antiviral therapy and responded completely but died 2 months later of an opportunistic infection. We conclude that patients with low-grade B-cell neoplasms treated with fludarabine, possibly in combination with other immune suppressive agents, may subsequently develop EBV-BLPDs that morphologically resemble other iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated BLPDs. Most are clonally distinct from the underlying low-grade B-cell neoplasm. A subset of these lesions may regress without systemic therapy.","['Department of Hematopathology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. labruzzo@mdanderson.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Atypical CLL has in turn been associated with variant immunophenotypes and poor outcome. However, the significance of abundant PCs remains controversial. We have analyzed the flow cytometric immunophenotypic features of 54 CLL/SLL LNs and correlated these findings with the morphologic and clinical features. The LN histology was assigned to one of two groups based on the prominence of PCs: Group I LNs contained scattered small, sometimes ill-defined PCs in a background of monotonous small round lymphocytes. Group II LNs had increased numbers and sizes of PCs resulting in an obviously nodular appearance at low magnification. Flow cytometry was performed using broad three- or four-color antibody panels that included anti-CD5, CD19, CD20, CD23, CD38, FMC7, and surface immunoglobulin (sIg). The intensity of expression of all markers was scored semi-quantitatively using isotypic controls and internal positive and negative populations as standards. There were 32 group I and 22 group II LNs that, by definition, expressed CD19, CD5, and CD23. Little variability was seen in the intensity of expression of CD19, and the majority of cases expressed CD23 brightly. CD5 varied from very dim to an intensity similar to that of normal T cells; the majority had an intermediate level of CD5 expression. FMC7 was expressed to a significant extent in 11 cases (21%). CD20 was relatively bright in 17 cases (32%). sIg was dim in 29 cases (55%) and moderate or bright in 24 cases (45%). CD38 was expressed significantly in 25 cases (47%). There was no correlation between histologic group and intensity of expression of any individual marker or with an immunophenotypic atypia score based on FMC7, CD20, and sIg. There was also no correlation between morphology or immunophenotype and clinical features. These findings do not support the interpretation that the prominence of proliferation centers in CLL/SLL LNs defines biologically distinct subtypes.","['University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, Texas, USA.

The most common adverse effects of IFN are flu-like symptoms. Autoimmune side effects are infrequent but may be hazardous and irreversible. These may occur in several ways: autoantibodies may either appear during the treatment or existing titers may rise, subclinical autoimmune phenomena may become clinically manifest or autoimmune diseases may appear de novo. The main categories of IFN immune-mediated side effects are: thyroid, hematological, connective tissue, renal and miscellaneous disorders. The most common ones are thyroid disorders, which manifest either as hypo- or hyperthyroidism. Patients with pre-existing autoantibodies are more susceptible to the exacerbation of thyroid autoimmunity, probably since IFN enhances the levels of autoimmunity. Hematological disorders include autoimmune anemia and thrombocytopenia and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. The immunological derangement of autoimmune hemolytic anemia manifests as enhanced destruction of antibody-coated red blood cells and induction of autoreactive B cells secreting these antibodies. Although autoimmune thrombocytopenia is rare, a sharp reduction in the platelet counts, beyond that expected from the antiproliferative effects of IFN, should raise this possibility. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has recently been included among the autoimmune disorders. Sporadic cases have been reported in association with IFN treatment. The clinical spectrum of IFN-induced connective tissue disorders ranges from typical systemic lupus erythematosus to seropositive or seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. Some authors also reported on the development of Behcet's disease in chronic myeloid leukemia patients treated with IFN. The underlying reason for the skin hyperreactivity in Behcet's disease and the effect of IFN treatment in these patients may be altered neutrophil activity in both disorders. Several series evaluated the incidence of Raynaud's phenomenon in patients treated with IFN for hematological disorders. Some of them reported on a rather high incidence of nailfold capillary microscopy abnormalities with or without Raynaud's phenomenon. Whether IFN-induced Raynaud's phenomenon is immune-mediated or directly caused vasospasm, is still unknown although the occurrence of several autoantibodies suggests an immune mechanism. Adverse effects of IFN therapy on the kidney include proteinuria and rarely nephrotic syndrome or acute and chronic renal failure. The mechanism of renal injury is unclear although an immune mechanism is suggested. Sporadic cases of other immune-mediated side effects have been published. These include dermatological adverse effects manifesting as psoriasis, pemphigus and vitiligo, and also rare cases of sarcoidosis, hepatitis, colitis or cryoglobulinemia. In conclusion, patients treated with IFN should be monitored for symptoms of autoimmunity. Patients with previous autoimmune phenomena should be treated, if possible, with alternative drugs since there is risk of exacerbation of these manifestations in these patients.","['Institute of Hematology, The Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel. praanani@netvision.net.il']",,,,,77,"['Copyright 2002 S.

Epub 2002 Apr 26.,,"The transcription factor C/EBP alpha regulates early steps of normal granulocyte differentiation since mice with a disruption of the C/EBP alpha gene do not express detectable levels of the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor and produce no neutrophils. We have recently shown that C/EBP alpha function is also impaired in acute myeloid leukemias. However, how the transcriptional activity of C/EBP alpha is regulated both in myelopoiesis and leukemogenesis is not fully understood. The current study demonstrates that activated Ras enhances the ability of C/EBP alpha to transactivate the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor promoter and a minimal promoter containing only C/EBP DNA binding sites. Ras signaling activates C/EBP alpha via the transactivation domain because it enhances the transactivation function of a fusion protein containing a Gal4 DNA binding domain and the C/EBP alpha transactivation domain and does not change C/EBP alpha DNA binding. Ras acts on serine 248 of the C/EBP alpha transactivation domain, because it does not enhance the transactivation function of a C/EBP alpha serine 248 to alanine point mutant. Interestingly, serine 248 of C/EBP alpha is a protein kinase C (PKC) consensus site, and a PKC inhibitor blocks the activation of C/EB alpha by Ras. Ras signaling leads to phosphorylation of C/EBP alpha in vivo. Finally, mutation of serine 248 to alanine obviates the ability of C/EBP alpha to induce granulocytic differentiation. These data suggest a model where Ras signaling enhances the activity of C/EBP alpha to induce granulocytic differentiation by phosphorylation of serine 248.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich and GSF-National Research Center for Environment and Health, D-81377 Munich, Germany. gerdbehre@aol.com']","['CA 72009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 56745/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,20020426,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiological data indicate a small but significant risk of radiation-induced leukemia after radiotherapy which might be related to the high mean bone marrow dose associated with radiotherapy of prostate cancer. The purpose of the study was to investigate the relation between the mean bone marrow dose and unstable chromosome aberrations in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patients undergoing conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer as a possible indicator of risk. Endometrial cancer patients were also included for comparison. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nine patients, six with prostate cancer (60-73 years old) and three with endometrial cancer (61-81 years old) treated with radiotherapy were included in the study. The non-bony spaces inside the pelvic bones were outlined on every CT slice using the treatment planning system and mean doses to the bone marrow calculated. Blood samples of the patients were obtained at different times before, during and at the end of treatment. Lymphocytes were cultured in the usual way and metaphases scored for dicentric aberrations. RESULTS: 46 samples from nine patients were obtained. The mean number of metaphases analyzed per sample was 180 with a range from 52 to 435. The mean bone marrow doses for prostate cancer patients ranged from 2.8 to 4.2 Gy and for endometrial cancer patients from 12.8 to 14.8 Gy. The aberration yield increased with the planning target volume and the mean bone marrow dose. CONCLUSION: The yield of dicentric aberrations for prostate cancer patients correlated closely with the mean bone marrow dose albeit the induction of dicentrics occurred in mature T lymphocytes most of which were probably in transit through the irradiated volumes. Therefore, the observed relationship between dicentrics and mean bone marrow doses are indirect.","['Department of Radiotherapy, Hematology-Oncology Clinic, Clinicum of the University of Tartu, Estonia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The in vivo distribution and DNA incorporation of [2-(14)C]FAU, [2-(14)C]FMAU, and [2-(14)C]thymidine (as a control) were studied in SCID mice bearing human xenografts of T-cell leukemia CCRF-CEM. Levels of drug-associated radioactivity in blood, tumor and normal tissues including liver, kidneys, heart, lungs, spleen, brain, and skeletal muscle were determined. RESULTS: At 1 h after dosing, radioactivity from all three compounds was distributed in a generally nonspecific manner, except that spleen and tumor tissue had relatively high concentrations of radioactivity from [(14)C]thymidine. At 4 h after dosing, the concentrations of radioactivity from [(14)C]thymidine and [(14)C]FMAU were relatively high in spleen and tumor tissue, and that from [(14)C]FAU was highest in tumor tissue. The tumor/skeletal muscle concentration ratios were 2.25+/-0.69 and 3.07+/-0.42 for [(14)C]FAU and [(14)C]FMAU, respectively. At 24 h after dosing, only spleen and tumor tissues contained appreciable amounts of radioactivity from either compound. In tumor tissue, the levels of radioactivity from [(14)C]FMAU were two- to threefold greater than those from [(14)C]thymidine or [(14)C]FAU. Examination of purified genomic DNA from tumor, liver, kidneys, brain, and skeletal muscle showed that, at 24 h after dosing, only DNA from tumor tissue contained appreciable concentrations of radioactivity. Radioactivity from [(14)C]FMAU in tumor DNA was 45% greater than that from [(14)C]thymidine and about threefold greater than that from [(14)C]FAU. CONCLUSIONS: The extent of accumulation of [(14)C]FMAU in tumor tissue and incorporation into tumor DNA indicate that [(18)F]FMAU could be useful as a functional PET tumor-imaging agent.","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL 35294, USA.']",['N01-CM-07111/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,20020308,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The MDR sublines were developed by exposing the parental MOLT-4 cells to stepwise increasing concentrations of anticancer drugs daunorubicin (DNR), vinblastine (VBL) and doxorubicin (DOX). Degrees of resistance were assessed in terms of IC(50) values in an MTT assay and the P-gp function was evaluated in terms of rhodamine 123 (Rh123) accumulation and efflux. The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry after staining with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide. The levels of P-gp and MDR mRNA expression were estimated using the PE-conjugated anti-P-gp monoclonal antibody 17F9 and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Three MOLT-4 sublines were established and revealed a 2- to 115-fold resistance to the anticancer reagents DNR, VBL and DOX as compared to the parental cell line. The highest MDR was expressed in MOLT-4/DNR cells, which was overcome by the P-gp modulator, cyclosporin A (CsA). The resistant sublines showed a decreased accumulation and an increased efflux of Rh123 in proportion to the degree of resistance, and these were completely reversed in the presence of 8 microM CsA. The decreased apoptotic response in these cell lines was clearly associated with the degree of drug resistance. P-gp antigen and MDR1 mRNA were highly expressed in both the MOLT-4/DNR and MOLT-4/DOX sublines. Less-resistant MOLT-4/VBL cells expressed lower levels of MDR1 mRNA and P-gp, even though the cell line was established by exposing the parental MOLT-4 cells to VBL for longer (5 months) than to the other two reagents (3 months). CONCLUSIONS: MOLT-4 cells were able to acquire a high level of drug resistance by culturing the cells in the presence of certain anticancer drugs, and acquisition of the resistance was relatively reagent-specific. The degrees of resistance to the anticancer drugs were well correlated with the expressions of MDR1 mRNA and functional P-gp, and were also associated with a decreased response to apoptosis.","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Science, Hachioji, Japan.']",,,,,,,,20020214,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2002 Mar 6.,,"PURPOSE: A new chemotherapy regimen was designed for leukemia to improve response to therapy and elucidate the possible underlying mechanisms responsible for its efficacy. METHODS: Cells of the chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line, K562, were treated singly, in combination, and in sequence with clinically equivalent dosages of topotecan, which targets topoisomerase I (Topo I), and etoposide and mitoxantrone, which target topoisomerase II (Topo II), to determine the best treatment. Apoptosis, early cell deaths, and cell cytotoxicities in drug-treated cells were determined with annexin V and propidium iodide staining and MTT assays, respectively. Confocal microscopy and RT-PCR showed the cellular locations and relative increases in Topo IIalpha in topotecan-treated cells. The double comet assay of individual cells showed simultaneously free Topo proteins, non-Topo-associated DNA, and Topo-DNA complexes in drug-induced DNA fragments. RESULTS: Sequential treatment with topotecan on days 1-3, followed by etoposide+mitoxantrone on days 4, 5, 9 and 10 resulted in 100% cell death whereas treatments involving administration of drugs singly or simultaneously resulted in less cell kill. The cytotoxicity results in cells treated for fewer days with the same sequential chemotherapy regimen showed the same trend, and adequate surviving cells for the experiments on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of drug action were produced. An increase in Topo IIalpha mRNA from RT-PCR 1 h after topotecan treatment was observed. Observations on K562 cells treated sequentially with topotecan followed by etoposide, mitoxantrone or etoposide+mitoxantrone were as follows: (1) Topo IIalpha protein levels increased and relocated from the cytoplasm into the nucleus as detected by confocal microscopy, (2) Topo IIalpha-DNA complexes increased and were associated with fragmented DNA (positive double comets) as detected by protein-DNA double comet assay, and (3) Topo I and Topo IIbeta proteins were not associated with fragmented DNA. Topotecan-induced Topo IIalpha protein levels correlated with increased numbers of positive double comets and reduction of cell viability. CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that Topo IIalpha protein induction after Topo I-directed drug treatment enhanced the sensitivity of cells to subsequent exposure to Topo II-directed drugs. Timed sequential chemotherapy with topotecan followed by etoposide+mitoxantrone is an effective regimen to ablate CML cancer cells.","['Malcolm Randall (Gainesville) VA Medical Center, 151 Research Service, 1601 SW Archer Road, Gainesville, Florida 32608, USA.']",,,,,,,,20020306,,,,,,,,,,

Because morphological analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in patients suspected of LI is false negative in one-third of patients, a diagnostic marker for LI by B-NHL or B-CLL would be very valuable. sCD27 was determined in the first CSF sample from each of 102 unselected patients submitted for (immuno)morphologic detection of malignant cells. The patients were considered to have LI if either (immuno)morphologic analyses showed tumor cells or if neuroradiological evaluation showed typical abnormalities consistent with LI. Patients were suspected of having LI if CSF samples revealed atypical lymphocytes and/or if clinical symptoms and signs suggestive of LI were present, but clinical follow-up was shorter than 3 months because of deterioration of the patient. LI was considered absent if (immuno)morphologic analyses of CSF samples were negative without evidence for LI during 3 months of clinical follow-up. In patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders [mainly B-non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)], sCD27 concentrations were significantly higher in the CSF samples of 16 patients with confirmed or suspected LI than in those of 46 patients without LI. However, sCD27 was also increased in a variety of other predominantly inflammatory neurological disorders including herpes simplex and zoster infections. The positive predictive value of sCD27 determination for LI was only 54%, but the negative predictive value was 92%.

Epub 2002 Jan 24.,,"Many of the therapeutic agents used for cancer chemotherapy today are based on decades-old agents which are highly cytotoxic but are nonselective for cancer cells. The hallmark of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is the Philadelphia chromosome translocation t(9;22), which results in the bcr-abl fusion gene. As an alteration that is nearly universal in CML cells, bcr-abl presents a therapeutic target that is unique to the pathological cells in CML patients. Advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms which sustain leukemic cells in CML have enabled the development of selective therapies for this disease. We review here the molecular pathogenesis and current treatment of CML. We also discuss the development of imatinib mesylate, a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl which has shown promise in clinical trials with CML. This recent advance in CML therapy represents a novel approach to rational design and development of new anticancer drugs.","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, PA 15213, USA.']",,,,,159,,,20020124,,,,,,,,,,

This graft-versus-tumor effect, which represents the most conclusive evidence that the immune system can cure cancer in humans, is mediated primarily if not exclusively by T cells specific for host minor histocompatibility antigens. Since minor histocompatibility antigens are present on all tissues and organs, injection of unselected donor T cells also causes graft vs. host disease, which drastically limits the use and benefits of this treatment. Recent studies in mice have shown that adoptive transfer of primed T cells targeted to a single major histocompatibility complex class I restricted immunodominant minor histocompatibility antigen can eradicate leukemia cells without causing any toxicity to the host. We present the promises and caveats of this and other new approaches for adoptive T cell immunotherapy of cancer.","[""Guy-Bernier Research Center, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, 5415 de l'Assomption Blvd., Montreal, Quebec H1T 2M4 Canada. c.perreault@videotron.ca""]",,,,,87,,,20020124,,,,,,,,,,

In this process, the endogenous estrogens, estrone and estradiol, are metabolized to 2-catechol estrogens (2-CE, major) and 4-CE (minor). If the 4-CEs are further oxidized to CE-3,4-quinones, they may react with DNA to form depurinating adducts at N-7 of guanine and N-3 of adenine, and generate apurinic sites. Similarly, the carcinogenic synthetic estrogen hexestrol, a hydrogenated derivative of diethylstilbestrol, is metabolized to its quinone, which reacts with DNA to form analogous depurinating adducts. This could be the primary critical event leading to oncogenic mutations and then initiation of cancer. Evidence supporting this hypothesis has been obtained from the human breast and animal models susceptible to estrogen-induced tumors, including the Syrian golden hamster kidney, ACI rat mammary gland, and Noble rat prostate. The oxidation of phenols to catechols and then to quinones is not only a mechanism of tumor initiation for natural and synthetic estrogens, but also for the leukemogen benzene. In fact, catechol, one of the metabolites of benzene, when oxidized to its quinone, reacts with DNA to form N7guanine and N3adenine depurinating adducts. Thus, a unifying mechanism, namely formation of catechol quinones and reaction with DNA, could initiate not only cancer by oxidation of specific endogenous estrogen metabolites, but also leukemia by oxidation of benzene.","['Eppley Institute for Research in Cancer and Allied Diseases, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, Nebraska 68198-6805, USA. ecavalie@unmc.edu']","['P01 CA49210/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA36727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA49917/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,50,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acquired PRCA has been associated with autoimmune, viral or neoplastic conditions. We report the case of a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and PRCA. Conventional antileukemic treatment had no effect on the PRCA, while the B-CLL showed partial remission according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia response criteria. The patient was treated with cyclosporin A that resulted in complete response of the PRCA lasting 12 months. PRCA relapse, suggested by a hemoglobin decrease and by bone marrow biopsy, did not respond to prednisone and cyclophosphamide treatment. Fludarabine treatment was started in July 1999; the B-CLL remained stable according to the International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia response criteria, the PRCA did not improve. In October 1999, because of intercurrent pneumonia, the patient was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) concentrate. This treatment resulted in total resolution of the pneumonia and a complete response of the PRCA. Therefore the patient remained on monthly IVIG. In view of the known efficacy of IVIG in the treatment of PRCA induced by parvovirus B19 and since serial polymerase chain reaction determinations of parvovirus B19 were repeatedly negative in our subject, we hypothesize that the IVIG per se may have a therapeutic effect on PRCA. The present case suggests that IVIG may be of benefit for PRCA patients even if the disease is unrelated to parvovirus B19 infection.","['Servizio di Oncologia Medica, U.O. di Medicina Interna II, Azienda Ospedaliera G.

Two different investigative avenues have paved the way to specific clinical studies. The first originates from the epochal murine experiments of the '70s, and has been greatly expanded in the last decade. A graft-versus-autoimmunity effect could also be demonstrated. In addition, it could also be shown that induced experimental autoimmune diseases such as adjuvant arthritis and autoimmune encephalomyelitis could, surprisingly, be cured following autologous transplantation. The first results in humans were observational and derived from studies including patients with coincidental diseases (severe autoimmune diseases plus leukemia/aplasia) treated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants. Although the concept of an allogeneic transplant is indisputably more appealing, very few patients with an isolated severe autoimmune disease have been treated using such a therapeutic approach. Reduced intensity conditioned transplants relying on subsequent graft-versus-autoimmunity effects strengthened by donor lymphocyte infusions are being explored cautiously. On the other hand, autologous transplants are being performed quite extensively. To date, transplanted severe autoimmune diseases include multiple sclerosis, connective tissue diseases (systemic sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis) and many others. It is uncertain if the main mechanism is solely immunoablative, or whether tolerized lymphocytes may also develop during a postulated ""window of opportunity"" following the transplant.","['Dipartimento di Emato-Oncologia, Azienda Ospedaliera e Cliniche Convenzionate S.

The c-myc mRNA levels were dramatically reduced at 1 h and became undetectable at 12 h after troglitazone treatment, which proved to be accompanied by complete blockade of the Tcf-4 activity in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. We succeeded in establishing HL-60 cell lines growing well in the presence of troglitazone in the long-term serum-free culture. They showed neither induction of apoptosis nor down-regulation of the c-Myc expression via blockade of the Tcf-4 activity after troglitazone treatment.

While much has been learned about the effects of specific translocations on cell proliferation, much less is known about what causes these chromosome rearrangements. This article describes the development and use of a system that genetically selects for rare translocation events using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A translocation YAC was created that contains the breakpoint cluster region from the human MLL gene, a gene frequently involved in translocations in leukemia patients, flanked by positive and negative selection markers. A translocation between the YAC and a yeast chromosome, whose breakpoint falls within the MLL DNA, physically separates the markers and forms the basis for the selection. When RAD52 is deleted, essentially all of the selected and screened cells contain simple translocations. The detectable translocation rates are the same in haploids and diploids, although the mechanisms involved and true translocation rates may be distinct. A unique double-strand break induced within the MLL sequences increases the number of detectable translocation events 100- to 1000-fold. This novel system provides a tractable assay for answering basic mechanistic questions about the development of chromosomal translocations.","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84132-3201, USA.']","['2P30CA42014/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM60420/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC1462053,,,,,,,,,,,

In some cases, onset of skin lesions is triggered by antigenic stimulation, and specific skin infiltrates at sites of previous herpes simplex or herpes zoster infection have been well documented. Specific skin manifestations of B-CLL can also be observed at sites typical for lymphadenosis benigna cutis (nipple, scrotum, earlobe), a Borrelia burgdorferi-associated cutaneous B-cell pseudolymphoma. METHODS: We studied specific skin manifestations of B-CLL arising at sites typical for B. burgdorferi-induced lymphadenosis benigna cutis, analyzing tissues for presence of B. burgdorferi DNA using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Six patients with B-CLL (M : F = 4 : 2; mean age: 67.8) presented with specific skin lesions located on the nipple (four cases) and scrotum (two cases). RESULTS: Clinically there were solitary erythematous plaques or nodules. Histology revealed in all cases a dense, monomorphous infiltrate of small lymphocytes showing an aberrant CD20+/CD43+ phenotype.

We used the monocytic leukaemia cell line THP-1, which differentiates to macrophages in response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), to investigate the regulation by RA of genes in the scavenger receptor type B family (CD36) in human monocyte/macrophages. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry demonstrated that, like PMA and the natural peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) ligand 15d-PGJ2, RA induced CD36 gene expression in these cells. Moreover, RA plus 15d-PGJ2 further enhanced CD36 protein and mRNA levels over that seen with the RA or PPARgamma compounds alone. The PPARgamma antagonist GW9662 was shown to block completely PPARgamma-ligand induction of CD36 gene expression, but had little effect on the action of RA. Our data indicated that RXR- and RAR-specific ligands (LG153 and TTNPB, respectively) were each alone able to increase CD36 mRNA and surface protein levels. By using calphostin C, a specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, we demonstrated that induction of CD36 by PMA, as well as by PPARgamma and RXR ligands were dependent upon PKC activation. In contrast, activation of CD36 through the RAR pathway was not affected by inhibition of PKC activity. Taken together, these data demonstrate that RA can up-regulate CD36 expression in human monocytes/macrophages. This regulation appears to be predominantly mediated through the RAR/RXR pathway of action and, unlike previously described methods of CD36 modulation, is independent of PPARgamma and PKC signalling. This study suggests a possible role for RA in physiological processes involving the scavenger receptor function in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage.","['Division of Research, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']","['P01 HD035276/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-HD35276/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC1782701,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the physiological significance of the burst of ROS is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: The present study was undertaken to investigate the role of superoxide anion in mediator release in rat and human cell systems. METHODS: RBL-2H3 cells were directly stimulated with anti-rat FcepsilonRI alpha-subunit monoclonal antibody (mAb). For the analysis of human cell system, leucocytes were isolated by dextran sedimentation from healthy volunteers or from patients, and challenged either with anti-human FcepsilonRI mAb or with the relevant antigens. Superoxide generation was determined by chemiluminescence-based methods. The releases of histamine and leukotrienes (LT)s were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorben assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Cross-linking of FcepsilonRI on RBL-2H3 cells or on human leucocytes from healthy donors by the anti-FcepsilonRI mAb resulted in a rapid generation of superoxide anion, as determined by chemiluminescence using superoxide-specific probes. Similarly, leucocytes from patients generated superoxide anion in response to the challenge with the relevant allergen but not with the irrelevant allergen. Furthermore, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI), a well-known inhibitor of flavoenzymes suppressed the superoxide generation and the release of histamine and LTC4 induced by the anti-FcepsilonRI mAb or by allergen in parallel. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that both RBL-2H3 cells and human basophils generate superoxide anion upon FcepsilonRI cross-linking either by antibody or by allergen challenge and that blockade of the generation prevents the release of allergic mediators. The findings strongly support the role of superoxide generation in the activation of mast cells and basophils under both physiological and pathological conditions. The findings suggest that drugs regulating the superoxide generation have potential therapeutic use for allergic disorders.","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve separate microsatellite loci, including three mononucleotide repeat markers, were used. Mutator phenotype (RER+) was detected in 20 AML (29.4%) and 3 MDS (21.4%) patients. RER+ rate was much higher in the therapy-related and secondary cases compared with the de novo cases.

Each patient underwent US of liver, gallbladder and complete bowel before chemotherapy, on days 2-4 after the end of chemotherapy and in cases of fever, diarrhoea or abdominal pain. US was combined with a standardized clinical examination and a broad spectrum of microbiological investigations. From January to August 2001, 243 US examinations were performed. The overall incidence of abdominal infectious diseases was 17.7% (11 out of 62, 95% confidence interval (CI): 9-29%). Four patients (6.5%) developed neutropenic enterocolitis; two of them died, two survived. Bowel wall thickening (BWT) > 4 mm in these four patients ranged from 5.8 to 23.6 mm and was detected only in one patient with mucositis. In three other patients (4.8%) Clostridium difficile, and in one patient (1.6%) Campylobacter jejuni, caused enterocolitis without BWT.

Abdominal infections caused by gastroenteritis viruses, cytomegalovirus (CMV) or Cryptosporidium were not observed. We conclude that in neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia receiving chemotherapy: (i) BWT is not a feature of chemotherapy-induced mucositis and should therefore be considered as sign of infectious enterocolitis; (ii) viruses, classic bacterial enteric pathogens (Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Aeromonas, Vibrio subsp., enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli) and Cryptosporidium have a very low incidence; and (iii) abdominal infections may be underestimated when US is not used in every patient with abdominal pain.","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Institute of Medical Microbiology and Immunology, University of Bonn, Sigmund-Freud-Strasse 25, 53105 Bonn, Germany. gorschlueter@uni-bonn.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNX showed less cytotoxicity in leukaemic cells than conventional DNR. The intracellular accumulation of DNX was 10 times less than conventional DNR during exposure to drugs for up to 5 h. Cell cycle analysis indicated that DNR induced concentration-dependent G2/M arrest, apoptosis and necrosis. However, DNX induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis but not necrotic cell death, even at a higher concentration. DNR- or DNX-induced activation of caspase-9 and -3 was detected at concentrations that induced apoptosis and necrosis. The sensitivity of leukaemic cells to DNR- and DNX-induced apoptosis correlated with the activation of caspases and the reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), but not the depletion of ATP and the generation of reactive oxidative species (ROS). DNX did not provoke ROS generation and ATP depletion in leukaemic cells. We conclude that the liposomal encapsulation of DNR restricts the intracellular accumulation speed and therefore diminishes ROS generation, ATP depletion and necrotic cell death. This may have implications for the cause of cardiotoxicity seen with DNR, its main dose-limiting step.","[""Department of Haematology/Oncology, St. Bartholomew's and The Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Turner Street, London E1 2AD, UK.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study on 27 t(4;11) infant ALL, we have used standardized primer sets for the detection of all incomplete and complete immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain (IGH) rearrangements, as well as for the Ig light chain kappa (IGK), T-cell receptor delta (TCRD) and gamma (TCRG) rearrangements that are most common in childhood BCP ALL. Only 52% of cases displayed clonotypic antigen receptor gene rearrangements (IGH in 48%, IGK, TCRD and TCRG in 12%, 41% and 6% respectively). This low frequency suggests, together with the findings of predominantly incomplete DJh joins and monoallelic IGH rearrangements, that they are derived from an immature progenitor cell. As 48% of the t(4;11) infant ALL cases had no detectable antigen receptor gene rearrangements that could be used for minimal residual disease (MRD) analysis, we established an expression-independent, leukaemia-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the genomic sequence of the MLL-AF4 fusion genes. This method had high sensitivity and specificity and resulted in identical estimations of tumour loads when compared with IGH targets. Thus, genomic MLL-AF4 fusion genes are a good alternative target for the analysis of MRD in patients with t(4;11) leukaemias.","[""Children's Cancer Research Institute, St. Anna Kinderspital, Kinderspitalgasse 6, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve patients in Infant 92 underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in first remission, but their survival was no better than that of patients receiving chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis of prognostic factors showed the adverse influence of younger age, CNS involvement at diagnosis and a high initial leucocyte count, but not of CD10 expression.

MEINOX proteins form heterodimer complexes with PBC proteins. Heterodimerization is crucial to DNA binding and for nuclear localization. PBC-MEINOX heterodimers bind DNA also in combination with HOX proteins, thereby modulating their DNA-binding specificity. TALE proteins therefore play crucial roles in multiple developmental and differentiation pathways in vivo. We report the identification and characterization of a novel human gene homologous to PREP1, called PREP2. Sequence comparisons indicate that PREP1 and PREP2 define a novel sub-family of MEINOX proteins, distinct from the MEIS sub-family. PREP2 is expressed in a variety of human adult tissues and displays a more restricted expression pattern than PREP1. PREP2 is capable of heterodimerizing with PBC proteins. Heterodimerization with PBX1 appears to be essential for nuclear localization of both PREP2 and PBX1. A comparison between the functional properties of PREP1 and PREP2 reveals that PREP2-PBX display a faster DNA-dissociation rate than PREP1-PBX heterodimers, suggesting different roles in controlling gene expression. Like PREP1, PREP2-PBX heterodimers are capable of forming ternary complexes with HOXB1. The analysis of some PREP2 in vitro properties suggests a functional diversification among PREP and between PREP and MEIS MEINOX proteins.","['Unit of Molecular Genetics, DIBIT, Department of Molecular Biology and Functional Genetics, Universita Vita Salute San Raffaele, Via Olgettina 58, 20132 Milano, Italy.']",['E.1026/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,PMC113854,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors sought to determine the efficacy of intrathecal thiotepa for pediatric LM. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors reviewed all children treated with intrathecal thiotepa for LM at two tertiary children's hospitals, assessing outcome by cerebrospinal fluid cytology, neuroimaging, neurologic examination, and overall survival rate. RESULTS: Fifteen children with LM evidenced by malignant cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (mean age 7.3 years; five medulloblastoma, one anaplastic astrocytoma, one glioblastoma, one retinoblastoma, one neuroblastoma, two rhabdomyosarcoma, one non-Hodgkin lymphoma, two acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and one acute myelogenous leukemia) were treated with intrathecal thiotepa at 5 to 11.5 mg/m2 per dose for two to seven doses. Five children received concomitant craniospinal irradiation; 12 received simultaneous systemic or other intrathecal chemotherapy, or both. Four children experienced clearance of malignant cells from the spinal fluid, but this response was sustained in only two. All four children with cytologic response received concurrent radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both. No patients showed partial or complete response on neuroimaging. Only one child had improvement on the neurologic examination; six were unchanged and eight had worsening neurologic signs. Median survival was 15.1 weeks, with a 1-year overall survival rate of 26.7% (standard error 11.4%). CONCLUSIONS: The unfavorable outcomes observed suggest that intrathecal thiotepa adds little to combination therapy for pediatric LM.","['Department of Neurology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California 94305-5235, USA. pfisher@stanford.edu']",['K12 NSO 1692-05/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical variables representing disease severity may explain some of the variability in these outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which readily available clinical data can explain the variability in length of stay and charges for children with cancer admitted to the hospital for fever and neutropenia, and to assess the appropriateness of using a time-efficient electronic case-finding strategy for the development of administrative outcome models. METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 157 fever and neutropenia encounters in a single institution during 11 months in 1997 was identified using a largely automated case-finding strategy followed by independent, blinded review of the selected discharge summaries. Models of admission variables predicting log length of stay and log charges were developed using multiple linear regression. The ""smearing"" technique of Duan adjusted for logarithmic retransformation was used in calculating each subject's predicted length of stay and charges. R2 values were calculated. There were two secondary analyses. In one, the result of admission blood culture was entered as a potential covariate. In the second, to evaluate the appropriateness of basing models on automated case-finding without discharge summary review, the authors rederived the models using all of the encounters (n = 160) identified by the algorithm, which had included three false-positive cases. RESULTS: Mean length of stay was 6.45 days. Mean charges were $11,967. Absolute monocyte count at admission was a significant, independent negative predictor of length of stay and charges. Underlying cancer diagnosis also was significant. Charges were highest for acute myeloid leukemia, followed by central nervous system tumors, other solid tumors, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphomas. Length of stay was highest for acute myeloid leukemia, followed by central nervous system tumors, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphomas, and other solid tumors. Absolute monocyte count and tumor type were the major components of the model, but admission temperature (for both administrative outcomes) and the presence of localized infection (for length of stay) also were significant predictors. R2 values were 35.3% (charges) and 38.5% (length of stay), with validation R2 values of 26.6% and 29.2%, respectively. Entering bacteremia as a covariate improved the models. Inclusion of the three false-positive cases generated models with only a modest loss of accuracy; it introduced over-and underreporting of some of the less significant predictors but did not disrupt the ability to identify the major predictors, absolute monocyte count and tumor type. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical variables that were significant in this study account, in validation R2 estimates, for more than 25% of the variability in administrative outcomes for encounters of fever and neutropenia. Adjusting length of stay and charges for these clinical variables would allow for a fairer comparison of institutions and individual providers. The electronic case-finding algorithm served as an efficient way to identify absolute monocyte count and tumor type as the major predictors and provided a conservative estimate of R2.","['Regenstrief Institute for Health Care and Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']",['1T16 LM07117/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2002 Apr 23.,,"Much is known about the transport of arsenite and antimonite into microbes, but the identities of mammalian transport proteins are unknown. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae FPS1 gene encodes a membrane protein homologous to the bacterial aquaglyceroporin GlpF and to mammalian aquaglyceroporins AQP7 and AQP9. Fps1p mediates glycerol uptake and glycerol efflux in response to hypoosmotic shock. Fps1p has been shown to facilitate uptake of the metalloids arsenite and antimonite, and the Escherichia coli homolog, GlpF, facilitates the uptake and sensitivity to metalloid salts. In this study, the ability of mammalian aquaglyceroporins AQP7 and AQP9 to substitute for the yeast Fps1p was examined. The fps1Delta strain of S. cerevisiae exhibits increased tolerance to arsenite and antimonite compared to a wild-type strain. Introduction of a plasmid containing AQP9 reverses the metalloid tolerance of the deletion strain. AQP7 was not expressed in yeast. The fps1Delta cells exhibit reduced transport of (73)As(III) or (125)Sb(III), but uptake is enhanced by expression of AQP9. Xenopus laevis oocytes microinjected with either AQP7 or AQP9 cRNA exhibited increased transport of (73)As(III). These results suggest that AQP9 and AQP7 may be a major routes of arsenite uptake into mammalian cells, an observation potentially of large importance for understanding the action of arsenite as a human toxin and carcinogen, as well as its efficacy as a chemotherapeutic agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Wayne State University, School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']","['HL33991/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 EY011239/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL48268/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 GM055425/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HL048268/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL033991/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL048268/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK007712/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P42 ES010344/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM55425/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'ES10344/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 DK7712-08/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM055425/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'EY11239/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC122900,20020423,,,,,,,,,,

In transformed lymphocytes, it acts as an essential growth factor. Tax stimulates the cell cycle in the G(1) phase by activating the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) CDK4 and CDK6 holoenzyme complexes. Here we show that Tax directly interacts with CDK4. This binding to CDK4 was specific, since Tax did not bind to either CDK2 or CDK1. The interaction with CDK4/cyclin D complexes was observed in vitro, in transfected fibroblasts, in HTLV-1-infected T cells, and in adult T-cell leukemia-derived cultures. Binding studies with several point and deletion mutants indicated that the N terminus of Tax mediates the interaction with CDK4. The Tax/CDK complex represented an active holoenzyme which capably phosphorylates the Rb protein in vitro and is resistant to repression by the inhibitor p21(CIP). Binding-deficient Tax mutants failed to activate CDK4, indicating that direct association with Tax is required for enhanced kinase activity. Tax also increased the association of CDK4 with its positive cyclin regulatory subunit. Thus, protein-protein contact between Tax and the components of the cyclin D/CDK complexes provides a further mechanistic explanation for the mitogenic and immortalizing effects of this HTLV-1 oncoprotein.","['Institut fur Klinische und Molekulare Virologie, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",,,,,,,PMC133776,,,,,,,,,,,

Disruption of RARalpha function appears to be the likely cause of aberrant myelopoiesis observed in APL, because PML-RARalpha expression has been shown to deregulate the transcription of genes that control myelopoiesis. To target RARalpha chimeric proteins, we engineered epitope-tagged versions of PML-RARalpha, PLZF-RARalpha, NPM-RARalpha, and NuMA-RARalpha (X-RARalphaV5) and generated a panel of stable COS cell lines expressing X-RARalphaV5. Protein fractionation and Western analysis of these COS lines reveal that X-RARalpha proteins localize to both the cytoplasm and nucleus. NPM-RARalpha is predominantly nuclear whereas NuMA-RARalpha is predominantly cytoplasmic. Confocal immunofluorescent microscopy reveals that PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha share a primarily diffuse nuclear pattern that excludes the nucleolus. NPM-RARalpha is also diffuse in the nucleus but, in contrast to PML-RARalpha and PLZF-RARalpha, is strongly associated with the nucleolus. Strikingly, NuMA-RARalpha predominantly localizes throughout the cytoplasm in a microspeckled pattern. We further demonstrate that NPM and NuMA interact with NPM-RARalpha and NuMA-RARalpha, respectively. The distinct intracellular localization patterns and the shared ability of X-RARalpha to interact with their respective RARalpha partner proteins (X) further support the hypothesis that deregulation of these partners may play a role in APL pathogenesis.","['The Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Toronto, Ontario, M5S 1A8, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we reported that FLT3 with ITD (FLT3/ITD) formed a homodimer and was autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues, while the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we elucidated the role of the JM domain in FLT3 activation. Mutant FLT3 with not only ITD but also an elongating or shortening JM domain transformed murine IL3-dependent myeloid progenitor cell line 32D regardless of the tyrosine residues in the JM domain. These mutant FLT3s were constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and activated signal-transduction molecules such as SHC, MAP kinase and STAT5a. Notably, co-transfection of the truncated FLT3/ITD lacking kinase and C-terminal domains with the wild type (Wt)-FLT3 into 32D cells resulted in the autonomous proliferation. In these cells, truncated FLT3/ITD generated a hetero-complex with Wt-FLT3 and Wt-FLT3 was constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated. These findings indicate that the FLT3 JM domain plays an important role in receptor activation, and that the length-mutated JM domain induces ligand-independent receptor activation but also activates Wt-FLT3 in a trans-manner.","['Department of Infectious Diseases, Nagoya University School of Medicine, 65 Tsurumai-cho, Showa-ku, Nagoya 466-8560, Japan. kiyoi@med.nagoya-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The dually infected individuals showed a significantly higher provirus load and an increase in CD4(+)25(+) T cell population, with a significant, positive correlation. This increase was attributable to polyclonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells, as demonstrated by inverse-long PCR analysis of the integration sites. S. stercoralis antigen activated the IL-2 promoter in reporter gene assays, induced production of IL-2 by PBMC in vitro, and supported growth of IL-2 dependent cell lines immortalized by HTLV-1 infection or the transduction of Tax.

Bone marrow-derived mast cells isolated from Gab2(-/-) mice have defective signaling probably due to the lack of the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3-kinase). In this study, we investigated the role of Gab2 using the rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cell line mast cells. Fc epsilon RI aggregation induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of Gab2 and translocation of a significant fraction of it from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. As in other cells, Gab2 was found to associate with several signaling molecules including Src homology 2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2, Grb2, Lyn, and phospholipase C gamma (PLC gamma). The association of Gab2 with Lyn and PLC gamma were enhanced after receptor aggregation. Overexpression of Gab2 in rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cell line cells inhibited the Fc epsilon RI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the subunits of the receptor, and the phosphorylation and/or activation of Syk and mitogen-activated protein kinase. Downstream events such as calcium mobilization, degranulation, and induction of TNF-alpha and IL-6 gene transcripts were decreased in Gab2 overexpressing cells, although Akt phosphorylation as a measure of PI3-kinase activation was unaffected. These results suggest that in addition to the positive effects mediated by PI3-kinase that are apparent in Gab2(-/-) mast cells, Gab2 by interacting with Lyn and PLC gamma may have negative regulatory effects on Fc epsilon RI-induced mast cell signaling and functions.","['Receptors and Signal Transduction Section, Oral Infection and Immunity Branch, Department of Health and Human Services, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secretory proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and are transported through the Golgi apparatus to the trans-Golgi network, where they are sorted into transport vesicles that bud off and fuse into condensing vacuoles, which subsequently undergo an editing and concentration process to become mature secretory vesicles. In this study, we report that the PTP-MEG2 protein tyrosine phosphatase is located on these vesicles in mast cells. Expression of PTP-MEG2 caused a striking enlargement of these vesicles in both rat basophilic leukemia mast cells and Jurkat T leukemia cells into giant vesicles with diameters of up to several micrometers. The fused vesicles did not acquire markers for other compartments and were adjacent to the trans-Golgi network, contained carboxypeptidase E, chromogranin C, and IL-2, and had an electron-dense core typical of secretory vesicles. Expression of PTP-MEG2 also caused a reduction in the secretion of IL-2 from stimulated Jurkat cells. The effects of PTP-MEG2 on secretory vesicles required the catalytic activity of PTP-MEG2 and was rapidly reversed by pervanadate.

METHODS: A re-evaluation of ECLIS (European Childhood Leukaemia and Lymphoma Incidence Study), a large IARC-coordinated project in the context of various published studies. RESULTS: ECLIS revealed a slightly higher leukaemia incidence in the most contaminated European regions, and an increasing trend with estimated cumulative excess radiation dose. The excess corresponds to 20 cases of childhood leukaemia in the study area up to 1991. More recent evidence from Greece and Germany indicates significantly higher risks in the cohort of children in utero at the time of the initial fallout. In Greece, a positive trend was observed over three regions of increasing average fallout contamination. CONCLUSION: Chernobyl fallout could well have caused a small, but significant excess of childhood leukaemia cases in Europe. The etiologic mechanism might include an induction of chromosome aberrations in early pregnancy. Increased risks in the birth cohort exposed in utero correspond to 11 excess cases in Greece and another 11.4 excess cases in Germany. Exposure misclassification and underascertainment of incident cases render post-Chernobyl risk estimates probably too low. If indeed Chernobyl fallout has caused childhood leukaemia cases in Europe, we would also expect an increased incidence for other childhood cancers and excess malignancies in adults as well as non-malignant diseases of all ages. Neither of these endpoints has as yet been systematically studied.","['Bremen Institute for Prevention Research and Social Medicine (BIPS), Linzer Str. 8-10, D-28359 Bremen, Germany.

Although a number of cellular responses to relaxin have been described, intracellular signaling mechanisms that link relaxin receptor engagement to alterations in gene expression remain uncharacterized. In the present study, relaxin treatment of a well-characterized target, human endometrial stromal cells, resulted in rapid activation of p42/44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, as well as of MAPK (or ERK) kinase (MEK). Using a selective chemical inhibitor of MEK, it was further demonstrated that MEK phosphorylation is critical for relaxin-induced MAP kinase activation. Relaxin treatment also induced MAP kinase activation in THP-1 monocytic cells and in human smooth muscle cells, indicating that it may be a major signaling transducer utilized by the relaxin receptor. In contrast to insulin or IGF-1, relaxin did not trigger the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, perhaps accounting in part for relaxin's unique biological profile. Relaxin was also found to cause activation of the transcription factor CREB, a substrate of the MAP kinase pathway. Finally, activation of the MAP kinase pathway was shown to be essential for optimal stimulation of expression of the gene for vascular endothelial growth factor.","['Connetics Corporation, 3400 West Bayshore Rd., Palo Alto, California 94303, USA.']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

IE2 is detectable in the nucleus as one of the major early-expressed proteins and exhibits a dynamic localization pattern during the infection cycle (D. Murges, I. Quadt, J. Schroer, and D. Knebel-Morsdorf, Exp. Cell Res. 264:219-232, 2001). Here, we investigated whether IE2 localized to regions of viral DNA replication. After viral DNA was labeled with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), confocal imaging indicated that defined IE2 domains colocalized with viral DNA replication centers as soon as viral DNA replication was detectable. In addition, a subpopulation of IE2 structures colocalized with two further virus-encoded replication factors, late expression factor 3 (LEF-3) and the DNA binding protein (DBP). While DBP and LEF-3 structures always colocalized and enlarged simultaneously with viral DNA replication sites, only those IE2 structures that colocalized with replication sites also colocalized with DBP. Replication and transcription of DNA viruses in association with promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) oncogenic domains have been observed. By confocal imaging we demonstrated that the human PML colocalized with IE2. Triple staining revealed PML/IE2 domains in the vicinity of viral DNA replication centers, while IE2 alone colocalized with early replication sites, demonstrating that PML structures do not form common domains with viral DNA replication centers. Thus, we conclude that IE2 colocalizes alternately with PML and the sites of viral DNA replication. Small ubiquitin-like modifier SUMO-1 has been implicated in the nuclear distribution of PML. Similar to what was found for mammalian cells, small ubiquitin-like modifiers were recruited to PML domains in infected insect cells, which suggests that IE2 and PML colocalize in conserved cellular domains. In summary, our results support a model for IE2 as part of various functional sites in the nucleus that are connected with viral DNA replication.","['Max-Planck-Institute for Neurological Research and Department of Neurology, University of Cologne, D-50931 Cologne, Germany.']",,,,,,,PMC136171,,,,,,,,,,,

This inhibition can be relieved by using inhibitors of histone deacetylases, acetylation being a major characteristic of transcriptionally active chromatin. Paradoxically, the expression of only approximately 2% of the total cellular genes is modulated by histone hyperacetylation. To unravel the potential role of this transcriptional control on BLV expression, we tested the effect of two highly specific inhibitors of deacetylases, trichostatin A (TSA) and trapoxin (TPX). Our results demonstrate that treatment with TSA efficiently enhanced long terminal repeat-directed gene expression of integrated reporter constructs in heterologous D17 stable cell lines. To further examine the biological relevance of these observations made in vitro, we analyzed ex vivo-isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from bovine leukemia virus (BLV)-infected sheep. TSA deacetylase inhibitor induced a drastic increase in viral expression at levels comparable to those induced by treatment with phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin, the most efficient activators of BLV expression known to date. TSA acted directly on BLV-infected B lymphocytes to increase viral expression and does not seem to require T-cell cooperation. Inhibition of deacetylation after treatment with TSA or TPX also significantly increased viral expression in PBMCs from cattle, the natural host for BLV. Together, our results show that BLV gene expression is, like that of a very small fraction of cellular genes, also regulated by deacetylation.","['Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Agronomy, Gembloux, Belgium.']",,,,,,,PMC136152,,,,,,,,,,,

We used this nonreciprocal recognition to investigate regions of packaging signals that influence viral RNA encapsidation specificity. Although the MLV and SNV packaging signals (Psi and E, respectively) do not contain significant sequence homology, they both contain a pair of hairpins. This hairpin pair was previously proposed to be the core element in MLV Psi. In the present study, MLV-based vectors were generated to contain chimeric SNV/MLV packaging signals in which the hairpins were replaced with the heterologous counterpart. The interactions between these chimeras and MLV or SNV proteins were examined by virus replication and RNA analyses. SNV proteins recognized all of the chimeras, indicating that these chimeras were functional. We found that replacing the hairpin pair did not drastically alter the ability of MLV proteins to package these chimeras. These results indicate that, despite the important role of the hairpin pair in RNA packaging, it is not the major motif responsible for the ability of MLV proteins to discriminate between the MLV and SNV packaging signals. To determine the role of sequences flanking the hairpins in RNA packaging specificity, vectors with swapped flanking regions were generated and evaluated. SNV proteins packaged all of these chimeras efficiently. In contrast, MLV proteins strongly favored chimeras with the MLV 5'-flanking regions. These data indicated that MLV Gag recognizes multiple elements in the viral packaging signal, including the hairpin structure and flanking regions.","['HIV Drug Resistance Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, Maryland 21702-1201, USA.']",,,,,,,PMC136156,,,,,,,,,,,

IMPDH is the key enzyme of de novo guanylate biosynthesis and was shown to be linked with proliferation. Therefore, IMPDH is a very good target for antitumor therapy. In order to be active, benzamide riboside has to be converted to BAD, an NAD analogue that binds to the NAD site on IMPDH. Inhibition of the enzyme by benzamide riboside selectively inhibits tumor cell growth and induces apoptosis in various human tumor cell lines. In this manuscript we describe the induction of the CD71 transferrin receptor in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells following treatment with benzamide riboside. The results indicate a possible involvement of the iron metabolism in the action of this new compound. Benzamide riboside might be clinically used in the treatment of leukemia and solid tumors, alone or as part of combination therapy. Since transferrin receptors are overexpressed in certain cancers, such as glioma and colon cancer, a combination therapy that includes benzamide riboside in transferrin-coupled liposomes will not only target cancer cells but also leads to suicidal action because benzamide riboside will upregulate transferrin receptors on cancer cells thereby make it accessible to dose-intensive chemotherapy. We therefore believe that benzamide riboside itself or derivatives of benzamide riboside might become an important addition for the treatment to diseases that are otherwise fatal.","['Clinical Institute of Medical and Chemical Laboratorydiagnostics, General Hospital of Vienna, University of Vienna Medical School, Austria. thomas.szekeres@univie.ac.at']",,,,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPMT activity exhibits a genetic polymorphism in 10% of Caucasians, with 1/300 individuals having complete deficiency. Patients with intermediate or deficient TPMT activity are at risk for excessive toxicity, including fatal myelosuppression, after receiving standard doses of thiopurine medications. The molecular basis for low TPMT activity has been elucidated, leading to the development of assays for the three signature mutations, which account for the majority of mutant alleles. TPMT genotype is correlated with erythrocyte and leukemia blast cell TPMT activity and associated with a risk of toxicity after thiopurine therapy. Recent studies defined target starting doses for mercaptopurine based on TPMT genotypes. This polymorphism is one of the best models for the translation of genomic information to guide patient therapeutics.","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 S.

A total of 200 sera from the general population and 67 from patients with neoplasia were studied. The latter were divided in 3 groups: lymphoma/myeloma, leukemia and non-immune solid tumors. HHV-6 antibodies (IgG and IgM) were assayed by IFA and viral genomes were detected using nested PCR. The prevalence of the infection in the healthy population was 63.5% with a titer geometric mean (TGM) of 48.67 +/- 1.23. A control group was obtained by systematic sampling of the healthy population. Among the patients with neoplasia, the prevalence was 95.5%. In the lymphoma/myeloma group, TGM was 268.73 +/- 1.62; in the leukemia group it was 151.1 +/- 1.88 and in the non-immunogenic solid tumors group it was 95.67 +/- 1.57. Statistically significant differences were observed (p < 0.01) between the control group and the lymphoma/myeloma and leukemia groups. Serum IgM or free viral genomes were not detected in any serum sample. The antibody prevalence found in the general population documents the high circulation of this lymphotropic virus which could indirectly contribute to the pathogenesis of the lymphoproliferative disorder.","['Instituto de Virologia Dr. J Vanella, Universidad Nacional de Cordoba, Argentina.']",,,,,,,,,Circulacion del virus Herpes 6 humano en adultos normales y en pacientes oncologicos.,,,,,,,,,

[Tyr(3)]octreotide and [Tyr(3)]octreotate, chelated with DTPA or DOTA, both showed high affinity binding to somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (sst(2)) in vitro. The radiolabelled compounds all showed high tumor uptake in sst(2)-positive tumors in vivo in rats, the highest uptake being reached with [(177)Lu-DOTA,Tyr(3)]octreotate. In preclinical therapy studies in vivo in rats, excellent, dose dependent, tumor size responses were found, responses appeared to be dependent on tumor size at therapy start. These preclinical data showed the great promise of radionuclide therapy with radiolabelled somatostatin analogues. They emphasised the concept that especially the combination of somatostatin analogs radiolabeled with different radionuclides, like (90)Y and (177)Lu, is most promising to reach a wider tumor size region of high curability. Furthermore, different phase I clinical studies, using [(111)In-DTPA]octreotide, [(90)Y-DOTA,Tyr(3)]octreotide or [(177)Lu-DOTA, Tyr(3)]octreotate are described. Fifty patients with somatostatin receptor-positive tumors were treated with multiple doses of [(111)In-DTPA(0)]octreotide. Forty patients were evaluable after cumulative doses of at least 20 GBq up to 160 GBq. Therapeutic effects were seen in 21 patients: partial remission in 1 patient, minor remissions in 6 patients, and stabilization of previously progressive tumors in 14 patients. The toxicity was generally mild bone marrow toxicity, but 3 of the 6 patients who received more than 100 GBq developed a myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia. Radionuclide therapy with [(90)Y-DOTA,Tyr(3)]octreotide started in 3 different phase I trials. Overall, antimitotic effects have been observed: about 20% partial response and 60% stable disease (N = 92) along with complete symptomatic cure of several malignant insulinoma and gastrinoma patients. Maximum cumulative [(90)Y-DOTA,Tyr(3)]octreotide dose was about 26 GBq, without reaching the maximum tolerable dose. New is the use of [(177)Lu-DOTA,Tyr(3)]octreotate, which shows the highest tumor uptake of all tested octreotide analogs so far, with excellent tumor-to-kidney ratios. Radionuclide therapy with this analog in a phase 1 trial started recently in our center in 63 patients (238 administrations), Interim analysis of 18 patients with neuroendocrine tumors was performed very recently. According to the WHO, toxicity criteria no dose limiting toxicity was observed. Minor CT-assessed tumor shrinkage (25% - 50% reduction) was noticed in 6% of 18 patients and partial remission (50% - 100% reduction, SWOG criteria) in 39%. Eleven percent of patients had tumor progression and in 44% no changes were seen. These data show that radionuclide therapy with radiolabelled somatostatin analogs, like [DOTA, Tyr(3)]octreotide and [DOTA, Tyr(3)octreotate is a most promising new treatment modality for patients who have sst(2)-positive tumors.","['Department of Nuclear Medicine, Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,35,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic effects were seen in 21 patients: partial remission in 1 patient, minor remissions in 6 patients, and stabilization of previously progressive tumors in 14 patients. Our results thus underscore the therapeutic potential of Auger-emitting radiolabelled peptides. The toxicity was generally mild bone marrow toxicity, but 3 of the 6 patients who received more than 100 GBq developed a myelodysplastic syndrome or leukemia. Therefore, we consider 100 GBq as the maximal tolerable dose. With a renal radiation dose of 0.45 mGy/MBq (based on previous studies) a cumulative dose of 100 GBq [(111)In-DTPA(0)]octreotide will lead to 45Gy on the kidneys, twice the accepted limit for external beam radiation. However, no development of hypertension, proteinuria, or significant changes in serum creatinine or creatinine clearance were observed in our patients including 2 patients who received 106 and 113 GBq [(111)In-DTPA(0)]octreotide without protection with amino acids, over a follow-up period of respectively 3 and 2 years. These findings show that the radiation of the short-range (maximal 10 microns) Auger electrons originating from the cells of the proximal tubules is not harmful for the renal function.

Both MOZ and MORF are histone acetyltransferases with weak transcriptional repression domains and strong transcriptional activation domains, suggesting that they may function as transcriptional coregulators. Here we describe that MOZ and MORF both interact with Runx2 (or Cbfa1), a Runt-domain transcription factor that is known to play important roles in T cell lymphomagenesis and bone development. Through its C-terminal SM (serine- and methionine-rich) domain, MORF binds to Runx2 in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with this, the SM domain of MORF also binds to Runx1 (or AML1), a Runx2 homologue that is frequently altered by leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations. While MORF does not acetylate Runx2, its SM domain potentiates Runx2-dependent transcriptional activation. Moreover, endogenous MORF is required for transcriptional activation by Runx2. Intriguingly, Runx2 negatively regulates the transcriptional activation potential of the SM domain. Like that of MORF, the SM domain of MOZ physically and functionally interacts with Runx2. These results thus identify Runx2 as an interaction partner of MOZ and MORF and suggest that both acetyltransferases are involved in regulating transcriptional activation mediated by Runx2 and its homologues.","['Molecular Oncology Group, Department of Medicine, McGill University Health Center, Quebec, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is composed of the N-terminal AML1 portion with the DNA-binding Runt domain and the C-terminal Evi-1 portion. It has been shown to dominantly repress AML1-induced transactivation. The mechanism for it has been mainly attributed to competition with AML1 for the DNA-binding and for the interaction with PEBP2beta (CBFbeta), a partner protein which heterodimerizes with AML1. It was recently found that Evi-1 interacts with C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) to repress TGFbeta-induced transactivation. Here, we demonstrate that AML1/Evi-1 interacts with CtBP in SKH1 cells, a leukemic cell line which endogenously overexpresses AML1/Evi-1 and that AML1/Evi-1 requires the interaction with CtBP to repress AML1-induced transactivation. The association with CtBP is also required when AML1/Evi-1 blocks myeloid differentiation of 32Dcl3 cells induced by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Taken together, it is suggested that one of the mechanisms for AML1/Evi-1-associated leukemogenesis should be an aberrant recruitment of a corepressor complex by the chimeric protein.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-8655, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Due to their unique characteristics, hematologic malignancies represent an ideal target for vaccine-based therapeutic interventions. METHODS: A review of published vaccine studies in experimental models as well as the results of clinical trials using vaccines for patients with hematologic tumors is presented. RESULTS: Tumor vaccine strategies can be divided into two categories: antigen-specific strategies, in which the tumor antigens have been identified and can be isolated to develop a molecularly defined vaccine, and cellular or non-antigen-specific, in which the tumor-specific antigens are unknown but presumed to exist within the material used to generate the vaccine. Early clinical trials have shown not only the feasibility and safety of either approach but also the obstacles in therapeutic cancer vaccination as an effective treatment modality for hematologic malignancies. CONCLUSIONS: Active immunization using current cancer vaccine approaches is feasible and safe. Although no major successes have been reported, the positive clinical results observed in some patients support the potential for therapeutic cancer vaccination in the management of hematologic malignancies. Results of studies that are testing vaccine formulations, targets, and settings (eg, bone marrow transplantation) may support the use of cancer vaccination as an efficient therapeutic strategy against tumors of hematologic origin.","['Department of Oncology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA. iborrell@jhmi.edu']",,,,,98,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DLI-induced remissions of chronic phase CML are durable, but as many as half of patients with other diseases ultimately relapse. Complications of DLI include acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and aplasia, which induce profound immunosuppression and susceptibility to opportunistic infections. There is a strong correlation of GVHD and disease response. CONCLUSIONS: Novel methods of augmenting the antitumor efficacy of DLI and of dissociating the graft-vs-leukemia effect from GVHD are needed.

CONCLUSIONS: The rapid pace of progress in cellular and molecular immunology has identified new opportunities for developing T-cell therapy or vaccination for leukemia.

In this article, we summarize the role of radioimmunotherapy in the treatment of leukemia. METHODS: The authors reviewed the published clinical trials of radioimmunotherapy in acute leukemia. RESULTS: Radioimmunoconjugates that emit beta-particles, such as 131I-anti-CD33, 90Y-anti-CD33, 131I-anti-CD45, and 188Re-anti-CD66c, deliver significant doses of radiation to the bone marrow and may be particularly effective when used as part of a conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Radioimmunoconjugates that emit short-ranged alpha-particles, such as 213Bi-anti-CD33, are better suited for the treatment of low-volume or residual disease. CONCLUSIONS: Radiolabeled antibodies can be administered safely to patients with advanced leukemias and have significant antileukemic activity. Radiolabeled antibodies can potentially intensify the antileukemic effects of conditioning regimens when used in conjunction with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Whether or not radiolabeled antibodies improve the outcome of patients with leukemia remains to be demonstrated by randomized studies.","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. burkej@mskcc.org']",,,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two children who had been previously treated for acute leukemia presented a bilateral anterior uveitis with hypopyon; anterior chamber paracentesis showed blast cells and confirmed the ocular relapse. A corneal lesion was found in 2 children and in 2 cases, the optic nerve had edema; a decrease in visual acuity was the sign of the optic nerve lesion. Two patients had retinal infiltration with hemorrhages in the posterior pole. Prophylaxis consists of intrathecal injection of methotrexate and reinforcement of chemotherapy.

Among several mHags, HA-1 is one that acts alone and is the most studied. It is suggested that HA-1 may be one of the immunodominant antigens inducing not only graft-versus-host disease but also graft-versus-malignancy effects. There are some reports that mHag HA-1-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes generated from an HA-1-negative donor can lyse HA-1-positive leukemic cells. However, the tissue distribution of HA-1 has been described as restricted to the cells of the hematopoietic lineage. METHODS: We examined the HA-1 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC), leukemia/lymphoma cell lines, solid tumor cell lines, and paired samples of tumor and normal tissues from individual cancer patients by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: We found that mRNA of HA-1 is expressed in all leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and PBMNC. Most of the leukemia/lymphoma cell lines have the same levels of HA-1 expression as a leukemia/lymphoma cell line, Raji. The expression levels of human PBMNC were 14- to 19-fold higher than those of Raji. Among 32 solid tumor cell lines, 7 showed >50% expression levels compared with Raji. CONCLUSIONS: HA-1 expression in the mRNA level is higher in cells of hematopoietic origin, but this tissue distribution is not strictly restricted. Some solid tumor cells and tissues express HA-1 gene equal to hematopoietic cells.","['Department of Internal Medicine (II), Okayama University Medical School, Okayama, Japan. nfujii@md.okayama-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cases were identified at tertiary care centers in the Province of Quebec between 1980 and 1993. Each parent was interviewed separately about alcohol consumption habits. We also used a case-only design with 186 cases to estimate interaction odds ratios between prenatal exposure and child DNA variants in the GSTM1 and CYP2E1 genes. RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio for any maternal consumption during pregnancy was 0.7 (95% confidence interval = 0.5-0.9).

Present studies demonstrate that, upon engagement of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis, epothilone (Epo) B derivative BMS 247550, a novel nontaxane antimicrotubule agent, as well as the death ligand Apo-2L/TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) induce the mitochondrial release and cytosolic accumulation of Smac/DIABLO, along with cyt c, in human acute leukemia Jurkat T cells. While it had no activity alone, ectopic overexpression of Smac/DIABLO or treatment with the N-terminus heptapeptide (Smac-7) or tetrapeptide (Smac-4) of Smac/DIABLO significantly increased Epo B- or Apo-2L/TRAIL-induced processing and PARP cleavage activity of caspase-3. This produced a significant increase in apoptosis of Jurkat cells (P <.05). Increased apoptosis was also associated with the down-regulation of XIAP, cIAP1, and survivin. Along with the increased activity of caspase-3, ectopic overexpression of Smac/DIABLO or cotreatment with Smac-4 also increased Epo B- or Apo-2L/TRAIL-induced processing of caspase-8 and Bid, resulting in enhanced cytosolic accumulation of cyt c. This was not due to increased assembly and activity of Apo-2L/TRAIL-induced DISC (death-inducing signaling complex) but dependent on the feedback activity of caspase-3.

Functional experiments showed that this interaction has the capacity to render GATA-dependent transcription responsive to treatment with a combination of all-trans retinoic acid and the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA).

However, functional links between the abundant expression of intact Notch1 and oncogenesis are still lacking. Here we show that Notch1 is highly expressed in B- and T-cell-derived tumor cells of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma. We demonstrate a novel mechanism for the oncogenic capacity of Notch1 by showing that the interaction between intact Notch1 on tumor cells and its ligand Jagged1 dramatically induces proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis in vitro. We further provide evidence that in Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma, Jagged1 is expressed in malignant and in bystander cells colocalizing with Notch1-positive tumor cells. Notch1 signaling may therefore be activated in tumor cells by Jagged1 through homotypic or heterotypic cell-cell interactions, and it seems likely that these interactions contribute to lymphomagenesis in vivo. Thus, our data suggest that activated Notch1 signaling plays an important role in the pathobiology of Hodgkin and anaplastic large cell lymphoma and that it might be a potential new target for treatment.","['Charite, Robert-Rossle-Klinik, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany. fjundt@mdc-berlin.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A large body of data indicates that in various model systems, elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) can potentiate glucocorticoid response, although this has not been well evaluated as a potential leukemia treatment. Although cAMP analogs have been studied, little data exist regarding the potential toxicity to leukemia cells of pharmacologic elevation of cAMP levels in leukemic blasts. Using MTT assays of cell proliferation on CEM ALL cells, we found that aminophylline and other nonspecific phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors suppress cell growth. This effect is replicated by the PDE4-specific PDE inhibitor rolipram, but not by specific inhibitors of the PDE1 or PDE3 classes. We found that PDE inhibitors cause increased dexamethasone sensitivity and a synergistic effect with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. We observed several important cellular characteristics associated with this treatment, including elevation of cAMP, induction of p53 and p21(WAF1/CIP1) proteins, G(1) and G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, and increased apoptosis. Sensitivity to forskolin and rolipram is shared by at least 2 pediatric ALL cell lines, CEM and Reh cells. Some cell lines derived from adult-type lymphoid malignancies also show sensitivity to this treatment. These findings suggest that PDE inhibitors have therapeutic potential in human ALL and characterize the molecular mechanisms that may be involved in this response.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Pediatrics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']","['K08-CA75120/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29-CA71546/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, fresh ATL leukemic cells derived from patients with acute ATL produce VEGF and bFGF transcripts and proteins. The viral transactivator Tax activates the VEGF promoter, linking the induction of angiogenesis to viral gene expression. Angiogenesis is associated with the adhesion of HTLV-I-transformed cells to endothelial cells and gap junction-mediated heterocellular communication between the 2 cell types.

Alternatively, MDM2 may have oncogenic roles other than those resulting from p53 interactions. Here we report that MDM2 can induce expression of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB, which is an anti-apoptotic factor expressed in certain neoplastic cells in response to chemotherapy. Initially, we noted that the overexpression of MDM2 protein in leukemic bone marrow cells of patients with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL), and an ALL cell line (EU-4) transfected with the MDM2 gene was associated with elevated expression of p65 and in vitro resistance to doxorubicin (Adriamycin). By cotransfection of the MDM2 gene and p65-promoter-reporter constructs into EU-4 cells, we found that transient and high-level MDM2 expression induced p65 promoter activity. In the presence of wild-type (wt) p53, MDM2 increased p65 promoter activity by reversing p53-mediated suppression of p65. In the absence of p53, MDM2 directly increased p65 promoter activity. Deletion and mutation analysis of the p65 promoter indicated that the region between nt -575 and -178, which contains the first and second Sp1-binding sites, was required for activation by MDM2. Further studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed that MDM2 was able to directly bind to the Sp1 site of the p65 promoter. Our findings suggest that by inducing p65 expression, MDM2 has a p53-independent role in tumorigenesis, which may further elucidate the association between MDM2 overexpression and resistant disease in childhood ALL.","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/BMT, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']","['R01 CA82323/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA72020/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that primitive human CD34(+) cord blood cells, including multipotent as well as granulopoietic- and erythroid-restricted progenitors, can be efficiently transduced with a MSCV-BCR-ABL-IRES-GFP retrovirus, resulting in the sustained expression by their progeny of very high levels of tyrosine phosphorylated p210(BCR-ABL). Interestingly, even in the presence of growth factors that supported the exclusive production of granulopoietic cells from green fluorescent protein (GFP)-transduced control cells, BCR-ABL-transduced progenitor subpopulations generated large numbers of erythropoietin-independent terminally differentiating erythroid cells and reduced numbers of granulopoietic cells. Analyses of individual clones generated by single transduced cells in both semisolid and liquid cultures showed this BCR-ABL-induced erythroid differentiation response to be elicited at a high frequency from all types of transduced CD34(+) cells independent of their apparent prior lineage commitment status. Additional experiments showed that this erythroid differentiation response was largely prevented when the cells were transduced and maintained in the presence of the BCR-ABL-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, STI-571. These findings indicate that overexpression of BCR-ABL in primary human hematopoietic cells can activate an erythroid differentiation program in apparently granulopoietic-restricted cells through a BCR-ABL kinase-dependent mechanism, thus providing a new molecular tool for elucidating mechanisms underlying lineage fate determination in human hematopoietic cells and infidelity in human leukemia.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Median patient age was 9 years (range, 0-19 years), and median follow-up 29 was months (range, 0-125 months). The median duration of first remission was 24 months (range, 0-109 months). Prognostic factors, including age, duration of first remission, HLA matching, and graft-versus-host (GVH) disease, were analyzed using both univariate and multivariate analyses. Overall survival was 38%, and LFS was 36% at 5 years. LFS was significantly worse for patients 15 years or older (log-rank, P =.009). HLA matching was associated with improved LFS. Acute GVH disease developed in 71%, with 29% having grades III-IV. The incidence of chronic GVH disease was 39% for patients who survived more than 80 days and was significantly higher for female patients receiving marrow from female donors (P =.0009). Transplantation-related mortality was 42% and was associated with HLA mismatches, age 15 years and older, and first remission less than 12 months. The 5-year estimate for relapse was 22%, with first remission at least 6 months associated with a lower risk. Results of unrelated donor BMT appear similar to multi-institutional studies of matched related donor BMT, and this approach appears to be curative for many patients.

We present here an analysis of a cohort of 30 patients with otherwise typical AA in whom clonal karyotypic evolution was observed during frequent periodic marrow examinations. The actuarial risk for this complication has been estimated in other studies at around 15% at 5 years. Conversion from normal to abnormal karyotype occurred at a constant rate after initial diagnosis, with about 50% of cases developing within the first 30 months. Transient chromosomal abnormalities were infrequent. Clinically, AA patients with clonal cytogenetic patterns were heterogenous; a variety of karyotypic defects with numerical and structural abnormalities of chromosome 7 accounted for 40% of all cases followed by trisomy 8, structural and numerical abnormalities of chromosome 13, deletion of Y chromosome, and complex cytogenetic abnormalities. Unlike in primary MDS, aberrancies of chromosome 5 and 20 were infrequent. The clinical course depended on the specific abnormal cytogenetic pattern. Most deaths related to leukemic transformation occurred in patients with abnormalities of chromosome 7 or complex cytogenetic alterations or both. Evolution of chromosome 7 abnormalities was seen most often in refractory patients who had failed to respond to therapy. In contrast, trisomy 8 developed in patients with good hematologic responses who often required chronic immunosuppression with cyclosporine A (CsA), and survival was excellent. Although AA patients with monosomy 7 showed a similar prognosis to those with primary MDS, trisomy 8 in AA appears to have a more favorable prognosis than in MDS.","['Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. maciejj@cc.ccf.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following this activation, a photoactive rhodamine derivative called 4,5-dibromorhodamine 123 (TH9402), was added. This compound is selectively retained in the mitochondria of activated host-reactive cells but not tumor- or third-party-specific resting cells.

By contrast, anti-BCL1 (BALB/c-origin leukemia/lymphoma) and anti-third-party C3H/HeJ (H-2(k)) responses were preserved. PDP-treated primed C57BL/6 cells were further tested in vivo. All lethally irradiated BALB/c mice inoculated with BCL1 cells and T-cell-depleted bone marrow cells developed leukemia by day +30, with 50% mortality by 100 days. All mice died of GVHD after addition of 5 x 10(6) untreated primed C57BL/6 cells. However, addition of same numbers of PDP-treated cells allowed 90% of the recipients to survive more than 100 days without detectable BCL1 tumor cells and free of GVHD. Moreover, PDP-treated primed C57BL/6 cells retained the ability to induce GVHD in the third-party C3H/HeJ mice.

Both activities were generally observed in those phorbol derivatives with an A/B trans configuration, but not in the isophorbol derivatives with an A/B cis configuration. Acetylation of 20-OH in the phorbol derivatives significantly reduced the inhibition of CPE, as shown in 12-O-, 20-O-diacetylphorbol 13-decanoate (6a) (IC100=15.6 microg/ml) vs. compound 6 (IC100=0.0076 microg/ml), and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13,20-diacetate (8a) (IC100=15.6 microg/ml) vs. 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (8) (IC100=0.00048 microg/ml), except in the case of 12-O-decanoylphorbol 13-(2-methylbutyrate) (4) and phorbol 12,13-diacetate (9c).

On the other hand, its positional isomer (12-O-acetylphorbol 13-tetradecanoate (8c) showed neither activities. The removal of a long acyl group in 8 led to a substantial loss of both activities, as shown in phorbol 13-acetate (9b). Of the 12-O-acetyl-13-O-acylphorbol derivatives, the highest inhibition of CPE was observed in 6, which has a dodecanoyl residue at C-13.

Eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) are classically defined by their cytoplasmic location and ability to regulate the initiation phase of protein synthesis. For instance, in the cytoplasm, the m7G cap-binding protein eIF4E plays a distinct role in cap-dependent translation initiation. Disruption of eIF4E's regulatory function drastically effects cell growth and may lead to oncogenic transformation. A growing number of studies indicate that many eIFs, including a substantial fraction of eIF4E, are found in the nucleus. Indeed, nuclear eIF4E participates in a variety of important RNA-processing events including the nucleocytoplasmic transport of specific, growth regulatory mRNAs. Although unexpected, it is possible that some eIFs regulate protein synthesis within the nucleus. This review will focus on the novel, nuclear functions of eIF4E and how they contribute to eIF4E's growth-activating and oncogenic properties. Both the cytoplasmic and nuclear functions of eIF4E appear to be dependent on its intrinsic ability to bind to the 5' m7G cap of mRNA. For example, Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein (PML) potentially acts as a negative regulator of nuclear eIF4E function by decreasing eIF4E's affinity for the m7G cap. Therefore, eIF4E protein is flexible enough to utilize a common biochemical activity, such as m7G cap binding, to participate in divergent processes in different cellular compartments.","['Structural Biology Program, Department of Physiology & Biophysics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York University, One Gustave Levy Place, New York, NY 10029, USA.']","['CA 80728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 88991/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,134,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In comparison with a control group frequency of progenitors is significantly increased in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Following different therapeutic modalities their quantity reflects therapeutic efficacy (responder and non-responder patients) and therefore exerts a predictive value regarding acceleration and blastic crisis. The significant correlations between fiber content and number of these precursors elucidates the complex interactions between stroma and progenitor cell differentiation and maturation. Following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation there is a rapid recovery of the CD34+ stem cell population in the first month. A higher number of these cells is related with graft size, an earlier independence for platelet transfusion and a more extended regeneration of erythro- and megakaryopoiesis. The slight increase in reticulin fibers in these patients may be associated with the complex and so far ill-defined pathomechanism of homing (adherence to the fibrous matrix). In idiopathic myelofibrosis (IMF) an increased number of CD34+ stem cells is found predominantly in the early (prefibrotic or mild fibrotic) hypercellular stages and probably indicates a higher proliferative activity of the precursor cell pool. According to sequential biopsies most patients with early IMF that later evolved into an overt fibrosclerotic stage usually display a reduction of progenitor cells during the development of myelofibrosis. The unequal distribution of CD34+ stem cells in the bone marrow versus spleen in IMF (advanced fibrosclerotic stage) is in support of the currently discussed hypothesis of splenic filtration and concentration of precursor cells as an essential feature of myeloid metaplasia. Regarding prognosis in CML a higher amount of CD34+ stem cells is significantly associated with an unfavorable survival and thus confirms the assumed implication of an accelerated phase of disease at onset. On the other hand, in polycythemia vera (PV) and IMF a low number of progenitors is probably due to a decreased proliferation rate (reduced hematopoietic turnover index) and therefore reflects a reduction in the regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis. For this reason, a presumptive defect in the recovery of normal and clonally transformed stem cells is speculated to add to the worsening of prognosis by causing the well-known bone marrow insufficiency in terminal stage PV and IMF.","['Institute of Pathology, University of Cologne, Germany. j.thiele@uni-koeln.de']",,,,,111,,,,,,,10.14670/HH-17.507 [doi],,,,,,

However, the rate at which DNA was damaged in intact human cells was 6-fold greater for the platinum phenanthridinium chloride complexes compared with cisplatin. These results are consistent with a DNA-targeting hypothesis where the attachment of an intercalating group to cisplatin places the platinum in close proximity to DNA and increases the rate of DNA platination.

Secondly, by exploitation of the COMPARE algorithm, a positive correlation has been established between the activity of certain members of this series and the existence of a mutation in the Ki-ras gene of non-small-cell lung and colon cancer cell lines.

Lactobacillus brevis (CD2) samples were more efficient in inducing apoptosis of Jurkat cells than were samples of Streptococcus thermophilus (S244).

No significant effects were observed on growth of the other cancer cell lines treated with the four individual limonoids at 100 micrograms/ml. At 100 micrograms/ml, the limonoid glucoside mixture demonstrated a partial inhibitory effect on SKOV-3 cancer cells. With use of flow cytometry, it was found that all the limonoid samples could induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells at relatively high concentrations (100 micrograms/ml). Considering the high concentration needed to induce apoptosis, it is unlikely that this is the primary mechanism of action for the cytotoxic effects seen with limonoids in this study.

The relatively small size of this fragment allows its insertion into a murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector in place of the viral promoter. Infection of a number of established human mammary and nonmammary cell lines with such a retroviral vector revealed that the WAP promoter was limited in its activity to mammary tumor cell lines. Expression in tumorigenic mammary cells was even more pronounced when these cells were introduced into the mammary fat pads of mice. This is the first demonstration that the WAP promoter is active in human mammary cells and mammary tumor cells in general, and suggests that the extended proximal WAP promoter may be useful for directing therapeutic gene expression to human mammary tumors.","['Institute of Virology, University of Veterinary Sciences, A-1210 Vienna, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical heterogeneity and inadequate understanding of the disease pathobiology have limited progress in the development of novel therapeutics. Preclinical investigations indicate that reciprocal interaction between the malignant clone and the microenvironment serve to create a hostile milieu that reinforces ineffective blood cell production. Ineffective hematopoiesis, the hallmark of MDS, arises from impaired progenitor responsiveness to normal trophic signals and excess local generation of inhibitory cytokines, which promote accelerated apoptotic loss of progenitors and their progeny. Evidence to support this model derives from cytokine neutralization studies and the direct relationship between plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha concentration and DNA oxidation and glutathione depletion in malignant CD34+ progenitors. Recent investigations indicate that angiogenic molecules generated by malignant myelomonocytic precursors represent integral diffusable signals that reinforce leukemia progenitor self-renewal while promoting the generation of proapoptotic cytokines and medullary angiogenic response. The potential for leukemia evolution is compounded by epigenetic events including methylation silencing of the p15 proto-oncogene or activating ras point mutations. Delineation of such biologic features that are central to the pathobiology of MDS provides a reliable framework for the development of novel therapeutics. Antiangiogenic agents in clinical testing include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors, thalidomide and related analogues, and the recombinant VEGF neutralizing antibody, bevacizumab. Agents whose actions may restore differentiation programs, such as the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors or histone deacetylase inhibitors, offer the prospect to promote effective hematopoiesis while impacting the potential for leukemia evolution. RAS farnesyl transferase inhibitors have shown encouraging preliminary results in acute myeloid leukemia and are currently under investigation in advanced MDS and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) interacts with a spectrum of biologic targets that may be uniquely suited to MDS. ATO is a potent inducer of apoptosis in thiol-depleted malignant progenitors and neovascular endothelium, while promoting differentiation through histone acetylation and inactivation of transcriptional corepressors. The identification of relevant biologic targets in MDS has raised expectations for the development of disease-specific therapies for MDS in the years that follow.","['Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85724, USA.

The chimeric bcr-abl gene codes for a tyrosine kinase that is constitutively activated in the leukemic cells and plays the central role in leukemogenesis. Hematologic malignancies, including Bcr-Abl-positive leukemias, also frequently have overactivity of the Ras signaling pathway, leading to abnormal transduction of growth and survival signals. New and investigational therapeutic options that target these specific molecular defects of leukemic cells include the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (STI571) and farnesyltransferase inhibitors (R115777, SCH66336), which block localization of Ras proteins to the cell membrane. While single-agent therapy with these new agents may produce hematologic and cytogenetic remissions in patients with Bcr-Abl-positive leukemias, molecular remissions are less common, and resistance may develop. Therefore, the development of a multifaceted therapeutic approach to these leukemias is of great interest.

The center sponsors the Schwartz Center Rounds, a monthly multidisciplinary forum where caregivers reflect on important psychosocial issues faced by patients, their families, and their caregivers, and gain insight and support from fellow staff members. Cancer in adolescents presents an extra dynamic of psychosocial complexity. The case of a 19-year-old woman with acute myelocytic leukemia is discussed. Her disease was refractory to allogeneic transplantation, and she died with severe graft-versus-host disease. Ms. P and her mother established very different relationships with the team which supported them through the transitions in her care, and Ms. P was able to die at home, with hospice care. The personal connection with the team enabled a degree of positive adjustment through the nightmare of loss. The epidemiology of cancer in adolescents and paradigms of care are reviewed. Psychosocial aspects of adolescence, opportunities for personal growth and support, and the challenge of end-of-life care are discussed.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology-Oncology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. rpenson@partners.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether infusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells that had been transduced in vitro with the gamma(c) gene can restore the immune system in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency. METHODS: CD34+ bone marrow cells from five boys with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency were transduced ex vivo with the use of a defective retroviral vector. Integration and expression of the gamma(c) transgene and development of lymphocyte subgroups and their functions were sequentially analyzed over a period of up to 2.5 years after gene transfer. RESULTS: No adverse effects resulted from the procedure. Transduced T cells and natural killer cells appeared in the blood of four of the five patients within four months. The numbers and phenotypes of T cells, the repertoire of T-cell receptors, and the in vitro proliferative responses of T cells to several antigens after immunization were nearly normal up to two years after treatment. Thymopoiesis was documented by the presence of naive T cells and T-cell antigen-receptor episomes and the development of a normal-sized thymus gland. The frequency of transduced B cells was low, but serum immunoglobulin levels and antibody production after immunization were sufficient to avoid the need for intravenous immunoglobulin. Correction of the immunodeficiency eradicated established infections and allowed patients to have a normal life. CONCLUSIONS: Ex vivo gene therapy with gamma(c) can safely correct the immune deficiency of patients with X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency.","['Laboratoire INSERM, Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, Paris, France.']",,"['N Engl J Med. 2002 Apr 18;346(16):1241-3.

Coadministration of bryostatin 1 with ara-C resulted in enhanced cytosolic release of cytochrome c and Smac/DIABLO, procaspase-3 and -9 activation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)), poly(ADP-ribosyl)phosphorylase degradation, apoptosis, and loss of clonogenic survival in U937/Bcl-x(L) cells, although effects were not as marked as in empty-vector control cells. Whereas the broad caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fluoromethyl ketone blocked ara-C/bryostatin 1-mediated caspase activation, loss of Deltapsi(m, )and apoptosis in U937 cells, it failed to diminish cytochrome c release. In contrast, ectopic expression of Bcl-x(L) blocked cytochrome c redistribution as well as all other events involved in ara-C/bryostatin 1-mediated apoptosis. The ability of ectopic expression of cytokine response modifier A to attenuate, albeit partially, bryostatin 1-mediated potentiation of ara-C-related apoptosis suggested a contributory role for activation of the extrinsic pathway in this phenomenon. Finally, the F(0)F(1) ATPase inhibitor oligomycin effectively blocked cytochrome c release as well as loss of Deltapsi(m) and apoptosis in U937/Bcl-x(L) cells. Together, these findings support the concept that bryostatin 1 potentiates ara-C lethality in human leukemia cells ectopically expressing Bcl-x(L) by diminishing the capacity of this antiapoptotic protein to antagonize cytochrome c release. In addition, they raise the possibility that activation of caspase cascades operating independently of Bcl-x(L)-associated mitochondrial actions may also contribute to enhanced lethality.","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia 23298, USA.']","['CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA83705/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When brassica plant tissue is broken, GLs are hydrolyzed by the endogenous enzyme myrosinase (Myr), releasing many products including isothiocyanates (ITC). Synthetic ITCs like sulforaphane exert chemopreventive effects against chemically induced tumors in animals, modulating enzymes required for carcinogens' activation/detoxification and/or the induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cell lines. To investigate the chemopreventive potential of ITCs while reproducing the circumstances of dietary contact with sulforaphane, we studied proliferation, apoptosis induction and p53, bcl-2 and bax protein expression in Jurkat T-leukemia cells by sulforaphane, the ITC generated in situ in a quantitative manner by Myr starting from glucoraphanin (GRA). Jurkat cells were treated with different doses of GRA-Myr mixture. Effects on cell growth or survival were evaluated by counting trypan blue-excluding cells. Cell-cycle progression, apoptosis and expression of p53, bax and bcl-2 proteins were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results were analyzed by two-sided Fisher's exact test. Sulforaphane, but not GRA, caused G(2)/M-phase arrest (P = 0.028) and increase of apoptotic cell fraction (P < 0.0001) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Necrosis was observed after prolonged exposure to elevated sulforaphane doses. Moreover, it markedly increased p53 and bax protein expression, and slightly affected bcl-2 expression. These findings indicate that sulforaphane but not the native GL GRA can exert both protective and toxic effects inhibiting leukemic cell growth. Sulforaphane therefore deserves study as a potential chemopreventive/chemotherapeutic antileukemic agent.","['Dipartimento di Farmacologia, Universita di Bologna, via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

NNAT maps to 20q11.2-q12, a region exhibiting loss of heterozygosity in acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative disease. To investigate possible epigenetic dysregulation of genes in this region relevant to leukemogenesis, we analyzed methylation of the NNAT gene in normal tissues and in leukemias. We found a differential methylation pattern, typical of imprinted genes, at sites in the CpG island containing NNAT exon 1 in normal pituitary, peripheral blood cells and bone marrow-derived CD34-positive hematopoietic progenitor cells. Substantial or complete loss of the unmethylated NNAT allele was observed in leukemia cell lines and in 20 of 29 (69%) acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia samples. While most highly expressed in brain, NNAT mRNA was also detected in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells and in leukemia cells exhibiting the normal methylation pattern, although not in hypermethylated leukemia cells. Demethylation by treatment of hypermethylated leukemia cells with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine resulted in reactivation of NNAT expression, concomitant with a reversion to the normal methylation pattern. The data demonstrate that hypermethylation of the NNAT locus is a frequent event in both myeloid and lymphoid acute leukemias of childhood. Aberrant hypermethylation of the NNAT locus suggests that the dysregulation of genes at 20q11.2-q12 in leukemia may be the result of epigenetic as well as genetic events.","['Department of Pediatrics and Department of Genetics, Case Western Reserve University and Ireland Cancer Center, Cleveland, OH 44109, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we first investigated the effects of epolactaene on a human leukemia B-cell line, BALL-1 cells, and clarified that epolactaene induces apoptosis in BALL-1 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, we focused on the side chain structure of epolactaene, and chemically synthesized epolactaene derivatives. One derivative, which has a straight long alkyl chain as its side chain, induced apoptosis more effectively than epolactaene. On the other hand, other derivatives with a short alkyl side chain had weaker apoptosis-inducing actions. A good correlation was found between the apoptosis-inducing action of these compounds and their octanol/water partition coefficients (log P). These results suggested that the apoptosis-inducing activities of epolactaene and its derivatives were related to the hydrophobicity of these compounds; so that side chain structure of epolactaene is very important for its apoptosis-inducing activities.

Rapid responses studied in our laboratories include opening of voltage-gated calcium and chloride channels in ROS 17/2.8 osteoblast cells, activation of MAP-kinase in human leukemia NB4 cells and chick intestinal cells, release of insulin by rat pancreatic beta-cells, and in chick duodena transcaltachia (the rapid hormonal stimulation of intestinal Ca(2+) transport). 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) is conformationally flexible (side chain, seco B-ring and A-ring) and accordingly is able to generate a large array of different shapes to serve as ligands for available receptors (VDR(nuc) and VDR(mem)) in the vitamin D endocrine system. Our laboratories have utilized a number of conformationally restricted analogs of 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) (from a library of several hundred analogs) to evaluate the preferred shape of the ligands for rapid and genomic responses. The determination of the X-ray structure of the 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)-occupied VDR(nuc) revealed that the preferred ligand shape was a twisted 6-s-trans bowl shape [Molecular Cell 5 (2000) 173-179]. Optimal agonists for genomic responses include 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) and other side chain conformationally flexible analogs such as 20-epi-1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) [approximately equal to 200-500-fold more potent than 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)] and 21-(3'-hydroxy-3-methylbutyl)-1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) [an analog with two side chains] all which can achieve the preferred VDR(nuc) shape. In contrast, rapid responses require a 6-s-cis shape of the agonist ligand such as can be achieved by the natural hormone 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) or by analogs permanently locked in the 6-s-cis shape such as 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)lumisterol(3) or 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)-7-dehydrocholesterol. Additionally, we have discovered analogs that are specific in their antagonist properties for either rapid or genomic responses. Thus, 1 beta,25(OH)(2)D(3) is an antagonist of only rapid responses [via the VDR(mem)], while 23S-25-dehydro-1 alpha,25(OH)D(3)-26,23-lactone is an antagonist of only nuclear responses [via the VDR(nuc)]. In conclusion, we have presented evidence that 1 alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) mediated rapid response and genomic response signal transduction pathways utilize differing shapes of ligand, both as agonists and antagonists.","['Department of Biochemistry, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA.

Loading of cells with ascorbic acid before exposure to H(2)O(2) resulted in a dose-dependent protective effect against: intracellular accumulation of peroxides, DeltaPsi(m) alteration, cytochrome c denaturation and release. The accumulation of peroxides induced processings and activations of procaspase-8, -9 and -3. Double staining with antiserum which recognizes the p18 subunit of cleaved caspase-3 and with Hoechst had shown that a high percentage of cells exposed to 100 microM H(2)O(2) stained positively with the antibody and showed features of apoptosis.

It is postulated that BCNU kills cells by forming DNA interstrand cross-links. The present study was undertaken to characterize the PK and PD of BCNU in mouse L1210 cells. L1210 cells were exposed to BCNU (0-160 microM) and analyzed for intracellular BCNU concentrations, DNA interstrand cross-links, cell cycle phase, and cytotoxicity. The half-life of BCNU in cells was approximately 40 min. The maximum reduction of mitochondrial enzyme activity (maximum cell death) achieved within 24 hr after exposure to BCNU was concentration-dependent and could be described by a Hill equation. At lower concentrations, the area under the DNA interstrand cross-link-time curve linearly correlated with the maximum cell death and the area under the BCNU concentration-time curve. BCNU induced cell accumulation in the G(2)/M phase of the cell cycle, which continued even after apparent completion of cross-link repair. Loss of membrane permeability was minimal (approximately 2%) during the first 24 hr. Thereafter, cells died exponentially over the next 9 days, primarily by necrosis. In conclusion, while cytotoxicity was concentration-dependent, an indirect relationship was found among the time-course of BCNU concentrations, DNA interstrand cross-links, and cell death. Because of the disparity between the time-scale of PK and PD, focusing only on the early events may provide limited information about the process of anticancer drug-induced cell death.","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Nebraska Medical Center, 600 South 42nd Street, P.O.

Cell density is a potent negative regulator of cell cycle time during exponential growth. Here, we asked whether SV40 large T antigen (Tag) levels, driven by two different promoters, changed in a predictable and regular manner during exponential growth in clonal astrocyte cell lines, immortalized and dependent on Tag. RESULTS: Expression and cell cycle phase fractions were measured and correlated using flow cytometry. T antigen levels did not change or increased during exponential growth as a function of the G1 fraction and increasing cell density when Tag was transcribed from the Moloney Murine Leukemia virus (MoMuLV) long terminal repeat (LTR). When an Rb-binding mutant T antigen transcribed from the LTR was tested, levels decreased. When transcribed from the herpes thymidine kinase promoter, Tag levels decreased. The directions of change and the rates of change in Tag expression were unrelated to the average T antigen levels (i.e., the expression potential). CONCLUSIONS: These data show that Tag expression potential in these lines varies depending on the vector and clonal variation, but that the observed level depends on cell density and cell cycle transit time. The hypothetical terms, expression at zero cell density and expression at minimum G1 phase fraction, were introduced to simplify measures of expression potential.","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 4106-4944, USA. jwj@po.cwru.edu']","['P30 CA043703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA073413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA-43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA-73413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC111187,20020417,,,,,,,,,,

These results have encouraged studies of treatment with ATRA in other acute myeloid leukemia subtypes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to evaluate toxicity and antileukemic efficacy of all ATRA in patients with relapsed or refractory non promyelocytic AML, 95 patients (median age, 58 years; range, 20 to 80 years), with unclassified AML according to the FAB classification or secondary AML at diagnosis, or refractory or relapsing AML, received induction therapy with Idarubicin, 10 mg/m(2)/day, for 3 days and cytarabine, 1000 mg/m(2)/12 h, for 6 days, alone or combined, on a randomized basis, with ATRA, 45 mg/m(2)/day, from day 1 to complete remission. Patients in CR received maintenance therapy with 6 monthly courses combining Ida, 10 mg/m(2)/day, intravenously, on day 1 with Ara-C100 mg/m(2)/day, subcutaneously, from day 1 to day 5. RESULTS: Results were evaluated after one induction course. Overall 54 patients (57%, 26 with ATRA and 28 without ATRA) achieved CR including five patients treated at time of initial diagnosis, seven previously resistant, 38 in first relapse and four in further relapse. Thirty patients (31%) had resistant disease and 11 (12%) died from toxicity. Median time for neutrophil recovery to 0.5 x 10(9)/l and platelets to 20 x 10(9)/l was 31 and 21 days respectively. Severe toxicity (WHO grade >or=3) included infections (37%), diarrhea (9%), bleeding (3%), vomiting (16%), hyperbilirubinemia (5%), mucositis (6%) and hypercreatininemia (2%). No ATRA syndrome was noted in the ATRA arm. Median overall survival for the entire cohort was 6.3 months and median disease-free survival was 4.7 months. There were no statistical differences in terms of CR, DFS, and OS between the two arms. CONCLUSION: We conclude that ATRA in combination with Ida and Ara-C can be administered safely to high-risk AML patients. However, in this setting, ATRA did not offer any advantage when compared to chemotherapy alone.","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pathogenesis of associated T-LGLL and autoimmune abnormalities is not clear. In this study we have investigated the role of cytokines in the development of immune complications in LGLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied clinical and laboratory features of 15 patients diagnosed with T-LGLL. The patients had various autoimmune disturbances: persistent neutropenia, immune thrombocytopenia, pure red-cell aplasia, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, sicca syndrome, systemic lupus erythemathosus, systemic scleroderma. The T-LGLL cells obtained from these patients were activated by phytohemagglutinin and incubated for 3 days. Using ELISA technique we analysed the release of sIL-2R, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF-alpha in the supernatant. RESULTS: Cytokine analysis of supernatants obtained from the LGLL T cells stimulated with PHA revealed increased sIL-2R production in 40% (six patients), TNF-alpha - in 47% (seven patients), IL-6 - in 67% (10 patients), IL-10 - in 47% (seven) and IL-8 - in 60% (nine) of patients. Levels of IL-4 and IL-12 were not elevated compared to controls. No correlation was found between LGL count, CD4 versus CD8 expansion, or in the clinical findings of the patients and cytokine release in vitro. CONCLUSION: Our findings showing the potential of LGLL cells for cytokine release in vitro suggests that these cells may play a major role in the immune disturbances observed in large granular lymphocytic leukemia accompanied by autoimmunity features.","['Hematology Institute, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Breakpoints are mainly located in the 3q21 and 3q26 regions but may occur elsewhere on chromosome 3. To determine the relationship between these breakpoints and the hematological parameters, including outcome of these patients, we analysed data from newly diagnosed adult AML patients with 3q rearrangements referred to our institution over a 15-year period. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted using data from 57 AML patients (median age: 64 years, range 19-82) with 3q rearrangements. Cytogenetic analysis was performed using standard techniques (RHG banding, FISH). Data concerning AML patients with 3q abnormalities were compared for outcome with those from patients with normal karyotype and from patients with 5q deletion, treated according to the same intensive protocols for the same time period. RESULTS: Patients with myeloid malignancy displaying 3q rearrangement were assigned to five subgroups, including those with: 3q21/q26 rearrangement; 3q21 alone, including t(1;3)(p36;q21); 3q26 alone, resulting in translocations involving multiple chromosome partners; t(3;5); 3q deletions. Among these patients, 37 were treated in AML chemotherapy trials. Complete remission was achieved in 43% (26/57) of cases. Five patients died early. Sixteen patients were resistant to induction chemotherapy. Median DFS and median OS were 4.5 and 8.8 months respectively. Relapse was observed in 34% of patients achieving CR. Comparison of the outcome of CR patients with that of patients presenting with normal karyotype (intermediate-risk) or complete/partial 5q deletion (high-risk) confirmed the very poor prognosis of patients carrying 3q chromosomal rearrangements. CONCLUSION: These data confirm that 3q rearrangements at q21 or q26 are recurring chromosomal abnormalities in AML. Appearing frequently in combination with monosomy 7 and an abnormal megakaryopoiesis, patients with these abnormalities have a particularly poor prognosis.","[""Laboratoire Central d'Hematologie et de Cytogenetique, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France. christiane.charrin@chu-lyon.fr""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the majority of cases (approximately 25%), this concerns a submicroscopic deletion of approximately 90 kb in chromosome region 1p32, which deletes the coding regions of the SIL gene and the untranslated region of the TAL1 gene, thereby placing the TAL1 gene under control of the SIL promoter region. Translocation (1;14)(p32;q11) involving the TAL1 gene occurs at a much lower frequency (3%), whereas some other rare variant translocations have been described as well. In this study we developed a set of TAL1 FISH probes based on the split-signal FISH principle that enables detection of both types of TAL1 gene aberrations in single test. For this purpose, one probe was designed downstream of the TAL1 gene (TAL1-D) and the second probe in the region upstream of the TAL1 gene, partly covering the SIL gene (SIL-U). We show that this split-signal FISH probe set allows reliable detection of the unaffected SIL-TAL1 gene region with a fusion signal, SIL-TAL1 fusion genes with loss of the SIL-U signal, and TAL1 gene translocations with a split-signal, independent of the involved partner gene.","['Dept of Immunology, Erasmus University Rotterdam/University Hospital Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), survivin expression by tumor cells has been recently described as a poor prognostic marker. We assessed the relationship between survivin gene up-regulation and several other factors involved in either cell cycle or apoptosis control. The expression of 34 genes from 27 cases of DLBCL with typical IPI factor-related poor prognostic outcome was analyzed by RNase protection assay. Using non-neoplastic tissues and low grade lymphomas as control, survivin expression was high in 80% of the cases without significant relation to patient overall survival (P = 0.64). However, the expression of several genes encoding for cell cycle inhibitors, cyclins, Bcl-2 or IAP family factors was significantly associated with the survivin up-regulation. Gene expression profiling showed that both survivin and cyclin B expression can define two subgroups of DLBCL: the previously described germinal center-like and activated B-like lymphomas, determined by protein expression analysis. We also identified a preferential survivin-cyclin B relationship (P = 0.017), suggesting that cyclin B over-expression, when linked to survivin over-expression in aggressive forms of lymphoma, might demonstrate a specific G2/M transition promotion.","[""Institut d'Etude et de Transfert de Genes (IETG), Centre Hospitalier Regional et Universitaire, Hopital Jean Minjoz, Besancon, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A population-based study describing ALL incidence during socioeconomic transition has been lacking. Central European post-communist countries (with very low foreign migration and centralized statistics) offer reliable data for the period before and during major socioeconomic changes. Population-based data on Czech ALL patients younger than 18 years were taken from two independent Czech national registries partially overlapping in time (1980-1998, n = 1236 and 1991-1999, n = 570). During the 1980s and 1990s, ALL incidence among children 1-4 years increased 1.5 times (P = 0.01). This increase was more prominent in females than in males (slopes 0.13 and 0.09, P values 0.03 and >0.05, respectively). No significant change was observed in other age groups (0, 5-9, 10-14, 15-17 years or all others combined). We discuss possible underlying socioeconomic factors including infant care and breast-feeding, hygiene, birth order, industry and pollution. Moreover, we try to pinpoint the immunophenotypic/molecular-genetic subsets of ALL that might be socioeconomically affected.

In the present work, we analyzed the effects of exogenous NO on the proliferation of BCR-ABL(+) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cells. As normal leukocytes, the proliferation of leukemia cells was inhibited by SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetyl-penicillamine), GEA (Oxatriazolium amino-chloride), and SIN-1 (Morpholino-sydnonimine), whereas SNP (sodium nitroprusside) had no effect on leukemia cell growth. SIN-1 induced higher anti-proliferation activity in BCR-ABL(+) cells, compared to normal hemopoietic cells. Inhibition of leukemia cell proliferation correlated with increased apoptosis and DEVDase activity. The simultaneous addition of exogenous iron reversed NO-mediated inhibition of cell growth, caspase activation and apoptosis in all BCR-ABL(+) cells tested. The quantification of intracellular iron levels in leukemia cells indicated that NO induced an early, dose-dependent decrease in ferric iron levels. Accordingly, elevation of intracellular iron protected leukemia cells from NO-mediated apoptosis. Together, the present work reveals the presence of an iron-dependant mechanism for leukemia cell rescue from NO-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis.","['Bone Marrow Transplantation, CNRS UMR5540 and EA482, Bordeaux-2 University, Bordeaux, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have compared the sensitivity of various T and B cell lines to death receptor or staurosporine-induced apoptosis. First, we found a lack of correlation between death receptor expression and sensitivity to Fas or Trail. By contrast, a correlation between caspase activation, DNA fragmentation and cell death in T cell lines was evidenced. Among T cells, CEM underwent apoptosis in response to CH11 but were resistant to Trail in agreement with the absence of Trail receptors (DR4 and DR5) on their surface. The B cell line SKW 6.4 was sensitive to CH11 and staurosporine but resistant to Trail. As B cell lines expressed significant levels of DR4 and DR5, resistance to Trail in SKW 6.4 is likely due to the expression of the decoy receptor DcR1. Burkitt's lymphoma such as RPMI 8866 and Raji did not exhibit DNA fragmentation in response to CH11, Trail or staurosporine but showed long-term caspase-dependent loss of viability upon effector treatment. The B cell lines used in this study express very weak or undetectable levels of DFF40 and relatively high levels of DFF45. Interestingly, cytosolic extracts from RPMI 88.66 but not other B lymphoma exhibit altered levels of cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation. Taken together, our results show that: (1) death receptor expression does not correlate with sensitivity to apoptosis; (2) the very low ratio of DFF40 vs. DFF45 is unlikely to explain by itself the lack of DNA fragmentation observed in certain B cell lines; and (3) a defective cytochrome c-dependent caspase activation might account at least in part for the insensitivity of certain Burkitt's lymphoma (RPMI 88.66) to apoptosis. Thus it seems that resistance of Burkitt's lymphoma to apoptosis is not governed by a general mechanism, but is rather multifactorial and differs from one cell line to another.","['INSERM U 526, Activation des cellules Hematopoietiques, Equipe labellisee par la Ligue Nationale contre le Cancer, IFR 50, Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible anti-tumour mechanisms involve complement-mediated lysis and/or antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Because G-CSF greatly enhances the cytotoxicity of neutrophils (PMN) in ADCC, the clinical efficacy of rituximab might be enhanced by the addition of G-CSF. Therefore, we investigated the neutrophil-mediated CD20-dependent cellular cytotoxicity in B cell lines. In contrast to previous studies by others, we found that G-CSF-primed PMN are capable of functioning as effector cells in CD20-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. However, HLA class II mAbs were far more effective. The differences between HLA class II- and CD20-mediated PMN-ADCC were not due to: (1) the use of chimeric (hIgG1) mAbs vs mIgG2a mAbs; (2) HLA class II-induced apoptosis as an 'ADCC-sensitising' mechanism; (3) CD20-induced inhibition of ADCC; (4) inferior membrane mobility of CD20. Analysis of Fcgammareceptor (FcgammaR) involvement showed that although CD20-induced ADCC was mediated mainly via FcgammaRI, for optimal lysis FcgammaRI and FcgammaRII were both required. In contrast, in HLA class II-dependent ADCC both FcgammaRI and II were capable of independently inducing maximum lysis. The mechanism underlying these differences in FcgammaR-binding and activation remains to be elucidated.","['Department of Haematology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kinases MEK-1, MEK-2, ERK-1/MAPK and ERK-2/MAPK are activated by phosphorylation at specific sites, and these events can be monitored using phospho-specific antibodies. In this report we examined the importance of the MEK/ERK/MAP kinase pathway in the monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of myeloid cell lines. Induction of monocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) led to rapid and sustained activation of MEK-1/-2, ERK-1/MAPK and ERK-2/MAPK, while induction of granulocytic differentiation by retinoic acid (RA) caused similar activation of MEK-1/-2 and ERK-2/MAPK, but not ERK-1/MAPK. The total levels of these kinases were not affected during the course of differentiation along either pathway. Pretreatment of cells with 5 microM of the MEK-1/-2-specific inhibitor U0126 abrogated PMA- or RA-induced activation of ERK-1/MAPK and ERK-2/MAPK. Importantly, pretreatment of HL-60 cells with U0126 was found to potently inhibit both monocytic and granulocytic differentiation, as assessed by cytochemical staining for non-specific esterase or nitroblue tetrazolium reduction, flow cytometric analysis of myeloid surface markers, and immunoblotting for the cell cycle inhibitor p21 WAF1/Cip1. Similar results were seen in U937 cells, where U0126 inhibited PMA-induced monocytic differentiation, and in 32D cells, where G-CSF-induced granulocytic differentiation was inhibited by U0126 pretreatment. Additional experiments revealed that inhibition of MEK-1/-2 in HL-60 cells resulted in nearly complete inhibition of differentiation-induced cell death during monocytic differentiation. By contrast, U0126 only partially inhibited cell death resulting from granulocytic differentiation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that the MEK/ERK/MAP kinase signaling pathway is activated, and plays a critical role, during both monocytic and granulocytic differentiation of myeloid cell lines.","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213-2582, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A reduction of STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation after TGF-beta1 pretreatment was observed in four out of 40 AML cases (10%), although all of the AML cases responded to TGF-beta1 by means of SMAD3 translocation. The reduced IL-6-mediated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation after pre-treatment with TGF-beta1 was associated with apoptosis and coincided with the degradation of certain cellular proteins, including JAK1 and -2 and Tyk2, without affecting the ERK expression and phosphorylation. Furthermore, treatment of AML blasts with the cytostatic agent VP16, as an alternative way to induce apoptosis, resulted in a similar degree of degradation of JAK kinases and concomitant reduction of IL-6-mediated STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Although degradation of JAK kinases could be rescued by incubating the cells with the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, the attenuating effect of TGF-beta1 treatment on the STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation was still partly present. It was shown that in AML cells cultured in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk, TGF-beta1 pretreatment resulted in a reduction of JAK1 phosphorylation upon IL-6 stimulation. Expression of SOCS1 and -3 could be ruled out as a possible cause of reduced JAK1 phosphorylation levels in the investigated AML case.","['University Hospital Groningen, Dept of Hematology, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The TEL-AML1 fusion was observed in six patients both by RT-PCR and FISH analyses, with a frequency of 22.2% among the B-lineage group, whereas TEL deletion was seen by FISH analysis in seven patients (17.1%). By FISH analysis, nine patients (22%) showed evidence of extra AML1 copies. In five of these patients the extra copies were due to non-constitutional trisomy 21, whereas in the remaining four cases they were due to tandem AML1 copies on der(21), as evidenced by metaphase FISH. Unexpectedly however, enhanced AML1 expression levels were seen by real-time quantitative RT-PCR in 18 out of the 41 ALL patients (43.9%). This high level of AML1 expression could be an important factor contributing to the pathogenesis and progression of childhood ALL. One key mechanism for over-expression seems to be the extra copies of AML1, but other mechanisms may involve an alteration of the activity of the AML1 promoter. Here, we also report two novel findings. The first is an intragenic deletion of TEL exon 7 in a case of T cell ALL. This deletion creates a frame-shift and results in a truncated protein lacking the C-terminus that includes the ETS domain. This shorter TEL is presumably unable to bind DNA. The second finding is a rearrangement of AML1 in a case of T cell ALL due to t(4;21)(q31;q22).

Therefore, we analyzed migration across Transwell filters of cells derived from bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood (PB) from 26 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. The presence of the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (FN) strongly enhanced the spontaneous and SDF-1-induced migration of leukemic PB and BM cells. No differences in spontaneous, SDF-1-induced migration or CXCR-4 expression were observed between the different AML subtypes. Subsequently, it was determined whether SDF-1 preferentially promoted migration of subsets of leukemic cells. Leukemic cells expressing CD34, CD38 and HLA-DR were preferentially migrating, whereas cells expressing CD14 and CD36 showed diminished migration. Analysis of paired PB and BM samples indicated that significantly higher SDF-1-induced migration was observed in AML for CD34(+) BM-derived cells compared to CD34(+) PB-derived cells, suggesting a role for SDF-1 in the anchoring of leukemic cells in the BM or other organs. The lower percentage of circulating leukemic blasts in patients with a relatively high level of SDF-1-induced migration also supports this hypothesis. In conclusion, we have shown that primary AML cells are migrating towards SDF-1 independent of the AML subtypes.","['Division of Medical Oncology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We provide evidence that for this alternative IgV(H) mRNA processing a known cryptic 5' splice donor site and a previously unidentified cryptic 3' splice acceptor site were used. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that the cryptic 3' splice acceptor site had been activated by specific somatic point mutations. The B-CLL further harbored a triplication of the rearranged JH3 gene segment including the putative N region and part of the JH3-JH4 intron sequence. This triplication probably took place via a repeated mechanism of DNA double strand break followed by homologous recombination, a mechanism which was recently proposed also involved in the somatic hypermutation process and is compatible with the post-germinal center derivation of this B-CLL. Finally, in a V4-34 expressing diffuse large B cell lymphoma, we observed alternative IgV(H) mRNA processing using the same cryptic 5' splice donor site and the normal splice acceptor site of the CH1-C(mu) exon. The significance of alternative IgV(H) processing in B cell malignancies and as a potential mechanism of somatic Ig diversification is discussed.","['Department of Pathology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sodium salicylate (SA), a plant stress hormone, can suppress the proliferation or cause apoptosis in certain mammalian cancer cells. Plant stress hormones are activators of cellular responses, including cell death, to diverse stress situations in plants. Thus, we hypothesized that plant stress hormones share the ability to adversely affect cancer cells. We found that the plant stress hormone SA suppressed proliferation of lymphoblastic leukemia, prostate, breast and melanoma human cancer cells. Jasmonic acid (JA), a plant stress hormone belonging to the Jasmonate family, induced death in lymphoblastic leukemia cells and caused suppression of cell proliferation in the other human cancer cells mentioned above. Another member of the Jasmonate family, methyl jasmonate (MJ), induced death in each of the cell lines. Plant stress hormones did not affect normal human lymphocytes, in contrast to their strong effect on lymphoblastic leukemia cells. JA and MJ caused apoptotic death, as determined by characteristic nuclear morphology, flow cytometric DNA profile and elevation of caspase-3 activity. Finally, mice bearing EL-4 lymphoma and treated with MJ, survived for significantly (P = 0.00953) longer periods of time than untreated mice.

Thirty-nine children received a CHOP-based induction, etoposide/ifosfamide consolidation, DECAL (dexamethasone, etoposide, cisplatin, cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and L-asparaginase) intensification, and either one or two similar but less intense maintenance courses.

All other patients were considered to be standard risk. Results were compared with the previous CCG NHL study (CCG-503). Sixteen and 23 patients were considered standard- vs. high-risk, respectively.

We have conducted a prospective study in patients with MCL to evaluate a therapeutic strategy in which CHOP polychemotherapy was followed by DHAP if CHOP failed to induce complete remission. Responding patients then proceeded to an intensification therapy with autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (APBSCT). Twenty-eight consecutive patients with newly diagnosed aggressive MCL were included. After four cycles of CHOP regimen, two complete responses (CR) were obtained (7%) and 14 (50%), five (18%) and seven (25%) patients achieved partial (PR), minor (MR) and no response, respectively (one patient died from septic complications during CHOP induction). The two patients in CR after CHOP underwent intensification with TBI, high-dose cyclophosphamide-etoposide and APBSCT. The other twenty-five patients received DHAP and in this group a response rate of 92% (21 CR (84%), two PR (8%)) was observed. Two patients had progressive disease. The twenty-three responding patients received high-dose therapy (TAM8 regimen: TBI-cytarabine-melphalan) followed by APBSCT. One of the two partial responding patients achieved CR after TAM8. After a median follow-up of 47.6 months (range, 14-70), seven patients have relapsed. Our data confirm that: (1) CHOP regimen induces a low CR rate in MCL; (2) CHOP plus DHAP appears to be much more efficient and allows a large proportion of patients to proceed to high-dose therapy in CR; (3) consolidation therapy including TBI and high-dose Arac-C followed by APBSCT may improve event-free survival.","[""Service d'Hematologie Adultes, Hopital Necker, Paris, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The median age of the patients was 62 years. All patients received blood progenitor cells from an HLA-identical sibling with 8.8 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg (median; range 4.7 to 26.2 x 10(6)/kg) and 5.5 x 10(8) CD3(+)cells/kg (median; range 4.5 to 7.9 x 10(8)/kg).

The median duration of white blood cell counts <1 x 10(9)/l was 17 days and of platelet counts <50 x 10(9)/l 20 days. In two patients acute GVHD grade I occurred. Nine of 10 patients analyzed developed mixed chimerism. Of seven patients transplanted in CR, three remained in CR 19 to 31 months after transplantation. Three patients with refractory leukemia did not achieve CR, while the patient with relapsed AML achieved a 3rd CR. After a median follow-up time of 22 months, chronic GVHD was mild and limited. The data from this pilot study in elderly patients with leukemia show that the combination of primarily immunosuppressive (FC) and antileukemic (IE) drugs for nonmyeloablative conditioning has moderate nonhematological toxicity and allows engraftment of allogeneic blood progenitor cells.","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Ulm, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lentiviral vectors may be particularly promising gene delivery tools for hematopoietic stem cells since these target cells tend to be quiescent and are therefore difficult target cells for vectors that require dividing targets. Human hematopoietic stem cells that can repopulate NOD/SCID mice have been efficiently transduced using HIV-1-based lentiviral vectors and similar vectors can also transduce murine hematopoietic stem cells. HIV-1 vectors that contain strong general promoters can generate high levels of transgene expression and very high expression levels can be generated in erythroid cells in vivo using beta-globin regulatory sequences to control the expression of the transgene.

Indeed, specific translocations are often associated with disease subtypes that manifest themselves through the accumulation of immature myeloid cells at varying stages of differentiation. Moreover, the differentiation state of myeloid blast populations has been utilized as a means of categorizing different AML subtypes (French, American, British, or FAB classification system). Thus, the notion that AML is a family of related but distinct diseases is a common view. Interestingly, however, studies in recent years that have formalized the concept of a leukemic stem cell (LSC) have also begun to define shared developmental, cellular and molecular features amongst the malignant stem cells that give rise to different AML subtypes. Moreover, some of these conserved features appear to be unique to the leukemia stem/progenitor cell population, and are not found in normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This article will summarize data emerging from the study of LSCs and suggest how distinct molecular and cellular characteristics of the LSC population may provide new opportunities for AML therapy.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Markey Cancer Center, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY 40536, USA.']",,,,,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In chronic phase, the leukemic clone appears to be maintained by a small number of BCR-ABL-positive hematopoietic stem cells that differentiate normally and amplify slowly. In contrast, as these cells enter the intermediate stages of lineage restriction, their progeny are selectively expanded and generate an enlarged pool of neoplastic progenitors. Recent analyses of purified subsets of primitive CML cells have provided a coherent explanation for this dichotomous behavior of BCR-ABL-positive stem and progenitor cells based on the discovery of an unusual autocrine IL-3/G-CSF mechanism activated in them. This only partially counteracts in vivosignals that maintain normal stem cells in a quiescent state but, when active in CML stem cells, promotes their differentiation in favor of their self-renewal. In more differentiated CML progenitors, the same mechanism has a more potent mitogenic effect which is then extinguished when the cells enter the terminal stages of differentiation. Thus, further expansion of the clone is limited until inevitably additional mutations are acquired that further distort or override the regulatory mechanisms still operative in the chronic phase.","['Departments of Medicine and Hematology, Glasgow Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, UK.']",,,,,97,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The presumed mechanisms underlying these differentiative pathways are gene restrictions, such as methylation and heterochromatin formation, which are commonly described as irreversible. However, recent discoveries regarding multi-organ stem cells demonstrate that 'true plasticity' exists, with cells of one organ turning into cells of other organs, including differentiative transformations that cross barriers between tissues derived from different primitive germ layers. These findings, along with earlier experiments into heterokaryon formation and longstanding recognition of reactive and neoplastic lesions in humans and animals, suggest that lineage pathways are not, in fact, unidirectional. Moreover, physiologic mechanisms of reversal of gene restrictions have been recognized. Therefore, in response to these observations, we suggest a new paradigm of cell plasticity, elucidating three guiding principles of 'genomic completeness', 'uncertainty of cell characterization', and 'stochastic nature of cell origins and fates'. These principles imply a change in the way data can be interpreted and could alter subsequent hypothesis formation. This new paradigm will hopefully lead us forward to a more flexible and creative exploration of the potential of adult vertebrate cells.","['Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY 10016, USA.']",,,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years it has become evident that MyD/Gadd play a role in blood cell development, where they function as positive regulators of terminal differentiation, lineage-specific blood cell development and control of blood cell homeostasis, including growth inhibition and apoptosis. MyD/Gadd are also involved in inflammatory responses to invading micro-organisms, and response to environmental stress and physiological stress, such as hypoxia, which results in ischemic tissue damage. An intricate network of interactions among MyD/GADD genes and gene products appears to control their diverse functions. Deregulated growth, increased cell survival, compromised differentiation and deficiencies in DNA repair are hallmarks of malignancy and its progression. Thus, the role MyD/Gadd play in negative growth control, including cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and in DNA repair, make them attractive molecular targets for tumor suppression.

The repository derives from a historical database of greater than 600 000 compounds, which have been supplied to DTP from a variety of sources worldwide. The in vitro anti-cancer drug cell line screen established at DTP is unique in several respects. It has changed the NCI emphasis from a compound-oriented drug discovery effort to a disease-panel oriented exercise, emphasized human tumor cells derived from solid tumors, developed a high volume screening method that can adapt to processing of numerous chemical agents or natural source-derived extracts, that has minimized the use of animals, and saved on the amount of material required for the initial screening. The hollow fiber assay created at the DTP has demonstrated the ability to provide quantitative initial indices of in vivo drug efficacy, with minimum expenditures of time and materials and is currently being utilized as the initial in vivo experience for agents found to have reproducible activity in the in vitroanticancer drug screen.

Indeed, in vitro studies have shown the statins can trigger cells of certain tumor types, such as acute myelogenous leukemia, to undergo apoptosis in a sensitive and specific manner. Mechanistic studies show bcl-2 expression is down-regulated in transformed cells undergoing apoptosis in response to statin exposure. In addition, the apoptotic response is in part due to the depletion of the downstream product geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate or other products of the mevalonate pathway including cholesterol. Clinically, preliminary phase I clinical trials have shown the achievable plasma concentration corresponds to the dose range that can trigger apoptosis of tumor types in vitro. Moreover, little toxicity was evident in vivo even at high concentrations. Clearly, additional clinical trials are warranted to further assess the safety and efficacy of statins as novel and immediately available anti-cancer agents.

Ongoing studies of this gene provide an interesting perspective on the role of the BCL2 family in transitions in cell phenotype. Specifically, gene products that influence cell viability as a major effect (eg MCL1, BCL2 and other family members) can act as key determinants in cell proliferation, differentiation and tumorigenesis. Although they do not have a direct role in proliferation/differentiation programs, these genes can either permit these programs to proceed or prevent them. Through such effects, the BCL2 family regulates the normal flow of cells through cycles of proliferation and along various pathways of differentiation. A model is presented suggesting that this is accomplished by sustaining or inhibiting viability at critical points in the cell lifecycle. These critical points represent windows of time during which cell fate transitions are effected. They can also be visualized as windows that open or close to promote or prevent continued progression along various cell fate pathways. The pattern of BCL2 family expression at these points allows for the proliferation differentiation, and continued viability of cell types that are needed, while aborting these processes for cells that are overabundant or no longer needed. The combined action of the various family members can therefore control the fate of cells, tissues and even the organism. This mechanism involving apoptosis-related genes is readily executable, and is poised to respond to external signals through the differential regulation of BCL2 family members. As such, it plays an important role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and function. Alterations that affect the BCL2 family impair the capacity to control the flow of cells through these critical points, and thereby 'leave the window open' for cell immortalization and cancer. Targeting this family may thus provide a means of inhibiting cancer development and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells.","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH, USA.']",['CA57359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,134,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The potential of specific proteasome inhibitors to act as novel anti-cancer agents is currently under intensive investigation. Several proteasome inhibitors exert anti-tumour activity in vivo and potently induce apoptosis in tumour cells in vitro, including those resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. By inhibiting NF-kappaB transcriptional activity, proteasome inhibitors may also prevent angiogenesis and metastasis in vivo and further increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to apoptosis. Proteasome inhibitors also exhibit some level of selective cytotoxicity to cancer cells by preferentially inducing apoptosis in proliferating or transformed cells or by overcoming deficiencies in growth-inhibitory or pro-apoptotic molecules. High expression of oncogene products like c-Myc also makes cancer cells more susceptible to proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis. The induction of apoptosis by proteasome inhibitors varies between cell types but often occurs following an initial accumulation of short-lived proteins such as p53, p27, pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members or activation of the stress kinase JNK. These initial events often result in a perturbation of mitochondria with concomitant release of cytochrome c and activation of the Apaf-1 containing apoptosome complex. This results in activation of the apical caspase-9 followed by activation of effector caspases-3 and -7, which are responsible for the biochemical and morphological changes associated with apoptosis.","['MRC Toxicology Unit, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']",,,,,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alleles corresponding to one paternal haplotype were detectable in plasma, but not in whole blood. Alleles from the alternative haplotype were not detectable. This demonstrated that the fetus shared at least one haplotype with the patient and therefore arrangements were made to bank the CB.

Here, we present evidence that Pbx1, in partnership with Meis1b, can regulate posterior neural markers and neural crest marker genes during Xenopus development. A Xenopus homolog of the Pbx1b homeodomain protein was isolated and shown to be expressed throughout embryogenesis. Xpbx1b expression overlaps with Xmeis1 in several areas, including the lateral neural folds, caudal branchial arch, hindbrain, and optic cup. When ectopically expressed, Xpbx1b can synergize with Xmeis1b to promote posterior neural and neural crest gene expression in ectodermal explants. Further, a physical interaction between these two homeodomain proteins is necessary for induction of these genes in embryonic tissue. In addition, coexpression of Xmeis1b and Xpbx1b leads to a prominent shift in the localization of Xmeis1b from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, suggesting that nuclear transport or retention of Xmeis1b may depend upon Xpbx1b. Finally, expression of a mutant construct in which Xpbx1b protein is fused to the repressor domain from Drosophila Engrailed inhibits posterior neural and neural crest gene expression. These data indicate that Xpbx1b and its partner, Xmeis1b, function in a transcriptional activation complex during hindbrain and neural crest development.","['Regulation of Cell Growth Laboratory, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",,,,,,,PMC122789,,,,['GENBANK/AF480430'],,,,,,,

In reviewing the published literature, we were unable to identify a suitable intermediate marker of substantive disease that predicted outcome in the BDF1 recipient of the L1210 leukemia. In an attempt to refine the use of animals in our laboratory, we developed a scoring sheet for behavioral and physical changes that followed intravenous injection of L1210 lymphocytic leukemia cells into BDF1 recipients. At 12-h intervals for the first 2 days after tumor-cell injection and at 6-h intervals thereafter, animals were observed and scored for each parameter. When death was imminent, animals were euthanized by inhalation of methoxyflurane followed by decapitation. Changes in physical and behavioral characteristics then were correlated with the end-point of death. Changes occurred in the mice approximately 7 days after tumor cell inoculation and 24 h before death. The earliest of these signs was hunched posture, followed by one or more other characteristics including decreased activity, increased facial swelling, ears in backward position, abdominal swelling, squinting eyes, and labored breathing. From these data, we were able to develop criteria for early euthanasia. Use of these intermediate end-points likely will substantially reduce the stress on the animals without compromising scientific outcomes in experiments using this or related preclinical models of cancer.","['Department of Human Biology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An overview of the problems encountered in the management of leukaemia in developing countries especially those in sub-Saharan Africa are highlighted. DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive analysis of consecutive leukaemia cases seen from January 1994 through December 1998. RESULTS: Of the 95 leukaemia patients diagnosed during the study period, childhood (0-15 years) leukaemia occurred in 27 (28.4%) patients while adulthood (above 15 years) leukaemia accounted for 68 (71.6%) patients. The main leukaemia types were: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) 14 (14.7%), acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML) 25 (26.3%), chronic myeloid (granulocytic) leukaemia (CML) 32 (33.7%), chronic lymphocytic (lymphatic) leukaemia (CLL) 22 (23.2%) and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) two (2.1%) patients. Most of the acute leukaemia (AL) cases occurred in the six to 15 year age bracket with a male preponderance. In ALL, lymphadenopathy was the commonest presenting feature followed by pallor (92.9%) while in the AML group, pallor occurred in 80% of cases. Abdominal swelling (87.5%) due to splenomegaly (81.3%) were the main clinical features in the CML group whereas lymphadenopathy (63.6%) followed by splenomegaly (59.1%) were the dominant presenting features in CLL. Haematologically, although leucocytosis characterised both acute and chronic leukaemias, most cases of acute leukaemia presented with more severe anaemia (Hb < 7 g/dl) and marked thrombocytopenia (Platelet count < 50 x 10(9)/l) than the chronic leukaemias. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS: The study shows that leukaemias are not rare in Malawi and cases which were diagnosed in this series probably only represent the tip of the iceberg. While there is need to increase diagnostic awareness among clinicians and laboratory staff, the severe chronic shortage of cytotoxic drugs and lack of supportive care facilities commonly encountered in developing countries should be realistically addressed through cost-sharing, cost recovery, adequate government subvention and donations from charitable organisations.","['Department of Haematology, University of Malawi, College of Medicine, Private Bag 360, Chichiri, Blantyre 3, Malawi.']",,,,,18,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This was a retrospective study from September 1, 1993 to September 3 1998. All bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy results were retrieved. The clinical data provided by clinicians were also noted. RESULTS: A total of 97 BME were recorded from patients aged two months to 13 years. The peak ages for BME were six to eight years (24% of patients). The more frequent indications for BME were unexplained anaemia found in 26% request forms, investigation for solid tumours (10%) and lymphoma (10%) and remission assessment after treatment for leukaemia (26%). The main findings were malignancy (27%) with leukaemia being commonest (ALL) 16% of patients and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (5%). Haematinic deficiency was seen in 12.7% of cases with iron deficiency being the commonest. There were some notable differences and similarities in the study as compared to a similar one performed at a local referral hospital.

Almost all patients respond to G-CSF with increased neutrophils, reduced infections, and improved survival. Some responders with congenital neutropenia and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) have developed myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML), which raises the question of the role of G-CSF in pathogenesis. The issue is complicated because both disorders have a propensity for MDS or AML as part of their natural history. To address this, the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) used its large database of chronic neutropenia patients treated with G-CSF to determine the incidence of malignant myeloid transformation in the two disorders, and its relationship to treatment and to other patient characteristics. No statistically significant relationships were found between age at onset of MDS or AML and patient gender, G-CSF dose, or duration of G-CSF therapy. What was observed, however, was the multistep acquisition of aberrant cellular genetic changes in marrow cells from patients who transformed, including activating ras oncogene mutations, clonal cytogenetic abnormalities, and G-CSF receptor mutations. In murine models, the latter produces a hyperproliferative response to G-CSF, confers resistance to apoptosis, and enhances cell survival. Since congenital neutropenia and SDS are inherited forms of bone marrow failure, G-CSF may accelerate the propensity for MDS/AML in the genetically altered stem and progenitor cells, especially in those with G-CSF receptor and ras mutations (82% and 50% of patients who transform, respectively). Alternatively, and equally plausible, G-CSF may simply be an ""innocent bystander"" that corrects neutropenia, prolongs patient survival, and allows time for the malignant predisposition to declare itself. In patients who transform to overt MDS or AML, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the only chance for cure. In those with ""soft"" signs of MDS, such as an isolated clonal cytogenetic change but without other evidence of MDS, or with an isolated G-CSF receptor mutation, there is room for conservative management. One option is to reduce the G-CSF dosage as much as possible, and observe the tempo of progression, if any, to more overt signs of malignancy.","['Division of Hematology-Oncology and the Research Institute, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.']",,,,,41,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

Recent advances have allowed better understanding regarding the mechanism of neutropenia and improved options for treatment. Target antigens for antineutrophil antibodies have been identified for both Felty's syndrome and for SLE. The role of soluble Fas-ligand (FasL) in inducing apoptosis of neutrophils has been clarified for LGL leukemia and increased neutrophil apoptosis has been described in neutropenic patients with SLE. The role of immune complexes in affecting neutrophil traffic and function continues to be studied. Treatments of neutropenia have included methotrexate, cyclosporine A, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) as well as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The efficacy of both GM- and G-CSF in reversing neutropenia and decreasing the risk of infections in Felty's syndrome and SLE has been well documented. Of concern, however, have been flares of symptoms or development of leukocytoclastic vasculitis in some patients following the use of these cytokines.

GSD1b results from a deficiency of the glucose-6-phosphate translocase enzyme and the genetic defect maps to chromosome 11q23. Patients with GSD1b are susceptible to recurrent bacterial infections, commonly involving the perirectal area, ears, skin, and urinary tract, although life-threatening infections, such as septicemia, pneumonia, and meningitis occur less frequently. Although the exact mechanism of neutropenia in patients with GSD1b is not known, treatment with recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has reduced the incidence of infections and has improved the quality of life of these patients. Defects in neutrophil chemotaxis and intracellular bacterial killing have been described and appear to be corrected by the use of G-CSF. To date, no cases of myelodysplasia or acute myeloid leukemia have been observed in patients with GSD1b treated with G-CSF. A significant complication of cytokine therapy is the development of hypersplenism, requiring either a reduction in the dosage of G-CSF or splenectomy.","['Fiona Elsey Cancer Research Laboratory, University of Ballarat Cancer Research Centre, Ballarat, Victoria, Australia.']",,,,,32,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

One subtype of CN, Kostmann syndrome, was originally described as an autosomal-recessive disorder, characterized by early-stage maturation arrest of myelopoiesis. Autosomal-dominant and sporadic cases have also been reported. Recent studies on the genetic bases of CN have detected different inherited or spontaneous point mutations in the neutrophil elastase gene. Development of additional genetic defects during the course of disease, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-receptor gene mutations and cytogenetic aberrations, indicates an underlying genetic instability. Data on more than 300 patients with CN collected by the Severe Chronic Neutropenia International Registry (SCNIR) since 1994 demonstrate that, independent of the CN subtype, more than 90% of patients respond to recombinant human (rHu)G-CSF with ANCs that can be maintained at approximately 1.0 x 10(9)/L. Adverse events include mild splenomegaly, moderate thrombocytopenia, osteoporosis, and malignant transformation into myelodysplasia (MDS)/leukemia. If and how rHuG-CSF treatment impacts on these adverse events remains unclear since there are no historical controls for comparison.

We describe the case of a 45-year-old man who developed a leukemic HSTCL 5 years after renal transplantation and continous immunosuppression with cyclosporine A and prednisolone. After a rapid clinical course, the patient died and autopsy was performed. The malignant lymphocytes showed a natural killer-like gammadelta-T-cell phenotype (CD2(+), CD3(+), CD7(+), TCR gammadelta(+), CD56(+), TIA-1(+), CD4(-), CD8(-), and TCR alphabeta(-)) and infiltrated the sinusoids of liver and the red pulp of the spleen. Cytogenetically, an isochromosome 7q, trisomy 8, Y-loss, and a translocation t(1;4) was detectable. This case shows the difficulties of recognizing HSTCL early in the clinical course and underlines that all types of T-NHL, nodal as well as extranodal, have to be considered in the differential diagnosis of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders. Moreover, HSTCL seems to occur as a specific late complication of solid organ transplantation.","['Division of Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Innsbruck, Austria.']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

Epub 2001 Dec 6.,,"Due to their minority among the non-Hodgkin lymphomas, classification of extranodal T-cell lymphomas, including those of the natural killer (NK) cell type, has long been controversial and unclear, and the clinical outcome is not well clarified. Recently, new well-defined disease entities have been described based on tumor cell biology combined with anatomical site, clinical features, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status, and cell lineage as determined by immunophenotype and genotype. Cytological features are usually not specific, and there are no morphologic correlates with the classification of extranodal T/NK-cell lymphomas. From a human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) endemic area in Japan, we report here the analysis of 144 cases of extranodal T-cell lymphoma, from which fresh tissues were available. As the clinicopathological features were known, we simply reclassified the cases according to cell lineage and anatomical site. The extranodal T-cell lymphomas were classified into three types on the basis of cell lineage: (1) natural killer cell (NK) type [sCD3-, CD56+, T-cell receptor gene (TCR) germline], (2) cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) type [sCD3+, TIA-1+, TCR rearranged, CD8+/-, CD4-/+], and (3) non-NK/CTL type [sCD3+, TIA-1-, TCR rearranged, CD4+/-, CD8-/+]. In addition to cell lineage, the anatomical site and clinical features were added for subclassification. NK type tumors (35 cases) included the lymphoblastic type, nasal/nasal-type NK lymphoma, and NK leukemia. The CTL type (46 cases) included anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), cutaneous type, intestinal, gamma delta T-cell type, and an unspecified type. The non-NK/CTL type (63 cases) included adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL), mycosis fungoides (MF), and an unspecified type. With the exception of ATLL and MF, most extranodal T-cell lymphomas had a cytotoxic phenotype of NK type or CTL type and were often associated with EBV infection. MF and the unspecified type within the non-NK/CTL tumors, with the exception of ATLL, had a favorable prognosis. However, NK and CTL types, with the exception of ALCL, were associated with a poor prognosis. Our results indicate that anatomical site and cell lineage are useful predictors of clinical outcomes of extranodal T-cell lymphomas.","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Nanakuma 7-45-1, Jonanku, Fukuoka 814-01, Japan. ohshima@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,20011206,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the subcellular localization of Myb proteins in cultured non-synchronized insect cells transfected with recombinant baculoviruses overexpressing either v-myb oncogene or c-myb proto-oncogene. The cell expressing Myb proteins underwent extensive nuclear changes and exhibited distinct nuclear structures resembling nucleoli. The bulk of v-Myb and c-Myb proteins accumulated in such nucleolus-like structures which, according to the nucleolar nomenclature, we classified to three types: compact of enlarged size (type I), large ring-shaped (type II) and with nucleolonemas (type III). We investigated these structures for the presence of important nucleolar macromolecules in order to establish whether they were compatible with the function in the production of ribosomes. Strikingly, our results indicated that the different forms of these structures did not represent genuine nucleoli. They rather reflected progressive changes, induced by the virus infection and high expression of v-myb genes, accompanied by the formation of these prominent nucleolus-like structures highly enriched in Myb protein. Gradual changes in number of individual nucleolus-like forms during infection, increasing amount of Myb protein and DNA localized in them together with decreasing amount of RNA and their different interaction with viral particles indicate that the nucleolus-like structure of type I is a precursor of the type II and finally of the type III.","['Department of Biopolymers Micromorphology, Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Flemingovo nam. 2, 166 37 Praha 6, Czech Republic. stokrova@img.cas.cz']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the prevalence of HCV infection in 109 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and compared it with a control group composed of 67 patients with Hodgkin's disease and 31 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The prevalence of HCV infection was also determined in blood donors. HCV infection was detected using second and third generation anti-HCV ELISA. Positive results were additionally confirmed using Inno-LIA AbIII and/or RNA-HCV by PCR. Immunohistochemical stains were used to determine B or T cell lineage when the morphological analysis was not sufficient for lymphoma classification. HCV infection was detected in 9% of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, in 2% of patients in the control group (p=0.036), and in 1.2% of blood donors. There was no difference in the prevalence of HCV infection between patients with B or T cell lymphomas. Blood transfusions or previous surgeries, both risk factors for HCV infection, were detected in 90% of the patients with a positive anti-HCV test, in average 17 and 36 years before the diagnosis of lymphoma, respectively.

In the present study, we demonstrated that PAT treatment also inhibited cell growth of four acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, i.e., HL60, K562, KG1a and U937, that do not derive from APL. PAT, like As2O3, was further shown to induce apoptosis in HL60 cells as assessed by Hoechst 33342 staining and microscopical detection. Such an apoptotic process was associated with loss of mitochondrial potential and enhanced cellular production of reactive oxygen-related species; it was potentiated by co-treatment with buthionine sulfoximine, a pro-oxidant compound acting through inhibition of glutathione synthesis, and abolished in response to the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, thus outlining that the toxicity of PAT, similarly to that of As2O3, is modulated by the cellular redox status. Pan-caspase inhibitors failed to inhibit PAT-triggered apoptosis of HL60 cells whereas they fully blocked that linked to As2O3, suggesting that PAT, unlike As2O3, does not require caspase activity for inducing apoptosis. PAT and As2O3 also differently affected intracellular pH, a key parameter commonly altered during apoptotic processes. Such data therefore indicate that PAT can exert cytotoxicity towards AML cells not deriving from APL such as HL60 cells, through inducing an apoptotic process which exhibits some similarities and some differences with that triggered by As2O3.","['Unite INSERM U456, Faculte de Pharmacie, Rennes Cedex, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2002 Apr 15.,,"A cDNA was isolated from interleukin 3-developed, mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (MCs) that contained an insert (designated mRasGRP4) that had not been identified in any species at the gene, mRNA, or protein level. By using a homology-based cloning approach, the approximately 2.6-kb hRasGRP4 transcript was also isolated from the mononuclear progenitors residing in the peripheral blood of normal individuals. This transcript information was then used to locate the RasGRP4 gene in the mouse and human genomes, to deduce its exon/intron organization, and then to identify 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human gene that result in 5 amino acid differences. The >15-kb hRasGRP4 gene consists of 18 exons and resides on a region of chromosome 19q13.1 that had not been sequenced by the Human Genome Project. Human and mouse MCs and their progenitors selectively express RasGRP4, and this new intracellular protein contains all of the domains present in the RasGRP family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors even though it is <50% identical to its closest homolog. Recombinant RasGRP4 can activate H-Ras in a cation-dependent manner. Transfection experiments also suggest that RasGRP4 is a diacylglycerol/phorbol ester receptor. Transcript analysis of an asthma patient, a mastocytosis patient, and the HMC-1 cell line derived from a MC leukemia patient revealed the presence of substantial amounts of non-functional forms of hRasGRP4 due to an inability to remove intron 5 in the precursor transcript. Because only abnormal forms of hRasGRP4 were identified in the HMC-1 cell line, this immature MC progenitor was used to address the function of RasGRP4 in MCs. HMC-1 leukemia cells differentiated and underwent granule maturation when induced to express a normal form of RasGRP4. Thus, RasGRP4 plays an important role in the final stages of MC development.","[""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, and Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]","['AI-23483/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-54762/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-36110/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-63284/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,20020415,,,"['GENBANK/AF331457', 'GENBANK/AY040628', 'GENBANK/AY048119', 'GENBANK/AY048120', 'GENBANK/AY048121']",,,,,,,

The neuro-immune-endocrine interface is mediated by cytokines acting as auto/paracrine or endocrine factors regulating pituitary development, cell proliferation, hormone secretion, and feedback control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. At birth or during neonatal ontogenesis, cytokines produce permanent alterations of HPA axis function and the stress response. Overexpressing IL-6 or leukemia inhibitory factor leads to significant changes in pituitary development and functions. Pituitary corticotroph POMC gene expression is regulated by CRH as well as several gp130 cytokines acting as neuro-immuno-endocrine modulators. Conversely, HPA axis functions modulate susceptibility or resistance to inflammatory disease. Cytokines (including IL-1, TNF, and members of the gp130 cytokine family) participate as mediators of a complex HPA axis response to stress and inflammation. Prolonged exposure to proinflammatory cytokines increases levels of the dominant negative glucocorticoid receptor isoform. Nonresponsiveness of the HPA axis to glucocorticoid negative feedback control provides a defense from destructive effects of cytokine excess. At the same time, gp130 cytokines stimulate pituitary suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-3, which represses cytokine signaling and abrogates cytokine-induced corticotroph POMC gene transcription and ACTH secretion.","['Cedars-Sinai Research Institute, University of California-Los Angeles School of Medicine, 8700 Beverly Boulevard, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",,,,,52,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The compound shows broad antitumor activity in preclinical models and dramatically reduced in vitro myelotoxicity in human hematopoietic progenitor cells compared with that of other minor groove binders. Brostallicin showed a 3-fold higher activity in melphalan-resistant L1210 murine leukemia cells than in the parental line (IC(50) = 0.46 and 1.45 ng/ml, respectively) under conditions in which the cytotoxicity of conventional antitumor agents was either unaffected or reduced. This melphalan-resistant cell line has increased levels of glutathione (GSH) in comparison with the parental cells. Conversely, GSH depletion by buthionine sulfoximine in a human ovarian carcinoma cell line (A2780) significantly decreased both the cytotoxic and the proapoptotic effects of brostallicin. In one experiment, human glutathione S-transferase pi (GST-pi) cDNA was transfected into A2780 cells, and four clones of A2780 with different expression levels of GST-pi were generated (i.e., two clones with high and two clones with low GST-pi expression). A 2-3-fold increase in GST-pi levels resulted in a 2-3-fold increase in cytotoxic activity of brostallicin. Similar results were obtained for GST-pi-transfected human breast carcinoma cells (MCF-7). Brostallicin showed 5.8-fold increased cytotoxicity in GST-pi-transfected versus empty vector-transfected cells with low GST-pi expression. In an in vivo experiment, A2780 clones were implanted into nude mice. The antitumor activity of brostallicin was higher in the GST-pi-overexpressing tumors without increased toxicity. Regarding the mechanism of action, brostallicin interacts reversibly with the DNA minor groove TA-rich sequences but appears unreactive in classical in vitro DNA alkylation assays. We speculated that an intracellular reactive nucleophilic species, e.g., GSH, could react with the alpha-bromoacrylamide moiety functions. Experiments on the interaction with plasmid DNA showed a change of the DNA topology from supercoiled to circular form (nicking) in the presence of GSH, whereas no change was found in its absence. In vitro incubations of brostallicin were performed with the human recombinant GST isoenzymes A1-1, M1-1, and P1-1 (alpha, mu and pi isoenzymes, respectively) in the presence of GSH. The decrease in brostallicin levels was monitored in these incubations; the rate of loss (and therefore brostallicin metabolism) was significantly higher for the M1-1 and P1-1 isoenzymes than for the A1-1 isoenzyme.","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, Department of Oncology, Mario Negri Institute of Pharmacological Research, via Eritrea 62, 20157 Milan, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Melatonin seems to be the natural hormone to facilitate sleep in insomniac patients and causes no hang over. When applied together with benzodiazepine it allows reduction of benzodiazepine without withdrawal effects. It should be applied 2 h before sleeping time in doses between 3 and 5 mg. Melatonin acts via the gamma-aminobutyric acid- and benzodiazepine receptor explaining its success in treatment of seizures in children and in adults. Constant application of benzodiazepine reduced the production of natural melatonin in rats, supporting the evidence that long-term application of benzodiazepine in humans does not restore sleeping habits but reduces natural sleeping habits even more. Low melatonin levels were seen in bulimia or neuralgia and in women with fibromyalgia; replacement reduced pain, sleeping disorders, and depression in fibromyalgia and bulimia. Melatonin profiles are a diagnostic tool to distinguish between several forms of depression, like major depression, winter depression (SAD), unipolar depression, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS). In patients with a major depression success with antidepressants correlated with an increase in their melatonin profiles but only patients suffering from DSPS can be successfully treated with melatonin. In perimenopausal women melatonin administration did produce a change in LH, FSH and thyroid hormones. Some oncostatic properties are supported by cell culture work and studies in animals. In Nordic countries indigenous people suffer less from breast and prostate cancer, winter darkness seems to protect. The supposedly increased melatonin levels created the 'melatonin hypothesis'. Epidemiological studies did show that blind people indeed have half the rate of breast cancers, supporting the hypothesis. Controversial results concerning melatonin and insulin resistance and glucose tolerance have been published. In postmenopausal women application of melatonin reduced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Pregnant women should avoid melatonin, since its teratogenic effect is not known. Patients suffering from non-hormone dependent tumors, like leukemia, should avoid melanin, since tumor growth was promoted in animal experiments. It can be expected that melatonin will receive wide consideration for treatment of sleeping disturbances, jet lag, and fibromyalgia once an oral formulation becomes available in Europe.","['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, University Hospital, Essen, Germany. ufk@uni-essen.de']",,,,,109,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data from 93 patients who received TBI in 1 or 2 fractions as a part of their conditioning regimen for bone marrow transplantation were analyzed with respect to the degree of visual impairment as a result of cataract formation. The probability to develop severe visual impairment (SVI) was determined for all patients, and the degree of visual impairment was assessed for 56 patients with stabilized cataract, using three categories: no, mild, or severe. RESULTS: For all 93 patients, the probability of developing a cataract causing SVI was 0.44. For allogeneic patients, it was 0.33 without and 0.71 with steroid treatment (p <0.001). All SVI-free probability curves reached a plateau distinct from the cataract-free curves. Apparently, cataracts developing late in the follow-up period rarely cause SVI. Of the patients with stabilized cataract, 32% had no visual impairment, 16% had mild, and 52% severe impairment. No or mild visual impairment was present in 61% of all patients with stable cataract and no steroid treatment compared with only 13% of the patients treated with steroids (p = 0.035). CONCLUSION: SVI occurs in only some of the patients (52%) with stable cataract after TBI for bone marrow transplantation in 1 or 2 fractions.

To obtain these parameters for the human eye lens, a large series of patients treated with different doses and dose rates is required. The data of patients with acute leukemia treated with single-dose total body irradiation (STBI) and bone marrow transplantation (BMT) collected by the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation were analyzed. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The data of 495 patients who underwent BMT for acute leukemia, who had STBI as part of their conditioning regimen, were analyzed using the linear-quadratic concept. The end point was the incidence of cataract formation after BMT. Of the analyzed patients, 175 were registered as having cataracts. Biologic effective doses (BEDs) for different sets of values for alpha/beta and mu were calculated for each patient. With Cox regression analysis, using the overall chi-square test as the parameter evaluating the goodness of fit, alpha/beta and mu values were found. Risk factors for cataract induction were the BED of the applied TBI regimen, allogeneic BMT, steroid therapy for >14 weeks, and heparin administration. To avoid the influence of steroid therapy and heparin on cataract induction, patients who received steroid or heparin treatment were excluded, leaving only the BED as a risk factor. Next, the most likely set of alpha/beta and mu values was obtained. With this set, the cataract-free survival rates were calculated for specific BED intervals, according to the Kaplan-Meier method. From these calculations, cataract incidences were obtained as function of the BED at 120 months after STBI. RESULTS: The use of BED instead of the TBI dose enabled the incidence of cataract formation to be predicted in a reasonably consistent way. With Cox regression analysis for all STBI data, a maximal chi-square value was obtained for alpha/beta = 1.75 Gy and mu = 0.75 h(-1). When Cox regression analysis was applied for patients who had no steroid treatment after BMT, a maximal chi-square value was obtained for alpha/beta = 1 Gy and mu = 0.6 h(-1). Cox regression analysis was repeated using the data of patients who had not received posttransplant steroid treatment and also no heparin administration; we found alpha/beta = 0.75 Gy and mu= 0.65 h(-1). An increased cataract incidence was observed after steroid treatment of >14 weeks and heparin administration. CONCLUSION: The alpha/beta value of 0.75 Gy and mu value of 0.65 h(-1) found for the eye lens are characteristic for late-responding tissues. The incidence of cataract formation can now be quantified, taking into account the values calculated for alpha/beta and mu, TBI dose, and dose rate. Also, the reduction in cataract incidence as a result of lens dose reduction by eye shielding can be estimated.","['Department of Radiotherapy, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands.

In this study, paclitaxel was selected to determine the inhibition of arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity, gene expression (NAT mRNA) and DNA-2-aminofluorene adduct formation in human leukemia HL-60 cell line. Paclitaxel (0.01-l microM) did decrease the level of NAT mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. The results demonstrated that paclitaxel inhibited NAT activity and DNA-2-aminofluorene adduct formation in human leukemia HL-60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Using standard steady-state kinetic analysis, it was demonstrated that paclitaxel was a possible uncompetitive inhibitor to NAT activity in cytosols based on the decrease in apparent values of K(m) and V(max).

Most cases are found in Japan, the Caribbean basin, and West Africa. DESIGN: To identify diagnostic parameters for cytology in this neoplasm, the authors undertook a retrospective review of all ATLL samples from 1990 to 2000. RESULTS: One hundred fourteen samples from 34 patients with the diagnosis of ATLL were reviewed: 80 cerebrospinal fluids, 7 pleural effusions, 4 bronchoalveolar lavages, 2 peritoneal effusions as well as fine-needle aspirations of 15 lymph nodes, 4 subcutaneous lesions, and 2 breast nodules. Twenty-one patients were women and 13 were men, with an age range of 30 to 71 years. Morphologically, all specimens were characterized by the presence of a polymorphous population of lymphocytes ranging from small bland-appearing lymphocytes to large atypical ones with bizarre, multilobulated nuclei (flower-like or clover leaf cells) with coarse chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The cytoplasm was deeply basophilic with occasional vacuoles. Immunocytochemistry was performed on 17 specimens from 14 patients. In all cases tested, tumor cells were immunoreactive for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD25 and were nonimmunoreactive for CD7 and CD8. Flow cytometry was performed on 12 specimens from 9 patients. The tumor cells in all cases tested were positive for CD2, CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD25 and were negative for CD7. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the polymorphous nature of ATLL, diagnosis can be established by close attention to nuclear cytologic features in conjunction with ancillary studies such as immunocytochemistry and/or flow cytometry.","['National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute, Section of Cytopathology, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",,,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we report inhibition of DNA-dependent protein kinase activity by phosphorothioate oligonucleotides, suramin and heparin. Inhibitory effect of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides on DNA-dependent protein kinase activity was increased with length and reached a plateau at 36-mer. The base composition of phosphorothioate oligonucleotides did not affect the inhibitory effect. The inhibitory effect by phosphorothioate oligodeoxycytidine 36-mer can be about 200-fold greater than that by the phosphodiester oligodeoxycytidine 36-mer. The inhibitory effect was also observed with purified DNA-dependent protein kinase, which suggests direct interaction between DNA-dependent protein kinase and phosphorothioate oligonucleotides. DNA-dependent protein kinase will have different binding positions for double-stranded DNA and phosphorothioate oligodeoxycytidine 36-mer because they were not competitive in DNA-dependent protein kinase activation. Suramin and heparin inhibited DNA-dependent protein kinase activity with IC(50) of 1.7 microM and 0.27 microg ml(-1) respectively. DNA-dependent protein kinase activities and DNA double-stranded breaks repair in cultured cells were significantly suppressed by the treatment with suramin in vivo. Our present observations suggest that suramin may possibly result in sensitisation of cells to ionising radiation by inactivation of DNA-dependent protein kinase and the impairment of double-stranded breaks repair.","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan. hosoi@m.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",,,,,,,PMC2364188,,,,,,,,,,,

Data were obtained from standardised face-to-face interviews of the mothers. The interviews included questions on early common infections, day-care attendance, breast-feeding, birth order and infantile diseases. Odds ratios were estimated using an unconditional regression model including the stratification variables, parental socio-economic status and perinatal characteristics. Birth order was not associated with childhood leukaemia (acute lymphoblastic or acute non-lymphoblastic). A statistically-significant inverse association was observed between childhood leukaemia and day-care attendance (odds ratio=0.6, 95% Confidence Interval=(0.4-1.0)), repeated early common infections (> or = 4 per year before age two, odds ratio=0.6 (0.4-1.0)), surgical procedures for ear-nose-throat infections before age two (odds ratio=0.5 (0.2-1.0)) and prolonged breast-feeding (> or = 6 months, odds ratio=0.5 (0.2-1.0)). In the multivariate model including day-care attendance, early common infections and breast-feeding, results concerning breast-feeding remained unchanged. A statistically significant interaction between day-care attendance and repeated early common infections was observed.

METHODS: Mice were randomly divided to three groups, one in vivo control (group I) and two in vitro (group II and III). Mice were sacrificed at 116 - 120 hours (group I) and 44 - 48 hours (group II and III) subsequent human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) injection. Two-cell embryos (group II and III) and blastocysts (group I) were obtained. Embryos in group II were cocultured with human tubal fluid (HTF) + 10% human serum and in group III with HTF + 10% human serum + rhLIF (1 000 U/ml). The number of embryo in different stage was recorded and compared. RESULTS: Embryo in four, eight-cell and morula was noted in group II and III, 87.7% versus 91.2% and 75.0% versus 85.4% respectively. There was no significant difference. However, further embryo development to the blastocyst, expanded blastocyst, and hatching blastocyst in group II (48.1%, 32.1% and 18.4%) was lower than that in group III (82.3%, 59.7% and 36.3%). There was no difference between blastocyst in group I and group III (86.0% vs 82.3%).

CD133 (AC133) is a newly described transmembrane protein expressed on CD34(+) and CD34(-) normal progenitors. We characterized the prognostic significance of CD133 expression in AML and expression of CD133 on AML progenitors thought to be responsible for maintaining this disease. METHODS: AML cells from 102 patients were analyzed for CD133 and CD34 expression, and correlated with outcome in 92 treated patients. AML cells were also FACS sorted into CD34(+)/CD133(+), CD34(+)/CD133(-), CD34(-)/CD133(+) and CD34(-)/CD133(-) subfractions, and assayed in vitro in colony-forming assay (CFU) and in suspension culture (SC) assay for up to 8 weeks, and in vivo in non-obese diabetic (NOD)/SCID mice to determine the phenotype of progenitors detected in these assays. RESULTS: CD133 expression was not correlated with event-free or overall survival, FAB subtype, cytogenetic abnormality or WBCC, but was correlated with CD34 expression. Primary AML CFU were present in all four sorted fractions. After an increasing period of time in SC, a higher proportion of cells capable of forming leukemic CFU were found in the CD34(+)/CD133(+) subfraction. Cells capable of producing leukemic engraftment in NOD/SCID mice were found in all subfractions, including the CD34(-)/CD133(-) subfraction in many patients. DISCUSSION: CD133 is not useful as a prognostic marker in AML. CD133 is expressed with CD34 on most primitive leukemic progenitors detected in vitro, however, in vivo progenitors could not be purified using CD133 in these patients.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency Vancouver Hospital and Health Sciences Centre, Vancouver, BC Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was performed to identify roles of PMNs other than those already known. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PMNs were separated from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals and stored in vitro for 24 h in the presence or absence of an anti-human Fc receptor (FcR) gamma III antibody, namely, anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody (mAb). Stored supernatants were harvested and incubated with several leukaemia and transformed cell lines for 48 h. The increase in growth rate was assessed by the increase in the amount of 3H-thymidine incorporated into these cells. Expression of perforin on PMNs, which is thought to decrease cell viability, was elucidated by flow cytometry (FCM) analysis. The presence of perforin in the stored supernatants was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A serine protease inhibitor, which is known to block the effect of perforin, was added to the cultures of several leukaemia and transformed cell lines to confirm the effect of perforin in reducing cell viability. RESULTS: Growth promotion of some cell lines cultured with the stored supernatants of PMNs was observed both in the presence and absence of anti-CD16 mAb, which was used as a trigger molecule of PMNs. This was particularly notable in the case of Raji and Daudi (both Burkitt lymphoma) cell lines and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCLs) derived from healthy individuals. Perforin expression was observed in both freshly prepared and stored PMNs, regardless of the presence or absence of anti-CD16 mAb. ELISA also detected perforin in the stored supernatants in both the presence and absence of anti-CD16 mAb. The increase in growth rate was induced in the presence of not only a serine protease inhibitor but also an anti-perforin mAb. CONCLUSIONS: Stored supernatants of PMNs exhibit up-regulation of cell growth in several cell lines; this up-regulation is particularly prominent in B-lineage cell lines. Furthermore, perforin appeared to be expressed on PMNs constitutively and secreted into the extracellular fluid. Results of this study strongly suggest that the growth-promoting activity in supernatants of stored PMNs is partially inhibited by perforin, which is thought to be produced by PMNs themselves.","['Department of Research, The Japanese Red Cross, Central Blood Center, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CC-FP shows enhanced activities in respect to the CLC/sCNTFR native complex, on a number of cells expressing gp130 and LIFR on their surface. In addition, CC-FP is able to compete with CNTF for cell binding, indicating that both cytokines share binding epitope(s) expressed by their receptor complex. Analysis of the downstream signaling events revealed the recruitment by CC-FP of the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3, Akt and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways. The monomeric bioactive CLC/sCNTFR fusion protein is therefore a powerful tool to study the biological role of the recently described cytokine CLC.","[""INSERM U564, CHU d'Angers, Angers, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-five children who underwent BMT between 1987 and 1994 were included in the study. Twenty-one children were conditioned with TBI and 24 with busulphan before BMT. All children underwent an ophthalmic examination before BMT in order to exclude lens opacities. Yearly examinations for 2-10 years were performed after BMT. RESULTS: Cataracts developed in 20 of the 21 (95%) children conditioned with TBI and in five of the 24 (21%) children conditioned with busulphan. There was no relationship between cataract development and age at BMT, or between cataract development and prednisolone given before or after BMT. CONCLUSION: The present study confirms earlier reports of the high risk of cataract development after TBI and suggests that busulphan is related to cataract development, although less frequently than TBI. The report discusses the possible additive effect of the disease itself, of any corticosteroid treatment and of other cytostatic drugs. It then stresses the importance of early diagnosis of cataracts in children in order to prevent the development of amblyopia.","['Department of Ophthalmology, Uppsala University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden. gerd.holmstrom@ogon.uu.se']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with tumors, because of immune deficits, seem to be at risk of rapid liver disease progression. Little is known about the course of HCV and dual HBV-HCV infections in such patients. MATERIAL/METHODS: The study assessed clinical courses of HCV and dual HBV-HCV infections in 249 children with tumors aged 1-18 years, divided into four groups: with HCV infection - 53, HBV-HCV infection - 53, HBV only - 33 and infection-free - 110. RESULTS: Hepatitis C was often chronic - in 83.3% of patients with HCV and 77.3% of those with dual infection. Over 80% had no jaundice. Mean AlAT activity was the highest in the HCV group (149.2I202.7 IU/l), lower in the dual infection group (123.3I148.1 IU/l; p<0.02), and the lowest in HBV (92.7I152.9 IU/l). Transaminasemia course in patients with HCV and dual HBV-HCV infections was most frequently fluctuating (50.9% and 45.3%, respectively). 52.8% of children with HCV demonstrated no advanced inflammatory lesions with invasion of the lamina limitans, no marked fibrosis, and minimum changes in descriptive classification. In 92.3% of children with dual infections, inflammatory activity was mild or mean, with no fibrosis in 61.5%, and persistent chronic inflammation predominant in descriptive classification (46.1%). CONCLUSIONS: HCV and HBV-HCV infections in children with neoplastic diseases tend to take chronic forms, but their clinical course is mild with signs of severe inflammatory activity or hepatic stroma remodeling observed on histopathology.","['Department and Clinic of Paediatrics, Haematology and Oncology, Medical University, Bydgoszcz, Poland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mRNA expression of a tetraspanin transmembrane protein, CD9, was high in undifferentiated ES cells and decreased shortly after cell differentiation. An immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that plasma membrane-associated CD9 was expressed in undifferentiated ES cells but low in the differentiated cells. Addition of LIF to differentiating ES cells reinduced mRNA expression of CD9, and CD9 expression was accompanied with a reappearance of undifferentiated ES cells. Furthermore, activation of STAT3 induced the expression of CD9, indicating the LIF/STAT3 pathway is critical for maintaining CD9 expression. Finally, addition of anti-CD9 antibody blocked ES cell colony formation and reduced cell viability.

Although CD10 was also identified in human breast myoepithelial cells, its availability of immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections has not been examined so far. In the present study, we demonstrated CD10 immunohistochemically on paraffin sections of both normal and pathological breast tissues, comparing its staining patterns to those of smooth muscle actin (SMA), which is now commonly used to highlight myoepithelium. CD10 was consistently positive in normal breast myoepithelial cells. CD10 also clearly highlighted myoepithelial cells in intraductal papilloma, adenosis, ductal hyperplasia, fibroadenoma, and phyllodes tumor as well as SMA did. In atypical ductal hyperplasia and ductal carcinoma in situ, continuous, discontinuous, and totally negative stainings of both CD10 and SMA were noted, depending on foci of neoplastic cell nests. However, both stainings clearly demonstrated myoepithelial cells of cancerized acini, being useful in differentiating lobular cancerization from microinvasion. Because SMA was also positive in normal vessels and spindle-shaped stromal cells, CD10, which was negative in vessels, was useful in differentiating myoepithelial cells from thin vascular wall in intracystic lesions with delicate papillae. Although background staining of spindle-shaped stromal cells was also noted in CD10, the positive cell number was less, and the signal was weaker than that of SMA. The absence of myoepithelial cells in invasive ductal carcinomas was more clearly highlighted by CD10 than SMA. We concluded that CD10 could be another useful marker of breast myoepithelial cells on paraffin sections. Combination of CD10 and SMA will provide more sophisticated information about presence or absence of myoepithelial cells in confusing breast lesions.","['Department of Pathology, Shiga University of Medical Science, Seta-tsukinowa-cho, Ohtsu, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is also evidence that repeated administration of typical and atypical antipsychotics may result in negative immunomodulatory effects. This study was carried out to examine (1) the serum concentrations of interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-10, the soluble CD8 (sCD8) and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIF-R) in nonresponders to treatment with typical neuroleptics as compared with normal volunteers and responders to treatment; and (2) the effects of atypical antipsychotics on the above immune variables. The latter were determined in 17 nonresponders to treatment with neuroleptics and in seven normal volunteers and 14 schizophrenic patients who had a good response to treatment with antipsychotic agents. The nonresponders had repeated measurements of the immune variables before, and 2 and 4 months after treatment with clozapine or risperidone. Serum IL-8 and IL-10 were significantly higher in schizophrenic patients than in normal controls. The serum concentrations of the sCD8 were significantly increased 2 months, but not 4 months, after starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics. Serum LIF-R concentrations were significantly increased 2 and 4 months after starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics. It is concluded that: (1) schizophrenia is characterized by an activation of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory aspects of cell-mediated immunity; (2) prolonged treatment with atypical antipsychotics may increase the anti-inflammatory capacity of the serum in schizophrenic patients by increasing serum LIF-R concentrations; and (3) short-term treatment with clozapine may induce signs of immune activation which disappear upon prolonged treatment.","['IRCCS, Istituto, Fatebenefratelli, Brescia, Italy.crc-mh@online.be']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The diagnosis was based on morphologic and cytochemical criteria and on immunophenotyping. To demonstrate the p53 protein expression, p53 specific mouse antihuman immunoreagent clone DO-1 that recognizes both wild and mutated p53 protein was used. To detect Bcl-2 a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the 26-kD Bcl-2 protein was applied. For evaluation of both proteins a sensitive Immunotech detection kit based on peroxidase labeled streptavidin biotin reagent was utilized. The patients were divided according to the presence or absence of both, nuclear p53 and cytoplasmic Bcl-2 proteins. A relative low frequency of p53 protein expression in B- and T-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia has been shown at diagnosis. In AML cases, the frequency of p53 expression was higher than that in ALL. Bcl-2 protein immunoreactivity has been found in the majority of acute leukemia patients. The marked heterogeneity in the percentage of p53 and Bcl-2 positive cells in individual patients was observed. Comparative analysis of the distinct acute leukemia subtypes according to the percentage of p53 and Bcl-2 positive cells showed no significant differences except for p53 protein positivity in relation between T-ALL and AML cases. The samples from healthy subjects used as a control exhibited very low proportion of positively stained cells and significantly differed from p53 as well as Bcl-2 positive cases. p53 and Bcl-2 positivity have not been significantly affected neither by age, sex nor WB C counts. Association between myeloid cells maturation and proportion of p53 and Bcl-2 positive cells was observed. Noteworthy was the inverse relation between the higher proportion of p53 positive cells and low Bcl-2 positivity in some cases of acute leukemia. Although our preliminary results need to be confirmed in a larger group of patients, immunocytochemical analysis of p53 and Bcl-2 proteins, indicators of cell alterations, may help to identify risk patients requiring intensive therapy.","['Cancer Research Institute Slovak Academy of Sciences, Bratislava. exonklo@savba.sk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The medical consequences and financial costs of this illness are reported. The reader will gain an understanding of the relevant clues to the diagnosis of a factitious hematologic illness, the psychodynamic issues present in this case and the legal, ethical and countertransferential issues raised by the case. METHOD: A single case review including medical and billing records, patient and staff interviews and literature review. RESULTS: The covert ingestion of busulfan by this patient resulted in life-threatening bone marrow suppression, bilateral aseptic hip necrosis, transfusion-dependent thrombocytopenia and a chronic pain syndrome. Her treatment was complicated by noncompliance with prescribed treatments and polymicrobial sepsis possibly secondary to the self-injection of feces into her central line. To date, the total cost of care for the treatment of this patient's medical complications secondary to her ingestion of busulfan exceeds $1,100,000.00. CONCLUSIONS: This case underscores the importance of the early recognition by the primary care physician of the possibility of a factitious etiology of hematologic abnormalities such as aplastic anemia due to the ingestion of bone marrow ablative medications. The index of suspicion is increased when the patient is a young health care provider, usually female, with atypical pancytopenia and an unusual disease course and response to treatment.","['Department of Psychiatry, UNC School of Medicine, 27599-7160, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Follistatin binds to activin A with high affinity, and prevents activin binding to its own receptors, thereby blocking its signaling. We previously identified FLRG gene from a B-cell leukemia carrying a t(11;19)(q13;p13) translocation. We and others have already shown that FLRG, which is highly homologous to follistatin, may be involved in the regulation of the activin function through its binding to activin. In this study, we found that, like follistatin, FLRG protein inhibited activin A signaling as demonstrated by the use of a transcriptional reporter assay, and blocked the activin A-induced growth inhibition of HepG2 cells. We have recently shown that the TGFbeta-induced expression of FLRG occurs at a transcriptional level through the action of Smad proteins. Here we show that activin A increases FLRG and follistatin at both the mRNA and protein levels. We found that Smad proteins are involved in the activin A-induced transcription activation of FLRG and follistatin. Finally we demonstrate that FLRG protein regulates its own activin-induced expression. In conclusion, activin A induces FLRG and follistatin expression. This observation, in conjunction with the antagonistic effect of FLRG and follistatin on activin signaling, indicates that these two proteins participate in a negative feedback loop which regulates the activin function.","['INSERM U453, Centre Leon Berard, 69373 Lyon, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mice inoculated with either vaccine showed significantly higher survival rates than controls after challenge with leukemia cells. However, protection from tumor challenge was optimal when the DNA vaccine was used for priming, followed by a booster immunization with the vaccinia virus recombinant. This vaccination protocol induced resistance not only to the first tumor challenge given shortly afterwards, but also to a second challenge given months later.

To overcome these problems we modified the widely used Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral vector pMX by replacing the 3'LTR with the spleen focus-forming virus LTR and inserting the woodchuck hepatitis B virus post-translational regulatory element. To compare requirements crucial for efficient transgene expression, we generated the hybrid retroviral vectors pMOWS and pOWS that harbor the complete murine embryonic stem cell virus (MESV)-leader sequence or a shortened MESV-leader not comprising primer binding site (PBS) and splice donor (SD). Applying these retroviral vectors significantly augmented transgene expression in hematopoietic cell lines and progenitor cells. For transduction of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells the retroviral vector pMOWS that harbors the MESV-PBS and -SD was superior resulting in 65% green fluorescent protein (GFP) expressing ES cells. Surprisingly, in murine and human primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC), the highest efficiency of up to 66% GFP expressing cells was achieved with pOWS, a retroviral vector that retains the negative regulatory element coinciding with the MoMuLV-PBS. In summary our hybrid retroviral vectors facilitate significantly improved transgene expression in multipotent cells and thus possess great potential for reconstituting genes in primary cells of disease models, as well as for gene therapy.","['Hans-Spemann Laboratories, Max-Planck Institute of Immunobiology, Freiburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2002 Apr 10.,,"Daxx has been reported to mediate the Fas/JNK-dependent signals in the cytoplasm. However, several lines of evidence have suggested that Daxx is located mainly in the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional regulator. Recent studies have further indicated that Daxx-elicited transcriptional repression can be inhibited by the nuclear body-associated promyelocytic leukemia protein and apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 by sequestering Daxx to the nuclear bodies and the cytoplasm, respectively. Here, we further investigated the coordinated molecular mechanism by which Daxx function is regulated through protein-protein interaction. Using yeast two-hybrid screens to identify Daxx-interacting protein(s), three independent clones encoding the 58-kDa microspherule protein (MSP58) fragments were identified. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that Daxx interacts in vitro and in vivo with MSP58 via its NH(2)-terminal segment, which is distinct from the binding region of Fas, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1, and promyelocytic leukemia protein, suggesting a unique modulatory role of MSP58 on Daxx function. Transient transfection experiments revealed that MSP58 relieves the repressor activity of Daxx in a dose-dependent manner in COS-1 and 293 cells but not in HeLa cells, implicating cell type-specific modulation of Daxx function by MSP58. Moreover, immunofluorescence analysis unequivocally demonstrated that MSP58 overexpression results in a translocation of Daxx to the enlarged nucleoli in COS-1 or 293 cells, whereas Daxx exhibited a diffuse nuclear pattern in HeLa cells. Taken together, these findings delineate a network of regulatory signaling pathways that converges on MSP58/Daxx interaction, causally associating Daxx nucleolus targeting with its transcriptional activation function.","['Graduate Institute of Life Sciences, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei 11456, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",,,,,,,,20020410,,,,,,,,,,

Up to this point, no one has targeted changes in serum hemoglobin during treatment. If dynamic changes in hemoglobin after treatment provide additive prognostic information to dynamic changes in PSA, then we should consider and test ways to incorporate serum hemoglobin into measures of response in HRPC. METHODS: Our patients consisted of 321 men who were studied on Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocols 9181 and 9182. We fit serial values of PSA and hemoglobin with an exponential model: y = exp(alpha + beta*t + gamma*t(2)) with y symbolizing either PSA or hemoglobin and t denoting time. We then used the Cox proportional hazard model to relate the parameters of the model (alpha, beta, and gamma) to subsequent survival. RESULTS: We found that the exponential model fit serial measurements of both PSA and serum hemoglobin well, and all three of the parameters for both markers related closely to subsequent survival (P < or = 0.003). The Cox model suggested a composite hazard score (HS) as a way to consolidate the information from serial measurements of both serum markers, and we observed that those with HS < 0 enjoyed a longer survival. CONCLUSION: Because serial measurements of serum hemoglobin during treatment of HRPC add prognostic information to serial measurements of PSA, we hypothesize that combining the dynamic changes in serum hemoglobin with those of PSA could lead to an improved measure of response in HRPC.","['Laboratory Medicine, Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Department of Pathology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27705, USA. voll002@duke.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We therefore performed a pilot study to evaluate the feasibility of a novel 2-CdA-based reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation (RIST) regimen. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 16 scheduled patients with hematological malignancies were enrolled for comparison of their data with conventional stem cell transplantation (n = 19). The regimen for RIST consisted of 2-CdA (0.11 mg/kg/day for 6 days), busulfan (4 mg/kg/day for 2 days), and rabbit antithymocyte globulin (2.5 mg/kg/day for 4, 2, or 0 days). The underlying diseases included acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 6), chronic myelogenous leukemia (n = 2), myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 6), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 2). RESULTS: After RIST, four patients died before day 100 as a result of acute graft-versus-host disease (n = 1), bacteremia (n = 1), disseminated candidasis (n = 1) and congestive heart failure (n = 1). Another patient died of cerebral infarction on day 140. Thus, acute-phase regimen-related toxicities >grade III were observed in only one patient. Engraftment and complete donor chimerism were achieved by day 28 in 14 evaluable patients, and 6 of them (43%) experienced grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease. With a median follow-up of 328 days (range, 231-633 days), the actuarial 1-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 69% and 50%, respectively. Notably, among seven high-risk patients (five patients had been in complete remission two or more times and two not in complete remission with refractory disease at transplant), only two patients developed leukemia relapse after RIST. Although the recovery of CD4+ cells was significantly slower (P = 0.02) in RIST than in conventional stem cell transplantation, the incidence of clinically documented infections was not significantly different between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that this novel regimen containing 2-CdA is well tolerated and induces early complete donor chimerism. The unexpected durable remission achieved in patients with advanced disease at transplant suggests the presence of an acceptable antileukemia/lymphoma effect, which would warrant a further clinical trial.","['Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Hematology Division, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many studies report efficient transduction only at high multiplicities of infection (MOI). This study reports efficient transduction of human CD34(+) cells with a drug resistance gene allowing post-transduction selection using lentivirus under low-MOI conditions that did not require cytokine stimulation or viral concentration. We used the P140K methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase mutant (P140K MGMT) as the gene insert into a second-generation lentiviral backbone and triple-plasmid transfection to generate vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-G protein-pseudotyped virus. The P140K MGMT gene product, O(6)-alkylguanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (AGT), provides protection from the therapeutic drug combination of 1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU) and the wild-type AGT inhibitor O(6)-benzylguanine (BG). Low-speed spinoculation enhanced transduction more than addition of Polybrene or multiple virus exposures. Addition of cytokines was not required. Low-MOI transduction (< or =1) of human CD34(+) and CD34(+) lin(-) cells with P140K MGMT lentivirus resulted in an average 41% and 89% gene transfer rate as assessed by PCR, respectively, and concordant AGT expression that conferred substantial clonogenic survival advantage after BG/BCNU treatment. During in vitro drug selection, 87% of surviving CD34(+) cell-derived colony-forming units (CFU) were transduced. This work shows the potential utility of lentiviral vectors for drug resistance gene transfer to HSCs for the purpose of in vivo selection and marrow protection. Because drug selection will enrich for transduced progenitors, high MOI can be avoided, improving the safety profile of lentiviral gene transfer.","['Molecular Virology Program, Division of Hematology/Oncology and Comprehensive Cancer Center, Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA']","['5R01CA73062/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5R01ES06288/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach should therefore be of interest for evaluating the therapeutic activity of anti-angiogenic agents on hematopoietic malignancies whose growth has been associated with enhanced angiogenesis. A variety of studies have indicated endostatin to be a potent anti-angiogenic agent both in vitro and in vivo, and a human malignancy that might be sensitive to endostatin is human B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). The demonstrated ability of human B-ALL cells to engraft the marrow of immunodeficient mice suggested the potential of this system for testing an endostatin delivery strategy using co-transplanted non-obese diabetic-scid/scid (NOD/SCID) HSCs engineered to express endostatin. Here we show that, in spite of their mutant scid gene, NOD/SCID HSCs can be transduced with an endostatin-encoding retrovirus at efficiencies that result in a several-fold increase in endostatin serum levels in transplanted recipients. However, this did not alter the regrowth of co-transplanted human B-ALL blasts. These findings validate this gene transfer approach for investigating effects of novel therapeutics on primary human malignant cells that engraft NOD/SCID mice and question the utility of native endostatin for controlling human B-ALL in vivo.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada.']",['P01-HL55435/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],['Mol Ther. 2002 Apr;5(4):338-9.

We have isolated a novel human PHD-finger protein, HBXAP (for hepatitis B virus x associated protein). HBXAP has three alternatively spliced isoforms. We also identified the Drosophila melanogaster HBXAP ortholog, gene CG8677. Based on alignment of four different proteins, we found a novel conserved domain in HBXAP that we designated the HBXAP conserved domain (XCD). We show that HBXAP represses transcription when recruited to DNA via the DNA binding of GAL4. Furthermore, the PHD finger alone suffices to repress transcription, thus attributing a functional role to this domain. The gene HBXAP is localized to the long arm of human chromosome 11 between q13.4 and q14.1. This region is amplified and rearranged in many tumors, suggesting a role for HBXAP in tumorigenesis similar to that of other PHD-containing proteins.","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot 76100, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Filgrastim is a lineage-specific colony-stimulating factor (CSF), mainly affecting neutrophils. In addition to enhancing neutrophil recovery, filgrastim may also enhance neutrophil functional activity. Filgrastim does not have any meaningful effect on monocytes or macrophages; however, recent data indicate that filgrastim has a stimulatory effect on Th2 lymphocyte-inducing dendritic cells. These dendritic cells facilitate humoral immune responses, but they also produce inhibitory cytokines that diminish cell-mediated immunity. Sargramostim is a multilineage CSF, affecting neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Sargramostim has a greater impact on Th1 lymphocyte-inducing dendritic cells, which facilitate cell-mediated immune responses, including antitumor activity. The broader activity of sargramostim on both types of antigen-presenting cells (macrophages and dendritic cells) may account for the reports of benefit beyond enhanced neutrophil recovery that have been seen in clinical trials of patients with leukemia and patients undergoing stem-cell transplantation. Given the disparate activity of these two CSFs on the immune system and the types of immune responses generated, it is prudent for clinicians to consider these effects when choosing an agent for enhancing neutrophil recovery in various clinical settings.","['Department of Pharmacy, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, 525 East 68th Street, Room K 04, New York, NY 10021, USA. dmstull@nyp.org']",,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Splicing, polyadenylation, and expression patterns, as estimated by in silico analysis, differed between the two FLVCR genes despite their similar genomic structures, suggesting active and independent evolution of transcriptional and messenger RNA processing patterns after gene duplication. Promoter activity was bi-directional for hFLVCR, but not for its 14q paralog. The upstream 1q transcribed sequences were determined to comprise a novel gene of unknown function, LQK1. Annotation of contigs centered at hFLVCR and FLVCRL14q also revealed highly conserved gene clusters on chromosomes 1 and 14, inferred to result from a duplication. The clusters contained members of the FLVCR, Angel (KIAA0759), JDP, p21SNFT, and TGF- families, as well as two uncharacterized families. The genome-wide locations of both previously recognized and four de novo in silico predicted genes belonging to these seven families were determined. Phylogenetic analyses of these families were consistent with the hypothesis that the 1q/14q duplication occurred early within, or immediately prior to the vertebrate divergence, after the protostome-deuterostome divergence but before the amniote-amphibian divergence.","['Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195-7710, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY030238', 'GENBANK/AY030239']",,,,,,,

Very little attention has been paid to mtDNA circular dimers (a complex form consisting of two genomes joined head-to-tail) despite their close association with human neoplasia. MtDNA dimers are frequently found in human leukemia, but the clinical relevance of their presence remains unknown. To begin to investigate the role of circular dimer mtDNA in the tumorigenic phenotype, we have created isogenic cell lines containing monomer and dimer mitochondrial genomes and compared the respective nuclear mRNA expression using Affymetrix gene array analysis. Surprisingly, a large number of nuclear gene changes were observed, with one of the largest category of genes being associated with remodeling of the cell surface and extracellular matrix. Since cell growth, migration, apoptosis, and many other cellular processes are influenced by signals initiating from the cell surface, the changes associated with the presence of mtDNA dimers could lead to significant alterations in tumorigenic potential and/or progression.","['Beckman Center for Molecular and Genetic Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These sites are divided into two classes: common and rare. Common fragile sites are expressed in all individuals at different frequencies, whereas rare ones are found only in certain individuals. Common and rare fragile sites have been shown to display a number of characteristics of instability being preferential sites for chromosomal deletions, duplications, and rearrangements. Moreover, a majority of mapped oncogenes are located at or near these fragile sites. These observations have led to the suggestion that both classes of fragile sites may play a significant role in chromosomal rearrangements involved in oncogene activation or tumor supressor gene inactivation. For these reasons, involvement of common and rare fragile sites and their relevance to specific chromosome breakpoints in cancer have received much attention. In this study, which reports on the cytogenetic findings obtained from 256 patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia, 103 with acute myelocytic leukemia, 40 with acute lymphocytic leukemia, 33 with myelodysplastic syndrome, we documented the fragile sites involved in chromosomal aberrations involving oncogenes, tumor supressor genes, and other known genes important in cell cycle regulation localized at these sites.","['Ankara University, Faculty of Medicine, Medical Biology Department, Ankara, Turkey. guvemg@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight patients were also analyzed in relapse. Contrary to previous reports, we could show that the PRAME gene is expressed by CD34(+) stem cells. This might constitute a problem in using PRAME for tumor immunotherapy. Overexpression of PRAME was found in 62% (n=31) of our patients. The rates of overall and disease-free survival in this group were higher than in patients with no or low expression (P<0.05). PRAME expression was negatively correlated to the white blood cell count at diagnosis (P<0.05) and significantly higher in patients with t(8;21). The levels of expression at diagnosis corresponded with those at relapse (P<0.001) and increased levels could be found prior to the relapse in one patient who was regularly monitored. Our results suggest that the expression of PRAME is an indicator of favorable prognosis and could be a useful tool for monitoring minimal residual disease in childhood AML.","[""University Children's Hospital, Jena, Germany. danielsteinbach@hotmail.com""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our aim was to ascertain whether or not a defect in a proapoptotic pathway, caused by a single nucleotide polymorphism that results in loss-of-function of P2X7 in healthy individuals, was present in leukaemic B lymphocytes of patients with CLL. METHODS: We extracted genomic DNA from the peripheral blood leucocytes of 36 unrelated individuals with CLL, four individuals with familial CLL, and 46 age-matched controls. We sequenced a PCR product to detect mutations in exon 13 of P2X7. In most patients with CLL, we measured expression and function of the P2X7 receptor by flow cytometry in B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes. FINDINGS: The prevalence of the polymorphic mutation and the frequency of the mutant allele were three-fold greater in individuals with CLL than in white, elderly controls. Individuals homozygous for the polymorphic allele had no P2X7 receptor function and heterozygotes had half the mean function of that seen in individuals homozygous for the wildtype allele; amounts of ATP-induced apoptosis varied accordingly. In two families, in which we studied a father-son pair and a sister-sister pair with CLL, loss of P2X7 function arose because of inheritance of one or two 1513A-->C alleles for P2X7. INTERPRETATION: Activation of the P2X7 receptor leads to apoptosis of lymphocytes in individuals with CLL, and reduced function of this receptor has an anti-apoptotic effect, resulting in an increase in B-cell numbers. Thus, inheritance of a loss-of-function polymorphic mutation at position 1513 in the P2X7 gene could contribute to the pathogenesis of CLL.","['Sydney University Department of Medicine, Nepean Hospital, PO Box 63, New South Wales, 2751, Penrith, Australia. wileyj@medicine.usyd.edu.au']",,['Lancet. 2002 Dec 14;360(9349):1898-9.

FPy-induced cell death was considered to be apoptotic on the basis of the induction of DNA fragmentation and the protection against these events by the coaddition of a pan-caspase inhibitor. The increase in the cytoplasmic cytochrome c level supported the possibility that FPy-treated cells should have the ability to complete the entire apoptotic process ending in cell fragmentation and apoptotic body formation. At concentrations too low to induce apoptosis, FPy could suppress the induction of apoptotic body formation in HL-60 cells by typical inducers of apoptosis such as actinomycin D or anisomycin.

The functional receptor complex of CNTF is composed of the CNTF receptor alpha (CNTFR), gp130 and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR). Three regions on CNTF have been identified as binding sites for its receptors. The ligand-receptor interactions are mediated through the cytokine binding domains (CBDs) and/or the immunoglobulin-like domains of the receptors. However, in the case of CNTF, the precise nature of the protein-protein contacts in the signaling complex has not yet been resolved. In this study, we provide the first demonstration that the membrane distal CBD (CBD1) of LIFR associates in vitro with soluble CNTFR in the absence of CNTF. Moreover, purified CBD1 partially blocks CNTF signaling, but not that of interleukin-6 or LIF, in human embryonal carcinoma cell line Ntera/D1 cells. These data raise the possibility that LIFR has the capability to form a ligand-free complex with CNTFR.","['Department of Biochemistry and Biotechnology Research Institute, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Two prospective cohort studies, in tandem. The index developed in the initial cohort was subsequently validated in a separate cohort. SETTING: General medicine service of a university teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS: For the development cohort, 524 hospitalized general medical patients aged 70 and older. For the validation cohort, 852 comparable patients. MEASUREMENTS: Administrative diagnosis data were used to construct the proposed index and several other widely used indices (Deyo-adapted Charlson; Acute Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation III conditions; total number of diagnoses; All Patient Refined Diagnosis Related Groups; and Disease Staging). We used receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling to compare our proposed index with the other indices with respect to predictive accuracy and strength of association with 1-year mortality. RESULTS: The High-Risk Diagnoses for the Elderly Scale was developed using 10 high-risk medical diagnoses. Individual condition weights, based on the magnitude of 1-year mortality risk, ranged from 1 (pneumonia, diabetes mellitus with end-organ damage) to 6 (lymphoma/leukemia); possible index scores ranged from 0 to 27. Mortality rates for patients categorized into four risk groups based on the index were 9.5%, 31.8%, 46.4%, and 73.6% in the development cohort (C statistic = 0.76), and 9.9%, 24.3%, 33.6%, and 50.8% in the validation subjects (C statistic = 0.68). The new index was a stronger predictor of mortality than several widely used measures. CONCLUSION: The High-Risk Diagnoses for the Elderly Scale, based on readily available administrative data,is a simple, accurate system for prediction of 1-year mortality in older hospitalized patients that demonstrated generalizability to an independent sample. Future studies are needed to test this index in other settings and populations.","['Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06504, USA.']","['K24 AG 00949/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'P60 AG 10469/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG 12551/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been used in a number of hematopoietic malignancies, for some solid tumor malignancies, for its viral modulation effects, and as a prophylactic approach in the prevention of recurrent disease. The efficacy of this therapy is most evident in patients who have chronic myelogenous leukemia. However, studies of other diseases have been less forthcoming in showing clear benefit. Even in patient groups in which disease remission has been attributed to DLI, the risks of the treatment, namely graft-versus-host disease, may invalidate its use. This article summarizes a number of key studies addressing its usefulness in a number of disease states, risks of therapy, and strategies to ameliorate those risks while preserving benefit. It also examines tools that have been developed to more accurately describe survival benefits attributable to DLI.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Transfusion Medicine Program, Emory University School of Medicine, 1362 Clifton Road NE, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.']",,,,,80,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science (USA).

Ligation of beta1 integrins in NK cells can modulate the lytic capacity in both a positive and a negative manner; however, the contribution of the beta1 integrins present on target cells remains to be evaluated. Here, we analyzed the effect of beta1 integrins expressed by potential tumor target cells on conjugation and cytotoxicity. Using normalized flow cytometry binding assays, we demonstrated that the pretreatment of MOLT-4, K562, U-937 and HL-60 human leukemia target cell lines with selected anti-beta1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) increased conjugation to human NK cell line NKL as well as to purified NK cells. Only mAb recognizing residues 207-218 of the beta1 subunit and functionally involved in the induction of homotypic adhesion (functional epitope A1) increased conjugation of all the target cells. Moreover, mAb to adhesion molecules different from beta1 but also inducers of homotypic adhesion of the target cells, i.e. CD43 and CD50 (ICAM-3), failed to increase conjugation to NKL cells. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that lysis of NK-sensitive target cells (MOLT-4) also increased after pretreatment with anti-beta1 epitope A1 mAb. Importantly, pretreatment of NK-resistant target cells (U-937 and HL-60) with anti-beta1 mAb was not able to outweigh the cytotoxic inhibitory mechanisms controlled by HLA class I molecules. However, simultaneous masking of HLA class I molecules with mAb and pretreatment with anti-beta1 mAb rendered NK-resistant cells susceptible to lysis, as predicted by the missing self hypothesis. Triggering of tumor target cells through beta1 integrins may thus play a role in conjugation to NK cells as well as in co-stimulation of cell-mediated cytotoxicity.","['Division of Immunology, Miguel Hernandez University, 03550 San Juan de Alicante, Spain.']",,,,,,,,20020228,,,,,,,,,,

SETTING: Medical ICU in a French teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: We conducted a study to describe critically ill cancer patients with ARDS during neutropenia recovery (defined as the 7-day period centered on the day the neutrophil count rose above 1000/mm3 [day 0]) and to compare them with critically ill cancer patients without ARDS during neutropenia recovery. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: During a 10-yr period, 62 critically ill cancer patients recovered from neutropenia, of whom 21 experienced ARDS during neutropenia recovery, with a median time of -1 days (-2.5-1) between day 0 and ARDS. In-ICU mortality in these 21 patients was 61.9%. As compared with non-ARDS patients, ARDS patients were less likely to have myeloma and more likely to have leukemia/lymphoma treated with adriamycin, a history of pneumonia before neutropenia, and a neutropenia duration >10 days; they had a shorter time since malignancy diagnosis and a longer time from chemotherapy to neutropenia. Neither the leukocyte counts on day 0 nor those during the 6-day neutropenia recovery period were predictive of ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute respiratory failure after prolonged neutropenia complicated by pneumonia are at increased risk for ARDS.","['Medical Intensive Care Unit, Saint Louis University Hospital, USA.']",,['Crit Care Med. 2002 Apr;30(4):938-40.

Because until now only case reports or very small series of patients have been described, a more systematically performed study is warranted. DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective evaluation was carried out on 38 patients with the diagnosis of ET/RS and more than 15 % ringed sideroblasts on smears. Simultaneously performed bone marrow biopsies, follow-up examinations and survival data were also available. RESULTS: Based on cytological features and particular bone marrow findings including immunohistochemistry three patterns could be determined. These were associated with different clinical features and in particular prognosis. Group I included six patients whose diagnosis was consistent with ET, group II comprised 21 patients revealing prefibrotic and early fibrotic chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis (CIMF) and finally 11 patients (group III) displayed myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Follow-up studies revealed that no patient with ET showed a fiber increase but eight CIMF patients developed overt myelofibrosis and four patients of the MDS group developed secondary acute myeloid leukemia. In comparison with a control group of 39 patients with true ET, prognosis was significantly different because our cohort showed a median survival of 100 months that contrasted significantly with the 170 months in the patients with true ET. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Ringed sideroblasts are not a pathognomonic feature of MDS, but may indicate a dysplasia probably associated with a primary or secondary disturbance of iron metabolism in a variety of disorders. For this reason, a more accurate classification of so-called ET/RS patients is warranted by evaluation of smears and in particular bone marrow biopsy specimens. According to our findings these patients should be classified as having either ET, CIMF or MDS and show a significantly different survival pattern.","['Institutes of Pathology, Universities of Freiburg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of our study was to determine whether apoptotic index, p53 and bcl-2 levels correlate with the clinical consequences of ineffective hematopoiesis; namely, the development of cytopenia and the shortened survival of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. DESIGN AND METHODS: The apoptotic index, determined by TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling, as well as bcl-2 and p53 protein levels, evaluated by immunohistochemistry, were studied in bone marrow trephine biopsy archival samples from 25 healthy subjects aged over fifty (control group), 61 consecutive patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and 17 patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia according to FAB criteria. The correlation between relevant clinical parameters was analyzed with Spearman's correlation test. Factors influencing survival were studied by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. RESULTS: The apoptotic index did not correlate with blood counts at diagnosis and had no prognostic influence on the overall survival of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. The p53 score correlated with both the leukocyte count (r=-0.274, p=0.034, Spearman's) and hemoglobin concentration (r=-0.316; p=0.014) in the myelodysplastic syndrome patients and showed an independent and significant prognostic influence on their overall survival (p=0.045, Cox's) while the bcl-2 score was not correlated with their blood counts or prognosis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Apoptotic index and bcl-2 do not correlate with key clinical data in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, while p53 levels show a good correlation with these data and may be a useful parameter to add to current prognostic schemes in this entity.","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital de Leon, Altos de Nava s/n E-24071 Leon, Spain. framoso@aehh.org']",,['Haematologica. 2002 Apr;87(4):337-9.

As the number of known translocations, specific for different types of leukemia increases, it takes ever more time and increasing amounts of patient's material to screen a single patient with individual polymerase chain reactions (PCR). The aim of this study was to develop a new approach combining specificity with high-throughput sufficient for rapid screening of clinical samples for the presence of numerous translocations. DESIGN AND METHODS: We designed an oligonucleotide microarray and used hybridization with microarrays in combination with multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay for accurate and rapid identification of some major leukemias. The following translocations were used as prototypic: t(9;22) p210 and p190, t(4;11), t(12;21), and t(15;17). This approach was tested on five different cell cultures carrying translocations and on 22 clinical samples from leukemic patients. RESULTS: Distinctive hybridization signals were obtained for all types of chimeric transcripts from cell lines with translocations. Both the type of translocation and the splice variant were determined. The data demonstrated high specificity and reproducibility of the method. Analysis of the 22 clinical samples using the microarray-based approach showed complete agreement with standard PCR analysis. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that oligonucleotide microarrays can be used as an efficient, alternative approach to the traditional post-PCR Southern blot analysis. The oligonucleotide microarray approach appears suitable for clinical screening of major risk-stratifying translocations in patients with leukemia.","['Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow, Russia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN AND METHODS: A variety of clinical and laboratory techniques including cell marker, cytogenetic and histologic studies were applied in order to establish the diagnosis. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Southern blotting were used for mapping the translocation breakpoint and Western blotting for assessing protein expression. RESULTS: Immunophenotyping showed the presence of a B-cell population with strong expression of FMC7, CD22, CD79b, CD5 and k restricted surface immunoglobulins. Based on morphology and immunophenotypic markers the diagnosis of B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was made. Karyotyping revealed a clone with t(2;7)(p12;q21-22). Evidence for clonal evolution with additional abnormalities including a deletion of the TP53 was present. We established by FISH and Southern blotting that the breakpoint on 7q21-22 fell in a region 66kb telomeric to the previously reported breakpoint for the t(2;7) and was the same as that observed in a t(7;21). CDK6 protein was over-expressed. The patient received alkylating agents and splenectomy and is alive but the lymphocytosis persists with evidence of disease progression. INTERPRETATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that CDK6 expression is dysregulated even when the breakpoint on 7q21-22 is located 66kb upstream from the coding region. Interestingly, the precise assignment of the lymphoma type in our case was not possible even when the splenic histology was analyzed.","['FRC Path, Academic Department of Hematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden NHS Trust/Institute of Cancer Research, 203, Fulham Road, London SW3 6JJ, UK. vasantha@icr.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A new classification system for lymphoid malignancies, known as the new World Health Organization (WHO) classification, has been proposed recently based on these findings. The relative incidence of the subtypes of malignant lymphoma is known to differ according to geographic location. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL) is a human malignancy associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), and the Kyushu islands are an HTLV-1 endemic area. To clarify the relationship between the histological classification and prognosis of lymphoid malignancies, we reclassified previous cases in our department and summarized our previous reports using the WHO classification. Of 933 cases of lymphoid malignancies, 471 (50%) were B-cell lymphoma, 396 (42%) T/natural killer (NK)-cell lymphoma and 41 (4%) Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). Analysis of clinical outcome showed favorable prognosis for HL, intermediate for B-cell lymphoma and poor prognosis for T-cell lymphoma. Among B-cell lymphomas, the commonest type was diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n = 281; 60%). Marginal zone lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) was diagnosed in 82 cases (17%), follicular lymphoma in 52 (11%) and mantle cell lymphoma in 24 (5%). Other less common lymphomas were Burkitt lymphoma (n = 9; 2%) and lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 5; 1%). Using overall survival rates, the various B-cell lymphoma types could be divided into three broad groups for prognostic purposes: (i) low-risk group comprising follicular lymphoma and MALT; (ii) intermediate-risk group comprising diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma; and (iii) high-risk group comprising mantle cell lymphoma and lymphoblastic lymphoma. Among the T/NK-cell lymphomas, the commonest type was ATLL (n = 191; 48%), followed by peripheral T-cell lymphoma, unspecified (n = 83; 21%), angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia (AILD) (n = 38; 10%), anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (n = 22; 6%). Less common types were lymphoblastic lymphoma (n = 17; 4%), nasal and nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma (n = 17; 4%), mycosis fungoides (MF) (n = 9; 2%) and other rare types. With respect to clinical prognosis, T/NK-cell lymphomas fell into three groups: (i) relative low-risk group comprising ALCL, AILD, MF and lymphoblastic lymphoma; (ii) relative intermediate-risk group comprising NK/T-cell lymphoma and unspecified lymphoma; and (iii) extremely high-risk group comprising ATLL. Among the lymphoblastic lymphomas, B-cell type and T-cell type lymphomas exhibited different clinical outcomes. We conclude that the histological, phenotypic and genotypic classification of the new WHO system should be beneficial for the clinical approach to these tumors.","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan. ohshima@fukuoka-u.ac.jp']",,,,,45,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The three mRNA splice variants resulting in one transmembrane (muIfnar-2c) and two soluble (muIfnar-2a/2a') mRNA isoforms are generated by alternative RNA processing of the muIfnar-2 gene. Treatment of a range of murine cell lines with a combination of type I and II IFN showed that the muIfnar-2a and -2c mRNA isoforms were up-regulated independently of each other in L929 fibroblasts and hepa-1c1c7 hepatoma cells, but not in M1 myeloid leukaemia cells. Analysis of the 5' flanking region of muIfnar-2 using promoter-luciferase reporter constructs defined three regulatory regions: a region proximal to exon 1, conferring high basal expression, a distal region conferring inducible expression, and a negative regulatory region between the two.

Major causes of death were relapse, organ failure, GVHD, and infection. In multivariate analysis, improved relapse-free survival was associated with good cytogenetic risk (P = .002) and shorter disease duration (P = .004). NRM was increased with longer disease duration (P = .0002), positive cytomegalovirus serology (P = .02), and male sex (P = .02). Relapse was associated with poor cytogenetic risk (P = .0004). Thus, BU/TBI conditioning as used in this trial was associated with relapse rates comparable to those observed with a previously used more intensive regimen combining BU/TBI with cyclophosphamide. However, despite the omission of cyclophosphamide, transplantation-related morbidity and mortality were considerable, particularly with transplants from unrelated donors. Future trials should explore the efficacy and tolerability of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens.","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA.']","['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Toxicity was in part related to an increased incidence of GVHD. Because T-cell depletion of donor bone marrow reduces the incidence of GVHD and other treatment-related complications after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, it was postulated that TBI dose may be safely escalated in this setting and may decrease the risk of relapse following TCD BMT. Herein, we report the results of a trial assessing the safety and impact of escalated doses of TBI after TCD BMT. Two hundred adults with hematologic malignancies were treated in consecutive cohorts defined by increasing doses of TBI (1400, 1480, and 1560 cGy) in combination with cyclophosphamide. In vitro T-cell depletion using anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody was used for GVHD prophylaxis. The incidence of grade II or greater acute GVHD in patients receiving 1560 cGy (36%) was significantly higher than in patients receiving 1400 cGy (18%) (P = .04) or 1480 cGy (13%) (P = .01). Two-year treatment-related mortality was significantly higher in patients who received 1560 cGy of TBI (33%) than in those who received 1400 cGy (20%) (P = .04) or 1480 cGy (19%) (P = .05). The increased dose of TBI did not reduce the rates of relapse, with the estimated 2-year risk of relapse being 24% (1400 cGy), 24% (1480 cGy), and 31% (1560 cGy) for the 3 cohorts of patients. Overall survival at 2 years was inferior for patients receiving 1560 cGy of TBI (36%) compared with those who received 1400 cGy (55%) or 1480 cGy (58%) (P = .01). We conclude that dose escalation of TBI is associated with increased GVHD and inferior survival following TCD BMT. Future efforts to reduce the risk of relapse after TCD BMT should focus on immunologic methods to induce the graft-versus-leukemia effect after BMT rather than intensification of the ablative regimen by escalation of irradiation dose.","['Center for Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA. edwin_alyea@dfci.harvard.edu']",['AI29530/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conditioning regimen consisted of total body irradiation, cytarabine, and cyclophosphamide, and cyclosporine and short-term methotrexate were employed for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Hematological reconstitution was rapid, and only grade I acute GVHD was observed. The patient has been in remission for more than 24 months after transplantation.

Bone marrow aspiration and cytogenetic analysis demonstrated that his bone marrow was still in the chronic phase, with minor cytogenetic response. Continuing interferon-alpha for 6 months in combination with oral cytarabine ocfosfate resulted in the disappearance of the neck lymph node swellings followed by CCR in the bone marrow.

The limit of detection in both assays was 5 copies of the target/10(5) cell equivalents. We tested the assays in 17 childhood malignancies (14 cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 3 of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma). High correlation coefficients of the standard curves (>0.980) and PCR efficiency (>0.95) were achieved with all primer/probe sets. In 2 (12%) of the 17 patients, ASO primers could not be designed because there was no junctional N-sequence. The quantitative data suggest that the copy number of clonal antigen receptors markedly decreased after induction therapy in 15 of 17 patients and that 1 patient relapsed and died of the disease.

Survivin is an inhibitor of apoptosis that shows selective expression during fetal development and in human malignancies. Survivin expression was examined in human leukemias using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Survivin gene expression was detected in 17 of 31 patients with acute myelocytic leukemia and 11 of 16 patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia but was not identified in normal bone marrow cells. Survivin expression was lower in patients with M3 acute myelocytic leukemia than in patients with other types of acute leukemia. Survivin was not detected in the chronic phase of chronic myelocytic leukemia but was observed in 5 of 7 patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia in blastic crisis. These findings suggest a relationship between survivin gene expression and hematopoietic cell differentiation. In fact, survivin gene expression was down-regulated during the differentiation of HL-60 cells after treatment with dimethyl sulfoxide or all-trans-retinoic acid. Moreover, the disease-free survival rates of patients with survivin expression were lower than in patients without survivin expression. Accordingly, survivin may have a role in leukemogenesis as well as in other malignancies. Detecting survivin may also provide prognostic information.","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 2 resistant cell lines exhibit similar levels of resistance to DNR and decreased drug accumulation. Altered drug subcellular distribution in the resistant cell lines compared to that in the sensitive cell lines was shown and, moreover, differences in drug distributions between the 2 resistant cell lines were found. DNR fluorescence in the resistant HL60 cell line was distributed into punctate regions in the cytoplasm; the nucleus and other cytoplasm were almost negative. In contrast, the resistant K562 cells showed a bright fluorescent signal located in the peripheral cytoplasm and perinuclear region; the nucleus and other cytoplasmic regions showed no signal. Use of the modulator verapamil increased drug accumulation and restored the altered subcellular distribution of the drug in the 2 resistant cell lines. The Golgi apparatus inhibitor brefeldin A had similar action in the resistant HL60 line but had little effect in the resistant K562 line.

For example, by gene marking autologous bone marrow grafts it has been possible to demonstrate that infused marrow contributes to relapse in acute and chronic myeloid leukemias. In the allogeneic transplant setting, genetically modified T-cells have proven valuable for the prophylaxis and treatment of viral diseases and may have an important role in preventing or treating disease relapse. Gene transfer is also being used to modify tumor function, enhance immunogenicity, and confer drug-resistance to normal hematopoietic stem cells.

The high incidence of oral cancer in this region is attributed to frequent use of tobacco (Shamma). In this report we have reviewed the mode of treatment and subsequent outcome of 228 oral cancer patients at the Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Unit of the Armed Forces Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS: In this retrospective study the case notes of 228 oral cancer patients treated at the Armed Forces Hospital, Riyadh were reviewed. Age, sex, presenting symptoms, location of cancer in oral cavity, habit of tobacco chewing, mode of treament and complications as a result of treatment were recorded. RESULTS: Out of 228 patients 149 were males and 79 were females with age ranging from 23 to 82 years. The majority of patients (58%) had tobacco chewing habit. Most of the patients received radiation therapy (98%), some times with adjuvant chemotherapy. Seventy-three percent of patients underwent surgery followed by radiotherapy, whereas 2% had surgery alone. Recurrence of the disease was observed in 56% of the patients over a period of 5 years following initial treatment. CONCLUSION: A close association between tobacco chewing and oral cancer was observed. It is concluded that post surgery radiotherapy is a highly successful method of treatment in patients with oral cancer. Cases with a history of shamma usage did not show deep invasion even when the tumor was large. They also showed good prognosis after excision but more resistant to radiotherapy comparing with those cases with no history of shamma usage.

TL binds preferentially to CD8alphaalpha homodimers with a 10-fold higher affinity than H-2K(b) class I molecules. To understand the molecular basis for this difference, we created a panel of CD8alpha mutants and tested the ability of the CD8alphaalpha homodimers to bind to H-2K(b) tetramers and TL tetramers. Mutations in three CD8 residues located on the complementarity-determining region-like loops contacting the negatively charged loop in the alpha3 domain of MHC class I greatly reduced binding to both tetramers. Because TL and H-2K(b) class I sequences are highly conserved in the alpha3 domain of MHC class I, this suggests that CD8 contacts the alpha3 domain of TL and H-2K(b) in a similar manner. In contrast, mutations in residues on the A and B beta strands of CD8 that are involved in contact with beta(2)-microglobulin affected interaction with the H-2K(b) tetramer, but not the TL tetramer. Therefore, the orientation of interaction of TL with CD8 appears to be different from that of H-2K(b). The unique high affinity binding of TL with CD8alphaalpha is most likely a result of amino acid differences in the alpha3 domain between TL and H-2K(b), particularly at positions 198 (K to D) and 228 (M to T), which are contact residues in the CD8alphaalpha-H-2K(b) cocrystal.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Section of Immunobiology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']","['AI50263/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA48115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK54451/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have investigated the effect of etoposide schedule on cell cycle distribution, apoptosis and p21(waf1) and cdk1(p34) status in two bcr-abl-positive chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) cell lines (K562 and KU812) and two small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines (H69 and GLC4). During a continuous 5-day exposure, the SCLC cell lines showed a time and concentration-dependent loss of cell viability, with an initial block in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle followed by apoptosis. In contrast, the two CML cell lines showed no significant apoptosis or loss of viability after a similar block in G2/M. However, when K562 or KU812 cells were placed in drug-free medium following a 3-day drug exposure there was marked, concentration-dependent apoptosis (% apoptosis after release at 1 microM etoposide in K562, 10% at 24 h, 30% at 48 h). Our data also show that p21(waf1) does not increase after etoposide treatment in either H69 or GLC4 (both with mutated-p53). Although K562 and KU812 cells are null-p53, the arrest in G2/M during drug exposure was associated with increased p21(waf1) and a decrease in cdk1 (both P<0.001 compared with controls). Upon release of these cells from drug-medium, p21(waf1) gradually returned to control levels, which was associated with an easing of the block at G2/M and an induction of apoptosis. This study highlights the importance of cell cycle regulatory proteins in drug sensitivity and resistance, and suggests that in cells such as K562 and KU812, a pulsed schedule may be more active than a single prolonged exposure.","[""Barry Reed Oncology Laboratory, 4th Floor, 38 Little Britain, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield, London EC1A 7BE, UK. w.a.i.liu@mds.qmv.ac.uk""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper is an attempt to explain these signal increases based upon a simulation of the backscattered signals from the cells nuclei. The simulation is an expansion of work in which a condensed sample of cells, with fairly regular sizes, could be considered as an imperfect crystal. Thus, destructive interference could occur and this would be observed as a large reduced value of backscattered signals compared with the values obtained from a similar, but random, scattering source. This current paper explores the possibility that simple changes in the nuclei, such as their observed condensation or the small loss of nuclei scatterers from cells, could cause a significant increase in the observed backscattered signals. This model indicates that the greater backscattered signals can be explained by further randomisation of the average positions of the scattering sources in each cell. When these ""microechoes"" are added together, so that the destructive interference is reduced, a large increase in the signal is predicted. The simplified model strongly suggests that much of observed large increases of the backscattered signals could be simply explained by the randomisation of the position of the condensed nuclei during apoptosis, and the destruction of the nuclei could produce further signal amplitude changes due to disruption of the cloud of backscattered waves.","['University Health Network/Princess Margaret Hospital, 610 University Ave., Toronto, Canada. hunt@oci.utoronto.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance of those cells to the anticancer drugs doxorubicin, etoposide, cisplatin, and vindesine was tested with the MTT method. Expression of multidrug resistance protein mRNAs (MDR1, MRP1, cMOAT/MRP2, and LRP) was analyzed with reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Doxorubicin subcellular distribution in those cells was examined by fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: S1TcTax05 and S1TcTax10 showed resistance to doxorubicin, etoposide, and vindesine, but not to cisplatin as compared with S1T or S1Tneo. RT-PCR demonstrated that MRP1 mRNA was expressed, but MDR1, cMOAT, and LRP mRNAs were not in S1T or S1Tneo. Marked expression of LRP mRNA was detected, but no change of MDR1, MRP1, or cMOAT mRNA expression in Tax-expressing S1TcTax05 and S1TcTax10. Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated that doxorubicin was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm of S1TcTax05 and S1TcTax10, and in the nucleus of S1T and S1Tneo. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Tax-related drug resistance of ATL cells is due to LRP and not MDR1, as reported previously. These findings in cells derived from an ATL patient suggest a novel mechanism for drug resistance in Tax-expressing ATL cells.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Sakuragaoka 8-35-1, Kagoshima 890-8520, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blasts from childhood ALL patients with a hyperdiploid karyotype have a tendency to apoptosis when cultured on stromal layers in vitro. In this study, we apply a novel method to investigate the relationship between apoptosis and hyperdiploidy in lymphoblasts of childhood ALL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The DNA content of individual ALL blasts in Feulgen-stained archival bone marrow smears can be determined by static cytometry. TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling) detects the DNA degradation associated with apoptosis. We performed TUNEL in situ sequential to DNA ploidy analysis in archival bone marrow smears from 12 patients with childhood ALL. RESULTS: Five patients were diploid and seven were hyperdiploid (51-65 chromosomes) by conventional cytogenetic analysis. In the five diploid cases, the percentage of TUNEL-positive blasts ranged from 1.0% to 1.3%; in the seven hyperdiploid cases, the percentage of TUNEL-positive blasts ranged from 3.6% to 9.0%. Comparing TUNEL and corresponding Feulgen images, we found that apoptotic blasts were predominantly of high DNA ploidy in both diploid and hyperdiploid cases. The mean DNA value of apoptotic blasts was larger than that of the total blast population in each case. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate an increased incidence of spontaneous apoptosis in situ of hyperdiploid blasts in ALL bone marrow and indicate that this phenomenon is not restricted to in vitro cultures. The findings provide a possible rationale for the good prognosis associated with hyperdiploid childhood ALL.","['Department of Pathology, National University Hospital, National University of Singapore, Singapore 119074.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the respective roles of growth factors, stromal contact, and extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands in this effect are not clear. Here we investigated the role of direct contact with stroma and the ECM protein fibronectin (FN) in these effects, and investigated whether abnormal integrin receptor function in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) progenitors was associated with perturbation in these responses. METHODS: Normal bone marrow CD34+ cells were cultured in GF-containing medium with or without contact with stromal layers, glutaraldehyde-fixed stromal layers (stroma-contact), or integrin-binding FN fragments for 7 days. Progeny cells were assayed for primitive progenitors in week-6 long-term culture-initiating cell (LTC-IC) and week-10 extended LTC-IC (ELTC-IC) assays. RESULTS: Increased LTC-IC and ELTC-IC preservation was seen following coculture with stroma, and was also observed after culture in contact with fixed stromal layers and FN. Both alpha4beta1 and alpha5beta1-integrin binding FN fragments enhanced LTC-IC preservation. Analysis of single CD34+CD38- cells showed that coculture with FN resulted in significantly reduced cell division, but enhanced retention of LTC-IC capacity in divided cells. FN also increased LTC-IC frequency in undivided cells. CML progenitors demonstrate deficient integrin-mediated adhesion, migration, and signaling.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, sequencing analysis, immunoblotting, and Southern blotting. RESULTS: We found overexpression of novel short isoforms of Helios (Hel-5 and Hel-6) in the HD-Mar cell line. Southern blot analysis suggested that there might be a small deletion in the Helios locus of HD-Mar. In addition, we observed decreased expression of more than one Ikaros family gene in 3 of 9 patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Moreover, one of the patients overexpressed novel short isoforms of Helios (Hel-7 and Hel-8). CONCLUSION: This study provides the first evidence of an Ikaros family member (other than Ikaros) of which novel short isoforms become overexpressed in human leukemia.","['Department of Medicine, University of Okayama, 2-5-1 Shikatacho, Okayama 700-8558, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We used data from US death certificates from 1983 to 1997 to calculate median age at death and standardised mortality odds ratios (SMORs) for common medical disorders in people with Down's syndrome. FINDINGS: Of 17897 people reported to have Down's syndrome, median age at death increased from 25 years in 1983 to 49 years in 1997, an average increase of 1.7 years per year studied (p<0.0001). Median age at death was significantly lower in black people and people of other races than in white people with Down's syndrome. As expected, death certificates with a diagnosis of Down's syndrome were more likely to list congenital heart defects (SMOR 29.1, 95% CI 27.8-30.4), dementia (21.2, 19.6-22.7), hypothyroidism (20.3, 18.5-22.3), or leukaemia (1.6, 1.4-1.8) than were those that did not report Down's syndrome. By contrast, malignant neoplasms other than leukaemia were listed on death certificates of people with Down's syndrome less than one-tenth as often as expected (0.07, 0.06-0.08). A strikingly low SMOR for malignancy was associated with Down's syndrome at all ages, in both sexes, and for all common tumour types except leukaemia and testicular cancer. INTERPRETATION: Identification of factors responsible for the racial differences recorded could facilitate further improvement in survival of people with Down's syndrome. Reduced exposure to environmental factors that contribute to cancer risk, tumour-suppressor genes on chromosome 21, or a slower rate of replication or higher likelihood of apoptosis in Down's syndrome cells, could be possible reasons for paucity of cancer in people with Down's syndrome.","['National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 4770 Buford Highway, MS F-45, Atlanta, GA 30341, USA. qyang@cdc.gov']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The vector contains the terminal sequences of two Moloney murine leukemia virus retroviral long terminal repeats (LTRs), fused to form a junction fragment, and is flanked by two loxP recognition sequences. Cre recombinase-directed excision liberates a circular, double-stranded DNA molecule containing the LTR junction fragment. Despite the natural intermediate for retroviral integrase being a linear DNA molecule, we show that, in the presence of Cre and retroviral Gag and Pol, the excised circle can be integrated into the target cell genome through both specific integrase (Int)-directed mechanisms and by a random integration process. The loxP cassette, carrying in addition a selectable marker gene, was incorporated into the E1-deleted region of an adenoviral vector. Infection of cells expressing Cre, Gag, and Pol generated clones that survived long term in drug selection (>3 months). Int-mediated integration was demonstrated in seven of nine clones by sequencing of the integration sites. In addition, the introduction of the loxP cassette into 293 cells coexpressing Cre and Int alone in the absence of other Gag and Pol proteins was sufficient to catalyze the integration mechanism. These experiments demonstrate that it is possible to generate high-titer adenovirus-mediated delivery of a C-type retroviral provirus that can subsequently undergo retroviral Int-mediated integration into dividing and nondividing cells.","['Molecular Medicine Program, Guggenheim 1836, Mayo Foundation, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus all possible factors that can help modify the immune response should be taken into account in order to intervene, whenever possible, with therapies based on defined abnormalities to reduce the rate of post-surgical infections. Many factors associated with the patient have been clearly identified as responsible for a decreased immune response: old age, concomitant diseases (diabetes, renal and liver failure, solid and hematologic neoplasias, malnutrition, autoimmune diseases, AIDS) and concomitant therapies (corticosteroid, cytotoxic agents). Old age can affect both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. Chronic diseases can be responsible for a reduced primary response or depression of delayed hypersensitivity reactions (renal failure, neoplasias) or changes in leukocyte function (diabetes, leukemia, lymphomas). Malnutrition frequently accompanies diseases such as cancer, chronic and acute pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel diseases. Deficiencies in important vitamins and minerals (B6, A, folate, biotin, riboflavin...) can alter significantly the leukocyte function and immune response. Finally, there appears to be innate immune-suppression following any form of injury which is correlated with its magnitude and can affect any aspect of immunity. This has been well studied both in burn and surgical trauma. Alteration of phagocytosis, opsonization and chemotaxis are typically affected in burns, whereas surgical stress can include some reduction of cell mediated immunity. The best approach today to minimizing post-surgical infections is probably, besides use of antibiotic prophylaxis, to reduce the surgical trauma which consequently reduces the stress response and immune-suppression and to optimize the immune response by maintaining homeostasis through nutritional support.","['Dept. of Infectious Diseases, Second University of Naples, Italy.']",,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our current understanding is that this is an oversimplification and corticotrophs are a dynamic and more complex group of cells. The biosynthetic precursors of ACTH and other cleavage products of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) have been found to be secreted by anterior pituitary cells, to circulate and to have biological activity. POMC and the biosynthetic intermediate, pro-ACTH, exert activity antagonistic to ACTH(1-39) on glucocorticoid secretion by adrenal cells, and other derivatives of POMC are mitogenic to adrenocortical cells. In terms of responses to hypothalamic and peripheral factors, corticotrophs are functionally heterogeneous. This is reflected in the sensitivity of individual subtypes of corticotrophs to CRH, vasopressin and glucocorticoids. There is a functional plasticity amongst the various types of corticotrophs. During gestation, in fetal sheep, changes occur in the overall ACTH-secretory responses to CRH relative to vasopressin, the proportions of total corticotrophs that respond to the respective peptides and the average secretory response of individual cells. Corticotrophs also respond to locally produced pituitary factors. Local actions of leukaemia inhibitory factor are demonstrated by the effects of immunoneutralization of the peptide in pituitary cells.

FS-cells are positive for S-100 protein and produce many cytokines or growth factors, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), basic fibroblastic growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF). Therefore, it is generally accepted that FS-cells regulate endocrine cells through these growth factors. FS-cells also exhibit a phagocytotic activity and are known to work as scavenger cells. In addition to these functions, FS-cells are considered to have some unknown functions. In order to reveal the biological significance of FS-cells in the anterior pituitary gland, we performed a morphological study and obtained some new findings. First, we were interested in the colloid formation in the senescent porcine pituitary gland. We analyzed the colloids and found that clusterin is a major protein in them. We also found that the accumulation of clusterin in the colloids is related to the phagocytotic activity of FS-cells. In our next study, we found that FS-cells have the potential to differentiate into striated muscle cells. From FS-cells show multi-potent cell character and other cytological evidence, we propose that FS-cells are candidate of organ-specific stem cells in the anterior pituitary gland.","['Department of Regulation Biology, Faculty of Science, Saitama University, Urawa, Japan. kininoue@seitai.saitama-u.ac.jp']",,,,,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Mortality analyses were based on standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) using the general population of California as a reference. Additional analyses of lymphatic and haematopoietic cancer deaths and diseases related to asbestos were undertaken. RESULTS: The update consisted of 18,512 employees, who contributed 456,425 person-years of observation between 1950 and 1995. Both overall mortality and total cancer mortality were significantly lower than expected, as were several site specific cancers and non-malignant diseases. In particular, no significant increases were reported for leukaemia cell types or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Mortality excess from multiple myeloma was marginally significant. The excess was confined to employees enrolled before 1949. Furthermore, there was no significant upward trend based on duration of employment, which argues against a causal interpretation relative to employment or exposures at the refineries. No increase was found for diseases related to asbestos: pulmonary fibrosis; lung cancer; or malignant mesothelioma. There was no significant increase in mortality from any other cancers or non-malignant diseases. CONCLUSION: This second update provides additional reassurance that employment at these two refineries is not associated with increased risk of mortality.","['Toxicology and Health Risk Assessment, Chevron Texaco Energy Research and Technology Company, Richmond, CA 94802-0627, USA.']",,['Occup Environ Med. 2003 Apr;60(4):304-5; author reply 305-6.

Epub 2002 Apr 4.,,"Platelet activating factor (PAF) interacts with cell surface G protein-coupled receptors on leukocytes to induce degranulation, leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) generation, and chemokine CCL2 production. Using a basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cell line expressing wild-type PAF receptor (PAFR) and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (mPAFR), we have previously demonstrated that receptor phosphorylation mediates desensitization of PAF-induced degranulation. Here, we sought to determine the role of receptor phosphorylation on PAF-induced LTC(4) generation and CCL2 production. We found that PAF caused a significantly enhanced LTC(4) generation in cells expressing mPAFR when compared with PAFR cells. In contrast, PAF-induced CCL2 production was greatly reduced in mPAFR cells. Pertussis toxin and U0126, which inhibit G(i) and p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) activation, respectively, caused very little inhibition of PAF-induced CCL2 production (approximately 20% inhibition). In contrast, these inhibitors almost completely blocked both PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation and LTC(4) generation in PAFR cells. However, in mPAFR cells pertussis toxin only partially inhibited PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation. A Ca(2+)/calmodulin inhibitor had no effect on PAF-induced ERK phosphorylation in PAFR cells but completely blocked the response in mPAFR cells. These data demonstrate that receptor phosphorylation, which serves to desensitize PAF-induced LTC(4) generation, is required for chemokine CCL2 production. They also indicate a previously unrecognized selectivity in G protein usage and ERK activation for PAF-induced responses. Whereas PAF-induced CCL2 production is, in large part, mediated independently of G(i) activation or ERK phosphorylation, LTC(4) generation requires ERK phosphorylation, which is mediated by different G proteins depending on the phosphorylation status of the receptor.","['Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania School of Dental Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104, USA.']","['HL-54166/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-63372/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,20020404,,,,,,,,,,

Consequently, the normal function of RUNX1 and its involvement in leukemogenesis remain subject to intensive research. To further elucidate the role of RUNX1 in hematopoiesis, we cloned the zebrafish ortholog (runx1) and analyzed its function using this model system. Zebrafish runx1 is expressed in hematopoietic and neuronal cells during early embryogenesis. runx1 expression in the lateral plate mesoderm co-localizes with the hematopoietic transcription factor scl, and expression of runx1 is markedly reduced in the zebrafish mutants spadetail and cloche. Transient expression of runx1 in cloche embryos resulted in partial rescue of the hematopoietic defect. Depletion of Runx1 with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides abrogated the development of both blood and vessels, as demonstrated by loss of circulation, incomplete development of vasculature and the accumulation of immature hematopoietic precursors. The block in definitive hematopoiesis is similar to that observed in Runx1 knockout mice, implying that zebrafish Runx1 has a function equivalent to that in mammals. Our data suggest that zebrafish Runx1 functions in both blood and vessel development at the hemangioblast level, and contributes to both primitive and definitive hematopoiesis. Depletion of Runx1 also caused aberrant axonogenesis and abnormal distribution of Rohon-Beard cells, providing the first functional evidence of a role for vertebrate Runx1 in neuropoiesis. To provide a base for examining the role of Runx1 in leukemogenesis, we investigated the effects of transient expression of a human RUNX1-CBF2T1 transgene [product of the t(8;21) translocation in acute myeloid leukemia] in zebrafish embryos. Expression of RUNX1-CBF2T1 caused disruption of normal hematopoiesis, aberrant circulation, internal hemorrhages and cellular dysplasia. These defects reproduce those observed in Runx1-depleted zebrafish embryos and RUNX1-CBF2T1 knock-in mice. The phenotype obtained with transient expression of RUNX1-CBF2T1 validates the zebrafish as a model system to study t(8;21)-mediated leukemogenesis.","['Division of Molecular Medicine, The University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.']",['RR10715/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/AF391125'],,,,,,,

The latter is a nonstandard problem in parametric cluster analysis because the dimension of the feature space (the number of genes) is typically much greater than the number of tissues. A feasible approach is provided by first selecting a subset of the genes relevant for the clustering of the tissue samples by fitting mixtures of t distributions to rank the genes in order of increasing size of the likelihood ratio statistic for the test of one versus two components in the mixture model. The imposition of a threshold on the likelihood ratio statistic used in conjunction with a threshold on the size of a cluster allows the selection of a relevant set of genes. However, even this reduced set of genes will usually be too large for a normal mixture model to be fitted directly to the tissues, and so the use of mixtures of factor analyzers is exploited to reduce effectively the dimension of the feature space of genes. RESULTS: The usefulness of the EMMIX-GENE approach for the clustering of tissue samples is demonstrated on two well-known data sets on colon and leukaemia tissues. For both data sets, relevant subsets of the genes are able to be selected that reveal interesting clusterings of the tissues that are either consistent with the external classification of the tissues or with background and biological knowledge of these sets.

Here, we determined the role of pituitary LIF and SOCS-3 in regulating hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis inflammatory responses. Murine pituitary LIF expression was induced up to eightfold after intraperitoneal injection of lipopolysaccharide or tumor necrosis factor-alpha, concordant with elevated plasma levels of ACTH and corticosterone. In LIF knockout (LIFKO) mice, induction of both ACTH and corticosterone were attenuated. LIF deletion was associated with elevated (P < 0.05) levels of pituitary TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6 mRNA and cytokine-inducible pituitary SOCS-3 expression. Abrogation of the HPA axis stress response and higher pituitary levels of proinflammatory cytokines observed in LIFKO mice resulted in a stronger inflammatory process, as evidenced by elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and increased serum amyloid A levels (P < 0.05).

We hypothesised that this increased risk was related to inherited damage which had caused increased stem cell proliferation rates. To test for this link, in vivo, rapid stem cell proliferation was established by giving sub-lethal irradiation (3Gy gamma-rays) and allowing 3 days recovery. At this stage, 60% of haemopoietic spleen colony-forming units (CFU-S) were in DNA-synthesis, compared to <10% in unirradiated controls. Two groups of mice, unirradiated controls and irradiated animals, were then injected with 50mg/kg methyl nitrosourea (MNU) and observed daily for onset of lympho-haemopoietic malignancy. In a further control group of 60 mice, irradiated but not injected with MNU, only one leukaemia developed. In unirradiated controls, 20% of the mice developed malignancies between 3 and 8 months later: in the irradiated, MNU-treated groups, 95% developed malignancies between 2 and 7 months later. Thus, at least one powerful potentiating mechanism for induction of lympho-haemopoietc malignancy following inherited damage can be related to haemopoietic stem cell proliferation. Genomic instability is exposed by cell proliferation and has been implicated in this type of damage. However, a regulatory stromal microenvironment plays a part in inducing that proliferation. Thus, the microenvironment is the effective ""bystander"" which is thought to promote and amplify genomic instability, and thereby influence the induction of malignancy both in PPI offspring and in mice with induced stem cell proliferation.","['CRC Experimental Haematology Unit, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital (NHS) Trust, Manchester, UK. blord@picr.man.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The traditional review of all automated hematology instrument results by preparation, staining, and microscopic examination of a blood film has disappeared in most institutions. The reasons are the more accurate detection of specimens with distributional or morphologic abnormalities by the instruments than by the traditional eyecount method. The opportunity for a clinician to request a microscopic examination of a blood film, whether or not it is flagged, must be preserved, because the clinician's knowledge of the patient's history, physical findings, and current or prior therapy may indicate review to discover an abnormality that may not have been apparent from the instrument results alone. There has also been a dramatic reduction of the numbers of medical technologists and technicians in medical laboratories. Automation of the CBC and differential counts has reduced the number of technologists needed for performance of these tests. But other factors have had a negative effect, such as the necessity to reduce costs. Consolidation of hematology and chemistry laboratories in core laboratories may produce savings in labor costs, but may also create problems of creating and maintaining areas of expertise, such as hematologic morphology, because of the cross-training required and the necessity of personnel to do all things. This article suggests and documents a number of measures that can be infinity stituted by the laboratory and by clinicians to reduce the number of eyecount differentials and blood film reviews that need to be performed. The first effort is to convince clinicians that valid data exist that confirm that a policy of allowing the laboratory to initiate blood film review based on findings of the CBC and automated differential is a more sensitive and accurate method of detecting patients with blood film abnormalities than routine blood film review of all specimens by technologists. Clinicians need to recognize that daily differential results or differentials at intervals of less than a week are not medically necessary in most patients. The laboratory, however, must provide opportunities for the clinician to request differentials at any time for specific medical reasons. The laboratory must establish the validity of screening criteria for detection of distribution and morphologic abnormalities of leukocytes by clinical correlation studies or adopt criteria established by laboratories with the same instrumentation and which have conducted clinical evaluations. A final observation on the eyecount differential is that it was the only way to identify cell types and their relative proportion for nearly 100 years. Cells were identified by their shape, intracellular structures, and staining characteristics. Many studies were able eventually to correlate some aspect of each cell type's function with their morphologic appearance. It has also been learned that the bone marrow is the source of production of most circulating cells and a great deal of the controls of cell production and release into the peripheral blood have been learned. But leukocytes have many functions, almost none of which are performed in the peripheral blood. The peripheral blood is mainly a conduit from the bone marrow to the tissues where the leukocytes perform their function in the case of the neutrophils and monocytes. It is mainly a recirculation and redistribution system for lymphocytes that usually receive their instructions from antigen processing cells in the tissues and allow these modified cells to home to sites where their functions occur. Cellular morphology and staining characteristics tell little about the maturation stage and functional capabilities of leukocytes. One cannot tell the difference between a band and a segmented neutrophil or whether a lymphocyte is a T or B cell on the conventional eyecount differential. One cannot tell the mature granulocyte of a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia from a normal mature neutrophil. Increasingly, techniques are being developed to identify better the maturation stages of cells and association with specific functional capabilities by flow cytometric techniques. The neoplastic nature of some normal-appearing leukocytes can be identified by techniques, such as fluorescent in situ hybridization. With the rapid advances in many approachs to understand the nature and functional capability of leukocytes, the eyecount differential with the traditional Romanowsky stain may be past the apogee of its ascent and beginning its trip into history along with the hemocytometer counting chamber and the Sahli pipet. The development and implementation of new laboratory cornerstone techniques for diagnosis of hematologic disease are eagerly awaited. On the other hand, the red cells and platelets exist to function in the peripheral blood. More emphasis is needed in the development of automated methods of determining the nature and functional capabilities of these true blood cells as part of the CBC.","['Department of Pathology, Los Angeles County/University of Southern California Medical Center, Los Angeles, California, USA. rpierre@earthlink.net']",,,,,16,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its spatial distribution during interphase appears to be cell-type specific. This study analyzes three-dimensional (3D) centromere distribution patterns during cellular differentiation along the neutrophil pathway. METHODS: Differentiation of the promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 was induced by retinoic acid. Centromeres in interphase nuclei were visualized by immunofluorescence staining of centromere-associated proteins with CREST serum. 3D images of nuclei were obtained by confocal microscopy. Automated methods for the segmentation of point-like objects in 3D images were implemented to detect the position of centromeres. Features of centromere localization patterns were determined by constructing the minimal spanning tree of the centromere distribution. RESULTS: In differentiated NB4 cells, the number of centromere conglomerates (chromocenters) was decreased and the distance between chromocenters was increased as compared with untreated controls. The nuclear volume did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: The measured rearrangement of centromeres indicates a progressive clustering of heterochromatin and a global remodeling of interphase chromosome territories during differentiation of NB4 cells. The developed methods for the analysis of 3D centromere distribution patterns provide the opportunity for a fast and objective analysis of heterochromatin remodeling.","['Department of Internal Medicine I, University Ulm, Ulm, Germany. michael.beil@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Most new therapies being examined in fludarabine-refractory patients have shown a high frequency of serious infection. Little data exist regarding the frequency of infections in this population treated with noninvestigational best supportive care therapies. METHODS: The infectious courses of 27 patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL/SLL were retrospectively reviewed. Fludarabine-refractoriness was defined as either relapse within six months of completion of or failure to respond to fludarabine treatment. Infections were documented after patients met National Cancer Institute criteria for further treatment. Serious infections were defined as infections mandating admission to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics. RESULTS: Patient characteristics included: median age 67 years (range, 40-83), median 3 chemotherapy treatments (range, 1-8), and hypogammaglobulinemia in 73% of patients. Pneumocystis carinii prophylaxis was given to 89% of patients. Serious infections developed in 24 out of 27 patients (89%). Patients had a median of 2 admissions (range, 0-11) for serious infection occurring at a median of 4 months (range, 0-21) from onset of fludarabine-refractoriness. The median frequency of admission for infection was 0.17 per month. Most common sites for infection in decreasing frequency were: respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood/sepsis, and soft tissues. Bacteria caused 69 out of 88 infections (78.4%); viruses (varicella-zoster and herpes simplex) caused 11 out of 88 (12.5%); fungi caused 4 out of 88 (4.5%); and opportunistic infections caused 4 out of 88 (4.5%).

Combinations of HHT, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha), and cytarabine (ara-C) have been studied in various CML phases. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity profiles of a combination regimen of simultaneous HHT and IFN-alpha therapy in patients with chronic-phase CML who were not exposed previously to either agent. METHODS: Forty-seven patients were treated: 37 patients with early chronic-phase CML (2 patients with clonal evolution) and 10 patients with late chronic-phase CML. Their median age was 62 years (range, 23-73 years). HHT was given at a dose of 2.5 mg/m(2) by continuous intravenous infusion over 24 hours daily for 5 days every month, and IFN-alpha was given daily at a target dose of 5 x 10(6) units/m(2) subcutaneously. Response, survival, and treatment toxicity were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, the complete hematologic response (CHR) rate was 85%; the cytogenetic response rate was 66%, with major cytogenetic responses (Ph positive in < 35% of metaphases) in 49% of patients and complete cytogenetic responses in 21% of patients. The CHR rate, cytogenetic response rate, and major cytogenetic response rate were 84%, 69%, and 52%, respectively, in patients with early chronic-phase CML. Among the 10 patients with late chronic-phase CML, the CHR rate, cytogenetic response rate, and major cytogenetic response rate were 80%, 50%, and 40%, respectively. Response rates in patients age > 60 years were 84%, 62%, and 49% for CHR, cytogenetic response, and major cytogenetic response. Myelosuppression was frequent but manageable: Anemia with hemoglobin < 8.0 g/dL occurred in 36% of patients, requiring dose adjustments and erythropoietin therapy. Nonhematologic toxicities were mainly fatigue, aches, and gastrointestinal disturbances. Dose reductions with multiple courses were significant and were due to myelosuppression: After 6-24 courses, the median daily IFN-alpha dose was 1 MU/m(2), and the median number of days on HHT per month was 2 days. With a median follow-up of 26 months, the estimated 2-year survival rate was 90% (95% confidence interval, 79-100%). CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous combination of HHT and IFN-alpha is safe and effective, but the dose schedules that actually were delivered were significantly lower than the planned dose schedules. With the availability of signal-transduction inhibitor 571 (imatinib mesylate), studies of combination of HHT and IFN-alpha chemotherapy in patients with CML who have disease that fails to respond to imatinib mesylate and of combinations with imatinib mesylate need to be explored.","['Department of Leukemia and Bioimmunotherapy, M.

We considered the Runx3 gene a potential candidate on the basis of genetic mapping which showed that Dsi1 and Runx3 are closely linked on mouse chromosome 4 and the precedent of the related Runx2 gene, which emerged recently as a Myc-collaborating gene activated by retroviral insertion in thymic lymphomas of CD2-MYC mice. We now report the physical mapping of the Dsi1 locus to a site 30 kb upstream of the distal (P1) promoter of the murine Runx3 gene. Comparison with the syntenic region of human chromosome 1 shows that the next gene is over 250 kb 5' to Runx3, suggesting that Runx3 may be the primary target of retroviral insertions at Dsi1. Screening of CD2-MYC lymphomas for rearrangements at Dsi1 revealed a tumor cell line harboring an MLV provirus at this locus, in the orientation opposite that of Runx3. Proviral insertion was associated with very high levels of expression of Runx3, with a preponderance of transcripts arising at the P1 promoter. These results confirm that Runx3 is a target of retroviral insertions at Dsi1 and indicate that Runx3 can act as an alternative to Runx2 as a Myc-collaborating gene in thymic lymphoma.","['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Institute of Comparative Medicine, University of Glasgow Veterinary School, Glasgow G61 1QH, United Kingdom. m.stewart@vet.gla.ac.uk']",,,,,,,PMC155108,,,,,,,,,,,

Indirect arguments have previously suggested that retrovirus receptor assembly play a role in triggering membrane fusion. Using CHO cells expressing physiological amounts of functional versions of human Pit2 fused to various tagging epitopes, we provide evidence that Pit2 forms assemblies at the cell surface. Living cells were exposed to cross-linking reagents and protein extracts were treated with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), a chemical that destroys all protein interactions but covalent links. Assemblies were also detected in the absence of cross-linking and TFA treatment, indicating that they are partially resistant to detergent denaturation. The formation of homo-oligomers was documented by the coimmunoprecipitation of differently tagged molecules. The amounts of Pit2 assemblies detected in the presence or in the absence of cross-linking reagents varied with extracellular inorganic phosphate concentration ([P(i)]). Variation of signal intensity was in the range of twofold, occurred in the absence of de novo protein synthesis and took place at the cell surface. These results indicate that Pit2 assemblies exhibit variable conformations at the surface of living cells. Susceptibility to virus infection and phosphate uptake also vary with extracellular [P(i)]. A model is proposed in which cell surface Pit2 assemblies switch from a compacted to an expanded configuration in response to changes of extracellular [P(i)], and possible relationships with the variation of biological activities are discussed.","['Unite Retrovirus et Transfert Genetique, CNRS URA 1930, Institut Pasteur, 75724 Paris, France.']",,,,,,,PMC155110,,,,,,,,,,,

These mutants can be rendered infectious by the addition of soluble receptor-binding domain (RBD) proteins in the culture medium. The RBD proteins that rescue the infectivity of these defective MLV vectors can be derived from the same MLV or from other MLVs that use distinct receptors to mediate entry. We have now constructed functional immunologically reactive gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV) envelope proteins, tagged with a feline leukemia virus (FeLV)-derived epitope tag, which are efficiently incorporated into infectious particles. Tagged GALV envelope proteins bind specifically to cells expressing the phosphate transporter protein Pit1, demonstrating for the first time that Pit1 is the binding receptor for GALV and not a coreceptor or another type of GALV entry factor. We have also determined that GALV particles bearing SU proteins with an insertion C-terminal to the PHQ motif (GALV I(10)) bind Pit1 but fail to infect cells. Incubation with soluble GALV RBD renders GALV I(10) particles infectious, whereas incubation with soluble RBDs from MLV or FeLV-B does not. This finding is consistent with the results obtained by Lauring et al. using FeLV-T, a virus that employs Pit1 as a receptor but requires soluble FeLV RBD for entry. MLV and GALV RBDs are not able to render FeLV-T infectious (A. S. Lauring, M. M. Anderson, and J. Overbaugh, J. Virol. 75:8888-8898, 2001). Together, these results suggest that fusion-defective FeLV-T and GALV are restricted to homologous RBD rescue of infectivity.","['Unit on Molecular Virology, Laboratory of Cellular and Molecular Regulation, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",,,,,,,PMC155069,,,,,,,,,,,

Children with leukemia and their parents were randomized to receive either the newly developed CD-ROM or the book You and Leukemia by Lynn Baker. Health care providers (HCPs) and other content/technical experts evaluated only the CD-ROM. Data were collected on children's health locus of control, their understanding of leukemia, and the satisfaction of participants with their assigned intervention. Children in the CD-ROM group, compared with those in the book group, showed increased feelings of control over their health. Although there was a high level of satisfaction with the CD-ROM among all users, younger children and their parents were most satisfied. In conclusion, the CD-ROM, Kidz with Leukemia: A Space Adventure, was found to be a useful, engaging, and empowering tool for children with leukemia and can serve as a model for developing future health-related educational materials.","['The Degge Group Ltd., 1616 North Fort Myer Drive, Suite 1430, Arlington, VA 22209, USA.']","['R44 CA071271-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R44CA71271/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC3307387,,,['NIHMS358873'],,,,,,,,

The antitumor and toxic effects are mediated in part by different mechanisms, thus, permitting a selective inhibition of certain side effects. The influence of O-(3-piperidino-2-hydroxy-1-propyl)nicotinic amidoxime (BGP-15) - a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor - on the nephrotoxicity and antitumor efficacy of cisplatin has been evaluated in experimental models. BGP-15 either blocked or significantly reduced (60-90% in 100-200 mg/kg oral dose) cisplatin induced increase in serum urea and creatinine level in mice and rats and prevented the structural degeneration of the kidney, as well. The nephroprotective effect of BGP-15 treatment was revealed also in living mice by MRI analysis manifesting in the lack of oedema which otherwise developed as a result of cisplatin treatment. The protective effect was accompanied by inhibition of cisplatin-induced poly-ADP-ribosylation and by the restoration of the disturbed energy metabolism. The preservation of ATP level in the kidney was demonstrated in vivo by localized NMR spectroscopy. BGP-15 decreased cisplatin-induced ROS production in rat kidney mitochondria and improved the antioxidant status of the kidney in mice with cisplatin-induced nephropathy. In rat kidney, cisplatin caused a decrease in the level of Bcl-x, a mitochondrial protective protein, and this was normalized by BGP-15 treatment. On the other hand, BGP-15 did not inhibit the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin in cell culture and in transplantable solid tumors of mice. Treatment with BGP-15 increased the mean survival time of cisplatin-treated P-388 leukemia bearing mice from 13 to 19 days. PARP inhibitors have been demonstrated to diminish the consequences of free radical-induced damage, and this is related to the chemoprotective effect of BGP-15, a novel PARP inhibitor. Based on these results, we propose that BGP-15 represents a novel, non-thiol chemoprotective agent.","['N-Gene R&D, Szent Istvan Krt. 18, Budapest, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fetuin's immunoreactivity increased considerably in adult human bone marrow in some pathological conditions, particularly in mastocytosis and was also increased in bone marrows in some cases of acute leukaemias, especially in acute myeloid leukaemia. This increase in the presence of fetuin in neoplastic bone marrows is not reflected by an increased level of circulating fetuin. This last observation contradicts earlier suggestions that fetuin is specifically reduced in cancer patients. A consistent increase in fetuin immunoreactivity in bone marrow of most cases of mastocytosis, as demonstrated in this paper, could become a useful tool in the diagnosis of this disease.","['Department of Pathology, University of Tasmania, Hobart.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: We examined LIF gene expression in the above-mentioned decidua by a quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method, and also examined the serum pregesterone, human chorionic gonadotrapin (hCG) by radioimmunoassay in all cases. RESULTS: (1) Serum levels of pregesterone and hCG are: (91.5 +/- 27.2) nmol/L, (69.9 +/- 14.9) kU/L in normal early pregnancy; (88.4 +/- 24.7) nmol/L, (57.6 +/- 11.2) kU/L in threatened abortion respectively. There was no difference in the levels of pregesterone and hCG between the two groups (P > 0.05). While serum pregesterone, hCG levels in inevitable group were (33.1 +/- 19.6) nmol/L, (10.3 +/- 3.2) kU/L respectively. Compared with normal early pregnancy and threatened abortion group, the levels of serum pregesterone and hCG reduced significantly (P < 0.05).

METHODS: Thirteen patients with leukemia received allo-bone marrow transplantation (BMT) from two or three HLA loci mismatched related donor (haploidentical group). The clinical outcomes of the bone marrow transplantion were compared with thase of 13 consecutive HLA identical sibling transplantion (identical group). In haploidentical donor BMT, the donors of patients were given G-CSF (Lenograstim Chugai) 250 micrograms/day for seven doses prior to marrow harvest. CSA, MTX, ATG and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) were combined for GVHD prophylaxis. ATG 5 mg/kg/day was infused for 4 days before transplantation and MMF was adminisered from 7th day after. RESULTS: All the patients were engrafted. The median number of CD34+ cells in graft was 6.1 x 10(6)/kg in haploidentical group and 2.5 x 10(6)/kg in identical group (P < 0.01). The median number of CD3+ cells was 50.5 x 10(6)/kg and 47.0 x 10(6)/kg respectively (P > 0.05). All patients had 100% donors hematopoietic cells after transplantation by cytogenetic evidence analysis. Five of the thirteen patients (38.5%) in haploidentical group and three of the thirteen patients(23.1%) in identical group experienced II-IV acute GVHD (P > 0.05). The probability of chronic GVHD was 87.5% in haploidentical group and 67.5% in identical group (P > 0.05), However none in both groups developed extensive cGVHD. The median follow-up duration was 453 days (range 180-690 days) for haploidentical group and 510 days (range 220-810 days) for identical group. In haploidentical group, five patients died from transplant related mortality (3 GVHD, 2 infection), none relapsed and eight patients(61.5%) survive in disease free situation. In identical group, two patients died from transplant related mortality (1 GVHD, 1 infection), two patients died from relapse and nine patients (69.2%) survive in disease free situation. DFS in haploidentical group and in identical group was similar(P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The transplants from haploidentical donor used in this study is 3 effective and feasible in preventing acute severe GVHD and improving DFS.","['Department of Hematology, General Hospital of Air Force PLA, Beijing 100036, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A recently hospitalized young female patient with acute leukemia was initially diagnosed as M3 subtype based on morphological French-American-British (FAB) classification. Karyotype analysis using standard G and R banding techniques and RT-PCR were applied to further define the diagnosis. After primarily cultured bone marrow cells from the iliac aspiration were tested for in vitro induced differentiation, the patient was treated with oral all-trans retinoic acid alone, 60 mg per day until complete remission was achieved. Peripheral blood and bone marrow changes were monitored over the whole treatment course. RESULTS: The characteristic chromosomal aberration for M3, the t(15;17) reciprocal translocation, was not found while a t(8;21) translocation was verified. Furthermore, an amplified product of the AML-1/ETO fusion gene instead of the PML/RAR alpha fusion gene was detected by RT-PCR and the diagnosis was corrected from M3 to M2. Primary cultured bone marrow cells can be fully induced to terminal differentiation after 4 days exposure to ATRA. A hematological complete remission was achieved after 40 days treatment with ATRA as a single therapeutic agent, suggesting an alternative pathway mediating ATRA-induced myeloid differentiation. CONCLUSION: A leukemia patient with a subtype other than M3, such as M2 in this case, may also be induced to complete remission by the mechanism of ATRA-induced terminal differentiation. This implies that there may be a pathway other than PML/RAR alpha fusion gene product which mediates ATRA-induced myeloid maturation in leukemia cells.","['First Affiliated Hospital, Suzhou University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou 215006, China. szchenzx@263.net']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From October 1995 to December 2000, 25 patients with high-risk leukemia (median age 34 years, range 5.5-52 years) were transplanted with peripheral blood stem cells from their HLA-identical sibling donors. Among them, 15 patients suffered from acute leukemia (ALL) (one ph+ ALL in CR1, seven in CR2 or greater, and seven in relapse, including two in relapse after the first all-BMT), four patients suffered from chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) (in CP2, AP, BC, and relapse after BMT respecively), 6 patients suffered from myelodys plastic syndrome (MDS), including one case of refractory anemia with excess of blasts (REAB), one case of refractory anemia with excess of blasts in trransformation (REAB-T), and 4 cases of acute leukemia secondary to MDS. The graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis included administration of cyclosporine and methotrexate. RESULTS: All patients were successfully engrafted. The median times (range) for their neutrophil returning to > or = 0.5 x 10(9)/L and for platelet returning to > or = 20 x 10(9)/L were 14 (10-18) days and 11 (7-45) days after transplantation resprctively. Grade II acute GVHD occurred in 12 patients with an incidence rate of 48%. Grade III GVHD was found in one patient (4%). No grade IV GVHD was seen. Among the 23 evaluable patients, 16 were diagnosed as chronic GVHD (70%). The actual transplant-related mortality was 16%. Leukemia relapse occurred in 6 patients, four of them received donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and achieved remission again. Nineteen patients were alive and disease-free with a median follow-up time of 304 (94-1,963) days. The two-year probability of overall survival, disease-free survival (DFS), and relapse rates were 64%, 58%, and 25% respectively. CONCLUSION: Allo-PBSCT decreases the relapse rate, increases the disease-free survival rate for patients with high-risk leukemia.

This work contributes two elements to knowledge on MLL translocations. First is reverse-panhandle PCR for cloning breakpoint junctions of the other derivative chromosomes, sequences of which are germane to understanding the MLL translocation process. The technique revealed duplicated sequences in one case of infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and small deletions in a case of treatment-related ALL. The second element is discovery of a three-way rearrangement of MLL, AF-4, and CDK6 in another case of infant ALL. Cytogenetic analysis was unsuccessful at diagnosis, but suggested t(4;11) and del(7)(q21q31) at relapse. Panhandle PCR analysis of the diagnostic marrow identified a breakpoint junction of MLL intron 8 and AF-4 intron 3. Reverse-panhandle PCR identified a breakpoint junction of CDK6 from band 7q21-q22 and MLL intron 9. CDK6 encodes a critical cell cycle regulator and is the first gene of this type disrupted by MLL translocation. Cdk6 is overexpressed or disrupted by translocation in many cancers. The in-frame CDK6-MLL transcript is provocative with respect to a potential contribution of the predicted Cdk6-MLL fusion protein in the genesis of the ALL, which also contains an in-frame MLL-AF4 transcript. The sequences in these three cases show additional MLL genomic breakpoint heterogeneity. Each breakpoint junction suggests nonhomologous end joining and is consistent with DNA damage and repair. CDK6-MLL is a new fusion of both genes.","[""Division of Oncology, Joseph Stokes, Jr. Research Institute, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.""]","['CA77683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA85469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA085469/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA66140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA080175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA077683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC123688,,,,"['GENBANK/AF487903', 'GENBANK/AF487904', 'GENBANK/AF487905', 'GENBANK/AF487906', 'GENBANK/AF492830', 'GENBANK/AF492831', 'GENBANK/AF492832', 'GENBANK/AF492833', 'GENBANK/AF492834', 'GENBANK/AF492835']",,,,,,,

We therefore explored the possibility of selectively eliminating alloreactive T cells by CD95/CD95L-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) in a major histocompatibility complex allogeneic murine model system. Activation of resting or preactivated T lymphocytes from C3H/HeJ (H-2(k)) mice was induced with irradiated BALB/cJ (H-2(d)) mouse-derived stimulators. Substantial decrease (> or = 80%) of proliferative and lytic responses by activated alloreactive T cells was subsequently achieved by incubating the mixed lymphocyte culture with an agonistic monoclonal antibody to CD95, and residual T cells recovered did not elicit alloreactivity upon challenge to H-2(d). Depletion of alloreactive T lymphocytes by AICD was specific because reactivity to an I-A(d)-restricted ovalbumin (OVA) peptide by OVA-specific CD4(+) T cells mixed into the allogeneic T-cell pool and subjected to induction of AICD in the absence of OVA peptide could be preserved. Adoptive transfer of donor-derived allogeneic T lymphocytes, depleted from alloreactive T cells by AICD in vitro, in the parent (C3H/He) to F(1) (C3H/He x BALB/c) GvHD model prevented lethal GvHD. The results presented suggest that alloreactive T cells can effectively be depleted from allogeneic T cells by induction of AICD to prevent GvHD and might introduce a new strategy for the separation of GvH-reactive T cells and T cells mediating antiviral and possibly graft-versus-leukemia effects.","['Division of Hematology, III Department of Medicine, University Medical School Mainz, Germany. uhartwig@mail.uni-mainz.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The H-Y epitope was localized in the DBY protein using female HLA-DQ5(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells loaded with DBY protein fragments.

In previous studies, we demonstrated that expression of a human PML-RARA complementary DNA in murine granulocyte precursor cells initiated the development of leukemia. However, leukemogenesis by PML-RARA required additional genetic alterations. To identify genetic changes that cooperate with PML-RARA in leukemogenesis, we performed spectral karyotyping analysis of myeloid leukemias from hMRP8-PML-RARA mice (11 cases) and from mice coexpressing PML-RARA and BCL2 (8 cases). Clonal abnormalities were detected in 18 of 19 cases (95%). Recurring numerical abnormalities identified in these murine leukemias included +15 (15 cases, 79%); loss of a sex chromosome (12 cases, 63%); +8 (10 cases, 53%); +10 (9 cases, 47%); +4, +7, or +14 (8 cases each, 42%); +16 (7 cases, 37%); and +6 (5 cases, 26%). In a series of 965 patients with APL, we identified secondary abnormalities in 368 (38%). The most common recurring abnormalities were +8 or partial trisomy of 8q (120 patients, 12.4%) and ider(17) t(15;17) (42 patients, 4.4%). The critical consequence of +8 in human leukemias appears to be the gain of 8q24, which is syntenic to mouse 15.

Moreover, transendothelial cell migration (TEM) in response to CCL21 and CCL19 was significantly higher for the malignant B cells of patients who had clinical lymph node involvement as compared with those of patients lacking such organomegaly. Furthermore, the expression of CCR7, the receptor for both CCL21 and CCL19, correlated with clinical lymphadenopathy, and blocking of CCR7 inhibited CLL cell TEM. By using immunohistochemistry we demonstrated that CCL21 and CCL19, but not CXCL12, are located in high endothelial venules and are, therefore, in an appropriate location to induce TEM. Regarding the adhesion receptors involved in TEM, alpha4 (most likely in association with beta1) and alphaLbeta2 were shown to be important in CLL cell TEM in vitro, but only the level of alpha4 expression correlated with the presence of clinical lymphadenopathy. The present studies are the first to shed light on the factors determining CLL cell entry into nodes and define the phenotype of circulating malignant cells likely to determine the pattern of lymph node enlargement in the disease.","['Department of Haematology, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom. k.j.till@liv.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13- acetate) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) inhibit apoptosis of B-CLL lymphocytes ex vivo. We used specific inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) to study their involvement in TPA- and IL-4-induced survival of B-CLL lymphocytes. BisI, a specific inhibitor of PKC, induced apoptosis and inhibited the antiapoptotic activity of TPA and IL-4. B-CLL cells have a basal PKC activity that was increased by TPA but not by IL-4. TPA, but not IL-4, induced ERK activation. However, the inhibition of ERK activation did not affect the viability of B-CLL lymphocytes, demonstrating that this pathway is not involved in their survival. Inhibition of PI3-kinase by LY294002 induced apoptosis of B-CLL cells and inhibited the survival effect of IL-4 and TPA. In addition, Akt, a downstream effector of PI3-kinase activity, was phosphorylated by TPA and IL-4 in B-CLL cells, though PI3-kinase had no effect on PKC-dependent phosphorylation of Akt. Furthermore, the inhibition of PKC or PI3-kinase increased dexamethasone- and fludarabine-induced apoptosis ex vivo in the presence of survival factors. These results demonstrate that PKC and PI3-kinase are involved in the survival of B-CLL cells and suggest that inhibitors of these pathways could be combined with the drugs used in the treatment of B-CLL.","['Unitat de Bioquimica, Departament de Ciencies Fisioliques II, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the role of the coiled-coil domain and Tyr177 in promoting CML, 4 P210 bcr/abl-derived mutants containing different bcr domains fused to abl were constructed. All 4 mutants, Delta(1-63) bcr/abl, (1-63) bcr/abl, Tyr177Phe bcr/abl, and (1-210) bcr/abl exhibited elevated tyrosine kinase activity and conferred factor-independent growth in cell lines. In contrast, differences in the transforming potential of the 4 mutants occurred in our mouse model, in which all mice receiving P210 bcr/abl-expressing bone marrow cells exclusively develop a myeloproliferative disease (MPD) resembling human CML. Of the 4 mutants assayed, only 1-210 bcr/abl, containing both the coiled-coil domain and Tyr177, induced MPD.

The other 3 mutants, (1-63) bcr/abl, Tyr177Phe bcr/abl, and Delta(1-63) bcr/abl, failed to induce an MPD but instead caused T-cell ALL.

In myeloid leukemia cells without virus insertion in this locus, low levels of only exon-1A/exon-2 Cb2 transcripts were present and receptors could not be detected. To elucidate the function of Cb2 in myeloid leukemia cells, a set of in vitro experiments was carried out using 32D/G-CSF-R (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor receptor) cells transfected with exon-1B/exon-2 Cb2 complementary DNA and a myeloid cell line carrying a virus insertion in Cb2 (ie, NFS 78). We demonstrate that a major function of the Cb2 receptor is stimulation of migration as determined in a transwell assay. Exposure of Cb2-expressing cells to different cannabinoids showed that the true ligand for Cb2 is 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), which may act as chemoattractant and as a chemokinetic agent. Furthermore, we observed a significant synergistic activity between 2-AG and interleukin-3 or G-CSF, suggesting cross-talk between the different receptor systems. Radioactive-ligand binding studies revealed significant numbers of Cb2 receptors in normal spleen. Transwell experiments carried out with normal mouse spleen cells showed 2-AG-induced migration of B220-, CD19-, immunoglobulin M-, and immunoglobulin D-expressing B lymphocytes.

Recently, the human Stat5 gene was found to be translocated to the RARalpha gene in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia indicating that Stat5 might also play a role in cellular transformation. We investigated the mechanism by which Stat5 might exert this function and studied the biochemical and cellular functions of fusion proteins comprising Stat5 and RARalpha. The expression of Stat5-RARalpha causes the transcriptional repression of gene transcription, a process that requires the coiled-coil domain of Stat5 (amino acid positions 133-333). Oligomerization of this domain in the Stat5-RARalpha fusion protein leads to stable binding of the corepressor SMRT independent of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) stimulation and is accompanied by an impaired response to differentiation signals in hematopoietic cells. This inhibitory effect on myeloid differentiation cannot be overcome by simultaneous coexpression of RARalpha. We conclude that Stat5 is capable of interacting with a corepressor complex that alters the pattern of corepressor binding to RARalpha and its dissociation in response to ATRA stimulation, leading to enhanced repressor activity and a block of hematopoietic differentiation.","['Georg-Speyer-Haus, Institute for Biomedical Research, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. a.maurer@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",,['Acta Haematol. 2016;136(1):1-15.

Initially described in a patient with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-unresponsive disease, STAT5b-RARalpha resulted from an interstitial deletion on chromosome 17. To determine the molecular mechanisms of myeloid leukemogenesis and maturation arrest in STAT5b-RARalpha(+) APL and its unresponsiveness to ATRA, we examined the effect of STAT5b-RARalpha on the activity of myeloid transcription factors including RARalpha/retinoid X receptor (RXR) alpha, STAT3, and STAT5 as well as its molecular interactions with the nuclear receptor corepressor, SMRT, and nuclear receptor coactivator, TRAM-1. STAT5b-RARalpha bound to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) both as a homodimer and as a heterodimer with RXRalpha and inhibited wild-type RARalpha/RXRalpha transactivation. Although STAT5b-RARalpha had no effect on ligand-induced STAT5b activation, it enhanced interleukin 6-induced STAT3-dependent reporter activity, an effect shared by other APL fusion proteins including promyelocytic leukemia-RARalpha and promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF)-RARalpha. SMRT was released from STAT5b-RARalpha/SMRT complexes by ATRA at 10(-6) M, whereas TRAM-1 became associated with STAT5b-RARalpha at 10(-7) M. The coiled-coil domain of STAT5b was required for formation of STAT5b-RARalpha homodimers, for the inhibition of RARalpha/RXRalpha transcriptional activity, and for stability of the STAT5b-RARalpha/SMRT complex. Thus, STAT5b-RARalpha contributes to myeloid maturation arrest by binding to RARE as either a homodimer or as a heterodimer with RXRalpha resulting in the recruitment of SMRT and inhibition of RARalpha/RXRalpha transcriptional activity. In addition, STAT5b-RARalpha and other APL fusion proteins may contribute to leukemogenesis by interaction with the STAT3 oncogene pathway.","['Section of Infectious Disease, Department of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']","['CA72261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA86430/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Outside of fever and chills, cough and polypnea are the earliest signs, followed by chest pain, dyspnea, lung auscultation changes, and haemoptysis. The sensitivity of each sign is higher than 56%. Before the onset of lung auscultation changes, the chest X-ray shows mainly unilateral alveolar infiltrates. Sensitivity of serology is weak (25%), but contributed to early diagnosis in 16.6% of cases. CONCLUSION: A better knowledge of the invasive pulmonary aspergillosis clinical, radiological and serological signs could help the practician to prescribe an 'invasive' investigation (computed tomographic scan, bronchoalveolar lavage) to confirm the diagnosis of this fungal infection.","['Service de maladies du sang-medecine interne, CHU, 4, rue Larrey, 49033 Angers, France. lucia.perez@infonie.fr']",,,,,,,,,Approche diagnostique non agressive de l'aspergillose pulmonaire invasive en hematologie.

Among children who died as a result of some form of CCC (excluding injury, sudden infant death syndrome, and non-CCC medical conditions), the percentage of cases younger than 1 year who died at home rose slightly from 7.8% in 1980 to 11.6% in 1998, whereas the percentage of older children and young adults who had a CCC and died at home rose substantially from 21% in 1980 to 43% in 1998. Children who had lived in more affluent neighborhoods were more likely to have died at home. Using leukemia-related deaths as a benchmark, deaths as a result of congenital, genetic, neuromuscular, and metabolic conditions and other forms of cancer all were more likely to have occurred at home. Significant variation in the likelihood of home death, not explained by the individual attributes of the cases, also existed across the 39 counties in Washington state. CONCLUSIONS: Children who die with underlying CCCs increasingly do so at home. Age at death, specific condition, local area affluence, and the location of home all influence the likelihood of home death. These findings warrant additional study, as they have implications for how we envision pediatric palliative care, hospice, and other supportive services for the future.","['Child Health Institute, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98103-8552, USA. feudtner@u.washington.edu']",['K08 HS00002/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of cytokines promoting their development in vitro has led to substantial advances in understanding their differentiation process. An important role could be assigned to interleukin-3 (IL-3), which supports the maturation of hematopoietic progenitors into basophils in vitro and in vivo. In contrast to other myeloid lineages, a specific basophil growth factor has not yet been discovered. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether basophils possess a lineage-restricted progenitor or whether they share a common ancestor with mast cells (MC), eosinophils, or even megakaryocytes. Partial answers to these questions could be provided using in vitro culture systems or taking advantage of hematological disorders, such as chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (CML and AML), some myelodysplastic syndromes, and the very rare acute basophilic leukemia in which basophilic differentiation occurs.","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Hematology, UPRES-EA 2509, Faculty of Pharmacy, Paris, France. arock@pharmacie.univ-paris5.fr']",,,,,74,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the extracts exhibited the pharmacological activities under study. Methanol and dichloromethane were the most toxic extracts. From the global methanol extract, isolations were performed of prunasin, 23,24- dihydro-cucurbitacin F, and a new cucurbitacin, 3beta-(beta-D-glucosyloxy)-16alpha,23alpha-epoxycucurbita-5,24-diene-11-one.

Two cell stage embryos from the ddY mouse strain were cultured in alpha-MEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and embryotrophic factors (ETFs) and allowed to develop to the trilaminal germ disc embryonic stage. Only small round cells (EES cells) were isolated by the colony isolating technique and subsequently cultured in the same medium containing the ETFs and leukemia inhibitory factors (LIF-10 ng/ml). The newly established embryonic stem (ES) cells isolated from inner cell mass of blastocysts differentiated from two cell stage embryo in culture. The EES and ES cell lines were maintained in an undifferentiated state using Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 1 ng/ml of LIF. The EES cells maintained their normal genetic and morphological features as well as their potential to differentiate into a broad spectrum of cell types as well as their ability to contribute to all cell lineages in chimeric mice. Moreover, these cell lines changed and differentiated into various kinds of cells by removing LIF and by the addition of ETFs to the vitro culture system. All 11 EES cell lines and 3 ES cell lines formed embryoid bodies; however, cell line EES-4 formed tube-like structures which extended, anastomosed with each other, and finally formed networks when the LIF were absent.

Conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracyclines and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), are useful in treating AML but now appear to have reached their maximum potential. Newer therapeutic approaches to AML have recently focused on immune-based therapy through monoclonal antibodies that target and destroy malignant cells via specific cell receptors. One such agent is gemtuzumab (CMA-676), an agent that targets the CD33 antigen on malignant myeloid cells. Initial studies have shown significant anticancer activity. We will discuss traditional and newer therapeutic approaches to AML and review the role of monoclonal antibody based therapies for patients with AML. A case of a 30-year-old man with refractory AML who was treated with gemtuzumab will be mentioned, highlighting potential applications and possible limitations to this novel therapy. Despite the effective reduction in the number of malignant cells in bone marrow, gemtuzumab ineffectively treated extramedullary leukemic gingival infiltrate. Regardless of limitations, monoclonal-based therapy offers an exciting and potentially safer adjunctive therapy for patients with AML.","['Department of Oral Medicine, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is now apparent that dose escalation alone does not eradicate the malignancy in many cases and that an associated immune-mediated graft-versus-malignancy effect may be equally important. Its presence is supported by the following observations: anecdotal reports that patients with relapsed leukaemia following SCT may re-enter remission after withdrawal of immunosuppressive drugs; the lower risk of relapse associated with the development of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD); and an increased risk of relapse in patients receiving syngeneic transplants or T-cell depleted allogeneic marrow grafts. More directly compelling evidence has been provided by the efficacy of donor lymphocyte infusions, particularly for relapsed chronic-phase CML.

Growing confidence in the power of the allogeneic graft-versus-malignancy (GVM) effect makes such an approach attractive. Lower intensity transplants increase the degree of mixed chimerism, both in T cell and myeloid cell lineages. Currently a variety of NST treatment approaches are being developed and in this chapter their safety profile and the immunological characteristics of the mixed chimeric state are described. Results of NST in specific disease categories are still limited but the NST approach appears to have promise in the treatment of both haematological and non-haematological malignancies because of the benefit of low toxicity coupled with a strong graft-versus-malignancy effect. NST regimens are also being explored in high-risk patients with non-malignant disorders. However, at present, there is insufficient data to determine whether NST should replace standard myeloablative transplants in specific disease groups. With their low toxicity, NST are well placed as platforms for future developments in transplant immunology to avoid GVHD and enhance the allograft effect against malignant diseases.","['Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Haematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",,,,,79,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1999 over 50% of all sibling transplants and over 25% of unrelated donor transplants reported to the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) used PBSC. The major reason for this increasing use of PBSC relates to the rapid haemopoietic recovery seen which mirrors the advantages of using PBSC in autologous transplantation. This improvement in engraftment is a consequence of the larger number of stem cells that can be collected from G-CSF-mobilized peripheral blood compared to bone marrow. Evidence from randomized trials now shows a survival advantage for the use of PBSC in patients with advanced leukaemia. The reason for this improved survival appears primarily to relate to a reduced risk of transplant-related mortality and, possibly, a reduced risk of relapse, However, these randomized studies have also confirmed that there is an increased risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease associated with PBSC transplantation and further follow-up is required to determine the long-term impact on outcome.","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital NHS Trust, UK.']",,,,,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, 20% of patients with MM express CD20 on their bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs). Therefore, the authors began a phase II clinical study to determine the activity of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab in MM patients. Nineteen previously treated MM patients received 375 mg/m2 rituximab per week for 4 weeks. Three months after initiation of treatment, patients were assessed for response and received a second course of therapy if their disease was stable (SD) or they achieved a partial response (PR). Six of 19 (32%) patients had either a PR (n = 1) or SD (n = 5), with a median time to treatment failure of 5.5 months (mean, 10.3 months; range, 3-27+ months). All six patients who had a PR or SD had CD20+ BMPC. Overall, rituximab therapy was well tolerated. Because most patients with MM poorly express CD20 on their BMPCs, the authors evaluated agents for their ability to induce CD20 expression and thereby facilitate rituximab binding on MM cells. These studies show that interferon-gamma (IFN-y) induced CD20 expression on MM BMPCs, MM B cells, and healthy donor BMPCs. In contrast, CD20 expression on chronic lymphocytic leukemia, follicular non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, healthy donor B cells, and progenitor cells was unaffected by IFN-y. Rituximab binding to the BMPCs of MM patients was also increased after culture with pharmacologically attainable levels of IFN-gamma (1-100 U/mL). In conclusion, these studies suggest that MM patients with CD20+ BMPCs may benefit from rituximab therapy. Furthermore, IFN-gamma induces CD20 expression on MM BMPCs and B cells and facilitates rituximab binding to MM BMPCs, providing the rationale for clinical trials to examine its use with CD20-directed serotherapies in MM.","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['CA80963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goal of this study was to define the potential to use canine lymphoma and leukemia as suitable models to refine therapeutic approaches targeting the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R). The authors evaluated the patterns of IL-2R expression in 13 dogs with multicentric non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and in six dogs with leukemia (acute lymphocytic leukemia, n = 3; chronic lymphocytic leukemia in blast crisis, n = 1; acute monoblastic leukemia, n = 2). The authors first cloned and sequenced the complete coding domains of the wild-type canine IL-2R alpha-chain gene. They next used qualitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis to examine IL-2R alpha, beta, and gamma(c) subunit expression in the tumors. Messenger RNA (mRNA) for the interleukin-2 receptor alpha, beta, and gammac subunits that comprise the high-affinity receptor was present in samples from all dogs with NHL. Expression of functional surface IL-2R also was observed flow cytometrically in NHL cells from all four dogs tested. Leukemic cells from one dog with B cell acute lymphocytic leukemia and two dogs with acute monoblastic leukemia expressed mRNA for all three subunits, whereas cells from another dog with B cell leukemia and both dogs with T cell leukemia expressed only mRNA for the beta and gammac subunits that comprise the intermediate-affinity receptor. These results indicate that the IL-2R is commonly expressed in canine lymphohematopoietic malignancies, and support the suitability of this large-animal model to evaluate targeted IL-2R cancer therapy using approaches of interest in the treatment of humans with hemolymphatic cancers.","['Department of Medical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of Wisconsin, Madison, USA.']",['CA01696/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['J Immunother 2002 Mar-Apr;25(2):188'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We reviewed our experience of 19 adult patients who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation for BCS from April 1988 to May 1999 to assess their long-term outcome and specific complications related to this procedure. RESULTS: Of these patients, 13 presented with chronic and 6 with acute liver failure. At presentation predisposing factors included polycythemia rubra vera in five, an undefined myeloproliferative disorder in four, essential thrombocythemia in two, presence of lupus anticoagulant in one, antiphospholipid antibody positivity in one, post-gestational in one, oral contraceptive pill in one, and idiopathic in four. Five patients had undergone previous porto-systemic shunt. Of the 19 patients, 16 are alive at a median follow-up of 89 months (range 1-119) with 2 patients developing disease recurrence at 4 months and 7 years posttransplant, respectively. Four patients have been retransplanted: one for progressive graft dysfunction due to nodular regenerative hyperplasia secondary to azathioprine toxicity, two for hepatic artery thrombosis (one soon after and the other 47 months posttransplant), and one for recurrent BCS. Three patients have died: one from an intra-abdominal bleed secondary to acute hemorrhagic pancreatitis 8 years posttransplant, another from acute myeloid leukemia at 6 years posttransplant, and the third patient from graft failure secondary to severe rejection 1 month posttransplant. CONCLUSION: Liver transplantation for BCS provides good long-term survival with acceptable morbidity.

We show here that the oxidative stress-responsive transcription factor Bach2 is a generic inhibitor of gene expression directed by the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element, the Maf recognition element, and the antioxidant-responsive element. The Bach2-enhanced green fluorescent protein bicistronic retrovirus was used to monitor the fate of Bach2-expressing cells at the single cell level. Bach2 exerted an inhibitory effect on NIH3T3 cell proliferation and caused massive apoptosis upon mild oxidative stress in both NIH3T3 and Raji B-lymphoid cells. Interestingly, Bach1, a highly homologous protein, could not induce cell death, demonstrating the specificity for the apoptosis induction. Although both oxidative stress and leptomycin B, an inhibitor of nuclear export, induce nuclear accumulation of Bach2, the leptomycin B-induced nuclear accumulation of Bach2 was not sufficient to elicit apoptosis.

Epub 2002 Mar 26.,,"A pharmacological approach to neoplasia by differentiation therapy relies on the availability of cytodifferentiating agents whose antitumor efficacy is usually assayed first on malignant cells in vitro. Using murine erythroleukemia cells (MELCs) as the model, we found that WEB-2086, a triazolobenzodiazepine-derived PAF antagonist originally developed as an anti-inflammatory drug, induces a dose-dependent inhibition of MELC growth and hemoglobin accumulation as a result of a true commitment to differentiation. MELCs treated for 5 days with 1 mM WEB-2086 show greater than or equal to 85% benzidine-positive cells, increased expression of alpha- and beta-globin genes, and down-regulation of c-Myb. This differentiation pattern, which does not involve histone H4 acetylation and is abrogated by the action of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, recalls the pattern induced by hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA). In addition to MELCs, human erythroleukemia K562 and HEL and myeloid HL60 cells are massively committed to maturation by WEB-2086 and, with some differences, by its analog, WEB-2170. This suggests that WEB-2086, structurally distant from other known inducers, might be a member of a new class of cytodifferentiation agents active on a broad range of transformed cells in vitro and useful, prospectively, for anticancer therapy due to their high tolerability in vivo.","['Department of Experimental Pathology and Oncology, University of Florence, 50134, Firenze, Italy.']",,,,,,,,20020326,,,,,,,,,,

Since the EVI1 gene at 3q26 is transcriptionally activated in 3q21q26 syndrome, we assessed the role of EVI1 gene expression in the abnormal megakaryocytic differentiation in 3q21q26 syndrome. RT-PCR analysis of various types of hematopoietic cells revealed that the EVI1 gene is expressed specifically in CD34(+) cells, megakaryocytes, and platelets. UT-7 is a human immature megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line with dependence for the growth on granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (designated at UT-7/GM) and with a differentiation capacity to erythroid (UT-7/EPO) and megakaryocytic lineages (UT-7/TPO) by erythropoietin (EPO) and thrombopoietin (TPO), respectively. Among three UT-7 sublines, UT-7/GM, UT-7/EPO, and UT-7/TPO, expression of the EVI1 gene was detected at low levels in UT-7/GM and UT-7/EPO cells, but was detected at a higher level in UT-7/TPO cells. When UT-7/GM cells were cultured with TPO, the level of EVI1 expression was increased, along with increased numbers of polynuclear megakaryocytes and expression of the platelet factor 4 (PF-4) gene. Furthermore, forced expression of the EVI1 gene in UT-7/GM cells changed their morphology to polynuclear megakaryocytes, stopped their growth, and induced cell death within a month. These data indicate that expression of the EVI1 gene is involved in progression of megakaryocytic differentiation and, thus, the dysmegakaryocytopoiesis in 3q21q26 syndrome could be partly due to an enhanced differentiation capacity of leukemia cells and/or megakaryocytes by constitutive expression of the EVI1 gene.","['Department of Biochemistry, Miyazaki Medical College, Miyazaki, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been shown that serine phosphorylation of oncoprotein 18 (Op18) is required for cell cycle progression specifically at the G2/M transition. Moreover, mutant forms of Op18 that are defective in one or more of the four serine residues induce G2/M arrest and subsequent polyploidization. Op18 phosphorylation is rapidly induced with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) treatment in a wide range of human cells. In this study, we investigated the role of Op18 in PMA induced polyploidization during megakaryocyte differentiation of the human erythroleukemia cell line. Crucial to the molecular analysis of megakaryocyte differentiation, is the ability to fractionate cell populations with different ploidy levels. We have utilized cell elutriation as a fractionation strategy to analyze Op18 expression in synchronized cell subpopulations in different phases of the cell cycle or with progressive megakaryocyte polyploidization. In the absence of PMA, increased phosphorylation of Op18 was observed in HEL cells during cell cycle progression, as for other proliferating cells. However, in contrast to Jurkat leukemia cells chosen as control, HEL cells exhibited a lack of Op18 phosphorylation in response to PMA, which was accompanied by polyploidization and differentiation along the megakaryocytic lineage. To further determine the role of Op18 in polyploidization, HEL cells were transfected with different Op18 expression constructs. Differences in cell survival and polyploidization were observed between high and low Op18 expressors. An increased Op18 level reduced cell survival during the early stage of PMA induced megakaryocyte differentiation, but enhanced polyploidization efficiency. Our findings suggest that maintenance of a high level of unphosphorylated Op18 is required for efficient polyploidization during the differentiation program of megakaryocytes.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA. clchang@ucsd.edu']",['CA32146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reduction of intracellular polyamine levels by use of inhibitors that block polyamine synthesis slows or inhibits growth of many cells in vitro. Several such inhibitors have shown efficacy in clinical trials, though the toxicity of some compounds has limited their usefulness. We have tested the effects of combinations of the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) and two polyamine inhibitors, difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) and methyl glyoxal bis guanylhydrazone (MGBG), on the clonal line of human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells, CEM-C7-14. Dex alone kills these cells, though only after a delay of at least 24 hours. We also evaluated a partially glucocorticoid-resistant c-Myc-expressing CEM-C7-14 clone. We show that Dex downregulates ornithine decarboxylase (ODC), the rate-limiting enzyme in polyamine synthesis. Pretreatment with the ODC inhibitor DFMO, followed by addition of Dex, enhances steroid-evoked kill slightly. The combination of pretreatment with sublethal concentrations of both DFMO and the inhibitor of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase, MGBG, followed by addition of Dex, results in strong synergistic cell kill. Both the rapidity and extent of cell kill are enhanced compared to the effects of Dex alone. These results suggest that use of such combinations in vivo may result in apoptosis of malignant cells with lower overall toxicity.","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston 77550-0645, USA.']","['R01 CA041407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41407-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC1503311,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), AML1 is disrupted not only by chromosomal translocations but also by mutations in the runt domain, which binds both DNA and CBFB. Acquired mutations have been described predominantly in the AML FAB type M0. To date, most patients appear to have biallelic disease, suggesting a complete lack of normal AML1 function. Inherited loss of function mutations thought to lead to haploinsufficiency also have been described in patients who have a familial disorder with predisposition to AML (FPD/AML), indicating the role of AML1 in megakaryopoiesis. Using single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, we studied the AML1 runt domain in 41 patients with M0 AML and identified potentially pathologic mutations in five (12%). Biallelic disease could be confirmed in only one patient, using loss of heterozygosity studies. At least three of the mutations would lead to truncated proteins similar to those reported in FPD/AML, suggesting that haploinsufficiency plays a role in the pathogenesis of this minimally differentiated type of leukemia. The incidence of acquired mutations in AML patients with acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (FAB type M7) was the same as that reported in other non-M0 patients, with only one mutation detected in 20 (5%) patients studied.","['Department of Haematology, University College London, London, United Kingdom. stephenl@icr.ac.uk']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen of the aberrations were reported previously in single cases and hence may be classified as recurrent as a result of the Workshop.

The primary diseases were: breast cancer, 33 patients; lymphomas, 24 patients; various other solid tumors, 30 patients; and nonmalignant diseases, 2 patients. The general type of previous therapy was RT only in 10 patients with an inv(16) and in 12 patients with a t(15;17), alkylating agents plus topoisomerase II inhibitors in 24 patients with an inv(16) and in 18 patients with a t(15;17), topoisomerase II inhibitors only in 5 patients with an inv(16) and in 2 patients with a t(15;17), alkylating agents only in 6 patients in each subgroup, and other types of chemotherapy in 3 patients in each subgroup.

Twenty-six patients (54%) with an inv(16) and 17 patients (41%) with a t(15;17) had additional cytogenetic abnormalities, which were unrelated to age and survival in both subgroups. Trisomy of chromosomes 8, 21, and 22 and del(7q) were the most frequent additional abnormalities in the inv(16) subgroup, whereas +8, -5, and del(16q) were most frequent in the t(15;17) subgroup.

In the inv(16) subgroup, patients younger than 55 years of age had a longer survival when compared with older patients (P = 0.006). The study supports the observation that t-MDS/t-AML with inv(16) and t(15;17) is often associated with prior therapy with topoisomerase II inhibitors; however, a notable finding was the high frequency of treatment with only radiotherapy, 29% of t(15;17) and 21% of inv(16).

The recurring translocation partners were 9p22 (48%), 19p13.3 (11%), 19p13.1 (10%), 4q21 (9%), 6q27 (6%), 1p32 (2%), 16p13.1 (2%), 10p13 (1%), and 17q25 (1%); in 9%, the translocations were seen only once. The remaining 349 patients were divided into five subgroups based on the balanced aberration: 21q22, inv(16), t(15;17), Rare, and Unique aberrations. Patients in the 11q23 subgroup had a sole cytogenetic abnormality more often than those in the 21q22, inv(16), Rare, and Unique subgroups, and a complex karyotype or -5/del(5q) and/or -7/del(7q) less often than patients in the 21q22, Rare, and Unique subgroups. Clinically, 11q23 patients had acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) more often as their primary disease and a shorter latency from start of treatment for the primary disease to their t-MDS/t-AL diagnosis, except when compared with the inv(16) subgroup. The 11q23 subgroup demonstrated a younger age at t-MDS/t-AL diagnosis, but this finding was not significant when patients with AL as their primary diagnosis were excluded. Survival from the time of diagnosis of t-MDS/t-AL was significantly shorter for the 11q23 subgroup compared with that of the 21q22, inv(16), and t(15;17) subgroups (median 8 vs. 14, 28, and 29 months, respectively). Inferior survival occurred even though 11q23 patients were younger and more often received blood or marrow transplantation (BMT). Even among patients receiving BMT, 11q23 patients had a shorter median survival (9 vs. 12-31 months for the other subgroups). However, among 11q23 patients, those receiving BMT survived longer, with 1- and 5-year survivals of 43% and 18% compared with 23% and 7% for patients not transplanted. With regard to prior therapy, 11q23 patients, compared with other patients, received radiotherapy less often as their sole therapy and chemotherapy more often. They had received VP16, methotrexate, 6MP/6TG, L-asparaginase, daunorubicin, cytarabine, and VM26 more often, likely attributed to the high frequency of AL as their primary disease. More patients in the 11q23 subgroup had received doxorubicin, except in comparison with the 21q22 subgroup; more vincristine, except in comparison with the Rare and Unique subgroups; and more prednisone, except in comparison with the Unique subgroup. Patients in the 11q23 subgroup more often received alkylating agents (AAs) (86% vs. 59-82% for the other subgroups), and topoisomerase II inhibitors (TIs) (84% vs. 49-75%), and they more often reported exposure to AAs plus TIs without radiotherapy (33% vs. 12-21%), except in comparison with the 21q22 subgroup (36%). We performed a multivariate analysis to determine whether the adverse survival of 11q23 patients compared to other Workshop patients was explained by factors other than the presence of the 11q23 abnormality. Covariates in the final model were the five cytogenetic subgroup indicators, where the 11q23 subgroup was the referent (P < 0.0001); age at t-MDS/t-AL (P = 0.0036); previous exposure to lomustine (P < 0.0001) and mitoxantrone (P = 0.0225); BMT for t-MDS/t-AL (P = 0.0006); and karyotype complexity (P = 0.0114). The risk of death for 11q23 patients relative to patients in the 21q22, inv(16), t(15;17), and Unique subgroups was significant, even after adjustment for other risk factors (relative risks 2.3, 3.6, 3.1, and 1.5, respectively; P < 0.0001 for the first three comparisons and P = 0.0125 for the last). When a multivariable model was constructed, excluding patients with AL or MDS as their primary diagnosis, the relative risk of death for 11q23 patients was significantly higher than that of all five other cytogenetic subgroups. We conclude that among t-MDS/t-AL patients with balanced aberrations, 11q23 translocations are an independent adverse risk factor. Although BMT is the current therapy of choice, new treatment is required.","['Division of Hematology and Oncology and the Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']","['CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77658/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hemorrhagic complications lead to significant morbidity and mortality in patients with APL. Up to 30% of early deaths are due to hemorrhagic complications. Our concept of the coagulation changes in APL have evolved from a simple belief that the bleeding was due to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) from underlying infection, to a knowledge that the APL cells themselves are responsible for the bleeding. We have observed that apoptotic APL cells have increased generation of thrombin and therefore contribute to the hypercoagulability and DIC. In addition, excessive fibrinolysis has been recognized to play an important role. The advent of a new therapeutic approach with all-trans-retinoic acid has improved overall survival and has greatly shortened the hemorrhagic phase of the disease, but only to produce a new complication, the retinoic acid syndrome. Its pathogenesis and management still remain to be the challenge for the present.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, the Robert H.Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA.']",,,,,40,"['Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate such research, a multi-institutional consortium established the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS), a large, diverse, and well-characterized cohort of 5-year survivors of childhood and adolescent cancer. PROCEDURE: Eligibility for the CCSS cohort included a selected group of cancer diagnoses prior to age 21 years between 1970-1986 and survival for at least 5 years. RESULTS: A total of 20,276 eligible subjects were identified from the 25 contributing institutions, of whom 15% are considered lost to follow-up. Currently, 14,054 subjects (69.3% of the eligible cohort) have participated by completing a 24-page baseline questionnaire. The distribution of first diagnoses includes leukemia (33%), lymphoma (21%), neuroblastoma (7%), CNS tumor (13%), bone tumor (8%), kidney tumor (9%), and soft-tissue sarcoma (9%). Abstraction of medical records for chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgical procedures has been successfully completed for 98% of study participants. Overall, 78% received radiotherapy and 73% chemotherapy. CONCLUSION: The CCSS represents the largest and most extensively characterized cohort of childhood and adolescent cancer survivors in North America. It serves as a resource for addressing important issues such as risk of second malignancies, endocrine and reproductive outcome, cardiopulmonary complications, and psychosocial implications, among this unique and ever-growing population.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['U24 CA 55727/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) inhibits the phosphorylation of araC (by feedback inhibition of the enzyme deoxycytidine kinase) and the incorporation of araCTP into DNA (by competition for DNA polymerase). In a T-lymphoblastic cell line, we studied whether the cytotoxicity of araC (2 nM-50 microM) could be enhanced by decreasing the concentration of dCTP, using the nucleoside-analogue cyclopentenyl cytosine (CPEC), an inhibitor of the enzyme CTP synthetase. Preincubation of the cells with CPEC (100-1,600 nM) for 2 hr increased the concentrations of araCMP 1.6-9.5-fold, which was significant for each concentration of CPEC used. The concentration of araCDP remained low, whereas the concentration of araCTP changed depending on the concentration of araC used. With 2-15 microm of araC and a preincubation with 400 nM of CPEC, the araCTP concentration increased by 4-15% (not significant), and the total amount of araC nucleotides increased significantly by 21-45%. When using a concentration of araC of 2 nM after a preincubation with CPEC of 100 nM, the concentration of araCMP increased by 60% (p = 0.015), whereas that of araCTP decreased by 10% (p = 0.008). This was compensated by an increase of 41% (p = 0.005) of araCTP incorporation into DNA, which represented 43% of all araC metabolites. Moreover, by performing pulse/chase experiments with 400 nM of CPEC and 2 microM of araC, the retention of cytosolic araCTP and the incorporated amount of araCTP into DNA were increased by CPEC. The modulation by CPEC of araC metabolism was accompanied by a synergistic increase of araC-induced apoptosis and by an additive effect on the araC-induced growth inhibition.","['Laboratory of Genetic Metabolic Diseases, Division of Clinical Chemistry, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Emma Kinderziekenhuis AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. a.c.verschuur@amc.uva.nl']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the incidence of VCR-related central nervous system (CNS) toxicity is comparatively low, suggesting that the blood-brain barrier may limit drug penetration into the brain parenchyma. This study determined whether measurable concentrations of VCR could be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as a surrogate marker of brain parenchyma penetration, after bolus intravenous injection in children without primary CNS pathology. METHODS: The authors studied 17 pediatric patients ages 2.5-14.1 years (median, 6.8 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or non-Hodgkin lymphoma without evidence of leptomeningeal disease. Patients received VCR 1.5 mg/m2 by intravenous bolus injection followed at varying intervals by lumbar puncture for scheduled intrathecal methotrexate administration under general anesthesia. Paired VCR concentrations in both plasma and CSF were measured in each patient simultaneously at times ranging from 8 minutes to 146 minutes after the VCR injection. Three patients were studied twice. The paired samples were stored at -40 degrees C until analysis using a high performance liquid chromatography assay with a sensitivity of 0.1 microg/L in CSF and 0.4 microg/L in plasma. RESULTS: Plasma VCR concentrations ranged from 2.2 microg/L to 91.2 microg/L. No measurable VCR concentrations were detected in the CSF samples. CONCLUSIONS: Measurable concentrations of VCR in CSF are not achieved after the administration of standard intravenous bolus doses of VCR. The current observations are consistent with the relative rarity of VCR-related CNS neurotoxicity compared with the commonly observed sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathies. These findings suggest that the penetration of VCR into the brain parenchyma of patients with a relatively intact blood-brain barrier is low and that VCR may have a limited role in the CNS-directed therapy of these patients.","[""Oncology Unit and Department of Paediatrics and Child Health, the University of Sydney, The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Westmead, New South Wales, Australia. stewartk@chw.edu.au""]",,,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: Clinical records of 2 patients reported here and 72 patients gathered using a literature search on Medline from other institutions were analyzed. The patients consisted of 57 patients who preceded acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL) and 17 patients who did not develop ANLL. These patients were divided into 3 groups by therapeutic regimens; Group I included 12 patients who received only biopsy or surgical resection of the tumor, Group II was 20 patients who received local irradiation for the tumor, and Group III consisted of 42 patients who received systemic chemotherapy. The nonleukemic periods between these groups were compared. In Group III, the period in the patients who were treated with chemotherapy given to ANLL was compared with that in the patients who received chemotherapy used for malignant lymphoproliferative disorders (MLPDs). RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (47%) initially were misdiagnosed, and the disease was most often malignant lymphoma. Preferential sites of GS were the small intestine, mediastinum, epidural site, uterus, and ovary, which often are difficult for the detection and diagnosis in addition to the skin and lymph nodes known commonly. The nonleukemic period after the diagnosis of GS was significantly longer in Group III than in the other groups (median, 12 months in Group III vs. 3 and 6 months in Groups I and II, respectively). The aggressive chemotherapy given to ANLL led to a longer nonleukemic period than the chemotherapy used for MLPDs. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce the risk of subsequent ANLL in patients with nonleukemic GS, it is important that accurate histologic diagnosis is established initially for GS and that all isolated cases of GS, even those that appear to be cured by resection or irradiation of the tumor, are treated with intensive chemotherapy similar to that used to treat ANLL during the nonleukemic period as soon as possible.","['Division of Rheumatology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan. 0433086501@jcom.home.ne.jp']",,,,,59,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: To better clarify CD23 role as a diagnostic tool, the authors retrospectively evaluated clinical and laboratory features of 372 patients who were referred to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center with a diagnosis of CLL or B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disease. RESULTS: Most of the patients (91%) were CD19+/CD5+. Only 6% of these CD19+/CD5+ patients were CD23-. Overall, CD23- patients had the worse prognostic features compared with CD23+ cases, including anemia (P = 0.03), massive splenomegaly (P = 0.000), high lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.007), high beta2-microglobulin (P = 0.006), older age (P = 0.001), and male gender (P = 0.02). Surface immunoglobulin expression was moderate/strong in 19 (82%) patients, and FMC-7 was positive in 22 (96%) patients. None of the 13 patients tested for CD10 expressed the antigen. Based on morphology, of the CD23, 16 (70%) were diagnosed with mantle cell leukemia (MCL) was diagnosed in 16 (70%) CD23- patients, 3 (13%) with splenic marginal-zone leukemia, 3 (13%) with prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) or PLL/CLL, and 1 (4%) with CLL. No cyclin D1 protein expression was noted by Western blot analysis in the one case that showed typical CLL morphology, and this patient did not require therapy. On the whole, the survival rate of CD23- patients was significantly worse than that of patients with CD23+. In contrast, 15 of 32 (49%) CD19+/CD5- patients were CD23-. CD23 negativity in this group was not associated with distinct clinical features or outcome. Eleven (73%) of these patients were classified as having splenic marginal-zone lymphoma and 4 as having follicular lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that CD23 negativity is rare in typical B-cell CLL, and CD23 negativity in patients with CD19+/CD5+ is suggestive of mantle cell leukemia a more aggressive disease with poor response to conventional therapy in which newer chemotherapy regimens such as hyper-CVAD may be more effective.","['Institute of Hematology, University of Catania, Italy.']",,,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Bilateral bone marrow biopsy specimens included 883 specimens that were evaluated for involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); 381 specimens that were evaluated for involvement by carcinoma (CA); 362 specimens that were evaluated for involvement by Hodgkin disease (HD); 94 specimens that were evaluated for involvement by sarcoma (SA); 56 specimens that were evaluated for involvement by multiple myeloma (MM); 53 specimens that were evaluated for involvement by acute and chronic leukemia, myelodysplasia, and/or myeloproliferative disorders (LEUK); and 35 specimens that were evaluated for other reasons. RESULTS: Of all 1864 specimens, 410 samples (22.0%) were positive for disease, including 77% of MM samples, 58% of LEUK samples, 29.6% of NHL samples, 14% of SA samples, 9.9% of HD samples, and 6.8% of CA samples. A discrepancy between the left and right sides was identified in 48 specimens (11.7% of positive samples). The discrepancy rate was 39% for HD samples, 29% for SA samples, 23% for CA samples, and 9.2% for NHL samples. No morphologic discrepancies between bilateral samples were found in MM samples or LEUK samples. Bilateral flow cytometric studies (n = 113 samples) were positive in 11 samples (9.7%; all morphologically positive), with two discrepancies detected between bilateral samples. Bilateral cytogenetic studies (n = 74 samples) were positive in 5 samples (7%), and there were no discrepancies. Bilateral molecular studies (n = 16 samples) were positive in 7 samples (44%), and there were 3 discrepancies. CONCLUSIONS: Bilateral morphologic evaluation is useful in the evaluation of patients with NHL, HD, CA, and SA and is not indicated for patients with acute or chronic leukemia, myelodysplasia, MM, and other diseases. Bilateral flow cytometric or cytogenetic studies of bone marrow did not provide additional information in this population to justify bilateral samples. The role of bilateral molecular analysis needs to be defined further, but pooled samples for molecular studies may be adequate.","['Division of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA.']","['CA-30206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Because vascularity is increased in the bone marrow of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the authors evaluated the clinical significance of Tie-1 expression in such patients. METHODS: Using Western blot analysis and solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA), the authors quantified Tie-1 protein in bone marrow samples from 128 patients with CML and 31 normal controls. RESULTS: The median Tie-1 RIA value of CML samples was significantly higher than in normal controls (P = 0.01). The authors found no significant differences in Tie-1 levels in patients with early chronic, late chronic, accelerated, and blastic phases (P = 0.2). High Tie-1 levels correlated with short survival in patients with early chronic phase (P = 0.003; Cox proportional hazard model) but not in patients with late chronic (P = 0.2) or accelerated/blastic (P = 0.2) phase CML. Tie-1 protein level was also prognostic when patients were separated into two groups by the median value. High Tie-1 level in early chronic phase was associated with significantly shorter survival than low Tie-1 level (median survival, 116 vs. 61 months; P = 0.03). In patients with early chronic phase CML, Tie-1 levels correlated directly with patient age (P = 0.004) and platelet count (P = 0.003), and inversely with leukocyte count (P = 0.007). Tie-1 as a predictor of survival in early chronic phase CML was independent of risk group, spleen size, age, hemoglobin, and basophil count (P = 0.03; multivariate Cox proportional hazard model). CONCLUSIONS: The authors' findings support the hypothesis that angiogenesis may play a major role in the pathophysiology of chronic phase CML.","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M. D.

The authors previously showed a relatively low prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection in individuals with human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1) infection, including patients with ATLL; however, the correlation between H. pylori infection and ATLL gastric involvement has not been investigated. METHODS: The authors studied 71 patients with ATLL. Gastric involvement was confirmed by endoscopy and biopsy. H. pylori infection was detected by serology, rapid urease test, and immunohistochemistry on biopsy samples. The expression of adhesion molecules on ATLL cells or their ligands on the vasculature in gastric mucosa was analyzed immunohistochemically. The expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) was detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. RESULTS: Gastric involvement was detected in 21 patients (30%), including 8 patients with acute clinical subtype ATLL and 13 patients with lymphoma type ATLL. The prevalence of H. pylori infection was 86% (18 of 21 patients) in the patients with gastric involvement but only 38% (19 of 50 patients) in the patients without such involvement (P < 0.001). The expression of lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) and its ligand, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), was most frequent on ATLL cells infiltrating the stomach and was enhanced substantially on vascular endothelium in H. pylori-infected gastric mucosa. Human mucosal lymphocyte antigen 1 also was expressed on infiltrating ATLL cells in the stomach. The expression of MAdCAM-1 mRNA assessed by RT-PCR also was seen selectively in H. pylori-infected patients. CONCLUSIONS: ATLL cells infiltrate gastric tissues infected with H. pylori, probably through the interaction of adhesion molecules on these cells and their ligands on the vasculature, i.e., through the LFA-1/ICAM-1 pathway.","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan.']",,,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The authors investigated the feasibility and efficacy of hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (hyper-CVAD), a dose-intensive chemotherapy regimen, in patients with AIDS-associated Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, as well as the possible impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in these patients. METHODS: Thirteen patients with AIDS-associated Burkitt lymphoma (six patients) or leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia; seven patients) were treated with hyper-CVAD alternating with high-dose methotrexate and ara-C for a total of eight cycles. Nine patients received HAART from the start of induction chemotherapy (seven patients) or later in the course of chemotherapy (two patients). The median patient age was 43 years (range, 32-55). Nine patients were diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at the time of diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia; the other 4 patients had been diagnosed with HIV infection for a median of 37 months (range, 18-137) prior to the diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia. The median absolute CD4 count from the 9 patients with evaluable counts was 77 cells/microL (range, 9-544); only one patient had a count > 200/microL. RESULTS: Twelve patients (92%) achieved a complete remission (CR) and one achieved a partial response (PR). Eight patients continued in CR after a median of 31 months (range, 7-45) at the time of writing. Five patients were alive and in CR over two years later. The median survival was 12 months, with 48% of patients alive after 2 years. Six of seven patients who received HAART from the start of chemotherapy were alive and in CR after a median of 29 months (range, 7-45). The four patients who did not receive HAART died. The regimen was universally myelosuppressive, but the toxicity profiles, recoveries from myelosuppression, and incidences of infectious complications were similar to that of non-HIV patients with Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia treated with the same regimen. CONCLUSIONS: Hyper-CVAD is an effective regimen for patients with AIDS-associated Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia, with acceptable toxicity. The combination of hyper-CVAD and HAART is associated with long-term survival in patients with the two diseases, which, until recently, were both considered invariably fatal and almost futile to treat medically.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. jcortes@mdanderson.org']",,,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To the authors' knowledge, the clinical significance of these breakpoints in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has not been previously investigated. METHODS: Centrally reviewed karyotypes of children with newly diagnosed ALL enrolled on Children's Cancer Group protocols from 1988 to 1995 formed the basis of the current report. Statistical analyses used chi-square tests for homogeneity of proportions, and outcome was analyzed using life table methods and associated statistics. RESULTS: Of 1946 cases with centrally reviewed and accepted cytogenetic analyses, 23 cases (1%) had breakpoints in chromosome bands 15q13-15. Most patients with 15q13-15 breakpoints had standard risk ALL, although breakpoints in 15q13-15 occurred more frequently in infants than in older children. The majority of these patients (16 patients; 70%) had balanced 15q13-15 rearrangements. Additional chromosomal abnormalities not involving 15q included abnormal 12p, abnormal 9p, Philadelphia chromosome, deletion 6q, and an 11q23 breakpoint. Thirteen (57%) 15q13-15 breakpoints occurred in pseudodiploid karyotypes; five (22%) were in hyperdiploid karyotypes with 47-50 chromosomes; two (9%) were in hyperdiploid karyotypes with > 50 chromosomes; and three (13%) were in hypodiploid karyotypes. Of the 23 patients with 15q13-15 breakpoints, 21 were survivors, 18 survived event-free for 2.2-9.3 years, and 3 were alive 1 to 3 years after a relapse at time of writing. CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that genes at 15q13-15 may be involved in the leukemogenesis of some cases of childhood ALL, but that with current intensive therapy such aberrations do not confer increased risk of treatment failure.","['The Ohio State University Medical Center, Department of Pathology, Columbus, Ohio, USA. heerema-1@medctr.osu.edu']","['CA-13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,['Copyright 2002 American Cancer Society.

In this multicentric study, we tested four semisolid, serum-free, cytokine-free media based on either methylcellulose (M1, M2) or collagen (C1, C2) commercialized for the EEC assay. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMC) from 73 individuals (62 patients with either polycythemia vera (26), essential thrombocythemia (19), secondary polyglobuly (17) or chronic myeloid leukemia (2) and 11 healthy donors) were grown in parallel in the four media without, or with 0.01 U/ml erythropoietin (EPo). RESULTS: In all four media EEC formation was specific, as it was not observed in cultures of patients with secondary polyglobuly or chronic myeloid leukemia, nor of healthy donors. Analysis of fresh or MGG-stained collagen gel cultures allowed detection of EEC formation significantly more frequently than methylcellulose-based media; addition of 0.01 U/ml of EPo had little or no effect on EEC formation. Collagen-based medium C1 gave better results than the other media tested: the 'C1' EEC assay was positive for 68.2% of polycythemia vera cultures with significantly higher median EEC numbers (6.5/10(5) BMMC for patients with one major criteria of polycythemia vera and 19 and 21/10(5) BMMC for patients with two or three major criteria, respectively). Medium C1 was also better for essential thrombocythemia cultures with 47.4% of positive results but with a low median EEC number (6.7/10(5) BMMC). When associated with the ELISA dosage of serum EPo, the 'C1' EEC assay allowed confirmation or elimination of the diagnosis of polycythemia vera for 91% (20/22) of polyglobulic patients. CONCLUSION: We propose that serum-free collagen-based culture systems be considered to standardize the EEC assay, now part of the new criteria of polycythemia vera.","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Angers, Angers, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both APL translocation products bind to the histone deacetylase (HD)-recruiting nuclear co-repressor complex (HD-NCR) in a ligand-dependent manner through their RARalpha portion. Differently to PML/RARalpha, PLZF/RARalpha also binds the HD-NCR in a ligand-independent manner through the PLZF portion of the fusion protein (PLZF#), which seems to be crucial for the t-RA resistance of t(11;17) APL patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The t-RA sensitivity of U937 cells was tested by the nitro-blue tetrazolium reduction (NBT) assay and by analysis of t-RA-induced type II transglutaminase activity. The interaction between HD-NCR and PLZF/RARalpha was investigated by in vitro binding assays. RESULTS: (i) Deletions in PLZF# convert PLZF/RARalpha from a repressor to an activator of t-RA response in U937 cells; (ii) the effect of PLZF/RARalpha on t-RA-signaling is regulated by the POZ-domain and its down-stream regions of PLZF#; (iii) there are additional binding sites for HD-NCR in PLZF# and (iv) PLZF# not only directly binds but also regulates the binding of PLZF/RARalpha to the HD-NCR. CONCLUSIONS: At least two different mechanisms responsible for the aberrant recruitment of HD-NCR complexes by PLZF# are regulating the different t-RA-sensitivity of the PLZF/RARalpha and PML/RARalpha positive APL blasts: one is related to the direct binding of the different members of the HD-NCR complex to PLZF#; the other is an enforcing effect of PLZF# on the affinity of the PLZF/RARalpha fusion protein to the HD-NCR complex.","['Med.

An increase in transplant-related mortality in male recipients of female stem cells has been recognised and attributed to graft vs host effect against H-Y; in contrast, decreased incidence of relapse, a graft vs leukaemia effect has not yet been described. METHODS: To detect potentially small but significant differences, we performed an analysis in a highly homogeneous group. We have analysed 782 patients, 438 males and 344 females, who were transplanted from HLA-identical female donors for CML in 1st chronic phase between 1989 and 1997. The risk of transplant related mortality (TRM) and relapse incidence (RI) were compared for male and female recipients over three successive time periods, zero to three months, three months to two years and two to five years post-transplant. Both groups were comparable for known risk factors prior to transplant. RESULTS: The cumulative risk of TRM at five years was significantly higher in males (42%, s.e.=3.6) than in females (27%, s.e.=2.8; P=0.02) with no overall effect on risk of relapse. Within the three specified time intervals post-transplantation, the number of events of TRM and RI in the two groups of recipients diverged over time. There was no difference within the first time interval (zero to three months) for both events. TRM was higher in male recipients as manifested from three months onwards over the whole observation period of five years (P=0.02). Risk of relapse was significantly reduced in male patients; this difference became manifest only beyond two years (P=0.01). CONCLUSION: These data confirm the importance of male gender for both, TRM and RI: male recipients of female blood or marrow grafts are at risk of enhanced procedure related mortality, eg GvHD, but benefit from reduced incidence of disease recurrence, hence a GvL effect. GvL in this setting needs more time than GvHD. These data give indirect but convincing evidence for a clinical relevance of H-Y as a minor histocompatibility antigen in humans.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kantonsspital Basel, Switzerland. hematology@uhbs.ch']",,,,"['Chronic Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for Blood and Marrow', 'Transplantation EBMT']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 31 APL patients (19 males and 12 females; aged from 8 to 74 years) from eight hospitals in Shanghai were analysed. Real-time Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measure the normalized dose (DoseN) of PML-RARalpha fusion transcripts. RESULTS: A wide range of PML-RARalpha DoseN above 1 x 10(3) was noted in 25 newly diagnosed patients. PML-RARalpha DoseN was significantly decreased after remission induction with ATRA, ATRA/chemotherapy or As2O3 and further reduced after consolidation. The fact that all patients with long disease free survival had a constantly low PML-RARalpha DoseN below 2 x 10(2) and a higher level predicted impending relapse suggests that this value could serve as a 'threshold' for molecular remission. PML-RARalpha DoseN was also of prognostic value in a group of relapsed patients, since good response to As2O3 reinduction was accompanied by a remarkable reduction of fusion transcript level, whereas patients with high PML-RARalpha Dose(N) after the second CR tended to relapse again rapidly. CONCLUSION: These results confirm that real-time RT-PCR assay for PML-RARalpha transcripts in APL patients is useful in reflecting leukemic burden, assessing response to treatment and indicating the ultimate clinical outcome or curability of disease.","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Key Laboratory of Human Genome Research, Ministry of Public Health and Shanghai Municipality, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, 197 Rui Jin Road II, Shanghai 200025, P.R.

Somatostatin acts through activation of G-protein-coupled receptors of which five subtypes have been identified. We have recently established that human CD34/c-kit expressing hematopoietic progenitors and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells exclusively express SSTR2. A major mechanism implicated in the antiproliferative action of somatostatin involves activation of the SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1. While 0.1-1 x 10(-9) M of somatostatin, or its synthetic stable analog octreotide, can inhibit G-CSF-induced proliferation of AML cells, little or no effects are seen on GM-CSF- or IL-3-induced responses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To study the mechanisms underlying the antiproliferative responses of myeloblasts to somatostatin, clones of the IL-3-dependent murine cell line 32D that stably express SSTR2 and G-CSF receptors were generated. RESULTS: Similar to AML cells, octreotide inhibited G-CSF-induced but not IL-3-induced proliferative responses of 32D[G-CSF-R/SSTR2] cells. Somatostatin induced SHP-1 activity and inhibited G-CSF-induced, but not IL-3-induced, activation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription proteins STAT3 and STAT5. CONCLUSION: Based on these data and previous results, we propose a model in which recruitment and activation of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 by SSTR2 is involved in the selective negative action of somatostatin on G-CSF-R signaling.","['Institute of Hematology, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effectiveness of therapy was also assessed after two cycles of treatment, four weeks apart MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were randomly assigned to two groups, both of which received two cycles of treatment with 90 mg of oral fludarabine phosphate administered when either fed or fasted. Patients in Group 1 (n = 8) received oral treatment on a full stomach for the first cycle then on a fasted stomach for the second, while those in Group 2 (n = 10) received their treatment in the reverse sequence. Oral fludarabine phosphate was administered on the first day of the two study cycles and intravenous fludarabine phosphate was administered on days 3-6. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Of 22 patients recruited, 18 (CLL n = 10; NHL n = 8) were eligible for efficacy and safety evaluation, and 16 for bioavailability and pharmacokinetic analyses. The response to oral 2-F-ara-AMP was rapid: by two treatment cycles, 12 out of 18 patients (66.7%) had achieved partial response. Of the six patients who did not respond, five patients (27.7%) had stable disease. There was no notable difference in the rate of response between patients with B-CLL and lg-NHL. There was a marginal increase in total systemic availability of fludarabine phosphate when administered orally on a fed stomach (2-F-ara-A AUC((0-24 h)) = 3.28 +/- 1.48 microg.h/ml) compared to a fasted stomach (2-F-ara-A AUC((0-24 h)) = 3.05 +/- 1.56 microg.h/ml). Time to peak plasma concentration was slightly extended by the presence of food (2.2 +/- 1.0 versus 1.3 +/- 0.74 h) but the terminal half-life was unaffected. The minor differences in the pharmacokinetics of oral fludarabine phosphate when taken after food were not statistically significantly different and seem unlikely to be clinically relevant. The efficacy and safety data closely paralleled previous experience with the intravenous formulation.","['Royal Bournemouth Hospital, Bournemouth, UK. david.oscier@lineone.net']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By quantifying CD20, CD22 and CD52 expression on chronic lymphocytic leukemia and normal (control) B cells, over time. The effect of Interleukin-4 therapy on CD20 antigen intensity on B-CLL cells in vivo was also determined. METHODS: Lymphocytes were purified at weeks 0, 4 and 8 from five B-CLL patients, five healthy volunteers and seven B-CLL patients receiving IL-4 therapy. The number of antigen receptor sites was calculated in molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochrome using flow cytometry. RESULTS: The mean number of CD20 receptors at baseline was significantly lower on B-CLL cells compared to normal B cells (8160 vs 87 046; P<0.0001). Similar results were obtained for CD22 (8630 vs 27 647; P<0.01), but not for CD52 (371 303 vs 409 484; P = 0.54). When soluble fluorochrome values at weeks 4 and 8 were analysed as change in per cent from baseline (delta%), there was <10 delta% variability in CD20 expression on control B cells, but considerable variability (22.5-67.5 delta%) on B-CLL cells. Expression of CD22 in CLL and control B cells varied by <15 delta%. CD52 on CLL B cells showed slightly greater variability (+/-35 delta%) than that of CD22 (+/-15delta%), but less than that of CD20. IL-4 therapy did not consistently increase the CD20 expression on B-CLL cells in vivo. CONCLUSION: Our data confirm differences in intensity between different target antigens on B-CLL cells, and draws attention to the fact that a substantial variability may occur over time, which may influence clinical decision-making. Caution must be taken when interpreting in vitro results on cytokine-mediated receptor intensity up-regulation.","['Department of Oncology (Radiumhemmet), Cancer Center Karolinska, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The optimal donor is an HLA-identical sibling but transplants using unrelated volunteers can also be successful. The factors influencing survival after allogeneic SCT for CML are reasonably well defined. Recently however, the Seattle group have emphasised the influence of a high marrow cell dose on outcome following volunteer unrelated donor SCT for high risk acute leukaemia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have sought to define factors impacting on transplant related mortality (TRM) in a population of CML patients after allografting with matched sibling or alternative stem cell donors at a single centre over a 20-year period, with emphasis on infused marrow cell dose. Factors entered into a multivariate analysis were: recipient age, recipient CMV serostatus, disease phase, donor sex, cell dose and frequency of CTLP reactivity. RESULTS: In multivariate analysis four factors had an adverse effect on TRM when using a VUD: low marrow cell dose (<3.65 x 10(8) TNC/kg, relative risk 2.05, CI 1.08-3.90, P = 0.029), late disease phase (relative risk 1.68, CI 1.03-2.74, P = 0.038), patient CMV seropositivity (relative risk 1.98, CI 1.25-3.13, P = 0.004) and high frequency of CTLP (relative risk 1.93, CI 1.18-3.13, P = 0.008). For HLA-identical sibling donor transplants the only factor that adversely impacted on TRM was late disease phase (P = 0.0004 in univariate analysis). CONCLUSION: High infused cell dose is a new modifiable factor associated with reduced TRM following allogeneic SCT using an unrelated donor for the treatment of CML. The data support the recommendation that bone marrow harvest teams should aim to collect the highest possible number of nucleated cells for recipients of unrelated donor transplants.","['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This stem cell disease is often treated with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) which can initiate haematological and cytological remission which is associated with increased survival. There is however no clear indication of why CML cells are more responsive to IFN-alpha. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To establish if BCR/ABL increases the sensitivity of multipotent cells to IFN-alpha a temperature sensitive mutant of BCR/ABL was expressed in the multipotent haemopoietic stem cell line FDCP-Mix. The effect of IFN-alpha in terms of proliferation, induction of apoptosis, changes in cell cycle inhibitor proteins, and differentiation was assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation, Annexin V and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: When the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase was activated, the IFN-alpha-induced inhibition on the growth rate of the FDCP-Mix cell population was more marked than in control populations. The BCR/ABL-mediated effect was due to decreased rates of DNA synthesis. There was no IFN-alpha-mediated induction of apoptosis. This enhanced BCR/ABL mediated growth inhibition occurred over a range of growth factor concentrations and was independent of changes in p21(Cip1) and p27(Kip) levels. When FDCP-Mix cells were induced to differentiate into mature macrophages and neutrophils in the presence of IFN-alpha, there was increased sensitivity to IFN-alpha that was independent of BCR/ABL activity. CONCLUSION: BCR/ABL PTK expression in this primitive multipotent haematopoietic cell line results in an enhanced response to IFN-alpha. In contrast, the more mature myeloid progenitor cells are equally responsive to this growth inhibitor. This data may explain some of the clinical effects of IFN-alpha.","['Leukaemia Research Fund Cellular Development Unit, Department of Biomolecular Sciences, UMIST, Manchester M60 1QD, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the presence of certain features rarely observed in MCL, such as transformation to prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL) or indolent clinical course, suggests that MCLeu may represent a distinct disorder. METHODS: Seven cases of MCLeu with t(11;14)(q13;q32) and BCL1-IGH gene rearrangement were ascertained among 140 newly diagnosed chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders with leukemic expression. Comparative genomic hybridization, FISH for specific gene loci, and immunological studies were preformed in them. RESULTS: In comparison with CLL, MCLeu cases had low immunological scores < or =2 with respect to B-CLL (P<0.0001). Expression of CD38 was absent in 43% of MCLeu and in 44% of B-CLL. Comparative genomic hybridization analysis identified genomic imbalances in 86% of MCLeu with a similar pattern than in MCL: gains of 3q, 8q involving MYC gene and 15q, and losses of 6q, 9p, 13q and 17p affecting P53 gene. Differently from MCL and CLL, genomic loss of 8p was frequently detected in MCLeu (83%). Although clinical presentation of MCLeu was indistinguishable from CLL, all patients but one had disease progression within three years. According to the immunologic and genomic profiles, two distinct subgroups of MCLeu were defined: one related to PLL, showing CD38-, deletion of P53, and MYC amplification and another which corresponds to a leukemic form of classical MCL, presenting with CD38+ and normal P53 and MYC status. CONCLUSION: MCLeu and MCL are closely related disorders, as they show similar genomic and molecular patterns. However, the deletion of the short arm of chromosome 8 may represent a specific marker for MCLeu. Two distinct subgroups of MCLeu may also be distinguished according to the immunologic and genomic cell profiles.","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Hospital Clinico, University of Valencia, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood stem cells were used in all cases. Eleven patients were in CR1. Patients with t(8;21) and inv(16) as well as those with acute promyelocytic leukemia were excluded from the study. The median of CD34+ cells infused was 6.2 x 10(6)/l (2.6-16.1). RESULTS: No case of transplant-related mortality occurred. The median number of days to neutrophil (>0.5 x 10(9)/l) and platelet (>20 x 10(9)/l) recovery was 10 (7-21) and 20 (9-26), respectively. Patients needed a median of 3 platelet units (1-6) and 3 blood units (0-12), respectively. Left ventricular ejection fraction remained unmodified after ASCT. Twelve out of 13 patients (92%) had variable grade of mucositis (two grade 2, five grade 3 and five grade 4). Total parenteral nutrition was needed in nine patients (69%). After a median follow-up of 14 months from ASCT, 11 patients out of 13 (85%) are alive in continuous CR; the other two patients experienced relapse at 12 and 14 months. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate the feasibility of a conditioning regimen based on high-dose IDA plus Busulphan in AML.

The gene undergoes rapid down-regulation as these cells are induced to differentiate, and constitutive expression in cultured myeloid stem cells retards maturation. Serpin 2A is also expressed in T cells as a consequence of activation. We now report analysis of the upstream regulatory elements that control Serpin 2A transcription. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using primer extension and rapid amplification of cDNA ends the transcription start site of the Serpin 2A gene was mapped, and a 1.2 Kb genomic upstream fragment cloned and sequenced. Promoter activity and protein binding of deletion and site-directed mutant constructs were analysed by transient transfection and by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. RESULTS: A minimal promoter fragment was identified with high activity dependent on NF-kappa and Moloney murine leukaemia enhancer factor LVa binding sites in both myeloid stem cells and activated T cells. NF-kappa was shown to be the main DNA binding protein in T cells, whereas that in haematopoietic stem cells appears to be novel. CONCLUSION: Serpin 2A promoter activity in T cells is due predominantly to NF-kappa binding to its consensus site. Activity in haematopoietic stem cells appears to be mediated by a novel protein, which recognises the NF-kappa consensus only in the context of flanking sequences. This concise regulatory element may be of potential value in gene therapeutic applications.","['CRC Department of Hematopoietic Cell and Gene Therapeutics, Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Wilmslow Road, Manchester M20 4BX, UK. lynne.hampson@man.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this model, cell cycle regulators play a central role as a source of genetic events; particularly, p16/INK4a gene acts as a tumoral suppressor gene and, recently, inactivation of this gene through a methylation mechanism, has been observed in multiple myeloma patients. Under the diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathies there is a broad spectrum of disorders with very different outcomes, ranging from indolent courses, such as those of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, Waldestron macroglobulinemia and smoldering multiple myeloma, to aggressive diseases such as symptomatic MM and primary plasma cell leukemia. To the best of our knowledge, the activity of p16 gene has not been evaluated and compared in these different subtypes of monoclonal gammopathies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The methylation status of the p16 gene was analysed in a group of 159 patients with monoclonal gammopathies (40 monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance, eight Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia, eight smoldering multiple myeloma, 98 symptomatic multiple myeloma and five primary plasma cell leukemia) using three different assays (restriction enzymes and PCR or S-B and modification by sodium bisulphite). RESULTS: Forty-one of 98 MM patients (41.8%) as well as four of the five (80%) primary PCL patients showed methylation of the p16 gene, while none of the patients with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia or smoldering multiple myeloma displayed a methylation status. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the methylation of the p16 gene could be a relevant oncogenic event in the monoclonal gammopathies evolution being associated with the most aggressive forms.","['Hematology Service, University Hospital of Salamanca, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results were compared with those obtained in the same cases by conventional cytogenetics and by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was performed using DNA probes that span the common breakpoints of the t(9;22) translocation and that detect a double BCR/ABL fusion in cells carrying this karyotypic anomaly, one on the abnormal chromosome 9 and one on the Ph chromosome. RESULTS: Interphase D-FISH detected a high number of rearranged cases (22/106) compared to conventional cytogenetics (15/106) and RT-PCR (21/106). CONCLUSION: Interphase D-FISH emerges as a reliable, fast and relatively inexpensive tool for the detection of BCR/ABL rearrangements in adult ALL patients at diagnosis. It has a sensitivity clearly higher than conventional karyotyping and it may prove also superior to that of RT-PCR in cases with unusual BCR/ABL breakpoints. Our results suggest that D-FISH might be considered as the initial test for the diagnosis of Ph+ adult ALL.","[""Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University 'La Sapienza', Rome, Italy. mancini@bce.med.uniromal.it""]",,,,['GIMEMA study group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The role of IL-6 and other gp130-cytokines was studied in the human plasma cell line INA-6 in vitro and in INA-6 xenografts. The proliferative response to gp130-cytokines was evaluated and activated components of gp130-signaling pathways were identified by Western blotting and DNA binding studies. Specifically, expression of IL-6 and receptors for IL-6 and leukemia inhibitory factor were analysed by RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: The plasma cell line INA-6 was cultured for several years remaining strictly dependent on exogenous IL-6. Other gp130-cytokines had no significant effect on INA-6 cell proliferation in vitro. Due to an activating mutation in the N-ras gene, mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) were constitutively phosphorylated. In contrast, signal transducer and activator of transcription(STAT)-3 activation was dependent on stimulation with IL-6. Blocking of either one of these pathways resulted in a significant decrease of INA-6 cell proliferation. Remarkably, INA-6 xenografts did not require exogeneous IL-6 for proliferation in vivo. Instead, an autocrine IL-6 loop and, in certain tumor sublines, responsiveness to additional gp130-cytokines was induced during in vivo growth. CONCLUSION: Activation of the gp130 signal transducer is mandatory for INA-6 cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Both the MAPK and the Jak/STAT pathway are operative in malignant plasma cells and either one is essential for plasma cell growth. The INA-6 cell line provides a preclinical model to study growth regulation of human plasmacytoma cells and to evaluate novel therapeutic strategies.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine III, University of Erlangen-Nuernberg, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PNH-phenotype has been described in various hematological disorders, mainly in aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, while it has been reported that complete deficiency of CD55 and CD59 has also been found in patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes, like non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The presence of CD55- and/or CD59-defective red cell populations was evaluated in 217 patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes. The study population included 87 patients with NHL, 55 with HD, 49 with CLL, 22 with ALL and four with hairy cell leukemia. One hundred and twenty-one healthy blood donors and seven patients with PNH were also studied as control groups. The sephacryl gel microtyping system was performed for the detection of CD55- and CD59-deficient red cell populations. Ham and sucrose lysis tests were also performed in all samples with CD55 or CD59 negative populations. RESULTS: Red cell populations deficient in both CD55 and CD59 molecules were detected in 9.2% of patients with lymphoproliferative syndromes (more often in ALL and nodular sclerosis type of HD) and in all PNH patients. CD55-deficient red cell populations were found in 8.7% of LPS patients (especially in low grade B-cell NHL), while CD59-deficient populations were found in only two patients with low grade B-cell NHL. CONCLUSION: These data indicate a possible association between paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria phenotype and lymphoproliferative syndromes, while further investigation is necessary to work out the mechanisms and the significance of the existence of this phenotype in these patients.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, University of Athens School of Medicine, Laiko General Hospital, Athens, Greece. imeletis@cc.uoa.gr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such exhaustion could reflect a suppressive effect of the Philadelphia positive clone expansion and/or be induced by Interferon-alpha treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 51 CML patients were classified into three groups. Newly diagnosed untreated patients were group A (n=30). Of the 21 treated individuals with Interferon-alpha, for at least 12 months, 15 showed no cytogenetic response (group B) while six showed persisting major/complete response (group C). Patients belonging to groups A and B were mobilized with chemotherapy plus G-CSF while patients of group C received a short course of G-CSF only. RESULTS: Patients responding to IFN-alpha (group C) showed comparable numbers of bone marrow Ph- long-term culture initiating cells to those of newly diagnosed individuals (group A): 8.5 (<1-65)/10(6) MNC vs 10.5 (<1-30), while non-responders had markedly lower numbers: <1 (<1-5). The amount of Ph- LTC-IC collected was significantly lower in patients of group B 1.8 (0-325)x10(2)/kg than in patients of either group A 31.3 (0-952)x10(2)/kg (P<0.002) or group C 109 (8-259)x10(2)/kg (P<0.01). Interestingly, five patients of group B who had 100% Ph+ metaphases, but Ph- progenitors in their bone marrow, mobilized normal amounts of Ph(-) progenitors. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the decline of normal hematopoietic progenitors, currently observed in the majority of CML patients, is not induced by IFN-alpha treatment, but it is likely due to the expanding leukemic clone. They also indicate that normal hematopoietic reservoir is consistently preserved in patients given IFN-alpha early after diagnosis and achieving a stable cytogenetic response.","['Divisione Ematologia II, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy. frafrassoni@smartino.ge.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, in a murine acute leukemia model, responses (proliferation and IL-2 secretion) to mitogens were suppressed in the early stages of leukemic progression due to a leukemia-derived soluble factor(s). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Correlations between the development of immunosuppression and changes in expression of TCR signaling proteins (CD3-zeta, p56(lck), p59(fyn)), calcium mobilization, and total tyrosine kinase activity following TCR stimulation were examined. RESULTS: In contrast to reduced responses to mitogens seen as early as 1 week following injection of leukemic cells, signaling abnormalities were only seen in advanced disease (ie four weeks). The only significant alteration in signaling protein expression was loss of CD3-zeta for four weeks following the initiation of leukemia. Importantly, a direct role of a leukemia-derived soluble factor(s) in the loss of CD3-zeta could be shown in vitro by co-culturing splenocytes with leukemic cells separated by a transwell for seven to 10 days. Further studies demonstrated that the leukemia-derived factor(s) stimulated splenic macrophages to secrete a second soluble factor(s) that caused the loss of CD3-zeta. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that soluble leukemia-derived factor(s) have both immediate immunosuppressive actions and a later effect acting indirectly to induce intrinsic defects in T-cell signaling pathways via accessory cells. In some tumors, there is evidence that the soluble factor is Fas-ligand, which induces apoptosis in tumor-infiltrating T cells and the action of activated caspases cleave CD3-zeta. In this model, the soluble factor prevents apoptosis indicating a second mechanism is responsible for the loss of T-cell signaling proteins.","[""Department of Haematology, Guy's, King's and St. Thomas' School of Medicine, Rayne Institute, 123 Coldharbour Lane, London SE5 9NU, UK.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients > or =60 years of age with previously untreated AML received valspodar (10 mg/kg/24 h by continuous intravenous infusion [CIV] on days 1-4 with a 2-mg/kg loading dose on day 1) in conjunction with two cycles of induction chemotherapy consisting of cytarabine (200 mg/m(2) CIV on days 1-7), and DNR (35 mg/m(2) [cohort 1] or 45 mg/m(2) [cohort 2] on days 1-3, intravenous bolus). Patients were assessed for dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), response rate, event-free and overall survival, and pharmacokinetics of valspodar and DNR. RESULTS: Valspodar was well tolerated at the lower DNR dose level (ie, 35 mg/m(2)) resulting in a 21% rate of DLT and only three toxic deaths. Treatment-related mortality was unacceptably high at the 45 mg/m(2) DNR dose level. The complete response rate was 49% overall and similar in both cohorts. The median overall survival of patients was 333 days in cohort 1 compared to 98 days in cohort 2. At baseline, 70% of assessable patients were P-glycoprotein positive. CONCLUSION: Substantial inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity can be achieved in this patient population at clinically tolerable doses of valspodar and DNR. The maximum tolerated dose of DNR was established as 35 mg/m(2). This regimen is being further evaluated in phase III trials.","['Department of Hematology, Cancer Center, University Hospital Rotterdam Dijkzigt Room L407, Dr Molewaterplein 40, 3015 GD Rotterdam, The Netherlands. sonneveld@haed.azr.nl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HA-1/HA-2-specific cytotoxic T cells with strong cytotoxic activity against HA-1/HA-2 positive target cells can be generated in vitro using HA-1 and HA-2 peptide-pulsed dendritic cells as antigen presenting cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We used HLA-A2 HA-1/HA-2 tetramers (HA-1(A2)/HA-2(A2) tetramers) to monitor the in vitro generation of HA-1- or HA-2-specific cytotoxic T cells. RESULTS: We show that the intensity of the tetramer-staining of the HA-1/HA-2-specific cytotoxic T cells strongly correlates with their capability to recognize mHag positive target cells. The bright tetramer-staining cytotoxic T cells lyse target cells expressing the natural ligand. The dim tetramer-staining cytotoxic T cells fail to lyse natural ligand positive target cells and lyse peptide-pulsed target cells only. The frequency of bright tetramer-staining, high avidity minor histocompatibility antigen-specific CTLs increases significantly upon appropriate antigen-specific restimulations. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that HLA class I-minor histocompatibility antigen tetramers are useful tools for monitoring and selection of high avidity HA-1- and HA-2-specific cytotoxic T cells for adoptive immunotherapy.","['Molecular Immunology Group, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood is the stem cell source of choice, however, various mobilisation strategies are used by different centres. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Over a 2-year period, 52 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (median age 47 years, range 16-64 years) underwent peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilisation using G-CSF alone (16 microg/kg/day). The harvest was considered successful if > or =1 x 10(6) CD34(+) cells/kg were collected by leukapheresis. The histological subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma comprised: follicular (24 patients), diffuse large B-cell (14 patients), lymphoplasmacytoid (four patients), mantle cell (three patients), lymphoblastic lymphoma (one patient) and small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (six patients). The median interval from diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma to mobilisation was 27 months (range 2 months to 17 years). The median number of prior treatment episodes was 2 (range 1-5); 26 patients had received fludarabine alone or in combination. At the time of peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilisation, 20 patients were in 1st remission and 32 were in > or =2nd remission; 30 patients were in partial remission and 22 were in complete remission; the bone marrow was involved in nine patients. RESULTS: Peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilisation/harvest was unsuccessful in 19 out of 52 (37%) patients (mobilisation: 18, harvest: 1). The factors associated with unsuccessful mobilisation or harvest were: prior fludarabine therapy (P=0.002), bone marrow involvement at diagnosis (P=0.002), bone marrow involvement anytime prior to mobilisation (P=0.02), histological diagnosis of follicular, mantle cell, or lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma, or small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (P=0.03) and female gender (P=0.04). CONCLUSION: Although peripheral blood progenitor cells can be successfully mobilised and harvested from the majority of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma after treatment with G-CSF alone, the latter is unsuccessful in approximately one-third of patients. These factors should be taken into account when patients are being considered for high-dose treatment.","[""Imperial Cancer Research Fund Medical Oncology Unit, Department of Medical Oncology, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, 45 Little Britain, West Smithfield, London EC1A 7BE, UK.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numbers of transplants have increased significantly and stem cell source, donor type and indications have changed during this decade. Information on these changes is essential for interpretation of current data, patient counseling and health care planning. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Since 1990, members of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and teams known to perform blood or marrow transplants have been invited annually to report their transplant numbers by indication, donor type and stem cell source. Data from these surveys have been used to present data for 1998, to assess current status and to give numbers of transplants per participating country, coefficients of variation between countries for individual indications and changes in indication, stem cell source and donor type over the past decade. RESULTS: In 1998, a total of 20 892 transplants were performed by 528 teams in 31 European countries. Of these transplants 18 400 were first transplants, 5308 (29%) were allogenic, and 13 092 (71%) were autologous. Of the autologous transplants, 809 (6%) were bone marrow derived, and 12 283 (94%) were from peripheral blood stems cells. Of the allogeneic transplants, 3372 (64%) were bone marrow derived, and 1936 (36%) were peripheral blood stem cell transplants. In 1990, the respective figures were 2137 allogeneic (50%) and 2097 (50%) autologous transplants, all exclusively bone marrow derived. Main indications in 1998 were leukemias with 6015 transplants (33%), 68% thereof allogeneic transplants; lymphomas with 7492 transplants (41%), 94% thereof autologous transplants; solid tumors with 4025 transplants (22%), 99% thereof autologous transplants; non-malignant disorders with 868 transplants (5%), 80% thereof allogeneic transplants. Absolute numbers of transplants per year did increase from 4234 in 1990 to 20 892 in 1998. Increase is higher for autologous, than for allogeneic transplants. There were differences in absolute or relative increase over time for individual indications. Transplant rates per number of inhabitants varied between countries, ranging from 0 to >500 total transplants per 10 million inhabitants with a clear correlation between number of teams and transplants per 10 million inhabitants (r=0.61, P<0.001). The least variation between countries was observed for acute leukemias, chronic myeloid leukemia and severe aplastic anemia in allogeneic transplants, for Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in autologous transplants. CONCLUSION: These data reflect the current status of blood and marrow transplantation in Europe. They show the continuing increase in utilization, highlight the change from bone marrow to blood as stem cell source and give an objective assessment on presence or absence of trends.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Kantonsspital Basel, CH-4031 Basel, Switzerland. hematology@uhbs.ch']",,,,['European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessment was also made of the clinical course, laboratory features and overall outcome of these conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A four-year, multi-center retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the effect of treatment for previous hematological malignancy on the development of secondary leukemia. The study collected in the GIMEMA Archive of Adult Acute Leukemia 3934 new cases of acute leukemia (2964 AML, 901 ALL, 60 acute biphenotypic leukemia). Among these cases, data were evaluated from patients with a personal history of a previous malignancy, and included inquiring into demographic data, history of neoplastic diseases in the 1st degree relatives, type and treatment of the previous malignancy, latency until the development of a secondary acute leukemia diagnosis, laboratory features, treatment and outcome at the onset of secondary acute leukemia. RESULTS: Approximately 200 (5.1%) patients presented a previous malignancy. Twenty-one were affected by ALL and 179 by AML. The proportion of patients with secondary AML was higher than that of patients with secondary ALL (179/2964 vs 21/901, O.R. 2.69-95% C.I. 1.66-4.39, P<0.001). The median latency, from the onset of the previous malignancy to the development of secondary ALL was 27 months and to the development of secondary AML was 52 months (P<0.05). Furthermore, of patients who previously received chemotherapy more developed a second AML (66/127 sAML vs 5/21 sALL; O.R. 3.46-95% C.I. 1.10-11.56, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: In most cases, chemotherapy treatment for a previous malignancy can play a role in the development of secondary AML. In almost all cases of secondary ALL, the role of previous drugs does not appear to be relevant. On the basis of our analysis, performed systematically for the first time on a large adult series of acute leukemia, we conclude that in these patients a biological predisposition to cancer may be suspected.","['Department of Hematology, Catholic University, Largo Francesco Vito 1, I-00168 Rome, Italy. lpagano@rm.unicatt.it']",,,,"[""Italian GIMEMA Group (Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One hypothesis to target sensitive cells is to select leukemic clones which harbor disrupted transcription factors. CBFalpha and CBFbeta are core-binding proteins which have been identified as transcription regulators of hematopoietic genes and shown to be altered in numerous leukemias. In M2 AML, the t(8;21) translocation, CBFalpha (AML1) is altered and produced as the AML1-ETO fusion protein. The fusion protein blocks transcription and differentiation mediated by G-CSF. Interestingly, AML1-ETO leukemic cell lines are sensitive to numerous cytokines in vitro and can be induced to differentiate in the presence of G-CSF and PMA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As in the APL differentiation model, primary culture provides a useful tool for therapeutic screening of differentiation inducers, we analysed the in vitro sensitivity of 10 fresh M2 AML t(8;21) leukemic samples to G-CSF and the functionality of G-CSF intracellular pathways. In vitro data were compared with in vivo data from four patients treated with rhG-CSF at the dosage of 5 microg/kg/day i.v. for two to three weeks before the initiation of AML induction chemotherapy and immunophenotypic analysis performed weekly to monitor in vivo differentiation. RESULTS: In vitro, an increase in CD34+ cells expressing differentiation antigens (CD11b, CD13 or CD15) was noted along with a decrease of immature CD34+/differentiation antigen negative cells. After two weeks of a daily rhG-CSF administration in vivo, a significant, albeit transient, decrease of blast count was achieved, concomitant with an increase in differentiated leukemic cells suggesting that in vivo differentiation occurs. Fresh t(8;21) leukemic cells possess functional G-CSF signaling pathways as normal activity and kinetics of STAT1 and STAT3 binding was observed. Furthermore, differentiation induction leads to a subsequent degradation of the AML1-ETO oncoprotein. CONCLUSION: The data presented here supports the claim that G-CSF can induce in vitro and in vivo differentiation of M2 AML t(8;21) cells.","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique (LBCH), INSERM E 00-03, et EA 316 Universite Paris 7, Hopital Saint-Louis, 1 Avenue Claude Vellefaux, 75754 Paris Cedex 10, France. lbch@chu.stlouis.fr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We wanted to test the hypothesis that the growth kinetics of CML and normal hematopoietic cells are different. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the growth kinetics and the phenotype of engraftment of chronic phase CML and normal human CD34(+) precursor cells in the bone marrow of immune deficient mice. RESULTS: High levels of engraftment of normal precursors occurred early and consisted of myeloid, erythroid, megakaryocytic, and lymphoid elements. This level and pattern of engraftment were maintained at later assessments. The level of CML cell engraftment was initially much lower, but it increased progressively at late time-points with no indication of a plateau in growth. Early engraftment of CML cells consisted almost entirely of myeloid and mast cells but soon after only mast cells were detectable. Conversely mast cells were infrequent in mice engrafted with normal progenitors. CONCLUSION: We conclude that in contrast to normal cell engraftment, engraftment of CML cells in NOD/SCID mice is characterized by a slow but progressive myeloid infiltration, which eventually consists almost entirely of mast cells.","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine at Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK. f.dazzi@ic.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To better define this subpopulation of patients, we attempted to define some parameters capable of predicting a pejorative clinical outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty-eight previously untreated patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia in Binet stage A were analysed to study the prognostic value of simple serological variables: soluble CD23 (sCD23), beta2 microglobulin (beta2m), lactate-dehydrogenase activities and albumin level. Results were compared to other conventional clinical and biological parameters by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. RESULTS: Our data show that: (1) among those studied, sCD23 >50 u/ml was the only serological significant parameter clearly correlated with disease progression and (2) stage A"" patients (hemoglobin level between 100 and 120 g/l and/or lymphocytosis >30.10(9)/l), axillary lymph nodes and hypogammaglobulinemia were found to be other variables associated with a pejorative outcome. These four variables enabled the establishment of a scoring system, capable of predicting disease progression since 66% of the patients with a score < or =2 are going to evolve into advanced stages vs 12% with a score <2. Furthermore, the time to progression is shortened when the score is increasing. CONCLUSION: Our findings show the prognostic relevance of a scoring system including sCD23 level. This score could be taken into account in the treatment strategy of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","[""Service d'Hematologie Biologique, Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital, 47 Boulevard de l'Hopital, 75013 Paris, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the immunological mechanisms involved and the immune reconstitution achieved have not been investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe the cases of two patients for whom we have studied the lymphocyte reconstitution achieved, using both phenotypic and genetic analyses of the T-cell repertoire, after peripheral stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: : In both cases we observed immune reconstitution with T-cell repertoire evolution and presence of activated CD8(+) T cells. In one of the patients an activated clone expressing Vbeta8 represents 46% of the CD8(+) cells. Expansion of this clone occurred in the absence of graft vs host disease symptoms. In the second case a skin lesion typical of graft vs host disease appeared after complete remission had been achieved. The T-cell repertoire in a biopsy of the lesion was distinct from that observed in the blood. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that peripheral donor cells can effectively reconstitute a grafted patient while inducing an immune response against antigens expressed by the leukaemic/myeloma cells. Our data provide arguments for different populations of T cells associated with graft vs leukaemia/lymphoma and GVH effects.","['Department of Haematology, CHU de Grenoble, 38043 Grenoble cedex 9, France.

However,the exact role of these drugs in consolidation therapy is less clear, especially in specific ALL subsets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the outcome of 308 patients (median age 35 years, range 13-75) with the most frequent subtype, early-B ALL, treated between 1974 and 1998 on eight consecutive protocols. Anthracycline-related effects were assessed by evaluating the impact of planned anthracycline dose-intensity (A-DI) on long-term outcome. A-DI (in mg/m(2)/week) during the first twelve weeks of consolidation therapy was classified as either ""high"" (doxorubicin>20, idarubicin>7) or ""low"". RESULTS: Complete remission was achieved in 78% of cases. With a median follow-up of 6.5 years, on multivariate analysis, disease-free survival (DFS) correlated only with expression of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and/or associated BCR-ABL rearrangements (Ph/BCR(+)) (P=0.0001) and planned A-DI (P<0.0001). On this basis, four major prognostic groups with significantly different DFS could be identified: (1) Ph/BCR(-), ""high"" A-DI (n=102), median 3.5 years and 41% at five years, respectively; (2) Ph/BCR(-), ""low"" A-DI (n=64), 1.3 years and 16%; (3) Ph/BCR(+), ""high"" A-DI (n=35), 1.7 years and 20%; (4) Ph/BCR(+), ""low"" A-DI (n=39), 0.75 years and 0%. When analyzed separately for Ph/BCR(-) (n=166) and Ph/BCR(+) (n=74) patients, the A-DI effect on DFS was preserved in the former (P=0.018) whereas, in Ph/BCR(+) patients, only age <50 years (P=0.004) and blast count <25 x 10(9)/l (P=0.02) correlated with better DFS. However, Ph/BCR(+) patients with the best prognostic profile (age <50 years and blast count <25 x 10(9)/l; n=21) who were treated on ""high"" A-DI regimens experienced a median DFS of 2.2 years with DFS 21% at five years, compared to 0.67-1 years and 0-10% in other cases (n=53, P<0.01). CONCLUSION: A ""high"" A-DI may act as a positive treatment-related prognostic factor in early B-lineage ALL. Although mainly restricted to patients with Ph/BCR(-) ALL, A-DI could also influence the outcome in Ph/BCR(+) patients with other favorable prognostic factors.","['Divisione di Ematologia, Ospedali Riuniti, Largo Barozzi 1, 24100 Bergamo, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and full-length cDNAs were generated by sequencing and were annotated using bioinformatic tools. RESULTS: From a total of 4142 ESTs obtained from normal bone marrow, 3424 meaningful tags were integrated into 1630 clusters, representing 622 known genes, 522 dbEST entries and 486 novel sequences. Out of 5382 ESTs from MDS-AML, 1985 clusters were produced based on the analysis of 4321 useful ESTs, including 711 known genes, 657 known ESTs and 617 novel sequences. Among 251 transcripts found in both bone marrow and MDS-AML EST datasets and those present in only one dataset, 58 showed statistically significant differences in EST copy numbers between the two tissues (P<0.05). Twenty putative full-length cDNAs for novel genes were also cloned from the MDS-AML library.

By conventional cytogenetic analysis, a t(11;14)(q13;q32) is observed at a frequency of 3 to 14%. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To demonstrate a cyclin D1 expression in MM patients or MM cell lines, 14 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and nine human multiple myeloma cell lines (HMCL) were screened by a competitive RT-PCR and/or Northern blot analysis for cyclin D1 expression. Furthermore, we screened 10 MM patients with FISH to demonstrate a relationship between the cyclin D1 expression and the presence of the t(11;14). RESULTS: Five HMCL had a cyclin D1 overexpression: three of them had a t(11;14)(q13;q32) and two had extra copies of chromosome 11. A cyclin D1 expression was found at diagnosis in seven out of 14 untreated MM patients (50%). Out of 14 MM patients, FISH studies were performed in 10 patients. A t(11;14) was detected in three out of 10 patients and extra copies of chromosome 11 were found in two additional patients. CONCLUSION: Cyclin D1 expression is a common event in MM patients (50%) and is associated either with a t(11;14)(q13;q32) or extra copies of chromosome 11. The prognostic role of the cyclin D1 expression and the level of this expression, as compared to other B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders such as mantle cell lymphoma or hairy cell leukemia, remains to be determined in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma.","[""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Caen, France, and UPRES-EA 2128, UFR de Medecine, Caen, France. troussard-x@chu-caen.fr""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected at different time intervals after transplantation. Lymphocytes were analyzed for informative markers by immunocytofluorimetric analysis. Natural killer cells derived from patients undergoing matched unrelated donor transplant were cloned by limiting dilution in the presence of phytohemoagglutinin and IL2. The natural killer cell clones were analyzed for cytolytic activity. RESULTS: In the nine patients analyzed undergoing transplantation from sibling donors, the majority of peripheral blood lymphocytes during the first 80 d after BMT were represented by T lymphocytes, while in the 15 patients undergoing matched unrelated donor transplant natural killer cells consistently outnumbered T lymphocytes. During the early phases after transplantation, most CD56+CD3- natural killer cells did not express CD16 which was expressed at later intervals. Analysis of the inhibitory receptors specific for HLA-class I molecules showed that CD94/NKG2A, specific for HLA-E, unlike normal donors, was expressed by all natural killer cells including the early appearing CD16-negative ones. Killer inhibitory receptors of the Ig superfamily were expressed late and in low percentages after transplantation and were always coexpressed with CD94/NKG2A. Natural killer-cell clones efficiently lysed the HLA-class I-negative cell lines K562 and 721-221. Natural killer-cell populations or clones isolated from patients with graft-versus-host-disease, failed to lyse donor or recipient derived phytohemoagglutinin-induced lymphoblasts. CONCLUSION: Our analysis shows that (1) recipients of matched unrelated donors transplants exhibit a high proportion of NK cells (2) all NK cells express CD94/NKG2A while the HLA-class I-specific inhibitory receptors of Ig superfamily appear at later stages and (3) donor NK cells do not lysed donor or recipient target cells.","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy, and Dipartimento di Medicina Sperimentale Universita di Genova, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Invasive aspergillosis is one of the most frequently encountered infections with a high mortality rate. New diagnostic tests for invasive aspergillosis such as the detection of Aspergillus galactomannan antigen by a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have recently been described. The objective of this study was to evaluate this assay as a potential surrogate for invasive procedures used to diagnose IA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed the performance of a commercially available ELISA test which we routinely use for the surveillance of galactomannan antigenemia in patients with hematological malignancies experiencing chemotherapy-induced prolonged neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm(3) for more than 7 days). Serum samples were collected on a weekly basis. Test positivity was defined in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. RESULTS: Over the 2 year study period, we analyzed 507 samples obtained during 193 neutropenic episodes from 135 patients. Ten, six and two patients were considered to have proven, probable or possible invasive aspergillosis, respectively, based on clinical, radiological or microbiological data. Forty-four positive (Index>1.5) and 26 'undetermined' (1.5 > Index > 1.0) test results were observed in 17 and ten patients respectively. All invasive aspergillosis cases had at least a positive or an undetermined test result. Only one positive and one undetermined result were found in two patients before the onset of clinical or radiological signs suggesting invasive aspergillosis. Sensitivity was 69% and specificity 96% if only positive results are considered; when 'undetermined' test results were combined with positive results, sensitivity attained 100% and specificity 92% suggesting that the cutoff value for positivity can be lowered from 1.5 to 1.0. CONCLUSIONS: Although the ELISA test did not appear to play a role in the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis and in the anticipation of antifungal therapy in our experience, it clarifies the diagnosis of infection in probable or possible invasive aspergillosis especially when the cutoff value is lowered and is useful for monitoring patients receiving specific therapy.","['Department of Medicine, Institut Gustave-Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A variety of chromosomal abnormalities have been reported in plasma cell leukaemia but the clinical significance of an abnormal karyotype is still unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We have applied the molecular cytogenetic techniques multicolour spectral karyotyping and microdissection in combination with fluorescence in situ hybridization on metaphases from a patient with primary plasma cell leukaemia and a fatal outcome. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The chromosome analysis showed severe hypodiploidy and 12 marker chromosomes. Identification of the structural rearrangements was not possible using routine cytogenetic methods. Utilizing the methods above, all marker chromosomes could be identified in detail and the karyotype was shown to be very complex. Forty-three breakpoints were found, and 25 could be identified at the band level, among others 14q32 where the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus is situated. Thus, these techniques provide the opportunity to resolve very complex chromosomal changes in a way that has not been previously possible and will consequently be of great importance in the search for hot spots that may harbour new cancer genes.","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Karolinska Institutet at Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its structure suggests it may act as a cell adhesion and signalling molecule. MATERIALS AND METHODS: KGIa cells and primary CD34-positive marrow cells were tested for their ability to aggregate in the presence of the anti-CD34 antibody QBEND10; CFU-GM colonies were grown using standard methods and tested for their content of colony-forming cells by replating; 'haematons' were isolated from marrow by filtration; the phosphorylation of CD34 was investigated by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting DISCUSSION: CD34-positive cells in human bone marrow, like KG1a cells, aggregate when incubated with QBEND10. Staining aggregates with anti-CD34-FITC revealed that aggregation involved co-localisation of CD34 at intercellular binding sites. We examined myeloid colonies (CFU-GM) grown from normal human bone marrow cells, and multicellular aggregates ('haematons') separated from freshly aspirated marrow by filtration, and found CD34-positive cells bound together with co-localisation of the CD34 at the binding sites. This finding shows that CD34-positive cell-cell adhesion occurs physiologically in vitro and in vivo. QBEND10-induced aggregation of KG1a and CD34-positive cells was enhanced by staurosporine (a protein kinase C inhibitor) and inhibited by genistein (a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor). Moreover, aggregated cells had increased phosphorylation of tyrosine on CD34 and translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) to the cytoplasm, compared with non-aggregated cells. We used the ability of primary colonies to produce secondary colonies on replating as a functional parameter and found that the replating ability of the colonies was increased by treatment with genistein (P=0.003). In addition, the ability of individual samples of primary CD34-positive cells to undergo QBEND10-induced aggregation and the ability of CD34-positive cell-derived colonies to produce secondary clones on replating were inversely related (r=0.86). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that homotypic aggregation of haematopoietic progenitor cells may be an important mechanism for preventing inappropriate proliferation in vivo. Thus, regulation of expression of the CD34 molecule may play an important role in maintaining the normal level of haematopoietic activity by contact-mediated inhibition of progenitor cell proliferation.","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Campus, DuCane Road, London W12 0NN, UK. mgordon@ic.ac.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among others, complex chromosome aberrations of chromosome 12 have been described in this disease. We searched for deletions of the 12p13 region as the result of these chromosome rearrangements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Paired leukemic and non-leukemic cells were obtained from a series of 21 patients suffering T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Loss of heterozygosity was searched for by microsatellite typing using a fluorescent automated laser DNA sequencer to analyze the amplification products. Proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Southern blot analysis of one patient was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Loss of heterozygosity of the 12p13 region, including the ETV6 and CDKN1B genes, was detected in nine of these 21 cases (43%). Western and Southern blot analyses of one case demonstrated a biallelic deletion which did not include ETV6. Taken together, our results defined a minimal region of deletion of less than one Mb flanked by the markers b312C2T7 and D12S320, excluding ETV6 as a candidate gene. Deletion of the 12p13 region is thus a highly recurrent genetic event in T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia.","['Unite INSERM U409 and Centre de recherche Claude Bernard, Hopital Bichat, Paris, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structurally related to BCL-6, which is involved in human lymphoma, PLZF may have a role in proliferation, differentiation and survival of hematopoietic cells, that could be mediated by transcriptional repression of the cyclin A gene. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Quantitative competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to measure the levels of expression of PLZF and cyclin A in normal leukocyte subsets (including CD19(+) lymphocytes, n=21) and malignant B lymphocytes (including B-chronic lymphocytic leukemias [B-CLL], n=63). Results obtained with this method were confirmed by Western and Northern blot analysis. Transactivation assays were performed using an expression construct for PLZF and two cyclin A promoter luciferase reporters in an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-cell line. Cyclin A expression, cell growth kinetics, and cell cycle were analysed in stable clones of the Burkitt lymphoma (BL) B-cell line DG75 with inducible expression of PLZF, generated using the tetracycline-regulated expression system. RESULTS: Expression of PLZF was 100-fold downregulated in 90% B-CLL (56/63) compared to normal B lymphocytes (P<0.001). B-CLL patients with the highest levels of PLZF had a poorer survival (P<0.013). In transactivation assays, PLZF inhibited the activity of the cyclin A reporters by 50%, demonstrating that PLZF can repress cyclin A expression in non-malignant B lymphocytes. However, in B-CLL patients, the level of cyclin A expression was found to be within the normal range. Altered PLZF function in B lymphoid malignancies was further corroborated in the PLZF-regulatable DG75 clones, where induction of PLZF expression did not significantly alter the levels of cyclin A expression, the cell growth kinetics, or the cell cycle phase distribution. CONCLUSION: The lower survival of patients with the highest levels of PLZF suggests that this protein may be a marker of progression in B-CLL. The absence of co-ordinated regulation of PLZF and cyclin A genes in B-CLL and in a malignant B-cell line may indicate a loss of cyclin A control by PLZF in B-CLL and other B-cell disorders. Deregulation of PLZF could thus play a role in B-cell malignancy.","['Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire Hematopoietique, Universite Paris 7, France. a.parrado@chu-stlouis.fr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanisms of action of IFN are still poorly understood and the individual response is unpredictable. In the present study, the pattern of intracellular gene expression following in vitro and in vivo exposure of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells to IFN was evaluated and correlated with the response to in vivo treatment with IFN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CML patients in different phases of the disease were studied. The pattern of expression of two IFN-inducible proteins involved in IFN-mediated biological activities, the p91 and p84 proteins (STAT1alpha and STAT1beta), components of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex and the enzyme 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase (2'-5' OASE) were investigated by Western blot in peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated or not in vitro by IFN. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: In 6/9 patients evaluated before starting treatment, STAT1 was expressed either constitutively or after in vitro stimulation by IFN. In three cases, STAT1 remained negative even after in vitro activation. The pattern of protein expression correlated with the subsequent hematological response to prolonged in vivo IFN administration: the presence of STAT1 being associated with the clinical response to IFN and the absence and non-inducibility of STAT1 with resistance to IFN. This was further substantiated by studies carried out in ten patients analyzed at the time of a documented clinico-hematological response or resistance to the in vivo administration of IFN. Finally, in order to establish whether the pattern of response to IFN treatment could be predicted at diagnosis, cells cyropreserved at diagnosis from patients with a documented complete response, confirmed also by cytogenetic negativity, or resistance, were studied. While complete responders proved STAT1 positive, none of the four resistant cases ever expressed STAT1. The expression of 2'-5' OASE did not correlate with the clinical response to IFN. This study documents the pivotal role of STAT1 in the in vitro and in vivo responses of CML cells to IFN. The constitutive or induced presence or absence of STAT1 shows a predictive correlation with the response or resistance to treatment with IFN and could be utilized to identify, at diagnosis, resistant patients who may be spared an expensive and unnecessary prolonged IFN administration.","['Centro CNR di Immunogenetica ed Oncologia Sperimentale, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Graft rejection following transplantation for leukaemia is a rare event but leukaemic relapse may occur at varying rates, depending upon the stage of leukaemia at which the transplant was undertaken and the type of leukaemia. Relapse is generally assumed to occur in residual host cells, which are refractory to, or escape from the myeloablative conditioning therapy. Rare cases have been described, however, in which the leukaemia recurs in cells of donor origin. Lack of a successful outcome of blood or bone marrow transplantation for severe aplastic anaemia (SAA), however, is due to late graft rejection or graft-versus-host disease. Leukaemia in cells of donor origin has rarely been reported in patients following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for SAA. This report describes leukaemic transformation in donor cells following a second allogeneic BMT for severe aplastic anaemia. PCR of short tandem repeats in bone marrow aspirates and in colonies derived from BFUE and CFU-GM indicated the donor origin of leukaemia.

One of the main risks is contamination of the stem cell preparations with leukemic blasts, which may account for a higher relapse rate compared to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Since overexpression of WT1 is common in leukemic blasts, we investigated, whether PBSCs from AML patients express WT1 at a higher level as compared to patients with solid cancers. PBSCs of seven patients with AML and of five patients with solid cancers were investigated for WT1 expression. Total WT1 copy count was determined in a standardized quantitative real time RT-PCR. WT1 expression was found in all AML PBSCs with an average copy number of 49.99 +/- 61.09. In solid cancers WT1 expression was statistically significantly lower with a copy number of 3.51 +/- 1.92. In AML patients with sustained complete remission we found a nearly significantly lower WT1 expression than in patients who relapsed within the first year after stem cell transplantation. Our data show a higher WT1 expression in PBSCs of AML patients compared to patients with solid cancers. This finding might indicate a contamination with leukemic blasts. Quantification of WT1 in PBSCs might therefore be useful to estimate the risk of relapse after autologous stem cell transplantation in AML patients.","['Med.

Clinical presentations and outcomes of patients with HIV and subsequent AML are reviewed. METHODS: Five HIV-infected individuals who were subsequently diagnosed with AML were evaluated and treated. A further 42 cases of AML among patients with antecedent HIV infection were identified using MEDLINE, AIDSLINE, and CancerLit searches. RESULTS: HIV infection was present for a median of 48 months (71-180) before AML was diagnosed and the median reported CD4 cell count was 210 x 106 cells/l. In five instances, a delay in diagnosis occurred when cytopenias were initially attributed to HIV or zidovudine-based therapy. In 45 patients, diagnosis was according to the French-American-British (FAB) leukemia classification schema and in two the FAB type was not specified. M2 (n = 15) and M4 (n = 14) subtypes represented 64% (29/45) of reported cases. Patients with a CD4 cell count < 200 x 106 cells/l (n = 11) had a median survival time of 7 weeks, while patients with a CD4 cell count >or= 200 x 106 cells/l (n = 7) had a median survival of 7 months (P = 0.005). Although long-lasting chemotherapy-induced responses were rare, the majority of treated patients did achieve complete hematologic remissions. Treatment-related morbidity did not appear to be excessive. CONCLUSION: In the absence of randomized and prospective clinical studies to guide decision making, this analysis indicates that induction chemotherapy may be a reasonable option for selected HIV-infected patients with AML and adequate immune function.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Virginia Mason Medical Center, Seattle, Washington 98111, USA.']",,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disruption of FGFR1 is associated with a disease entity known as the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (EMS)/stem cell leukemia-lymphoma syndrome, a chronic myeloproliferative disorder that frequently presents with eosinophilia and associated T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma. The disease is aggressive and rapidly transforms to acute leukaemia, usually of myeloid phenotype.

In 2-10% of the cases, this chimeric gene is generated by variant rearrangements, involving 9q34, 22q11, and one or several other genomic regions. All chromosomes have been described as participating in these variants, but there is a marked breakpoint clustering to chromosome bands 1p36, 3p21, 5q13, 6p21, 9q22, 11q13, 12p13, 17p13, 17q21, 17q25, 19q13, 21q22, 22q12, and 22q13. Despite their genetically complex nature, available data indicate that variant rearrangements do not confer any specific phenotypic or prognostic impact as compared to CML with a standard Ph chromosome. In most instances, the t(9;22), or a variant thereof, is the sole chromosomal anomaly during the chronic phase (CP) of the disease, whereas additional genetic changes are demonstrable in 60-80% of cases in blast crisis (BC). The secondary chromosomal aberrations are clearly nonrandom, with the most common chromosomal abnormalities being +8 (34% of cases with additional changes), +Ph (30%), i(17q) (20%), +19 (13%), -Y (8% of males), +21 (7%), +17 (5%), and monosomy 7 (5%). We suggest that all these aberrations, occurring in >5% of CML with secondary changes, should be denoted major route abnormalities. Chromosome segments often involved in structural rearrangements include 1q, 3q21, 3q26, 7p, 9p, 11q23, 12p13, 13q11-14, 17p11, 17q10, 21q22, and 22q10. No clear-cut differences as regards type and prevalence of additional aberrations seem to exist between CML with standard t(9;22) and CML with variants, except for slightly lower frequencies of the most common changes in the latter group. The temporal order of the secondary changes varies, but the preferred pathway appears to start with i(17q), followed by +8 and +Ph, and then +19. Molecular genetic abnormalities preceding, or occurring during, BC include overexpression of the BCR/ABL transcript, upregulation of the EVI1 gene, increased telomerase activity, and mutations of the tumor suppressor genes RB1, TP53, and CDKN2A. The cytogenetic evolution patterns vary significantly in relation to treatment given during CP. For example, +8 is more common after busulfan than hydroxyurea therapy, and the secondary changes seen after interferon-alpha treatment or bone marrow transplantation are often unusual, seemingly random, and occasionally transient. Apart from the strong phenotypic impact of addition of acute myeloid leukemia/myelodysplasia-associated translocations and inversions, such as inv(3)(q21q26), t(3;21)(q26;q22), and t(15;17)(q22;q12-21), in CML BC, only a few significant differences between myeloid and lymphoid BC are discerned, with i(17q) and TP53 mutations being more common in myeloid BC and monosomy 7, hypodiploidy, and CDKN2A deletions being more frequent in lymphoid BC. The prognostic significance of the secondary genetic changes is not uniform, although abnormalities involving chromosome 17, e.g., i(17q), have repeatedly been shown to be ominous. However, the clinical impact of additional cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations is most likely modified by the treatment modalities used.","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.']",,,,,206,"['Copyright 2002 S.

In the 1980s, the principal approach was repeated examination of bone marrow metaphases for the presence of the Ph chromosome in patients treated by interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) or allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The use of fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) techniques to detect the BCR-ABL fusion gene in Ph-positive leukaemia cells increased the sensitivity of cytogenetic studies to some degree. In the last 10 years, the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has proved extremely valuable for assessing and monitoring minimal residual disease in patients who achieve Ph negativity after treatment with IFN-alpha or with the new Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate or after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Results are consistent with the notion that the majority of long-term survivors after allogeneic SCT are probably 'cured'; for other patients monitored serially in complete cytogenetic remission, rising numbers of BCR-ABL transcripts detected by RT-PCR can indicate the need for further therapy.","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College at Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",,,,,45,"['Copyright 2002 S.

The fusion gene has often incorporated part of a gene encoding a receptor or cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, particularly ABL, PDGFRB and FGFR1. This contrasts with the frequent involvement of genes encoding transcription factors or other nuclear proteins in acute myeloid leukaemia. Nevertheless, genes encoding tyrosine kinases have also been implicated in some cases of acute leukaemia.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a prospective inpatient study conducted from July 1994 to August 1997, 220 patients aged 16 to 65 years received SCT for hematologic cancer at a single institution. Patients received a psychiatric assessment at hospital admission and weekly during hospitalization until discharge or death, yielding a total of 1,062 psychiatric interviews performed. Psychiatric disorders were determined on the basis of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify variables associated with LOS. RESULTS: Overall psychiatric disorder prevalence was 44.1%; an adjustment disorder was diagnosed in 22.7% of patients, a mood disorder in 14.1%, an anxiety disorder in 8.2%, and delirium in 7.3%. After adjusting for admission and in-hospital risk factors, diagnosis of any mood, anxiety, or adjustment disorder (P =.022), chronic myelogenous leukemia (P =.003), Karnofsky performance score less than 90 at hospital admission (P =.025), and higher regimen-related toxicity (P <.001) were associated with a longer LOS. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P =.009), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (P =.04), use of peripheral-blood stem cells (P <.001), second year of study (P <.001), and third year of study (P <.001) were associated with a shorter LOS. CONCLUSION: Our data indicate high psychiatric morbidity and an association with longer LOS, underscoring the need for early recognition and effective treatment.","['Department of Psychiatry, Clinical Institute of Psychiatry and Psychology and Stem-Cell Transplantation Unit, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain. jmprieto@comg.es']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2002 Mar 27.,,"WT1 was originally identified as a Wilms' tumor suppressor gene, but it may have oncogenic potential in leukemia and in some solid tumors. WT1 is a transcription factor that has been implicated in the regulation of target genes related to apoptosis, genitourinary differentiation, and cell cycle progression. Because induction of WT1 leads indirectly to increased p21 expression in osteosarcoma cells, we investigated the possibility that other genes involved in the G(1)/S phase transition might also be WT1 targets. Cyclin E plays a crucial role in the cell cycle by activating cyclin-dependent kinase 2, which phosphorylates Rb, leading to progression from G(1) into S phase. We identified several WT1 binding sites in the cyclin E promoter. We demonstrate that WT1 binds to these sites and that in transient transfection assays WT1 represses the cyclin E promoter. This activity is dependent on the presence of a binding site located downstream of the transcription start site. In intact cells, induction of WT1 expression down-regulates cyclin E protein levels. These results provide the first demonstration that WT1 can directly modulate the expression of a gene involved in cell cycle progression.","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21231, USA.']",['R01-CA48943/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,20020327,,,,,,,,,,

Our experience with laparoscopic splenectomy in the setting of massive splenomegaly is presented. METHODS: A prospective review of patients undergoing LS for massive splenomegaly was conducted. Massive splenomegaly (MS) in adults was defined as a craniocaudal length >or=17 cm or a morcellated weight >or=600 g. In children, spleens measuring fourfold larger than normal for age were considered massive. RESULTS: Forty-nine patients with MS were treated with LS. The most common primary diagnoses were lymphoma and leukemia. Mean splenic length was 20 cm (15 to 27 cm), with weights ranging from 600 to 4,750 g. Twelve patients with supermassive splenomegaly (length >22 cm) required a hand-assisted laparoscopic approach. There were no conversions to open surgery. Mean operating time was 171 minutes (90 to 369). Mean blood loss was 114 cc (<30 to 600 cc). Average length of stay was 2.3 days (1 to 16). Minor postoperative complications occurred in 3 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic splenectomy in the setting of splenomegaly is safe and appears to minimize perioperative morbidity.

Inhibition of TNF-alpha production using the soluble TNF receptor (Enbrel) has been successful in rheumatoid arthritis, and we have now applied the same principle to MDS. We determined spontaneous TNF-alpha production by marrow cells in MDS; TNF-alpha production was elevated (> mean + 2 x SD of controls) in > 1/3 of patients, but did not correlate with clinical parameters. Sixteen patients participated in a 3-month pilot study of Enbrel. The drug was well tolerated and 15 patients were evaluable. Of these, one became temporarily (14 weeks) transfusion independent. In another patient, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) rose from 0.5 x 10(9)/l to 0.84 x 10(9)/l. Serious infections were seen in two out of six neutropenic patients.

When the effects of Enbrel on haematopoietic colony formation were studied, no significant increase was seen in MDS and there was no correlation with TNF-alpha levels. Although anti-TNF therapy with Enbrel was well tolerated at the dosages used in MDS, its efficacy as a single agent appears low.","['Hematology Branch and Office of Biostatistics Research, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA. maciejj@cc.ccf.org']",,,"['Br J Haematol 2002 Jun;117(4):1002.

Accordingly, the sensitivity of the cells to anti-Fas-induced apoptosis decreased proportionally and the reduced expression of FasL resulted in a decreased ability of the leukaemic cells to induce apoptosis in T cells.

In the present study, we found that leukaemic blasts presenting surface CD30L displayed a characteristic cytokine-receptor pattern that makes them ideal targets for those cytokines usually produced by Th2-type cell subsets. In particular, even though a broad distribution of Th2 cytokine receptors by AML blasts was shown, we demonstrated the almost exclusive expression of interleukin 4 (IL-4) receptor (R), in the absence of its cognate cytokine, by CD30L+ AML. Furthermore, a number of Th2-associated markers, including CD30, IL-4 and GATA-3, were expressed by residual T cells derived from CD30L+ AML but not from CD30L- AML, in which the presence of the Th1-associated marker LAG-3 was documented in some cases. The production of IL-4 in the absence of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) was also detected in CD3+/CD30+ T cells from CD30L+ AML. These results, along with the shift toward IL-4-producing specific T-cell clones observed in CD30L+ AML samples by enzyme-linked Immunospot (ELISpot) assay, were consistent with the hypothesis of a Th2 polarization taking place in T cells from CD30L+ AML.

The aim of the present phase II trial was to determine tumor response, and toxicity and to delineate the pharmacokinetics of oral low-dose etoposide in patients with hematological malignancies in a palliative treatment setting. Thirty-two patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), acute myeloblastic (AML) and lymphoblastic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) were included. Patients were given oral etoposide, 100 mg once daily for 14 d in a 21-d cycle. Serum etoposide concentrations were determined on d 1, 7, and 14 of every cycle before etoposide administration and, in addition, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 24 h after drug intake on d 1. The median age of patients was 68 yr (range: 50-89 yr). The median time from diagnosis to inclusion in the study was 21 mo (range: 0.5-144 mo) and most patients had advanced disease and were heavily pretreated. Eleven patients completed three or more cycles. Eight of 11 patients with acute leukemia and 1 of 2 with MDS received only 1 course because of toxicity (n = 5) or progression (n = 4). One patient with AML, a Jehovah's Witness, was treated up-front and achieved a complete remission and two patients with low-grade NHL gained a complete and a partial remission, respectively. Twenty-one of 32 patients were evaluable for toxicity during the first cycle. In 67%, the white blood cell count nadir was < 2.0 x 109/L and in 38% < 1.0 x 10(9)/L. Platelet count nadir was less than 25 x 10(9)/L in 24% of evaluable patients. During all cycles (n = 79), eight patients developed febrile neutropenia, four of whom with a fatal outcome. The correlation between the area under the curve (AUC) of the free fraction of etoposide and leukopenia was statistically significant at a log analysis (n = 12; p < 0.05). There was also a statistically significant correlation between the AUC and the 24-h concentration (n = 15; p < 0.005) and between the concentrations at 24 h and d 7 (n = 11; p < 0.005) of the free fractions of etoposide. In conclusion, etoposide had a moderate clinical effect in this group of heavily pretreated patients. Moreover, toxicity was substantial, in particular leukopenia, which correlated to the free-etoposide AUC.","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Hospital and Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several reports from China relative to its use mainly in acute promyelocytic leukemia, especially from the Shanghai group, has caused a resurgence in the investigation of the drug in the management of malignancies with focus on malignancies of hematologic origin. Arsenic is eliminated by many routes (urine, feces, sweat, milk, hair, skin, and lungs), although most is ultimately excreted in urine. Multiple myeloma is characterized by the clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow associated with bone loss, renal disease, and immunodeficiency. Preclinical evidence suggests an immunologic mechanism behind the therapeutic effects of As2O3 on myeloma cells. This appears to be achieved by a marked increase in lymphokine-activated killers mediated killing and up-modulation of CD38 and Cd54, two molecules involved in cell-cell interactions. Moreover, As2O3 alone or administered with ascorbic acid may provide a novel therapy for lymphoproliferative disorders. Preliminary clinical data in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma suggest that As2O3 does have a role in the management of multiple myeloma; however, preclinical data show that the addition of ascorbic acid, and using As2O3 in combination with other active chemotherapeutic agents will enhance its role in managing the disease, and this is probably the position the drug will occupy in the armamentarium against myeloma.","['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Center, OH 44195, USA. husseim@ccf.org']",,,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structurally, annexins are characterized by a highly alpha-helical and tightly packed protein core domain considered to represent a Ca2+-regulated membrane binding module. Many of the annexin cores have been crystallized, and their molecular structures reveal interesting features that include the architecture of the annexin-type Ca2+ binding sites and a central hydrophilic pore proposed to function as a Ca2+ channel. In addition to the conserved core, all annexins contain a second principal domain. This domain, which NH2-terminally precedes the core, is unique for a given member of the family and most likely specifies individual annexin properties in vivo. Cellular and animal knock-out models as well as dominant-negative mutants have recently been established for a number of annexins, and the effects of such manipulations are strikingly different for different members of the family. At least for some annexins, it appears that they participate in the regulation of membrane organization and membrane traffic and the regulation of ion (Ca2+) currents across membranes or Ca2+ concentrations within cells. Although annexins lack signal sequences for secretion, some members of the family have also been identified extracellularly where they can act as receptors for serum proteases on the endothelium as well as inhibitors of neutrophil migration and blood coagulation. Finally, deregulations in annexin expression and activity have been correlated with human diseases, e.g., in acute promyelocytic leukemia and the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and the term annexinopathies has been coined.","['Institute for Medical Biochemistry, Center for Molecular Biology of Inflammation, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.']",,,,,343,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A direct correlation was observed between enhanced DR5 expression and sensitivity to ADR and VP-16. There was no induction of DR5 following treatment with VCR, MTX or DEX. There was up to a 51-fold increase in the median level of expression of Fas following treatment with ADR and VP-16, and unlike DR5 this occurred in cells with either wild-type or mutant p53. Nevertheless, a direct correlation was observed between Fas expression and drug-sensitivity. Conversely, there was only a two-fold increase in expression of Fas after exposure to VCR, MTX and DEX. These findings suggest that DR5 mediates sensitivity to ADR and VP-16 in a p53-dependent manner, whereas, Fas appears to mediate sensitivity to these two drugs independent of p53 status.

The treatment of murine L1210 leukemic cells with 2mM of ATP in vitro for 3h was able to reduce the number of leukemic clonogenic cells by about one order of magnitude presumably by changing the permeability of the leukemic cell membrane. Furthermore, the incubation of L1210 cells with ATP (2mM) and low dose 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HC, 2 microg/ml) for 3h resulted in at least a four-log reduction of clonogenic L1210 cells. Only a slight degree of toxicity to pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (CFU-S) was observed in both treatment protocols. To determine the efficacy of pharmacological purging by ATP, we designed a murine system to mimic the conditions expected in the clinical setting of autologous transplantation using simulated partial remission marrow (SPRM) which was prepared by mixing normal marrow cells and L1210 cells at a ratio of 9:1. After the SPRM cells were incubated in vitro at a concentration of 1 x 10(6)/ml with both ATP (2mM) and low dose 4-HC (2 microg/ml) for 3h, 5 x 10(4) of the cells were then injected into lethally irradiated 9 weeks male BDF1 mice. All the mice given untreated-SPRM died of leukemia by day 27, whereas none of the recipients transplanted treated-grafts had died by day 70, thus suggesting that the combination use of ATP and 4-HC may be a potentially effective way to purge leukemic cells in autologous stem cell transplantation. The mechanism of the selective killing of leukemic cells is assumed that 4-HC is effectively incorporated into leukemic cells by increasing the permeability of the cell membrane by ATP. Taken together, this simple and rapid procedure is able to purge leukemic cells from autologous bone marrow grafts.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Nihon University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. yhatta@med.nihon-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection methods based on this technique using clone-specific primers are cumbersome and time consuming. The detection of monoclonal gene rearrangements of gamma T-cell receptors (TCRgamma) is a simpler although less sensitive method. In the present study, we analyzed the presence of MRD during four different phases of treatment (week 4; 3-6, 12-24 months, and end of treatment) in 34 Brazilian children with lymphoid leukemia by three detection methods based on the PCR technique: (1) using consensus primers for the detection of a clonal population for TCRgamma; (2) clone-specific primers for the junctional region of TCRgamma; and (3) a semi-nested reaction with an initial cycle with consensus primers followed by a second cycle with clone-specific primers. MRD presence was associated with a shorter event-free survival and was the major independent prognostic factor in most of the phases analyzed. The use of consensus primers for the detection of TCRgamma clonality, although less sensitive, proved to be a simpler, faster and less costly method whose positivity was associated with more than 90% relapse rates during all phases analyzed.","['Departamento de Pediatria and Puericultura, Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of new technologies allowing screening for this defect has permitted new advances in the comprehension of underlying mechanisms. Apart from its implications for host defense, the expression of MPO restricted to myeloid precursors makes MPO mRNA a good marker of acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, during the last few years, involvement of MPO has been described in numerous diseases such as atherosclerosis, lung cancer, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Both strong oxidative activity and MPO genetic polymorphism have been involved. This review summarizes the broad range of diseases involving MPO and points out the possible use of this protein as a new clinical marker and a future therapeutic target.","['INSERM Unite 525 Faculte de Pharmacie, Nancy, France.']",,,,,66,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, this protein and its mRNA represent primary targets to inhibit proliferation of these cells. Here we describe the properties of a ribozyme against the bcr-abl mRNA, expressed as a fusion transcript with the human U1 small nuclear RNA or the adenovirus VA1 RNA and delivered to the cells through retroviral vectors. These fusion ribozymes are specifically localized in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm, respectively. Transduction of 32D-LG7 myeloid cells, whose growth is IL-3 independent thanks to deregulated bcr-abl expression, imposed strong negative selective pressure on cell growth and induced restoration of an IL-3-dependent phenotype. Although expressed at a level similar to that of the U1-fusion ribozyme, the cytoplasmic VA1 ribozyme was a more powerful inhibitor of p210(bcr-abl) gene expression. In cells transduced with the vector expressing this ribozyme, the levels of the bcr-abl transcript were reduced up to 10(4)-fold, the p210(bcr-abl) protein became undetectable, and the cells underwent massive apoptosis when cultured in the absence of IL-3. Transduction of primary hematopoietic cells obtained from bone marrow of patients with CML resulted in remarkable reduction of bcr-abl mRNA levels, starting a few days after transduction. These results show the feasibility and efficacy of vector-expressed anti-bcr-abl ribozymes for purging of CML cells.","['Molecular Medicine Laboratory, International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Underlying diseases were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 8) acute myeloblastic leukemia (n = 6) and Burkitt lymphoma (n = 1). Hemophagocytic syndrome was suspected after chemotherapy, in case of an unusual prolonged febrile neutropenia (n = 14) or isolated thrombocytopenia (n = 1). That fever was associated with cutaneous, pulmonary, hematologic, digestive and cardiac signs. Biological disorders included hypoprotidemia, hyponatremia, increased liver enzymes and fibrinopenia. Thrombocytopenia was observed in all patients and was associated with neutropenia for 14 of them. Diagnosis of hemophagocytic syndrome was always confirmed by bone marrow aspiration (infiltration with activated macrophages). Infection was documented in eight children. The treatment of hemophagocytic syndrome relied on steroids and resolution of symptoms occurred within three days of therapy. No recurrence of hemophagocytic syndrome was observed with a median follow up of two years and a half. CONCLUSION: Such complication should be suspected in cases of prolonged febrile neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, and confirmed by bone marrow aspiration.

Atractylon significantly inhibited the growth of human leukemia cell line HL-60 and mouse leukemia cell line P-388, and showed low cytotoxicity against primary cultures of normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells at 15 microg/ml for 12 h. Atractylon had a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on the two tumor cell lines. In accordance with DNA fragment increases and PARP protein decreases, atractylon at 15 microg/ml for 6 h induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Moreover, atractylon inhibited the viability of P-388 cells and induced apoptosis after 15 microg/ml treatment for 12 h in an in vitro assay. However, atractylenolide I at 30 microg/ml for 12 h also induced apoptosis in HL-60 and P-388 cells, but atractylenolides II and III showed no significant inhibition effects on tumor cell growth.

Epub 2002 Jan 24.,,"PURPOSE: XK469 (NSC 697887) is a novel antitumor agent with broad activity against a variety of tumors including drug-resistant tumors. Previous studies have indicated that XK469 is an antiproliferative agent with a low cytotoxic effect in human H116 tumor cells. In this study, we sought to determine the signaling pathways involved in mediating its antiproliferative activity. METHODS: The antiproliferative activity of XK469 was tested using human U-937 leukemia cells in culture. XK469-induced cell cycle arrest was determined using flow cytometric analysis. Phosphorylation/activation of MEK and MAPK was analyzed using immunoblot analyses with specific antibodies against p-MEK and p-MAPK. RESULTS: Cell cycle analysis revealed that XK469 arrested U-937 cells at the G(2)/M phase. Compared with conventional anticancer agents, XK469 showed very low, if any, cytotoxic or proapoptotic effect against U-937 cells. In contrast, treatment of U-937 cells with vinblastine, doxorubicin and m-AMSA resulted in extensive cell death through apoptotic pathways. XK469, but not other agents, potently inhibited the phosphorylation/activation of MEK in U-937 cells cultured in serum-containing medium. XK469 was also able to block the activation of MEK by serum addition in starved U-937 cells. Exposure of cells to XK469 for 1 h was sufficient to inhibit the activation of MEK and its downstream kinase, MAPK. The antiproliferative response to XK469 was correlated with a steady accumulation of cyclins B1 and A, which appeared to be a direct result of G(2)/M arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the antiproliferative effect of XK469 is mediated by inhibiting the MEK/MAPK signaling pathways in U-937 human leukemia cells.","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, 516 Hudson Webber Cancer Research Center, Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute, 4100 John R.

Strong, diffuse staining was less common in neuroblastomas, Wilms' tumors, and rhabdomyosarcomas and was negative in alveolar soft part sarcomas and desmoplastic small round cell tumors. Tumors with strong, diffuse staining for c-kit in a pattern similar to gastrointestinal stromal tumor may represent suitable targets for new therapeutic agents.","['Department of Pathology, University of Tennessee Medical Center, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.']","['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The integrity of the MuLV IN was completely preserved, since the fusion was conducted at the last amino acid residue of the protein. The vector pMIN-Sp1, which carried the fused MuLV IN-Sp1 zinc finger domain gene, was cotransfected with a wild-type MuLV vector pMLV-K to NIH/3T3 cells. A nonradioactive reverse transcriptase assay was performed on culture supernatants collected from the cotransfected cells to confirm the production of recombinant viruses. The expression of the fusion protein and the integration of the MuLV genome by the fusion protein were confirmed by a Northern and then a Southern hybridization analysis on the total RNA or genomic DNA extracted from cells infected by viruses collected from the supernatants of the cotransfected cells. Regions of the host chromosome that were selected by the fusion protein as the integration targets were sequenced using the TOPO(TM) cloning method on a series of PCR products generated with a nested set of primers. The percentage of positive clones screened that contained the DNA-binding sequence of the fused Sp1 zinc finger domain was around 13% (5 out of 39 clones). It was found that the Sp1 DNA-binding sequence was only present in regions that were proximal to one of the long terminal repeats of the integrated viral genome, suggesting that the fusion protein could select a target sequence for integration. The host flanking sequences determined for all the positive clones were also used as queries to perform a BLAST search on the GenBank mouse EST entries. Although matching scores for sequences of some of the clones computed were more significant than others, it was difficult to judge whether or not the integration in these clones had been targeted to some gene sequences. Most of the integration sites might exist in the introns, since we found that the probability of the gene sequences containing an Sp1 DNA-binding site was low.","['Department of Life Science, National Tsing Hua University, Hsinchu, Taiwan, ROC.']",,,,,,"['Copyright 2002 National Science Council, ROC and S.

Diseases such as chronic myeloid leukaemia, promyelocytic leukaemia, polycythaemia vera and hypereosinophilic syndrome are often accompanied by markedly elevated levels of cobalamin in the blood. A rise in the serum cobalamin concentration is one of the diagnostic criteria for polycythaemia vera and hypereosinophilic syndrome. In haematological disorders, the increase in circulating cobalamin levels is predominantly caused by enhanced production of haptocorrin. Several liver diseases such as acute hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic liver disease can also be accompanied by an increase in circulating cobalamin. In liver diseases, the increase in cobalamin is predominantly caused by cobalamin release during hepatic cytolysis and/or through decreased clearance of circulating cobalamin by the affected liver. Liver disorders are not an indication for determining the serum cobalamin concentration. However, a coincidentally observed elevated serum cobalamin concentration is reason for further investigation.","['Amphia Ziekenhuis, Klinisch-Chemisch en Hematologisch Laboratorium, locatie Langendijk, Langendijk 75, 4819 EV Breda.']",,,,,,,,,De betekenis van een te hoge cobalamineconcentratie in het bloed.,,,,,,,,,

In vitro studies have shown that Pbx1 regulates the activity of Ipf1 (also known as Pdx1), a ParaHox homeodomain transcription factor required for the development and function of the pancreas in mice and humans. To investigate in vivo roles of Pbx1 in pancreatic development and function, we examined pancreatic Pbx1 expression, and morphogenesis, cell differentiation and function in mice deficient for Pbx1. Pbx1-/- embryos had pancreatic hypoplasia and marked defects in exocrine and endocrine cell differentiation prior to death at embryonic day (E) 15 or E16. In these embryos, expression of Isl1 and Atoh5, essential regulators of pancreatic morphogenesis and differentiation, was severely reduced. Pbx1+/- adults had pancreatic islet malformations, impaired glucose tolerance and hypoinsulinemia. Thus, Pbx1 is essential for normal pancreatic development and function. Analysis of trans-heterozygous Pbx1+/- Ipf1+/- mice revealed in vivo genetic interactions between Pbx1 and Ipf1 that are essential for postnatal pancreatic function; these mice developed age-dependent overt diabetes mellitus, unlike Pbx1+/- or Ipf1+/- mice.

Previous studies in nonhematopoetic cells demonstrated that the prostate-apoptosis-response-gene-4 (Par-4) is up-regulated in cells undergoing programmed cell death and that Par-4 exerts its proapoptotic effect by down-regulating Bcl-2. After showing the aberrant expressional pattern of Par-4 in neoplastic lymphocytes as well as demonstrating inverse expressional patterns of Par-4 and Bcl-2 in malignant cells of patients suffering from acute lymphocytic leukemia, we assessed the functional consequences of Par-4 overexpression during apoptosis in Jurkat T lymphocytes. We show that in lymphatic cells Par-4 overexpression decreases the level of Bcl-2, whereas Bax, the proapoptotic counterpart of Bcl-2, retains unaltered levels. Moreover, Par-4 overexpression is accompanied by cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Despite these effects, overexpression of Par-4 alone is not sufficient to induce apoptosis but markedly increases the rate of apoptosis on treatment with different chemotherapeutic agents. On chemotherapeutic treatment Par-4 overexpression enhances disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, PARP-cleaving activity, as well as activation of caspase-3. The hypothesis of caspase-dependency of Par-4-promoted apoptosis is additionally supported by demonstrating complete abrogation of programmed cell death after pretreatment with a broad spectrum caspase-inhibitor. On inhibition of caspase-3 overexpression of Par-4 enables lymphatic cells to alternatively activate caspases-9, -6, and -7 by diminishing the influence of the inhibitors of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) cIAP1 and XIAP. Our study is the first to identify Par-4 as a proapoptotic protein in lymphatic cells, outlining a model of action evaluating the role of Bcl-2/Bax, as well as demonstrating the impact of Par-4 expression on PARP cleavage, disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase activation, and interactions with inhibitors of apoptosis proteins.","['Department of Medicine III, Johann Wolfgang Goethe-University Hospital, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL60R cells lost surface Fas expression, but we found no evidence that Fas/FasL mediates the apoptotic effects of Dox in HL60. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) did not seem to play a major role as a specific inhibitor of apoptosis. In fact, the P-gp inhibitor verapamil reversed only partially the resistance to Dox-induced apoptosis of the MDR cells. In addition, it did not modify the rate of apoptosis induced from the other stimuli in the same cells. The expression of p53 or Bcl-2 was not different between HL60 and HL60R. However, in HL60R there was an increase in the mRNAs of inhibitory of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) like neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein (NAIP), c-IAP-2 and survivin. Treatment with Dox or serum starvation strongly down-regulated X-linked IAP and survivin mRNAs in HL60. Cisplatin decreased NAIP and survivin mRNAs in the same cells. However, in HL60R the levels of these IAP mRNAs were much less affected by the treatments. These results support that IAPs may be involved in tumor resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs or other apoptotic agents.","['Dipartimento di Scienze Farmacologiche, Universita di Palermo, Policlinico P.

Specimens in which >or=10% of the neoplastic cells showed cytosolic immunoreactivity were considered to be immunopositive. Results were correlated with clinico-pathologic characteristics of the subjects. All seven apoptotic regulators examined were positive in a proportion of the tumors. The percentage of cases expressing Bax was higher in the patients without evidence of disease after treatment than in the patients alive with disease or who died of disease (P<0.05). A significant difference in disease-free survival was detected between Bax-positive and -negative groups (P<0.05), and in overall survival between Mcl-1-positive and -negative groups (P<0.05). Significant association between the seven markers tested was only found for caspase 3 and Bak immunoreactivity in cervical carcinoma (P<0.05).

The oocytes increase in size and the surrounding squamous pre-granulosa cells become cuboidal and proliferate to form a layer of cuboidal cells around the growing oocyte. This development of the primordial follicle commits the follicle to undergo the process of folliculogenesis. When the available pool of primordial follicles is depleted reproductive function ceases and humans enter menopause. The current study examines whether leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) promotes the primordial to primary follicle transition that initiates follicular development. Ovaries from 4 day-old rats were cultured in the absence or presence of LIF or neutralizing antibody to LIF. LIF treatment increased the proportion of follicles that initiated the primordial to primary follicle transition to 59%, compared to 45% in untreated cultured ovaries. The ability of LIF to induce primordial follicle development was enhanced to greater than 75% by the presence of insulin in the culture medium. Anti-LIF neutralizing antibody reduced the proportion of spontaneous developing primordial follicles. Immunocytochemical studies demonstrated higher levels of LIF protein in the granulosa and surrounding somatic cells of primordial and primary follicles compared to the oocyte. In contrast, later pre-antral and antral stage follicles showed LIF expression primarily in the oocyte. In granulosa and theca cell cultures LIF had no effect on cell proliferation. However, LIF treatment did increase expression of Kit ligand (KL) mRNA in cultured granulosa cells. KL has been shown to promote ovarian cell growth and induce primordial follicle development. LIF induction of KL expression may be involved in the actions of LIF to promote primordial to primary follicle transition. In summary, LIF treatment increased the primordial to primary follicle transition in cultured ovaries and LIF may interact with KL to promote primordial follicle development.","['Center for Reproductive Biology, School of Molecular Biosciences, Washington State University, Pullman, WA 99164-4231, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Induction of apoptosis during a 48hr exposure to Cl-IB-MECA was not prevented by the A(3)AR antagonists [5-propyl-2-ethyl-4-propyl-3-(ethylsulfanylcarbonyl)-6-phenylpyridine-5-carboxyla te] (MRS 1220) or N-[9-chloro-2-(2-furanyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-c]quinazolin-5-yl]benzeneacetamide (MRS 1523). Furthermore, higher concentrations of MRS 1220, which would also antagonize A(1) and A(2A) receptors, were ineffective in preventing the apoptosis. Although Cl-IB-MECA has been shown in other systems to cause apoptosis through an A(3)AR-mediated mechanism, in these cells it appeared to be an adenosine receptor-independent effect, which required prolonged incubation. In both HL-60 and MOLT-4 cells, Cl-IB-MECA induced the expression of Fas, a death receptor. This induction of Fas was not dependent upon p53, because p53 is not expressed in an active form in either HL-60 or MOLT-4 cells. Cl-IB-MECA-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells was augmented by an agonistic Fas antibody, CH-11, and this increase was suppressed by the antagonistic anti-Fas antibody ZB-4. Therefore, Cl-IB-MECA induced apoptosis via a novel, p53-independent up-regulation of Fas.","['Molecular Recognition Section, Laboratory of Bioorganic Chemistry, National Institute of Diabetes, Digestive and Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']","['Z01 DK031117-20/Intramural NIH HHS/United States', 'Z99 DK999999/Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC4811183,,,['NIHMS768425'],,,,,,,,

In previous studies achieved in two K562 DOX-resistant sublines (K562/0.2R and K562/0.5R), we have shown stable mitochondrial damage comparatively with sensitive parental cells, such as decrease of cytochrome c oxidase activity (COX; EC 1.9.3.1) and cytochrome aa3 content. In order to explain these data, we have studied several COX genes and their expression, in relationship with altered COX activity and multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype. We have observed a lower expression of the catalytic subunits COX I and II in MDR sublines, which was neither related to mutations in the corresponding mitochondrial genes, nor to a reduced transcription rate. In contrast, we have noticed an increase in both MDR K562 variants, in the mRNA expression of the catalytic subunit COX III, related to an increase in the half-life of these transcripts. Moreover, the doxorubicin resistance phenotype in K562 cells was accompanied by modifications of the expression and steady-state mRNA levels of several nuclear-encoded regulatory COX subunits. Thus, doxorubicin-resistant K562 cells represent an interesting model to study stable modifications concomitant to MDR phenotype. Our results seem to indicate compensatory mechanisms which highlight the complexity of regulatory systems of COX enzyme, involving coordinate regulation of both nuclear and mitochondrial subunit expression.","['Groupe Physiologie Moleculaire Mitochondriale et Immunitaire, Faculte de Medecine, UMR 6101, CNRS, 2 rue du Dr. Marcland, 87025 Cedex, Limoges, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some cell types, however, are quite resistant to TRAIL. We investigated the effect of ectopic expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL on TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human acute myelogenous leukemia HL-60 cells. We found that HL-60 cells, which express TRAIL receptors (also called death receptor, DR) DR4, DR5, and Dc (decoy) R2, are highly sensitive to TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity. Greater than 90% killing occurred within 24 h of TRAIL treatment. The expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, however, completely abolished the TRAIL-induced cytotoxic effects. Treatment of HL-60 cells with TRAIL induced caspase-8 activation within 2-4 h, but no activation could be seen in Bcl-2-expressing or Bcl-xL-expressing cells. TRAIL also induced cleavage of BID, which was also abolished by Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Similarly, TRAIL activated caspase-3 and caspase-7 in control cells but not in cells expressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL. Cleavage of the caspase-3 substrate poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), was abrogated by ectopic expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Inhibition of caspases by the pan-caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-valine-alanine-aspartate-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) abolished the TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Overall, these results indicate that TRAIL-induced apoptosis involves activation of caspase-8, caspase-7, caspase-3, and BID cleavage, and Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL prevents TRAIL-induced apoptosis by abrogating caspase activation and BID cleavage.","['Cytokine Research Section, Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030-4009, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Attachment of the cDNAs on the array after the hybridization procedure was monitored by visualizing fluorescent signals from the spots on the array. In the second method, two selected DNA targets, beta-actin and GAPDH, were labeled with fluorescent dye to hybridize to the cDNA array. Hence, hybridization specificity was demonstrated by obtaining fluorescent signals solely from the genes corresponding to the target.","['The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the phosphorylation levels of p38 and JNK, as well as the expression levels of ERK, p38, and JNK, were unchanged by the VES treatment. Treatment with VES also induced hypophosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and an increase of the p21WAF1 protein level. VES-induced ERK phosphorylation was abolished by the ERK inhibitor, PD98059, which resulted in a remarkable prevention of VES-induced monocytic differentiation. Inhibition of the ERK activity by PD98059 also diminished the VES-induced p21WAF1 protein expression, but did not change the phosphorylation state of the retinoblastoma protein.

The findings suggest that pentasomy 8 is associated with a heterogeneous group of myeloid disorders and probably plays a specific role in the progression of myeloid neoplasia.","['Department of Haematology, George Papanicolaou General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to review our experience with second malignancies in patients treated for Hodgkin's disease, comparing the results with the international literature data. Six hundred and sixty five patients with HD were treated in our department, between 1978 and 1996. Second neoplasm developed in 32 cases (4.8%). Seven secondary hematological malignancies were observed: four acute nonlymphocytic leukemias, two non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and one chronic myeloid leukemia. Among patients with second hematological malignancies, the mean age at diagnosis of HD was 44 years and the mean interval until the development of second malignancy was 6.1 years. Five patients received chemo- and radiotherapy and in two cases chemotherapy was used. Three of the seven patients are alive. Twenty-five patients have had solid tumors, affecting lung (5), breast (3), colon (3), stomach (2), urinary bladder (2), head-and-neck (1), thyroid gland (1), esophagus (1), liver (1), pancreas (1), furthermore, three sarcomas and two malignant melanomas were observed. Their mean age at the diagnosis of HD was 46 years and the mean period of latency was 8.3 years. Chemotherapy was applied to nine patients, 16 patients received both chemo- and radiotherapy. Eleven patients had solid tumors in the region irradiated earlier. Ten out of the 25 patients are alive, three patients' present state is unknown. Since alkylating agents increase the risk of leukemia and irradiation contributes mainly to other malignancies, future treatment protocols should attempt to reduce the most serious consequence of therapy without compromising the survival. It is necessary to investigate the impact of additional risk factors. Careful, lifelong observation is indicated for patients with HD, with special attention given to new clinical signs and symptoms.","['Department of Chemotherapy A, National Institute of Oncology, Budapest, Hungary. varadi@oncol.hu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite a prompt reconstitution of B- and T-cell numbers, both B- and T-cell function are profoundly impaired for a prolonged period of time after PBPC infusion. The positive selection of CD34+ cells might provide effective tumor cell purging without compromising hematopoietic recovery in patients with acute leukemia, multiple myeloma, breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, whose autografts have been reported to contain malignant cells which might promote disease relapse. However, the incidence of viral infections in the early posttransplant period might be increased after CD34-selected compared with unmanipulated PBPC transplants, as a result of the lack of accessory and immune cells in the graft. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on immunological reconstitution after transplantation of autologous PBPC; in particular, emphasis will be placed on the mechanisms of immune dysfunction after the infusion of unmanipulated and CD34-selected autografts.","['Department of Hematology, Catholic University Medical School, Rome, Italy. sergiorutella@tin.it']",,,,,69,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, the reported role of the ubiquitin system in apoptotic death control as well the alteration of its control in carcinogenesis should come as no surprise. Indeed, we and other groups have reported that the ubiquitin system is involved in apoptotic cell death of normal human lymphocytes and that this control is altered in B lymphocytes derived from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (B-CLL), rendering these malignant cells hypersensitive to specific inhibition of protein degradation/processing through proteasomal function. This approach recently allowed us to demonstrate that the stability of the tumor suppressor and pro-apoptotic protein p53 is differentially regulated in B-CLL versus normal lymphocytes and that this difference might at least partly explain the impaired response of B-CLL lymphocytes to apoptotic death activation. These results strongly suggest an imbalance in p53 regulation in B-CLL cells that leads to a variable response to DNA damage and constitutively expressed chromosomal instability. The question we and others would like to address is whether this alteration, or more likely a subset of alterations of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, is specific to B-CLL malignancy or if it is a hallmark of cancer cells in general. In either case, a better understanding of the ubiquitin-dependent control of apoptosis should pave the way towards a methodological approach for in vitro development of discriminating treatments which may be of potential usefulness in clinical trials of B-CLL.","['Laboratoire de Radiobiologie et Oncologie (CEA-DSV/DRR), Fontenay aux Roses, France.']",,,,,49,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrated a down-regulation of vimentin after ATRA treatment of NB4 cells by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. The architecture of the vimentin cytoskeleton in differentiated NB4 cells resembled that observed in mature neutrophils. In contrast, we showed a slight increase of vimentin content in phorbol ester (PMA)-treated NB4 cells. The structural features of the vimentin cytoskeleton obtained by image analysis showed significant differences in network density and directionality between ATRA-treated NB4 cells and controls. The functional consequence of the cytoskeletal remodeling for the mechanical properties of NB4 cells was assessed in migration assays. After ATRA treatment, we found a 4-fold increased migration of NB4 cells across transwell membranes with a 8 microm pore size without any cell size modification. No significant differences between PMA-treated NB4 cells and control cells could be observed using similar tests.

Our studies indicated that reducing basicity, increasing steric hindrance at C-4', and/or lipophilicity may help circumvent P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated anthracycline efflux and thus increase drug retention in MDR-positive cells. From a series of 4'-substituted analogs, 4'-O-benzylated doxorubicin (WP744) was selected for a comparison with the classic anthracycline doxorubicin for their cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic properties. WP744 retains cytotoxic activity against P-gp and MRP-positive cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: In three AML cell lines (K562, KBM-3, and OCIM2) WP744 was markedly more potent (IC50 values of 0.18, <0.05, and <0.05 microg/ml, respectively) than doxorubicin (IC50 values of >0.5, 0.07, and 0.09 microg/ml, respectively). Likewise, WP744 inhibited the colony formation by AML-CFU cells from fresh bone marrow of three AML patients more strongly than doxorubicin. Cell growth inhibition by WP744 is accompanied by apoptosis induction as shown by TUNEL assay in OCIM2 cells. WP744-induced apoptosis appears to be mediated by caspase-3 as apoptotic changes were abrogated in the presence of the caspase 3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK. Accordingly, caspase 3 activity was elevated in the lysates from drug-treated cells. WP744 induced also cleavage of apoptotic marker poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP). Finally, WP744 at 0.05 microM and greater was a potent inducer of apoptosis (by quantitative DNA fragmentation) in cultured human acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) CEM cells, compared to 0.5 microM doxorubicin needed for a similar effect. CONCLUSION: The novel anthracycline WP744 was found to be an antileukemic agent with proapoptotic activity superior to that of doxorubicin.","['The University of Texas M. D.

ETS-1 is a member of the ets family of transcription factors, which are key mediators of physiological and pathological processes. We have found that Sp100 interacts with two regions of ETS-1 (domains A+B and D+E+F). ETS-1 alters NBs while remaining localized throughout the nucleus, apparently by recruitment of the core component Sp100 away from the NBs. Sp100 strongly increases ETS-1 activation of natural and ets-focused promoters, through a mechanism involving the activation (C) domain of ETS-1 in addition to the interaction domains. Sp100 acts as a novel coactivator that potentiates the activator function of ETS-1.

Using chromatin immunoprecipitations, we established that both p300 and SAF-A bind to S/MAR elements in the transiently silent topoisomerase I gene prior to its activation at G(1) during cell cycle.

Epub 2002 Mar 21.,,"A number of cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) inhibitors were tested for the ability to protect IPC-81 rat leukemic cells against cAMP-induced apoptosis. A near perfect proportionality was observed between inhibitor potency to protect against cAMP-induced apoptosis and to antagonize CDK5, and to a lesser extent, CDK2 and CDK1. Enforced expression of dominant negative CDK5 (but not CDK1-dn or CDK2-dn) protected against death, indicating that CDK5 activity was necessary for cAMP-induced apoptosis. The CDK inhibitors failed to protect the cells against daunorubicine-, staurosporine-, or okadaic acid-induced apoptosis. The inhibition of CDK5 prevented the cleavage of pro-caspase-3 in cAMP-treated cells. The cells could be saved closer to the moment of their onset of death by inhibitors of caspases than by inhibitors of CDK5. This suggested that the action of CDK5 was upstream of caspase activation. The cAMP treatment resulted in a moderate increase of the level of CDK5 mRNA and protein in IPC-81 wild-type cells. Such cAMP induction of CDK5 was not observed in cells expressing the inducible cAMP early repressor.

This condition occurs uncommonly, particularly in persons aged <or=16 years. However, pediatric uveitis deserves special consideration for reasons that include the relatively poor prognosis, unique systemic associations, and various age-related treatment considerations. Accurate diagnosis requires history from both patient and parents, a complete ophthalmic examination that may require general anesthesia, and carefully selected investigations. Infections and masquerade syndromes, such as leukemia and retinoblastoma, must be excluded before treatment is commenced with immunosuppressive agents. Noninfectious anterior uveitis generally responds to topical corticosteroid and mydriatic therapy. Although used frequently in adults with posterior uveitis, periocular corticosteroid injections may require a general anesthetic, and systemic corticosteroids may cause serious adverse effects, including growth retardation, in pediatric patients. Consequently, in children, one or more corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive drugs are usually employed for vision-threatening noninfectious posterior eye inflammation. Methotrexate is the most commonly used systemic immunosuppressive agent for pediatric uveitis. It is effective in small retrospective clinical series, generally well tolerated, easy to administer, and inexpensive. Cyclosporin has also been used successfully in children with uveitis, being associated with a low risk of renal toxicity when used at standard doses. Although prescribed for severe ocular inflammation in adults, alkylating agents are generally contraindicated in children owing to risks including secondary malignancy, sterility and bone marrow suppression. Drugs that inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha have recently been used successfully to treat children with uveitis; however, in some patients there may be a risk of potentiating the ocular inflammation. Randomized clinical trials would provide valuable information about the relative efficacy of the various available treatment options.","['Casey Eye Institute, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, Oregon 97201-4197, USA. smithjus@ohsu.edu']",,,,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this review, the pharmacological determinants of the sensitivity of human leukaemia cell lines and lymphoblasts derived from children with ALL will be discussed. In addition, clinical pharmacological studies of 6-MP and MTX in relation to the continuing therapy with childhood ALL will be reviewed. For 6-MP in vitro, prolonged exposure times to relatively high extracellular drug concentrations are necessary for cytotoxicity, and these concentrations are much higher than those achieved during continuing therapy for childhood ALL. For MTX, plasma concentrations are achieved during continuing therapy that would be cytotoxic to human leukaemia cells during prolonged exposures in vitro. For both MTX and 6-MP, wide inter- and intrapatient variation in plasma pharmacokinetic parameters has been described. For 6-MP and MTX, cellular pharmacological studies have been largely restricted to erythrocytes as a surrogate of the possible effects in leukaemic blasts. Although measures of the pharmacology of 6-MP and MTX in erythrocytes has been related to prognosis in many studies, 6-MP systemic exposure and the dose intensity of 6-MP and MTX actually received by children during this phase of therapy seems to be the most important determinant of efficacy. Further studies will be needed to determine the importance of pharmacokinetic variability during continuing therapy as a determinant of outcome for children with ALL. In this respect, minimal residual disease status during this phase of treatment may prove to be a useful pharmacodynamic endpoint.","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Pendlebury, Manchester M27 4HA, UK. eestlin@mch.srht.nwest.nhs.uk""]",,,,,90,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science Ltd.

For cytosine arabinoside (ara-C), methotrexate, vincristine and corticosteroids, in-vitro studies indicate that the extracellular drug concentration and exposure time are important determinants of cytotoxicity for human leukaemia cell lines. For L-asparaginase, epipodopyllotoxins and cyclophosphamide, there have been few studies of the relationship between cellular pharmacology and cytotoxicity in relation to ALL. The clinical and cellular pharmacology of methotrexate and cytosine arabinoside have been studied in relation to childhood ALL in vivo. For these drugs, there is evidence to suggest that maintenance of plasma concentrations that are biochemically optimal is necessary to maximize anti-leukaemic effects. For cytosine arabinoside in particular, optimal extracellular fluid concentrations are not likely to be achieved or maintained by bolus or short-duration i.v. infusions. A potentially important example of this may be served by the success of antimetabolite-based intrathecal chemotherapy for CNS-directed treatment of childhood ALL. Intrathecal administration of both methotrexate and cytosine arabinoside results in prolonged leukaemic cell exposure to cytotoxic concentrations of the drug. For vincristine, anthracyclines and asparaginase, the actual dose intensity received by children during consolidation therapy may be important, and there is considerable interpatient variation in the pharmacokinetics of cyclophosphamide and teniposide in the therapy of childhood cancers. The importance of this relationship to childhood ALL is not known. The pharmacological and cellular pharmacological studies performed at St Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN, USA) have allowed investigation of the relationships between the clinical and cellular pharmacology of methotrexate and prognosis, and have supported the individualization of consolidation therapy with this drug. Cytosine arabinoside has been less well studied in relation to childhood ALL, although evidence exists to suggest that the administration of conventional-dose bolus or infusion schedules may not be optimal in terms of the antileukaemic efficacy of this antimetabolite. For L-asparaginase, ongoing studies may allow the relationship between dose and schedule of administration to be related to pharmacodynamic measures such as asparagine depletion and prognosis. Therefore, through knowledge of clinical and cellular pharmacological properties, it may be possible to optimize the consolidation phase of therapy for childhood ALL, without disrupting the fundamental principles by which the overall treatment is administered. This may be particularly important for children with disease that has inherent or acquired resistance to therapy.","[""Department of Paediatric Oncology, Royal Manchester Children's Hospital, Pendlebury, Manchester M27 4HA, UK. eestlin@mch.srht.nwest.nhs.uk""]",,,,,93,"['Copyright 2002, Elsevier Science Ltd.

The speed and depth of the early response to remission induction therapy has become an important determinant of the intensity of subsequent therapy in many protocols worldwide. Moreover, the detection of significant levels of minimal residual disease at the end of remission induction may have an important bearing on subsequent outcome. Although these clinical observations may reflect, in part, the inherent sensitivity of lymphoblasts to remission induction therapy, the pharmacology of these agents in relation to childhood ALL may also play an important part in early response to therapy. In-vitro studies of human leukaemia cell lines indicate that both the extracellular fluid concentration and duration of exposure to vincristine and anthracyclines are important determinants of cytotoxicity. For L-asparaginase and corticosteroids, the cellular and molecular pharmacological determinants of chemosensitivity have been partially characterized, but further work is needed in this area. The clinical pharmacology of vincristine and L-asparaginase have been well characterized in relation to childhood ALL, and considerable interpatient pharmacokinetic variability exists for these drugs. For corticosteroids and anthracyclines, pharmacology studies are needed in order to fully characterize and understand the factors influencing interpatient pharmacokinetic variability for these agents in relation to childhood ALL. Whereas the relationship between the clinical pharmacology, and potentially important pharmacodynamic effects such as asparagine depletion, has been well characterized for therapy with L-asparaginase, similar studies have yet to be performed for the other drugs that form the mainstay of remission induction therapy for childhood ALL. Therefore, further studies are required to investigate the relative importance of the clinical and cellular pharmacology of vincristine, corticosteroids, L-asparaginase and anthracyclines in the speed and depth of response to remission induction therapy for childhood ALL.

In previous studies, we synthesized two classes of electrophilic tocopheryl quinones (TQ), nonarylating alpha-TQ and arylating gamma- and delta-TQ, and found that gamma- and delta-TQ, but not alpha-TQ, were highly cytotoxic in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (CEM) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) CEM/VLB100. We have now extended these studies on tumor biology with CEM, HL60 and MDR HL60/MX2 human promyelocytic leukemia, U937 human monocytic leukemia, and ZR-75-1 breast adenocarcinoma cells. gamma-TQ, but not alpha-TQ or tocopherols, showed concentration and incubation time-dependent effects on loss of plasma membrane integrity, diminished viable cell number, and stimulation of apoptosis. Its cytotoxicity exceeded that of doxorubicin in HL60/MX2 cells, which express MRP, an MDR-associated protein. Apoptosis was confirmed by TEM, TUNEL, and DNA gel electrophoresis. Kinetic studies showed that an induction period was required to initiate an irreversible multiphase process. Gamma-TQ released mitochondrial cytochrome c to the cytosol, induced the cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase, and depleted intracellular glutathione. Unlike xenobiotic electrophiles, gamma-TQ is a highly cytotoxic arylating electrophile that stimulates apoptosis in several cancer cell lines including cells that express MDR through both P-glycoprotein and MRP-associated proteins. The biological properties of arylating TQ electrophiles are closely associated with cytotoxicity and may contribute to other biological effects of these highly active agents.","['Department of Anatomy and Medical Education, The Ohio State University College of Medicine, Columbus 43210, USA. jones.4@osu.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The GVL effect is mediated in large part by mature T-cells contained in the donor graft and has been defined in detail in animal models of transplantation. The GVL activity has been observed in the clinical setting after SCT from both matched siblings and unrelated donors. The best demonstration and most direct evidence of GVL activity in humans come from the use of donor leukocyte infusions (DLI). For patients who relapse with chronic myelogenous leukemia after matched sibling SCT, infusions of leukocytes collected from the original transplant donor will re-establish complete and durable remission in 60-80% of patients. DLI is less effective for more advanced phases of CML and for patients who relapse with diseases other than CML. DLI after matched sibling SCT is complicated primarily by graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), marrow aplasia, and unfortunately, relapse in some cases. There has been little information regarding the use of unrelated DLI (UDLI). Available data now shows that despite initial concerns that UDLI would result in excessive toxicity, it is an effective approach to relapse after unrelated donor marrow grafting. Response rates are similar to those seen after the use of matched sibling DLI, and many remissions remain durable. Graft-vs-host disease is a frequent complication after UDLI though the incidence and severity of GVHD is also similar to the use of matched sibling DLI. It is not clear that the GVL and GVHD effects can be separated, since the majority of responding patients also develop GVHD. The most effective cell dose for UDLI has not been established, though there does not appear to be either a dose-response or dose-toxicity relationship from UDLI. Although second unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation (BMT) may cure a small minority of patients, GVL induction with UDLI offers a safer and potentially more effective therapy for relapsed leukemia, and offers insights in methods to manipulate the human immune system for therapeutic benefit.","['Bone Marrow and Stem Cell Transplant Program, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, USA.']",,,,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1997, we started a study aimed at improving our previous results in elderly patients with ALL and at assessing the therapeutic role of IFN in this disease. Fifty-eight patients with ALL, aged 55-81 years (median: 64.9 years), were randomly allocated to treatment with vindesine or vincristine during induction. After a first consolidation course, IFN was administered as a single agent for three months together with cranial radiotherapy. Chemotherapy was then resumed with a second consolidation course and maintenance. A complete remission (CR) was obtained in 58% of patients (CI: 45-71%), significantly less than in our previous study which included IFN combined with chemotherapy during maintenance (CR: 85%, CI:70-94%, p = 0.007).

In particular, the pattern of relapses over time suggested that the 3 month IFN treatment phase with no additional chemotherapy might have contributed to the comparatively poor outcome of this cohort. In addition, vindesine given during induction did not prove less neurotoxic than vincristine, did not improve the CR rate, and had no impact on survival. In conclusion, although similar to published studies in elderly patients with ALL, this study is inferior to our previous one. INF, given as a single drug, has a modest role if any in the treatment of older persons with ALL.","[""Department of Hematology, Hjpital de.Jolimont, Service d'Hematologie, Haine-Saint-Paul, Belgium. andre.delannoy@ping.be""]",,,,"['LALA Group, France and Belgium']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Originally, inv(3) and t(3;3) breakpoints have been reported to cluster in a region (breakpoint cluster region, BCR) of approximately 30 kb, which is located centromeric and downstream of the ribophorin I (RPN-I) gene. More recently, we established a PAC contig that includes the 3q21 BCR, and used these PAC clones to map breakpoints in patient samples by both metaphase and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. A significant proportion of inv(3) and t(3;3) breakpoints was located at sometimes considerable distances centromeric of the originally described BCR, in a region recently also implicated in t(1;3) rearrangements. These breakpoints may thus define a second, centromeric BCR (BCR-C), or extend the original 3q21 BCR to a size of approximately 100 kb. Activation of the EVI-1 gene in 3q26 by regulatory sequences of the housekeeping gene RPN-I has been suggested as a leukemogenic mechanism in patients with inv(3) and t(3;3). However, despite a number of characteristics that make EVI-1 an attractive candidate oncogene, its biological properties fail to fully explain the phenotype of leukemias carrying 3q rearrangements.

To overcome this barrier to productive infection, viral polypeptides modulate a variety of host cell pathways.

The overlap of these mechanisms with those impacted during oncogenesis provides the opportunity to use adenoviruses and adenovirus mutants to characterize the state of key regulatory pathways in specific malignant cells. For example, adenoviruses mediate cytotoxicity after infection of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells, mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells and multiple myeloma cell lines. Specific adenovirus mutants demonstrate enhanced cytotoxicity and, in many cases, apoptosis is not the primary mechanism of cell death. Analysis of these infections with respect to both the features of the primary malignant cell and the mechanisms of adenovirus-mediated cytotoxicity holds the prospect of providing novel insights into the status of key regulatory pathways in individual patient malignant cells. These studies also hold the prospect of supporting the development of specific attenuated adenoviruses as therapeutic agents with selective cytotoxicity for specific primary lymphoid malignancies.","['The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, New Brunswick 08901, USA. strairrk@umdnj.edu']",,,,,93,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because differential splicing produces multiple isoforms with potentially different functions, Ikaros provides a unique model to study how post-transcriptional mechanisms may be involved in neoplastic processes. Indeed, several groups including ours have underlined evidences that expression of different Ikaros isoforms vary among different types of leukemias. The predominance of short isoforms in certain subsets is intriguing. Here, additional observations reinforced the hypothesis that Ikaros expression may be deregulated in human leukemias.

For this purpose, we used a semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), based on the coamplification of an internal standard not homologous to the DNA target to quantify the mrp transcription level in each studied sample. We report that the level of constitutive mrp gene's expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes is higher in CLL patients than in healthy controls. We found increased mrp gene expression levels in patients with higher white blood cells (WBC) and lymphocytes' counts as well as in more advanced disease stages according to Rai or Binet scale. Finally, mrp gene's expression was higher in patients with progressive CLL, especially in cases refractory to chemotherapy salvage.

In this study, we established a non-radioactive polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis, one of the most sensitive and simplest methods to detect polymorphisms and mutations of the human lactoferrin gene. We optimized the PCR conditions for nine different DNA templates and 16 pairs of exon primers for SSCP analysis. The DNA templates used in the analyses were prepared from a cosmid clone (CT6-1) that contains the human lactoferrin gene, human placental tissue, leukocytes from 10 normal volunteers, leukemic cells of two patients, and previously established three breast and two leukemic cell lines. With the appropriate exon-primer sets, PCR products from exon I to exon 16 of the lactoferrin gene were generated from the DNA templates and analyzed by SSCP. Compared with the homogenous cloned DNA, lactoferrin gene polymorphisms were detected within exons 2, 5, 7, 9, 13, 14, and 15 of the normal placental and leukocyte DNA. In addition, abnormal migration patterns of the lactoferrin gene in cancer cells were detected in exons 4, 5, 13, 14, and 15. The PCR-SSCP band migration patterns can be attributed either to gene polymorphism in normal cells or to DNA mutations in cancer cells and the employed method cannot distinguish between them. Nonetheless, the present analysis suggests that genetic polymorphisms of the lactoferrin gene exist in selected exons and additional mutations of the lactoferrin gene do occur in the cancer cells.","['Gene Regulation Section, Laboratory of Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, National Institutes of Health Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Much experience has been gained, and the biology, indications and limitations are becoming clearer. Nonmyeloablative conditioning allows consistent engraftment of allografts from matched related, unrelated, and even partially matched donors. NST has been able to reduce the toxicity of allogeneic HSCT. The better immediate outcome produces better overall DFS. NST was feasible in elderly patients with almost no upper age limit, and in patients with organ dysfunction or other comorbidities precluding standard ablative conditioning. NST has also reduced the regimen-related toxicity of allogeneic HSCT in high-risk setting such as HSCT in heavily pretreated patients or following failure of a prior transplant procedure and in the unrelated setting. NST is rapidly becoming the treatment of choice in these indications where toxicity of standard ablative therapy is unacceptable. In certain malignancies such as in NHL, Hodgkin's disease and multiple myeloma, standard ablative NST has been reported to result in exceptionally high treatment related mortality, and NST is being investigated as a more reasonable alternative. NST may reduce the toxicity of the procedure even in younger patients who are eligible for ablative HSCT as well, however the long-term impact on patient outcome in this group is not yet established, and NST merits further investigation in prospective comparative trials. As described above, the known susceptibility of the underlying malignancy to GVT, the response to prior chemotherapy and bulk of residual disease, and the type of donor are other factors to consider when considering NST, and when selecting a regimen. The optimal preparative regimen needs to be defined. Ultimately less chemotherapy will be used and more specific immune-modulation, rather than intense nonspecific immunosuppression, will be used to achieve HVG tolerance. Preliminary animal models using costimulation blockade for specific induction of tolerance are promising steps towards achievement of this goal. Although much progress has been achieved with consistent achievement of engraftment with NST, GVHD and disease recurrence remain major obstacles to successful treatment. Existing clinical data suggest that NST does limit the incidence and severity of GVHD. Limitation of regimen-related toxicity, and bilateral transplantation tolerance afforded by mixed chimerism, are believed to have a major role in limiting GVHD. However GVHD remains the primary cause of treatment-related mortality. The development of techniques to separate GVHD and GVL are essential for further improvement of NST outcome. Better understanding of the biology and targets of GVHD and GVL may allow the elimination of alloreactive T-cells responsible for GVHD from the graft while retaining T-cells with GVL and infection control potential. Recurrence of the underlying malignancy is a major complication when NST is attempted in patients with chemo-refractory diseases and with high tumor bulk. Reduced toxicity regimens such as the FB/ATG regimen have been somewhat more successful in controlling disease progression until a potent GVT effect is established. However novel approaches are urgently required. NST serves as a platform for cellular immunotherapy. Judicious use of pre-emptive DLI needs to be explored. DLI may be amplified by activation of donor lymphocytes with IL-2 or in vivo administration of IL-2. Identification of tumor antigens will lead the way to ex-vivo generation and expansion of tumor specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes to be used as potent immunotherapy without the hazards of GVHD. Allogeneic transplantation is rapidly changing from administration of supralethal doses of chemotherapy and radiation, trying to physically eliminate the 'last tumor cell', to the more subtle and tolerated sophisticated immunotherapy. This effort will focus on specific induction of HVG tolerance followed by induction of tumor-specific GVT effect to cure the underlying malignancy.","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",,,,,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this work was to study the survival after diagnosis of cutaneous metastasis in a large series of patients and to evaluate survival according to the type of cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted out in the Laboratoire d'Histo-pathologie Cutanee of Strasbourg. Between 1950 to 1996, 228 patients with cutaneous metastasis were diagnosed on the basis of typical histopathology, confirmed by two dermatopathologists. We excluded lymphoma or leukaemia with secondary skin involvement. Medical and demographic data were collected from hospital data, and the ""Registre du Cancer du Bas-Rhin"". The type of neoplasm, the time of diagnosis of primary cancer and the time of death (or survival at 12/31/1996) was established in 200 patients, 99 men and 101 women with a mean age 62.4 +/- 13 years. We found 64 cases of breast carcinoma, 36 cases of lung carcinoma, 31 cases of melanoma and 69 cases of other cancers. Long term actuarial survival after cutaneous metastasis was calculated using by the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: The median survival after cutaneous metastasis was 6.5 months (mean 22.8 +/- 43.8 months). The mortality rate was 13 p. 100 at 1 month, 48 p. 100 at 6 months and 64.5 p. 100 at 12 months. Median survival was calculated according to the primary neoplasm: breast carcinoma: 13.8 months, melanoma: 13.5 months, lung carcinoma: 2.9 months (36 cases). The outcome of patients with cutaneous metastasis of lung carcinoma was worse than those with melanoma (p < 10(-4)) and breast cancer (p < 10(-4)). Survival after cutaneous metastasis of other cancers could not be compared because of the small size of the subgroups: median survival after cutaneous metastasis of non cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: 8.8 months (5 cases), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: 6.5 months (12 cases), carcinoma of oesophagus: 4.7 months (2 cases), colo-rectal cancer: 4.4 months (9 cases), pancreatic cancer: 3.3 months (2 cases), stomach cancer: 1.2 months (7 cases) and liver and gall bladder carcinoma: < 1 month (3 cases). Survival beyond 10 years was observed in 9 patients: 3 melanoma, 2 breast cancers, 2 prostatic carcinomas, 1 larynx carcinoma and 1 cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. CONCLUSION: This is the first study in which the survival after the occurrence of skin metastasis was systematically analysed in a large series of patients. It shows that half of patients with cutaneous metastasis die within the first 6 months after the diagnosis. Those cases due to lung carcinoma have the poorest prognosis.","[""Clinique Dermatologique de Strasbourg, Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, CHRU, 1, place de l'Hopital, 67091 Strasbourg.""]",,,,,,,,,Survie apres metastases cutanees: etude de 200 cas.,,,,,,,,,

We report four cases of this affection in HIV-negative patients seen between 1990 and 1999 in Nantes Dermatological Clinic. CASE REPORTS: Patients mean age was seventy. Three patients had recent exposure to soil or birds, and two remembered a trauma before the lesion appeared. In three cases the lesion was on the hand. In two cases the lesion was an ulcerated nodule, in another an abscess and in the last a cellulitis. Two subjects were treated by fludarabin and systemic corticosteroids for respectively chronic lymphocytic leukemia and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia. The third had a CD4 lymphopenia. Cultural examination confirmed the diagnosis. Treatment, with fluconazole in 3 cases and ketoconazole and itraconazole in 1 case, resulted in healing of the skin lesion in a few months. DISCUSSION: Recognition of primary cutaneous cryptococcosis as a clinical entity has long been debated. An altered immunological status is an important factor for developing this disease. There is often a clear history of trauma or exposure to soil or birds preceding the development of the lesion. Clinically it often looks like a papule or an ulcerated nodule. The lesion is confined to the skin without systemic involvement. The prognosis is excellent thanks to the use of oral antifungal imidazoles.","['Clinique Dermatologique, Hotel-Dieu, Nantes.']",,,,,,,,,Cryptococcoses cutanees primitives chez des sujets seronegatifs pour le VIH.,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: Emphasis needs to be placed on the clinical recognition of arthropod bites as an unusual cutaneous manifestation of CLL, as they provide the physician with both a diagnostic and a therapeutic challenge. Patients often deny being bitten and, thus, the biopsy results conflict with the patient's history. Additionally, as there is no specific treatment, both the patient and physician are faced with a similar dilemma.

In view of the close relationship between multiple myeloma and primary plasma cell leukemia (PCL), an anti-CD20 antibody treatment might also be considered as consolidation for patients with PCL. A 55-year-old patient diagnosed with PCL achieved complete remission after autologous transplantation. A total of four weekly courses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)) were administered. Prior to antibody therapy, CD20+ cells comprised 22.6% of the mononuclear cells in peripheral blood (PB) assessed by flow cytometry and were enriched by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS). In the enriched CD20+ fraction, 0.093% clonotypic cells were detected using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay based on limiting dilutions. The proportion of clonotypic cells was 0.034% in PB and 0.032% in bone marrow (BM). Rituximab depleted CD20+ cells completely in PB and BM. Tumor load in PB and BM at day 40 and in PB at day 70 did not change in comparison to prior to therapy (0.037% in PB, 0.026% in BM). At day 90, the tumor load increased to 0.066% in PB. At day 120, the patient relapsed with 0.65% CD38++/CD138+/CD20- plasma cells and furthermore no CD20+ B cells in PB. The expansion of plasma cells was accompanied by an increase in the tumor load in both compartments (PB: 0.65%, BM: 1.8%). The accumulation of plasma cells during disease progression without the reappearance of CD20+ cells did not sustain the role of circulating clonotypic B cells as proliferative compartment in our patient. However, it cannot be excluded that rituximab was not able to eradicate malignant B cells, which subsequently contributed to relapse.","['Department of Internal Medicine V, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,20011222,,,,,,,,,,

The ATRA therapy was discontinued for 11 days and treatment with corticosteroids improved the systemic and cutaneous signs. Only 11 cases of Sweet's syndrome associated with ATRA have been previously reported in the literature, involving only the skin in eight cases, the skin and muscles in two cases, and the lung, kidney, fascia, and muscles in one case.

The prevalence of LC was 3.7% in clinically diagnosed patients and 2.9% in biopsy-proven cases, respectively. Patients with and without LC did not differ with regard to age, sex, white blood cell counts, hemoglobin, fibrinogen, and platelet counts at diagnosis, but lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was significantly higher in patients with LC. Various karyotype abnormalities were found, but in patients with LC numerical abnormalities of chromosome 8 were significantly more common ( P<0.0001). Patients with LC did not differ from patients without LC with regard to remission rate, but there was a trend towards shorter remission duration in patients with LC. We conclude that patients with LC have some features different from patients without this symptom. The increased frequency of numerical aberrations of chromosome 8 in patients with LC was the most interesting observation of our study.

STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: Cultures were initiated with EBV-infected tonsillar B and B-CLL cells. Expression of EBNA-2 and some of the key players regulating G1/S phase transition such as c-myc expression, phosphorylation of Rb protein, expression of G1 cyclins, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 were followed. RESULTS: In line with earlier studies, EBV infection induced c-myc expression, pRb phosphorylation, D2 and D3 expression, and disappearance of p27 in normal B cells. In contrast, EBV-infected B-CLL cells remained resting and they did not express c-myc; cyclin D2, ppRb and cyclin D3 were seen only in occasional cells. Importantly, p27 expression was maintained. CONCLUSIONS: In B-CLL cells, the expression of the EBV-encoded nuclear proteins EBNAs is not followed by entrance to the cell cycle. Thus, the difference in the interaction of EBV-normal B cells and EBV-B-CLL cells is already apparent early after infection.","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden. akimae@eos.ocn.ne.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a step toward the elucidation of the early intranuclear events that regulate the proliferation or the differentiation process, we show that in the HL-60 cells, a proliferating stimulus (i.e., insulin-like growth factor-I [IGF-I]) increased nuclear diacylglycerol (DAG) production derived from phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate, as indicated by the inhibition exerted by 1-O-octadeyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and U-73122 (1-[6((17 beta-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl)amino)hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dione), which are pharmacological inhibitors of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C. In contrast, when HL-60 cells were induced to differentiate along the granulocytic lineage by dimethyl sulfoxide, we observed a rise in the nuclear DAG mass, which was sensitive to either neomycin or propranolol, two compounds with inhibitory effect on phospholipase D (PLD)-mediated DAG generation. In nuclei of dimethyl sulfoxide-treated HL-60 cells, we observed a rise in the amount of a 90-kDa PLD, distinct from PLD1 or PLD2. When a phosphatidylinositol (4,5) bisphosphate-derived DAG pool was generated in the nucleus, a selective translocation of PKC-beta II occurred. On the other hand, nuclear DAG derived through PLD, recruited PKC-alpha to the nucleus. Both of these PKC isoforms were phosphorylated on serine residues. These results provide support for the proposal that in the HL-60 cell nucleus there are two independently regulated sources of DAG, both of which are capable of acting as the driving force that attracts to this organelle distinct, DAG-dependent PKC isozymes. Our results assume a particular significance in light of the proposed use of pharmacological inhibitors of PKC-dependent biochemical pathways for the therapy of cancer disease.","['Dipartimento di Morfologia ed Embriologia, Sezione di Anatomia Umana Normale, Universita di Ferrara, 44100 Ferrara, Italy.']",,,,,,,PMC99611,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that SMN can directly interact in vitro and in vivo with the large nonstructural protein NS1 of the autonomous parvovirus minute virus of mice (MVM), a protein essential for viral replication and a potent transcriptional activator. Typically, SMN localizes within nuclear Cajal bodies and diffusely in the cytoplasm. Following transient NS1expression, SMN and NS1 colocalize within Cajal bodies. At early time points following parvovirus infection, NS1 fails to colocalize with SMN within Cajal bodies; however, during the course of MVM infection, dramatic nuclear alterations occur. Formerly distinct nuclear bodies such as Cajal bodies, promyelocytic leukemia gene product (PML) oncogenic domains (PODs), speckles, and autonomous parvovirus-associated replication (APAR) bodies are seen aggregating at later points in infection. These newly formed large nuclear bodies (termed SMN-associated APAR bodies) are active sites of viral replication and viral capsid assembly. These results highlight the transient nature of nuclear bodies and their contents and identify a novel nuclear body formed during infection. Furthermore, simple transient expression of the viral nonstructural proteins is insufficient to induce this nuclear reorganization, suggesting that this event is induced specifically by a step in the viral infection process.","['Department of Biology, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287, USA.']","['R01 AI046458/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI46458/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI021302/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS041584/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI21302/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS41584-01/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC136105,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the role of PML in vivo, we compared immune responses and virus loads of PML-deficient and control mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). PML(-/-) mice exhibited accelerated primary footpad swelling reactions to very-low-dose LCMV, higher swelling peaks upon high-dose inoculation, and higher viral loads in the early phase of systemic LCMV infection. T-cell-mediated hepatitis and consequent mortality upon infection with a hepatotropic LCMV strain required 10- to 100-times-lower inocula despite normal cytotoxic T-lymphocyte reactivity in PML(-/-) mice. Furthermore, PML deficiency rendered mice 10 times more susceptible to lethal immunopathology upon intracerebral LCMV inoculation. Accordingly, 10-times-lower VSV inocula elicited specific neutralizing-antibody responses, a replication-based effect not observed with inactivated virus or after immunization with recombinant VSV glycoprotein. These in vivo observations corroborated our results showing more virus production in PML(-/-) fibroblasts.

Thus, we used a recently generated Smad 3-deficient (Smad 3-/-) mouse model to test the hypothesis that Smad 3 alters female fertility and regulates the growth of ovarian follicles from the primordial stage to the antral stage. In addition, we tested whether Smad 3 affects the levels of proteins that control apoptosis, survival, and proliferation in the ovarian follicle. To test this hypothesis, breeding studies were conducted using Smad 3-/- and wild-type mice. In addition, ovaries were collected from Smad 3-/- and wild-type mice on Postnatal Days 2-90. One ovary from each animal was used to estimate the total number of primordial, primary, and antral follicles. The other ovary was used for immunohistochemical analysis of selected members of the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 family of protooncogenes (Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-x), proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk-2). The results indicate that Smad 3-/- mice have reduced fertility compared with wild type mice. The results also indicate that Smad 3 may not affect the size of the primordial follicle pool at birth, but it may regulate growth of primordial follicles to the antral stage. Further, the results indicate that Smad 3 may regulate the expression of Bax and Bcl-2, but not Bcl-x, Cdk-2, and PCNA. Collectively, these data suggest that Smad 3 may play an important role in the regulation of ovarian follicle growth and female fertility.","['Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, University of Maryland School of Medicine, 660 W.

In the present study, we have examined the effects of the quinolones norfloxacin (NFLX), enoxacin (ENX), ofloxacin (OFLX), tosufloxacin (TFLX), lomefloxacin (LFLX), sparfloxacin (SPFX) and grepafloxacin (GPFX) on the efflux of doxorubicin from mouse leukaemia P388/ADR cells expressing P-glycoprotein. The relationship between their partition coefficients (hydrophobicity) and effluxing potencies was also elucidated. 2. Both TFLX and SPFX strongly increased the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin (5 micromol/L) in P388/ADR cells, but had no effect on P388/S cells not expressing P-glycoprotein. The rank of order of the potency of the quinolones (TFLX > SPFX > GPFX > NFLX) was not related directly to their hydrophobicity. These results suggest that some quinolones can reverse anticancer drug resistance. 3. Because GPFX is more highly excreted into the bile than other known quinolones, the effects of doxorubicin (10 mg/kg) or the well-known inhibitors of P-glycoprotein, namely cyclosporine A (10 mg/kg) and erythromycin (100 mg/kg), on the biliary excretion of GPFX at steady state was studied in rats. 4. Doxorubicin, cyclosporine A and erythromycin significantly decreased the biliary clearance of GPFX. Cyclosporine A and erythromycin had a much stronger inhibitory effect on the biliary excretion of GPFX than doxorubicin. These results suggest the possibility that GPFX is, at least in part, excreted into the bile by a P-glycoprotein-mediated transport mechanism.","['Department of Medical Technology, Nagoya University School of Health Sciences, Meijo University, Nagoya, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So far, however, there has been no information about the allergenicity of processed celery in celery-allergic patients. METHODS: In 12 patients with a history of allergic reactions to raw or raw and cooked celery, double-blind placebo-controlled food challenges (DBPCFCs) with raw celery (n = 10), cooked celery (110 degrees C/15 min; n = 11), and celery spice (n = 5) were performed. Nine patients underwent an open mucosal challenge with four samples of canned celery retorted at Co-values (cooking effect) of 7.45-76.07 (corresponding to the time periods in minutes at a thermal influence of 100 degrees C). IgE immunoblot analysis of celery extract was performed with sera of all challenged patients. The thermal stability of celery allergen was investigated by enzyme allergosorbent test (EAST) inhibition. Furthermore, intraperitoneal immunization of mice followed by a rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cell mediator release assay was used as a biological in vitro model to assess the allergenicity of processed celery. RESULTS: Six out of 11 patients showed a positive DBPCFC to cooked celery and five out of five patients to celery spice. Allergenicity of celery was preserved in four patients with a positive DBPCFC to cooked celery even if celery was treated at a Co-value of 76.07. Patients with positive DBPCFC to cooked celery reacted to known celery allergens (Api g 1, Api g 4, cross-reactive carbohydrate determinants CCD). EAST inhibition showed that heat resistance of celery allergens decreases in the following order: CCD > Api g 4 > Api g 1. Accordingly, five of six patients with a positive DBPCFC to cooked celery were sensitized to profilin and/or CCD. The murine model reflected the reactivity of patients sensitized to the major allergen Api g 1. CONCLUSIONS: 1) In a subset of patients with a positive DBPCFC to cooked celery, celery remains allergenic even after extended thermal treatment (76.07 min/100 degrees C). 2) Celery spice is allergenic for patients with an allergy to raw celery. 3) RBL cells sensitized with mouse IgE to raw celery may serve as a useful tool for screening the potential allergenicity of heat-processed products containing celery.","['Allergy Unit, Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Classic antibody-targeted conjugates were prepared by aminolytic reaction of the multivalent HPMA copolymer containing side-chains ending in 4-nitrophenyl ester (ONp) reactive groups with primary NH(2) groups of the antibodies. The star structure of antibody-targeted conjugates was prepared using semitelechelic HPMA copolymer chains containing only one reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide group at the end of the backbone chain. In both types of conjugates, B1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) was used as a targeting moiety. B1 mAb recognizes the idiotype of surface IgM on BCL1 cells. The star structure of the targeted conjugate had a narrower molecular mass distribution than the classic structure. The peak in the star structure was around 300-350 kDa, while the classic structure conjugate had a peak around 1300 kDa. Doxorubicin was bound to the HPMA copolymer via Gly-Phe(D,L)-Leu-Gly spacer to ensure the controlled intracellular delivery. The release of doxorubicin from polymer conjugates incubated in the presence of cathepsin B was almost twice faster from the star structure of targeted conjugate than from the classic one. The star structure of the targeted conjugate showed a lower binding activity to BCL1 cells in vitro, but the cytostatic activity measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation was three times higher than that seen with the classic conjugate. Cytostatic activity of nontargeted and anti-Thy 1.2 mAb (irrelevant mAb) modified HPMA copolymer-bound doxorubicin was more than hundred times lower as compared to the star structure of B1 mAb targeted conjugate. In vivo, both types of conjugates targeted with B1 mAb bound to BCL1 cells in the spleen with approximately the same intensity. The classic structure of the targeted conjugate bound to BCL1 cells in the blood with a slightly higher intensity than the star structure. Both types of targeted conjugates had a much stronger antitumor effect than nontargeted HPMA copolymer-bound doxorubicin and free doxorubicin. The star structure of targeted conjugate had a remarkably higher antitumor effect than the classic structure: a single intravenous dose of 100 microg of doxorubicin given on day 11 completely cured five out of nine experimental animals whereas the classic structure of targeted conjugate given in the same schedule only prolonged the survival of experimental mice to 138% of control mice. These results show that the star structure of antibody-targeted HPMA copolymer-bound doxorubicin is a suitable conjugate for targeted drug delivery with better characterization, higher cytostatic activity in vitro, and stronger antitumor potential in vivo than classic conjugates.","['Institute of Microbiology, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Videnska 1083, 142 20 Prague 4, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We show a theoretical reason that competitive PCR might quantify DNA more accurately during the plateau phase than during the exponential phase. Second, we demonstrate that the theoretical predictions are supported by the experimental results of beta-globin gene amplification using the lysates of human diploid fibroblast WS1 cells. We also demonstrate that we can correctly quantify target DNA by keeping the starting concentration of target DNA close to a constant preset value while using a constant number of PCR cycles and by using WS1 cells as control.

Significant cancer risk was seen among diagnostic x-ray workers (RR = 1.2, 95% CI: 1.1-1.3).

The patterns of risk associated with years since beginning x-ray work and with age and calendar year of initial employment suggest that the excesses of leukemia, skin cancer, and female breast cancer-and possibly thyroid cancer-were related to occupational exposure to x rays. Because of a lack of individual dosimetry for Chinese medical x-ray workers (CMXW) before 1985, the dose was reconstructed by physical and biological retrospective dosimetry methods. The cancer risk of CMXW was estimated based on the reconstructed dose. The average cumulative dose for the earlier cohort (employed before 1970) was 551 mGy, and for the later cohort (employed from 1970 to 1980) it was 82 mGy. The RRs of leukemia and solid cancer were significantly high for the earlier cohort: 2.4 for leukemia, 1.2 for solid cancer. But no significant increase of RR was evident for the later cohort. The RR of leukemia was 1.7 and 1.1 for solid cancer.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in DS shares many of the clinical characteristics of the same malignancy in other patients, and with current intensive therapy the long-term survival is similar. Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia have unique clinical characteristics in these patients and are best described as a single disorder, termed myeloid leukaemia of DS. When these patients are treated intensively, they show better survival rates than patients without DS. This may be related to increased expression of genes on chromosome 21 contributing to increased chemosensitivity. Chronic myeloid leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia occur less often than expected. With the exception of an increased risk of retinoblastoma, germ-cell tumours, and perhaps lymphomas, the risk of developing solid tumours is lower in both children and adults. Breast cancer is almost absent, and the risk of a second malignant disease after treatment for leukaemia also appears to be decreased. Increased susceptibility to apoptosis in DS may result in cell death rather than malignant transformation after major cell injuries. This hypothesis would explain the decreased risk of both solid tumours and secondary cancers.","['Department of Paediatrics, Skejby Hospital, Aarhus University, Denmark. hasle@dadlnet.dk']",,,,,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using the recently advocated combination of all-transretinoic acid and chemotherapy, adverse effects such as retinoic acid syndrome have decreased, and long-term survival has improved. Chemotherapy in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid seems to be the best postremission treatment protocol, with a 5-year relapse-free survival rate of 50 - 60%. Arsenic compounds have recently proved effective in newly diagnosed and relapsed acute promyelocytic leukaemia, with complete remission rates of 80 - 90% according to most reports. As2O3, the most studied arsenic compound, can be given by intravenous infusion at a dose of 0.08 - 0.16 mg/kg daily. A course of 28 - 44 days is required to induce remission. Although the drug is safe in patients who have relapsed, severe liver damage has been observed in some newly diagnosed patients. Combined use of chemotherapy and arsenic as postremission treatment results in longer survival than arsenic alone. Although their mechanisms of action are distinct, both all-trans-retinoic acid and arsenic can modulate PML-RARalpha, an oncoprotein that has a central role in leukaemogenesis, and both can relieve ranscriptional repression by modifying chromatin structure.","['Shanghai Institute of Haematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University, China.']",,,,,33,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent developments in our understanding of stem-cell biology have profoundly influenced the practice of both autologous and allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The demonstration that cytokines, such as granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, mobilise large numbers of haemopoietic progenitors has resulted in the peripheral blood rather than the bone marrow becoming the preferred source of haemopoietic stem cells in autologous, and increasingly in allogeneic, stem-cell transplantation. This has substantially reduced the morbidity of autografting, so that disease relapse now represents the most important cause of treatment failure. Current efforts are aimed at reducing this risk, either by employing novel conditioning regimens or by tumour purging. With regard to allogeneic transplantation, there is a growing realisation of the importance of a graft-versus-leukaemia effect, and this has encouraged the use of strategies which optimise an immunologically-mediated antitumour effect. This, coupled with increased understanding of the biology of stem-cell engraftment, has resulted in the development of less toxic conditioning regimens, designed to allow the benefits of allografting to be extended to patients in whom this procedure is contraindicated.","['Department of Haematology, Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, UK.

Here we describe a multidisciplinary long-term follow-up clinic for survivors of ABMT and report patient satisfaction with the clinic and economic analysis 1.5 years after its inception. In its first 1.5 years of operation, 83 new patients were seen in the clinic. Patients were evaluated a median of 4.0 years after ABMT (range 4.9 months to 12 years) and were a median of 48.5 years (range 22.5-69.0 years) old. Patients received their ABMT for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma ( n=26), Hodgkin's disease ( n=18), acute myeloid leukemia ( n=18), multiple myeloma ( n=15), breast cancer ( n=5), or desmoplastic round-cell tumor ( n=1). Patient satisfaction was assessed 1.5 years after the establishment of the long-term follow-up clinic by means of a self-report questionnaire. Seventy-five percent of patients returned the survey. Waiting times in the clinic were short, with 70% of patients seen within 30 minutes of arrival. Overall, patients were very satisfied with the new clinic model, with 85% patients reporting that the clinic met their expectations. An economic analysis indicated that the estimated annual cost of operating the clinic was approximately $53,000, which translates into $440 per patient visit, $962 per new patient or $172 per patient visit with the clinic operating at peak capacity. In conclusion, we present an inexpensive model of care for ABMT survivors that can be extended to adult survivors of malignancy not treated by ABMT.","['ABMT Long-term Follow-up Research Unit, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, ABMT Program, Canada. aaron.schimmer@utoronto.ca']",,,,,,,,20011123,,,,,,,,,,

A 6-year-old boy received an unrelated 2/6 HLA antigen mismatched UCB transplant for high-risk Burkitt type acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The UCB unit was provided as a volume-reduced sample after buffy coat separation with a final volume of 36 ml. To avoid the loss of nucleated cells due to cell clumping during thawing procedure cells were washed with a solution containing the rhDNase. No visible clotting of the resuspended unit occurred, and the patient was transplanted with 2.9x10(7) nucleated cells/kg body weight without any acute or chronic side effects due to rhDNase. On day +35, PCR analysis of bone marrow aspirate showed complete chimerism, and the child engrafted with an absolute neutrophil count greater than 0.5x10(9)/l on day +47. Platelet transfusion independence was achieved on day +120. In conclusion, the supplementation of rhDNase to the washing and resuspension solutions of a thawed UCB unit is effective to prevent cell losses prior to transplantation. However, further investigations must be performed to confirm the safety of this procedure.","['Institute of Transfusion Medicine and Immunology, Red Cross Blood Service of Baden-Wurttemberg-Hessen, College of Clinical Medicine Mannheim, University of Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany. h.eichler@blutspende.de']",,,,,,,,20020126,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2002 Feb 23.,,"The BCR/ABL1 fusion gene is mainly caused by the t(9; 22)(q34; q11.2) translocation, which results in the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the typical hallmark in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), but can also be present in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The BCR/ABL1 rearrangement is an important tumor classification marker and a useful prognostic factor allowing an adequate therapy management. Ph chromosome detection by conventional cytogenetics (CC) can be hampered by low quantity and quality of metaphases from tumor cells. Furthermore, BCR/ABL1 rearrangements may be hidden due to cryptic rearrangements or complex aberrations. Therefore, molecular cytogenetic methods turned out to be useful tools for the detection of BCR/ABL1 rearrangements. We performed fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with the recently developed BCR/ABL1 D-FISH probe (QBIOgene, Illkirch, F) on cultured bone marrow and peripheral blood cells of 71 patients with CML, ALL, AML, and myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). FISH results and the results of banding methods were directly compared. Based on the analyses of >200 nuclei per patient, D-FISH correlated closely with CC and allowed an accurate quantification of BCR/ABL1 rearrangements even in a low percentage of aberrant cells. No false-positive or false-negative results were obtained. Furthermore, the D-FISH probe detected three cryptic and one complex BCR/ABL1 rearrangement, which were not visible by CC. We conclude that D-FISH reliably detects standard Ph chromosomes as well as its variant translocations and accurately quantifies BCR/ABL1 rearrangements prior and during cancer treatment as well as in the phase of remission, in daily routine tumor cytogenetic diagnostics.","['Institut fur Humangenetik, Universitatsklinikum Magdeburg, Leipziger Strasse 44, H. 26, 39120 Magdeburg, Germany.

Epub 2002 Jan 29.,,"Immunotherapy of malignant diseases mediated by dendritic cells (DC) pulsed with tumor antigens ex vivo is a promising new tool in the individual treatment of malignant diseases. The present study focuses on the problem of how to optimize in vitro culture conditions and induce the maturation of DC with the capacity to induce antitumor immunity toward leukemic cells. DC were generated from peripheral mononuclear cells by co-cultivation with granulocyte/macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and interleukin-4 (IL-4). Tumor antigens were added for 2 h after 7 days in culture. Irradiated leukemic blasts, blast lysate, apoptotic cells from the Jurkat cell line (T ALL) and their lysate were used in various concentrations for antigen pulsing. Harvested DC were phenotyped by flow cytometry, and viability was assessed using trypan blue exclusion (Annexin test). After the cells had been pulsed with tumor antigens and co-cultured with autologous lymphocytes, the production of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-12 was analyzed, and lymphocyte proliferative response and cytotoxicity against the target tumor cell line were assessed. The cultivation of monocytes under the described conditions led to the expression of surface markers typical of DC (i.e. CD83, CD86, HLA-DR, CD11c and CD40). Pulsation by antigens from leukemic cells further increased the cell populations expressing these markers. Antigen pulsation decreased the viability of generated DC depending on the increase in concentration of tumor antigens. Pulsed DC-lymphocyte interaction increased the proliferative response of lymphocytes and IFN-gamma production depending on the type of tumor antigens used for pulsation. The highest proliferative response was detected with DC pulsed with Jurkat cell-line lysate. Similarly to the proliferation assay, cytotoxic testing showed the highest efficiency of DC pulsed with Jurkat cell-line lysate in killing the target malignant cells. Our results show that an appropriate antigen concentration used for DC pulsing is one of the crucial factors in an effective treatment strategy, as high concentrations of tumor antigens induce apoptosis of DC, thereby rendering them non-functional. Under optimal conditions, pulsation by lysate from leukemic blasts induced the maturation of DC and led to an increase in the proliferation of autologous lymphocytes, to the production of Th1-cytokines and to the induction of cytotoxicity toward the leukemic cell line. These results are encouraging for the possible application of pulsed DC in the therapy of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Institute of Immunology, Charles University, Second Medical Faculty and Faculty Hospital Motol, V Uvalu 84, 150-06 Prague 5, Czech Republic.']",,,,,,,,20020129,,,,,,,,,,

TAL1 also has a critical role in embryonic vascular remodeling and is expressed in endothelial cells postnatally, although little is known about its function or regulation in this cell type. We report here that the important proangiogenic stimulus hypoxia stimulates phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteasomal breakdown of TAL1 in endothelial cells. Tryptic phosphopeptide mapping and chemical inhibitor studies showed that hypoxia induced the mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated phosphorylation of a single serine residue, Ser(122), in the protein, and site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that Ser(122) phosphorylation was necessary for hypoxic acceleration of TAL1 turnover in an immortalized murine endothelial cell line. Finally, whereas TAL1 expression was detected in endothelial cells from both large and small vessels, hypoxia-induced TAL1 turnover was observed only in microvascular endothelial cells.

Chemokines and their receptors are involved in T cell and mast cell migration and accumulation during the inflammatory process. METHODS: In the present study, we investigated the role of RANTES and its receptors in OLP using immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR and an in vitro chemotaxis assay. RESULTS: RANTES and CCR1 were expressed on T cells and mast cells in OLP, while OLP lesional T cell supernatants stimulated CCR1 mRNA expression in a human leukemia mast cell line (HMC-1). TNF-alpha stimulated CCR1, CCR4 and CCR5 mRNA expression in the same cell line. OLP lesional T cell supernatants stimulated HMC-1 migration, which was partly inhibited by anti-RANTES antibody. CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows, for the first time, the distribution of RANTES and CCR1 in OLP. It is hypothesized that RANTES and CCR1 may play important roles in mast cell trafficking and related events in OLP.","['School of Dentistry, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe four cases with some distinctive features, such as diffuse splenic infiltration, lack of micronodules, marginal zone cytology, p53 inactivation and cutaneous involvement. METHODS AND RESULTS: In the course of a review of cases of SMZL, we recognized the existence of a subset of four cases of splenic B-cell lymphoma, with predominantly red pulp involvement, absence of follicular replacement, and a monomorphous population of tumoral cells resembling marginal zone B-cells, with scattered nucleolated blast cells. The immunophenotype (bcl2+, CD5-, CD10-, CD43-, CD23-, cyclin D1-, IgD- (3/4)) was consistent with SMZL. Bone marrow infiltration (4/4) and peripheral blood involvement (2/4) showed similar findings to those described for SMZL in these locations. However, unlike classical SMZL, 2/4 had cutaneous involvement, and 4/4 cases showed either p53 mutation or anomalous p53 staining (p53+, p21-). CONCLUSIONS; In spite of a diffuse pattern of splenic infiltration, cutaneous involvement and p53 alterations, these cases have findings that overlap with those corresponding to classic SMZL (symptomatology, morphology of bone marrow, lymph nodes, peripheral blood involvement, and immunophenotype). We suggest that these cases be considered a putative variant of SMZL.","['Department of Pathology and Genetics, Hospital Virgen de la Salud, Toledo, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is increasingly understood that there are important obstacles to assisting patients with nutritional problems in the oncology setting. The purpose of this article is to discuss the incidental findings of two recent studies, highlighting the importance of and problems associated with nutritional issues in patients with a hematologic malignancy. OVERVIEW: This article presents findings from two recent studies with a subset of patients who have hematologic malignancies. This diagnostic subgroup has specific challenges associated with nutrition and eating because of the intensive and aggressive treatments that patients endure. An explorative, descriptive, iterative, qualitative methodology was used for both studies. The focus was on exploring the lived experience of treatment in oncology/hematology for patients (prospective) and caregivers (retrospective). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: The findings indicate that the issues surrounding food and eating are considered to be of great significance both to patients who are undergoing intensive treatment for a hematologic malignancy and to their caregivers. The significance of food is not seen purely in relation to its nutritional value, but as an important quality-of-life issue. Eating problems during intensive chemotherapy are perceived as highly stressful and can be, in the case of treatment-related anorexia, life threatening. Recommendations are made for interventions that could reduce the stress and nutritional difficulties for both patients and caregivers.","[""Leukaemia Foundation's Psycho-Social Research Program, University of Queensland, St. Lucia, Queensland 4072, Australia.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: The diagnosis of TBM was confirmed in 3 cases by culture from CSF, in 1 case Mycobacterium tuberculosis was proven only in tracheal aspirate. In 1 patient M. bovis was found, which is an extremely rare cause of TBM in Germany. We report the contributions of different diagnostic tools (CSF analysis, neuroimaging) in reaching the presumptive diagnosis and in monitoring the further course. All patients developed neurological complications despite prompt tuberculostatic treatment. Three of the patients presented a chronic severe loss of consciousness of unclear origin.

The patient had petechiae, thrombocytopenia, and blastemia. Trisomy 21 with a satellited Y chromosome (Yqs) was found in proliferating blasts. A stimulated peripheral blood culture confirmed the constitutional origin of the Yqs, but did not reveal the presence of any trisomic 21 cell. By the age of 3 months, clonal chromosome evolution in the form of an interstitial deletion of the long-arm of chromosome 13 [del(13)(q13q31)] was detected along with trisomy 21 in unstimulated bone marrow cultures. However, remission was achieved without treatment at the age of 4 months. Trisomy 21 and del(13)(q13q31) were not identified in either cytogenetics or fluorescence in situ hybridization studies at that time. The child was asymptomatic until the age of 20 months when anemia and thrombocytopenia prompted a bone marrow biopsy, revealing changes consistent with AMKL. The remission proceeded by clonal karyotype evolution in a neonate with TMD demonstrates that clonal karyotype evolution does not indicate an immediately progressive disease. However, the development of AMKL after TMD in this case illustrates the increased risk for leukemia in TMD cases, even without DS. The gradual clonal evolution of the blasts in our patient suggests that ""multiple hits"" oncogenesis applies to TMD progression to acute leukemia.","['Department of Pathology, University of South Alabama College of Medicine, Mobile, USA.']",,,,,31,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present work focuses on the therapeutic efficacy and the toxicity of interferon (IFN) alpha 2b in combination with cytosine arabinosine (Ara-C) in patients younger than age 18 years enrolled in the randomized trial CML 91, which compared the efficacy of IFN and cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) with IFN alone in 810 patients with CML in the chronic phase. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twelve patients younger than age 18 years were enrolled in the randomized trial CML 91. Hydroxyurea and IFN (5 million units/m2, once a day) were given as initial treatment in all patients. After randomization, six patients received IFN (5 million units/m2, once per day) and Ara-C (20 mg/m2 for 10 days each month) (IFN plus Ara-C group), and six patients received IFN alone (5 million units/m2 once per day) (IFN group). RESULTS: Six months after the beginning of the treatment, a complete hematologic response was obtained in all the patients in the IFN plus Ara-C group and in four patients in the IFN group. A major cytogenetic response was observed in three patients in the IFN plus Ara-C group and in two patients in the IFN group. Five patients from the IFN group who crossed over to receive Ara-C did not experience additional hematologic toxicity. Three patients in the IFN plus Ara-C group and two from the IFN group are alive, in major cytogenetic response, with a follow-up of 18 to 48 months. CONCLUSION: The combination of IFN and Ara-C induces complete hematologic and major cytogenetic responses and is well tolerated in patients younger than age 18 years with CML. This combination may offer an alternative to bone marrow transplantation in children in the chronic phase of CML without a histocompatible donor.","[""Service d'Hematologie et Oncologie Medicale, Hopital Jean Bernard, Poitiers, France. f.millot@chu-poitiers.fr""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are two forms of the disease. Transient leukemia (TL) is a form of megakaryoblastic leukemia that occurs in newborns with Down syndrome and usually disappears spontaneously within the first 3 months of life. Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) occurs in Down syndrome children within the first 4 years of life and is fatal without treatment. The megakaryoblasts of TL and AMKL are indistinguishable by light and electron microscopy; yet, TL is benign and AMKL is malignant. One of the hallmarks of many malignancies is the expression of telomerase. It is therefore hypothesized that the transient, benign form of megakaryoblastic leukemia (TL) would not contain telomerase activity, whereas telomerase would be demonstrable in the malignant form of the disease. Telomerase activity was determined in the blood and/or bone marrow aspirates in 29 cases of AMKL and 34 cases of TL. The authors found telomerase activity in 15 of 29 (52%) cases, of AMKL and in only 4 of 34 (12%) cases of TL (P < 0.001). Furthermore, three of the four telomerase-positive TL cases were particularly severe, of which two were fatal. Telomerase activity is found frequently in the leukemic cells of the malignant form of megakaryoblastic leukemia but rarely in the benign form of the disease (TL). Observations provide evidence that telomerase may be a critical factor for the malignant conversion of leukemic cells.","['Department of Pathology, Medical College of Virginia, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, USA.']",,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2002 Jan;24(1):6-8.

These advances have led to the development of promising new therapeutic strategies, including agents targeted to the molecular lesions that cause leukaemia. The importance of host pharmacogenetics has also been recognised. Thus, genetic polymorphisms of certain enzymes have been linked with host susceptibility to the development of de novo leukaemia or therapy-related second cancers. Furthermore, recognition of inherited differences in the metabolism of antileukaemic agents has provided rational selection criteria for optimal drug dosages and scheduling. Treatment response assessed by measurements of submicroscopic leukaemia (minimal residual disease) has emerged as a powerful and independent prognostic indicator for gauging the intensity of therapy. Ultimately, treatment based on biological features of leukaemic cells, host genetics, and the amount of residual disease should improve cure rates further.","[""Leukaemia/Lymphoma Division, Fahad Nassar Al-Rashid Chair of Leukaemia Research at St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. ching-hon.pui@stjude.org""]","['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA78224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,75,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this setting, tumours expressing CD43 in the absence of other T or B cell markers (CD43 only phenotype) are rare. We present four cases with this aberrant phenotype seen at our institution. METHODS: The CD43 only phenotype was defined as expression of CD43 in the absence of expression of B cell markers CD20 and CD79a, and T cell markers CD3 and CD5, on initial immunohistochemistry performed on biopsies of suspected NHL. Combinations of further immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, cytogenetic analysis and molecular studies were used to enable further diagnosis and lineage assignment. RESULTS: The four cases were subsequently diagnosed as: one case of extramedullary acute myeloid leukaemia, one case of null cell anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, and two cases of extranodal diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

The development of HAM/TSP is associated with rapid maturation of dendritic cells (DCs), while ATL is accomplished with their maturation defect. The DC maturation is induced by cell-to-cell contact with CD4+ T cells expressing CD40 ligand (L). We determined the influence of CD40L expressed on various HTLV-I-infected T cells on the DC maturation. Around 60% of CD4+ T cells infected with HTLV-I for 1 week, expressed CD40L molecules involved in DC maturation. DCs matured by the CD40L+ T cells activated autologous CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. HTLV-I-immortalized T-cell lines established from healthy donors consistently expressed CD40L molecules for 3 months, however, some lines lost the expression soon thereafter. Interleukin (IL)-2-independent and transformed lines lacked that expression. Furthermore, T cells obtained from HAM/TSP patients expressed CD40L molecules for at least 3 weeks, whereas T cells from ATL patients did not express that. The CD40L T cells did not induce DC maturation, and required exogenous CD40L molecules for maturation. The CD40L+ T-cell-induced maturation was blocked by anti-CD40L antibody. Therefore, the lack of CD40L expression on HTLV-I-infected T cells may be associated with the development of ATL.","['Division of Human Retrovirus, Center for Chronic Viral Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan. mmaki@nih.go.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study documents relapse and survival rates in 85 consecutive children (33 at good risk, 52 at high risk) with ALL diagnosed in 1991 to 1996. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Until 1993, the New York II protocol for the high-risk group and a combination of UKALL XI (induction) and R blocks of ALL-REZ BFM-87 (intensification) regimens for patients at good risk were used. To reduce toxicity, the protocols were subsequently modified. Consolidation treatment was the same for both groups, consisting of a lower cytarabine dose and methotrexate removal, whereas intensification was changed only for the high-risk group using the BB block of the NHL-BFM-90 protocol. The bone marrow clearance of leukemia was assessed on day 22, and minimal residual disease was detected using polymerase chain reaction analysis of Ig heavy-chain gene rearrangements. RESULTS: Seventy patients had common precursor B lineage ALL, six had pre-B-ALL, eight had T-ALL, and one had B-ALL. Two patients never achieved remission and died. Six patients died of consolidation-related complications. Four more patients died, two during induction and two during maintenance therapy. Two other children had relapse (2.3%), both of whom were treated with the earlier protocols and then underwent bone marrow transplantation. Four more children with morphologically complete remission showed minimal residual disease (which reached the levels of 1 leukemic cell among 10(2)-10(4) normal cells) with the use of clone-specific probes at several points of the study intervals, but never had relapse. The 5-year overall and event-free survival rates were 86% and 83%, respectively. The 5-year overall survival rates for good-risk and high-risk groups were 94% and 81%; the corresponding event-free rates were 91% and 78%. The 5-year event-free survival rate in the patients at high risk was significantly higher after the protocol change (90% vs. 65%, P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: The modification proved to be effective in diminishing the therapeutic toxicity and improving the efficacy, mainly for the high-risk group.","[""First Department of Pediatrics, University of Athens, Aghia Sophia Children's Hospital, Greece. ftzortzatou@hotmail.com""]",,,,,28,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Chemotherapy response was determined by standard morphology or by MDF assessed by residual leukemic cell percentage remaining in the marrow on days 7, 14, and 28 of induction. Bone marrow response was classified as M3 (>25% leukemic blasts) or M1/M2 (< or = 25% leukemic blasts). Multidimensional flow cytometry evaluation was compared with that of standard morphology. Available day-7 and day-14 marrow slides were also reevaluated by a single pathologist without patients' clinical information. RESULTS: Of 46 day-7 specimens, eight (17%) had discordant MDF and morphologic results (P < 0.001), including six classified as M3 by morphology but were M1/M2 by MDF, and two were classified as M3 by MDF but were M1/M2 by morphology. Of 24 day-14 bone marrow specimens, five (20.5%) were discordant (P < 0.001), including two classified as M3 by morphology but were M1/M2 by MDF, and three were classified as M3 by MDF but were M1/M2 by morphology. Reevaluation of the blinded day-7 and day-14 marrow slides yielded discordance between repeated pathology readings of 11% (P < 0.001) and 6% (P = 0.04), respectively. CONCLUSION: Our data show significant discordance between the morphologic and MDF evaluation of early marrow response. Early response to therapy is a significant prognostic indicator in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and is used to alter subsequent treatment; thus, precise assessment of response is important. A larger comparison of MDF with morphology for the evaluation of early response, including correlation with clinical outcome, is warranted.","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington 98109-1024, USA. smeshinc@fhcrc.org']",['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['J Pediatr Hematol Oncol 2002 Feb;24(2):165'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-six children (ages 18 mo to 15 y) receiving intrathecal chemotherapy with either methotrexate or the combination of methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and Ara-C for the prophylactic treatment of central nervous system leukemia were randomly assigned to receive an infusion of normal saline or ondansetron at one of two doses (0.15 or 0.45 mg/kg) 30 minutes before undergoing the procedure. One hundred forty-six infusions were administered (51 placebo, 47 at the lower ondansetron dose, and 48 at the higher dose). Each patient acted as his or her own control, and each patient was studied at least three times. RESULTS: Twenty-three of 26 patients (88.5%) had postprocedural vomiting on at least one occasion. At least one episode of vomiting occurred during the 24 hours after the procedure in fifty-two of the procedures (35.6%). The incidence of vomiting was significantly greater after infusion of placebo than after either low-dose or high-dose ondansetron. The likelihood of severe vomiting was even more significantly reduced by the preadministration of ondansetron. Almost all of the intrathecal treatments associated with severe vomiting occurred after the infusion of placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Vomiting induced by intrathecal chemotherapy can be greatly reduced by the intravenous administration of ondansetron before the procedure, and severe vomiting can be virtually eliminated.","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Medical Center, State University of New York at Stony Brook, 11794-8111, USA. rparker@mail.som.sunysb.edu""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study reported here identified these risk factors among case patients and control patients in Orange County, California, from 1984 to 1993 and determined the significance of the risk factors in the study population. A case-control study was performed for 604 cases of AML and 643 cases of MM; there were 7,112 control subjects who had colon cancer. The model included the variables smoking history, occupational history, and residence in a census tract with a petroleum refinery waste dump. A geographic information system (GIS) analysis also was performed to correlate the incidence of AML and MM with proximity to the six dump sites that received large amounts of petroleum refinery waste. Current smokers were found to be at an increased risk of AML with an odds ratio of 2.0. Laborer/equipment cleaners and transportation workers/movers were at risk of AML with odds ratios of 3.5 and 2.4, respectively. Construction/resource extraction workers were at risk of MM with an odds ratio of 2.8. GIS analysis determined that the risk for MM was 1.6 cases per mile for 10 or more years of residence near a large chemical dump. The authors were able to identify census tracts with a high incidence of AML and MM, and to perform distance analysis using a statistical measure of spatial randomness. The case-control study identified occupational and lifestyle risk factors for AML and MM that were not apparent from census-tract-level data.","['Epidemiology Division, Department of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, 224 Irvine Hall, Irvine, CA 92697-7550, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to CML, BCR-ABL transcripts can be found in a minority of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias and very rarely in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Elucidating the molecular mechanisms and downstream pathways of BCR-ABL has led to the design of several novel therapeutic approaches.

We report the cloning and characterization of a full-length IE1 transcript and protein (IE1B) from human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) variant B. The IE1B transcript consists of five exons (3720 nucleotides), three of which are coding for the IE1 protein. The 1078-amino acid-long IE1B protein is 62% identical and 75% similar to the 941-amino acid IE1 from HHV-6 variant A. IE1B protein can be detected at 4 h post-infection (P.I.), and it is distributed as small intranuclear structures. The maximal number of IE1 bodies ( approximately 10-12/nucleus) is detected at 12 h P.I. after which the IE1 bodies condense into 1-3 larger entities by 24-48 h P.I. During infection the IE1B protein is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. IE1B undergoes further post-translational modification with its conjugation to the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO-1) peptide. IE1B colocalizes with SUMO-1 and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies during infection as well as in transfection experiments. Finally, IE1 from variant B is a weaker transactivator than IE1 from variant A, when assayed using heterologous promoters. Overall, the characterization of the HHV-6 IE1B protein presented highlights the similarity and divergence between IE1 from both variants and provides useful information pertaining to the early phase of infection.","[""Laboratory of Virology, Laboratory of Viral Immunology, Rheumatology and Immunology Research Center, Centre Hospitalier de l'Universite Laval Research Center and Faculty of Medicine, Laval University, Sainte-Foy, Quebec G1V 4G2, Canada.""]",,,,,,,,20020318,,,['GENBANK/AY037932'],,,,,,,

The ear gene product is present in all early embryonic cells, but becomes restricted to specific tissues in late embryogenesis. We mapped the ear gene to cytological region 88E11-13, near easter, and showed that it is deleted by Df(3R)ea(5022rx1), a small, cytologically invisible deletion. Annotation of the completed Drosophila genome sequence suggests that this region might contain as many as 26 genes, most of which, including ear, are not represented by mutant alleles. We carried out a large-scale noncomplementation screen using Df(3R)ea(5022rx1) and chemical (EMS) mutagenesis from which we identified seven novel multi-allele recessive lethal complementation groups in this region. An overlapping deficiency, Df(3R)Po(4), allowed us to map several of these groups to either the proximal or the distal regions of Df(3R)ea(5022rx1). One of these complementation groups likely corresponds to the ear gene as judged by map location, terminal phenotype, and reduction of EAR protein levels.","['Department of Biology, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244-1270, USA.']",,,,,,,PMC1462017,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with SDS are at a high risk for development of bone marrow failure, myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute leukemia. The p53 gene plays a major role in cell-cycle regulation, particularly in the presence of a genetic alteration in DNA, a critical step for the initiation of leukemogenesis. p53 gene up-regulation and p53 protein overexpression may occur as a cellular reaction to significant DNA damage. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and refractory anemia patients have close similarities in the prevalence of acute leukemia and in cell-cycle changes in bone marrow cells. This similarity was further investigated for p53 protein overexpression using archived tissue from patients with hematologic diseases having various leukemic propensities, including SDS and refractory anemia. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining for p53 protein overexpression was performed on bone marrow biopsies from 9 patients with SDS. These specimens were compared with biopsies from 71 patients with acquired hematologic disorders with variable risk levels for leukemia, including acquired aplastic anemia (n = 14), refractory anemia (n = 46), and various acquired cytopenias (n = 11), as well as 37 control subjects. RESULTS: p53 protein overexpression was identified only in patients with SDS and in patients with refractory anemia; these groups exhibited comparable prevalences of 78% and 72%, respectively. None of the patients with acquired aplastic anemia, acquired cytopenias, or in the control group showed overexpression of p53 protein. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of p53 protein overexpression in SDS is significantly different from that in acquired aplastic anemia and acquired cytopenias, but it is similar to the prevalence in refractory anemia. We speculate that p53 protein overexpression in this bone marrow failure syndrome may represent an early indicator of significant DNA genetic alteration, which is a crucial step in the process of leukemogenesis.","['Department of Pathology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-0743, USA. melgheta@utmb.edu']",,['Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2002 Oct;126(10):1157-8; author reply 1158.

The purpose of the current study was to determine whether a delay in the administration of filgrastim from Day 5 to Day 10 during chemotherapy with a hyper-CVAD (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and dexamethasone) regimen resulted in a longer time to neutrophil or platelet count recovery or increased the incidence of infection. METHODS: One hundred ninety-nine patients who achieved complete disease remission after a single course of induction chemotherapy were considered for evaluation. Induction chemotherapy was with hyper-CVAD (fractionated cyclophosphamide, 300 mg/m2, twice daily for Days 1-3; doxorubicin, 50 g/m2, on Day 4; vincristine, 2 mg, on Days 4 and 11; and dexamethasone, 40 mg, on Days 1-4 and Days 11-14), which also was given in odd-numbered consolidation Courses 3, 5, and 7. Even-numbered courses (Courses 2, 4, 6, and 8) were comprised of methotrexate, 200 mg/m2, over 2 hours followed by 800 mg/m2 over 24 hours on Day 1; cytarabine, 3 g/m2, every 12 hours for 4 doses over 2 days (Days 2 and 3); and intravenous methylprednisolone, 50 mg, twice daily on Days 1-3 (MTX/ara-C regimen). Two sequential treatment groups were assessable based on timing of the filgrastim administration; 151 patients received filgrastim starting on Day 5 (D5) of induction chemotherapy and 48 patients received filgrastim starting on Day 10 (D10). RESULTS: Time to neutrophil recovery was shorter for the D5 group than for the D10 group during induction chemotherapy (18 days vs. 19 days; P = 0.04) and hyper-CVAD Courses 3 and 5 (12 days vs. 15 days during Course 3, P < 0.001; and 13 days vs. 16 days during Course 5, P = 0.002). There was no apparent significant difference between the two groups with regard to time to neutrophil recovery during the MTX/ara-C courses or the last hyper-CVAD course. Delay in the administration of filgrastim did not appear to result in an increase in time to platelet count recovery or in the incidence of infection; however, there was an increased incidence of mucositis during induction chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: For a hyper-CVAD and MTX/ara-C regimen, the results of the current study have shown that the administration of filgrastim can be delayed until Day 10 without increasing the risk of treatment-related morbidity during consolidation chemotherapy. During induction chemotherapy, delay in the administration of filgrastim may result in a slight increase in the time to neutrophil count recovery and risk of mucositis, but there is no apparent associated increase in the risk of infection.","['Department of General Internal Medicine, The University of Texas M.

A nested case-control study was undertaken to explore if parity and age at first birth affect the risk of developing these malignancies. METHODS: In a nationwide cohort defined by a population-based Fertility Register, we identified 356 women with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 819 with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), and 179 with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). For each case, five age-matched controls were selected. Odds ratios were estimated by conditional logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: There was some evidence of weak negative associations between parity and age at first birth for CML. Compared to nulliparous women there was a tendency of a temporal risk reduction of CML for the first 10 years following a delivery. The risk of ANLL was slightly lower in parous compared to nulliparous women. Neither parity nor age at first birth was related to the risk of ALL. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that if pregnancy-related hormonal or immunological factors have an effect on the development of leukemia, it is minor and confined to the myeloid types, chiefly CML. Our study gives some support for treating the leukemias as separate entities based on both cell lineage and form in future etiologic studies.","['Department of Medical Epidemiology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. karin.ekstrom@mep.ki.se']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A remaining problem is a lack of basic knowledge about the immunological requirements for protection against retroviruses. Infection of macaque monkeys with simian immunodeficiency virus is still the best model for HIV vaccine research. However, in this model it remains difficult to determine protective immunological mechanisms because of limited numbers of experimental animals and their genetic heterogeneity. Thus, fundamental concepts in retroviral immunology have to be defined in other ways such as mouse models. This minireview summarizes new findings on cellular and molecular mechanisms in protection of mice against Friend murine retrovirus infection. It has been shown that complex immune responses, including B and T cell responses, are required for efficient protection in this model. Multiple viral antigens are necessary to elicit such broad immune reactivity. Efficacious vaccines must protect not only against acute disease, but also against the establishment of persistent infections or the host is at serious risk of virus reactivation. The minireview closes with a discussion on the relevance of findings from the mouse model on the design of a protective vaccine against HIV.","['Institut fuer Virologie der Universitaet Wuerzburg, Germany. ulf.dittmer@mail.uni-wuerzburg.de']",,,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overall estimated 1-year survival rate in all cats was 48.7%, and the 2-year survival rate was 39.9%, with a median survival of 266 days. The median survival time and the 1-year survival rate for mediastinal lymphoma were 262 days and 49.4%. respectively. Siamese cats had a more favorable prognosis for survival and remission than other breeds. Response to therapy in this study was shown to be a significant prognostic indicator. CR is necessary for long-term survival. Cats that did not achieve CR had little chance of survival for longer than I year. Young Siamese cats in this study had a greater tendency to develop mediastinal malignant lymphoma at a young age, and all were FeLV negative. In comparison with results reported in other studies with different combination chemotherapy protocols, these are among the highest percentages of remission and the longest survival rates for cats with malignant lymphoma.","['Department of Clinical Sciences of Companion Animals, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University, The Netherlands. e.teske@vet.uu.nl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies have been carried out on young adult mice exposed to daily levels of 60Co gamma irradiation ranging from 0.3 to over 30 R day-1. The lowest level is comparable with the occupational maximum permissible dose for the atomic energy industry. There is little evidence of life shortening at that level, but as exposure increases, there is an exponential decline in life expectancy. The life-shortening coefficient is approximately 4 days/100 R accumulated or 4% R-1 day-1. When life-shortening is < or = 15%, all of the increased mortality can be attributed to radiation-induced increases in death rates from neoplastic diseases, including various forms of leukemia and pulmonary tumors. Age-specific death rates for mice dying of all other causes remain the same as the controls throughout life, at the lowest doses. A non-neoplastic disease component of excess mortality rate emerges at 6 R day-1 and above. The risk of death from all and specific causes following single exposures compared with protracted lifetime irradiation shows a clear effect of protraction. Leukemia death rates are reduced by a factor of 5 or more at all daily exposure levels below 20-30 R day-1. Risks for other causes of death are also reduced, but to a variable degree.","['Division of Biological and Medical Research, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, Ill., USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NASA: 00027448'],,,

Diagnosis is established on the basis of clinical criteria. Molecular genetic testing is feasible, but the large size of the gene and wide range of pathogenic mutations have so far impeded the development of a clinical diagnostic test. Insights into pathogenesis have followed from identification of the NF1 gene and the development of animal models. The major function of the gene product appears to be regulation of the ras protein. Tumors are believed to arise by the loss of function of the NF1 protein, suggesting that NF1 behaves as a tumor suppressor gene. Heterozygous effects on some cell types are also likely, however. The role of ras in the pathogenesis of tumors in NF1 has suggested an approach to treatment using ras inhibitors, some of which are likely to begin in clinical trials in NF1 patients in the near future.","['Partners Center for Human Genetics, Harvard Medical School, 77 Avenue Louis Pasteur, Suite 642, Boston, MA 02115, USA. bkorf@partners.org']",,,,,53,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine models of infection have recently been established, with disease manifestations similar to those observed in human subjects. Previous studies have suggested that this organism is capable of producing activation of a wide range of immunologic cell types. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether M pneumoniae can induce mast cell activation in the rodent mast cell line RBL-2H3. RESULTS: After 4 hours of coculture, morphologic changes indicative of activation were observed by means of electron microscopy, and M pneumoniae was identified, by means of immunoelectron microscopy, adhering to mast cell membranes. Coculture of rat basophilic leukemia cells with viable M pneumoniae for 4 hours resulted in net release of beta-hexosaminidase and serotonin into the supernatant. Live, but not heat-killed, organisms induced the release of IL-4 protein into the culture supernatant, with a peak at 4 hours. During coculture with M pneumoniae, production of mRNA for IL-4, IL-6, and TNF-alpha was upregulated after 2 hours and had returned to near baseline by 24 hours after infection. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that viable M pneumoniae induces activation of mast cells with release of granule contents, as well as cytokine production.","['Division of Developmental and Clinical Immunology, Department of Pediatrics and Microbiology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294-3300, USA.']",['HL61000/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test this hypothesis, we have experimentally and computationally compared the abilities of two gp130-signaling cytokines (LIF and Hyper-interleukin-6 [HIL-6]) to sustain ES cell self-renewal. Quantitative measurements of ES cell phenotypic markers (stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 and E-cadherin), functional assays (alkaline phosphatase activity and embryoid body formation efficiency), and transcription factor (Oct-4) expression over a range of LIF and HIL-6 concentrations demonstrated a superior ability of LIF to maintain ES cell pluripotentiality at higher concentrations (> or =500 pM). Additionally, we observed distinct qualitative differences in the ES cell self-renewal dose response profiles between the two cytokines. A computational model permitted calculation of the number of signaling complexes as a function of receptor expression, ligand concentration, and ligand/receptor-binding properties, generating predictions for the degree of self-renewal as a function of cytokine concentration by comparison of these calculated complex numbers to experimentally determined threshold cytokine concentrations. Model predictions, consistent with experimental data, indicated that differences in the potencies of these two cytokines were based primarily on differences in receptor-binding stoichiometries and properties. These results support a ligand/receptor signaling threshold model of ES cell fate modulation through appropriate types and levels of cytokine stimulation. Insights from these results may be more generally applicable to tissue-specific stem cells and could aid in the development of stem cell-based technologies.","['Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, Roseburgh Building, University of Toronto, 4 Taddle Creek Road, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 3G9, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the effect of CEP on three groups of human mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in relation to CEP-induced apoptosis. CEP, at the concentration required for and at the time of induction of apoptosis, activated MAPKs p38 in both Jurkat and K562 cells and activated extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) only in K562 cells. However, CEP treatment did not trigger c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinases (JNKs) activation. CEP increased the expression and phosphorylation levels of c-Jun and ATF-2 transcription factors. zVAD-fmk, a general caspase inhibitor, did not inhibit CEP-triggered p38 activation in Jurkat and K562 cells or ERK activation in K562 cells. Unexpectedly, pretreatment with a specific p38 inhibitor, SB203580, promoted CEP-induced apoptosis and caspase activation in Jurkat and K562 cells, whereas pretreatment with an MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 inhibited CEP-induced apoptosis and caspase activation in K562 cells. A selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, herbimycin A, which completely inhibited CEP-triggered ERKs activation, clearly promoted CEP-induced c-Jun expression and phosphorylation.

It is known that this is probably due to deprivation of some target-derived neurotrophic factors, mainly of nerve growth factor though positive effect of other factors, for example that of leukemia inhibitory factor on galanin has also been demonstrated. In this study, the effects of leukemia inhibitory factor and nerve growth factor on calcitonin gene related peptide expression in cultured dorsal root ganglion explants and in their outgrowing axons were examined. Lumbar dorsal root ganglia with short pieces of peripheral nerves were removed from adult mice and explanted into collagen gels. They were covered with RPMI 1640 culture medium and left in an incubator for 2 days after which they were fixed. These whole mount preparations with outgrowing axons were stained with an antibody against calcitonin gene related peptide. Following microscopic examination and imaging, sections were cut from the cultured ganglia as well as from some freshly taken normal ones and they were also stained to determine calcitonin gene related peptide immunoreactivity in the primary sensory neurons. The results demonstrated that besides the positive effect of nerve growth factor on the expression of this peptide in outgrowing axons, leukemia inhibitory factor also supported the expression of calcitonin gene related peptide in the primary sensory neurons of adult mouse lumbar dorsal root ganglia and in their outgrowing axons in vitro. When the time course of changes in calcitonin gene related peptide expression in dorsal root ganglia and the up-regulation of leukemia inhibitory factor at the site of a peripheral nerve injury in vivo are considered together, this novel finding may lead to new explanations for the changes in neuropeptide expression following axotomy.","['Department of Physiology, Neuroscience Research Unit, Medical School, Yuzuncu Yil University, Van, Turkey. drgurkan@yyu.edu.tr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: There were 29 patients with a cumulative anthracycline (ATC) dose of 75-600 mg/m2. None of them had congestive heart failure. Patients underwent SAE just before (detection of chronic cardiotoxicity) and just after (detection of acute cardiotoxicity) ATC therapy. Echocardiography and Holter electrocardiography were performed at the same time. The rates of abnormal SAE, echocardiography, and electrocardiogram findings were calculated and compared for every 100 mg/m2 of ATC. RESULTS: The SAE showed a significantly higher detection rate for acute cardiotoxicity was at a cumulative ATC dose of less than 400 mg/m2 when compared with other methods (P < 0.05). The lowest dose at which acute cardiotoxicity was detected by SAE was 117.3 mg/m2. The detection of chronic cardiotoxicity by SAE was significantly higher at a cumulative ATC dose of 100-400 mg/m2 when compared with other methods (P < 0.05), and the lowest value showing toxicity was 373.3 mg/m2. The lowest ATC dose causing chronic cardiotoxicity was significantly lower in patients less than 2-years-old (120.0 +/- 28.3 mg/m2) than in the other age groups (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Acute and chronic ATC cardiotoxicity were detected by SAE at lower cumulative doses compared with other methods. The technique of SAE was a potentially useful method for detection of cardiotoxicity among those investigated and it provides useful information on subclinical cardiac dysfunction in patients receiving ATC therapy.","['Department of Pediatrics, Nippon Medical School Hospital, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, Japan. d.fukumi@nms.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gingival enlargement in AL is either due to leukemic infiltration, or due to reactive hyperplasia. To differentiate between them a biopsy is required, but being highly contraindicated, biopsy has been substituted in this study by fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). METHOD: Gingival FNAC was performed on different sites in the upper and lower gingiva. Each site represents an interdental papilla, which was selected according to the clinical presentation, i.e., being enlarged or not. Seventy-two adult AL patients received a cytological and clinical examination in this study, and the cases were classified and categorized according to the French-American-British (FAB) criteria. RESULTS: Twenty-one cases were diagnosed as being infiltrated, 16 with gingival enlargement, 4 with no evidence of enlargement. In one case the infiltration affected the alveolar mucosa of an edentulous patient. In six cases the ginigva was enlarged without being infiltrated (reactive hyperplasia). Leukemic gingival enlargement was seen mostly in patients with acute myeloid leukemia, particularly M4 and M5 subtypes; however, two patients with acute mixed lineage leukemia (AMLL) were both affected with leukemic infiltration. CONCLUSION: FNAC was shown to be a simple, non-traumatic and useful diagnostic procedure for screening leukemic infiltration in gingival tissues in AL patients.","['Department of Oral Diagnosis, College of Dentistry, University of Baghdad, Iraq.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

O(6)-(n-Propanalyl)guanine (O(6)-PAG) and O(6)-(ethanalyl)guanine (O(6)-EAG) were synthesized for use as authentic standards in investigations of DNA alkylation by acrolein and chloroacetaldehyde, respectively. Preparation of the O-methyl oximes of these aldehydes aided in confirming the structural assignments of O(6)-PAG and O(6)-EAG. HPLC was used to study the stability of O(6)-PAG under a variety of conditions. The decomposition of O(6)-PAG was attributed to an alpha,beta-elimination reaction resulting in the formation of guanine and acrolein. In 0.1 M phosphate-DMSO (9:1), O(6)-PAG (1-10 mM) had a half-life of approximately 1 h (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C). In 0.05 M Tris-DMSO (9:1), the apparent half-life of O(6)-PAG (1-10 mM) was approximately 16 h (pH 7.4, 37 degrees C). The increased lifetime under the latter conditions was attributed to a reversible reaction between Tris and the aldehydic functionality of O(6)-PAG to give a more stable oxazolidine. Under conditions similar to those that would be used for hydrolysis of DNA [0.1 M HCl-DMSO (98:2), pH 1.3, 70 degrees C, 30 min], there was an estimated 10-35% loss of O(6)-PAG. Under the same conditions, O(6)-EAG had apparent half-lives of 6.6 h (phosphate-DMSO) and 2.5 days (Tris-DMSO) and the estimated loss at pH 1.3 over 30 min (70 degrees C) was 15-20%. Ab initio quantum chemical calculations were used to understand the energy factors that underlie the occurrence of O- versus N-alkylations as well as possible, subsequent intramolecular cyclizations. Simulations of the free energies of reactions between acrolein and guanine indicated that N-alkylation was favored over O(6)()-alkylation and that cyclizations to tautomers were most favorable if they involved the N-1 or NH(2) positions.","['Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']","['CA16783/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA52857/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68438/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA692460/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA71627/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When expression of MEnT protein was induced with ZnCl2, the stable transfectants differentiated with kinetics that were similar to wild type C19 MEL cells treated with HMBA, including induction of alpha-globin mRNA expression, assembly of hemoglobin and growth arrest. Expression of endogenous c-myb and c-myc was also decreased in response to MEnT. Expression of mad-1 mRNA was rapidly increased in response to expression of MEnT resulting in a shift from predominantly c-Myc/Max complexes to predominantly Mad/Max containing complexes.

Recently, the hMre11/Rad50/NBS1 repair complex, involved in Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) repair, was found to colocalize within PML NBs, suggesting a role for these nuclear sub-domains in the DNA repair signalling pathway. We report here that in normal human fibroblasts, after ionizing radiation (IR), the PML NBs are modified and recognize sites of DNA breaks (ssDNA breaks and DSBs). Eight to 12 h after radiation PML NBs associate with hMre11 Ionizing Radiation-Induced Foci (IRIF), and subsequently with p53 within discrete foci. The PML, hMre11 and p53 colocalizing structures mark sites of DSBs as identified by immunolocalization with anti phosphorylated histone gamma-H2AX. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ionizing radiation induces the stable association of p53 with hMre11 and PML. These results suggest that the PML NBs are involved in the recognition and/or processing of DNA breaks and possibly in the recruitment of proteins (p53 and hMre11) required for both checkpoint and DNA-repair responses.","['Department of Experimental Oncology, European Institute of Oncology, Via Ripamonti 435, 20141 Milan, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other work from our laboratory has demonstrated that E2F1 can directly bind and represss the Mcl-1 promoter - contributing to E2F1-mediated apoptosis. Here we show that while E2F1 can repress the Mcl-1 promoter, other members of the E2F family (such as E2F4) cannot. Characterization of the Mcl-1 promoter demonstrates that the -143/+10 region is critical for E2F1-mediated downregulation. We demonstrate that the ability of E2F1 to repress the Mcl-1 promoter correlates with its ability to bind within the required -143/+10 region of this promoter. In contrast, E2F4 is unable to bind to the -143/+10 region of the Mcl-1 promoter. We propose that E2F4 is unable to repress the Mcl-1 promoter primarily as a result of insufficient binding to the essential regulatory region. This is the first evidence of DNA binding specificity among E2F family members that results in differential regulation of a naturally occurring promoter.","['Program in Molecular Oncology, H Lee Moffitt Comprehensive Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, Florida, FL 33612, USA.']",['CA78214/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The products are quantified in the hybridisation protection assay (HPA) using acridinium ester-labelled DNA probes and chemiluminescence. The method is a single tube procedure which uses small amounts of RNA (<500 ng/triplicate analysis), is technically simple (requiring just two waterbaths and a luminometer), rapid (total assay time <4 h) and sensitive (capable of detecting one BCR-ABL-positive K562 cell in the presence of 10(4)-10(5) BCR-ABL-negative cells). BCR-ABL signals from patient RNA samples were quantified relative to known amounts of K562 RNA and normalised to levels of ABL. BCR-ABL/ABL ratios ranged from 0.15 to 1.59 (median 0.65) in RNA from diagnostic blood or bone marrow of 18 CML patients and were < or =0.0001 in 20 normal controls. Sequential samples analysed from six CML patients post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation who relapsed and received donor lymphocyte infusions showed BCR-ABL/ABL ratios which reflected patient status or treatment. A BCR-ABL/ABL ratio of 0.01 served as a useful arbitrary indicator value, with results above and below this value generally correlating with relapse or remission, respectively.","['Department of Haematology, University College London, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate dCK, dGK and 5'-NT gene expressions in cell lines and in samples from patients with leukemia, we have established a real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) method. From the available dCK, dGK and 5'-NT cDNA sequences we designed specific primers and fluorogenic probes for the respective genes. The mRNA of dCK, dGK and 5'-NT was also measured by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the enzyme activities by a radioactive substrate-based technique and Western blot was used to measure the amount of dCK and dGK protein. A MOLT-4 wild-type and its 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosylguanine (Ara-G)-resistant subline was used for the methods comparisons and the RQ-PCR assay was used in 35 samples from pediatric patients with ALL and AML. The results from RQ-PCR for the cell lines were in agreement with the semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The mRNA expression for dCK, dGK and 5'-NT (expressed as the ratio of the respective gene and the reference gene) in pediatric ALL and AML patients showed a large interindividual variability from 0.06 to 2.34, non-detectable to 0.06 and 0.04 to 0.30, respectively. These results show that the quantitative evaluation by RQ-PCR is a valuable tool in the determination of dCK, dGK and 5'-NT mRNA levels in cell lines and in clinical samples which were expressed at various levels. This rapid, convenient and specific method is suitable for further studies of these genes in clinical samples.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients with WM had bone marrow biopsies consistent with the diagnosis, an IgM M-protein in the serum, and subsequently required chemotherapy. Seven of 11 patients with WM had an M-protein >3 g/dl and five patients had bone surveys performed that were negative for osteolytic disease. Two patients were diagnosed with IgM MM because of the presence of significant osteolytic disease on a metastatic bone survey. ISH for kappa, lambda, and IL-1beta expression was performed on bone marrow aspirates from each of the 13 patients. None of the neoplastic cells from the 11 patients with WM showed detectable IL-1beta expression by ISH.

Eight weeks after transplantation and with a continuous drug treatment for the last 4 weeks, the leukemic cell mass decreased from almost 90% of all bone marrow cells to about 15 and 45% with ES, to about 35 and 55% with PI-88, and to about 10 and 25% with ES + PI-88 in the leukemic mice and rats, respectively. The numbers of normal human bone marrow cells transplanted into mice were unchanged by the treatments. The microvessel density in leukemic animals given ES or PI-88 was 10-50% of that in untreated animals. Notably, simultaneous treatment with ES and PI-88 led to a reduction of about 95% in JMML mice and 85% in BNML rats. In vitro proliferation of either JMML or BNML cells was not significantly altered by either drug, demonstrating the selectivity of ES and PI-88 as angiogenic inhibitors.

Ninety-five of these AML patients (13 with fusion gene transcripts) were also investigated for the presence of IGH, IGK, TCRG and TCRD rearrangements by Southern blot and/or PCR heteroduplex analysis and sequencing. In nine out of 95 patients (9.5%), such rearrangements were found. Combined data revealed that only one patient with a fusion gene transcript had a coexistent Ig/TCR rearrangement. The nine AML patients with Ig/TCR rearrangements, as well as five additional AML patients from a previous study were investigated in more detail, revealing that Ig/TCR rearrangements in AML are immature and unusual. The presence of Ig/TCR rearrangements in AML did not correlate with RAG gene expression levels as determined by real-time quantitative PCR.

However, a skewed XCIP exists in hematopoietic cells in approximately 40% of healthy elderly females, interfering with interpretation of clonality assays. In hematopoiesis, an active stem cell pool is assumed to be present within a larger population of inactive stem cells, with a continuous exchange of cells between the two compartments. The assumption that the active stem cell pool size decreases with age may explain the phenomenon of acquired skewing occurring by chance and predicts the XCIP of this population to fluctuate. This fluctuation should be reflected in the XCIP of peripheral granulocytes. We examined the XCIP for fluctuations in time in peripheral granulocytes, monocytes and T cells of young, middle-aged and elderly healthy females. We used an optimized HUMARA PCR assay that eliminates unbalanced DNA amplification. We found no fluctuations in XCIP in any age group in up to 18 months follow-up.

Eight to 12 months after transplantation of human CD34+CD38- cells from umbilical cord blood, cultured on AFT024 vs human stroma for 2-3 weeks, the murine bone marrow was harvested and analyzed for the presence of human myeloid and lymphoid cells. The mean percent engraftment of total human hematopoietic cells in the murine marrow was significantly higher after co-cultivation on AFT024 than on human stroma. Human myeloid and lymphoid lineage cells were detected in all mice. However, engraftment of myeloid lineage cells (CD33+), B lymphoid (CD19+), and T lymphoid cells (CD4+and CD8+) were significantly higher after co-cultivation of the human cells on AFT024 than on human stroma, prior to transplantation. Interestingly, the length of time in culture did not significantly affect the engraftment of the myeloid and T lymphoid lineage progenitors, but the percentage of B lymphoid lineage engraftment decreased significantly between 2 and 3 weeks of co-cultivation on both types of stroma. Cells with a primitive phenotype (CD45+/CD34-/CD38- and CD45+/CD34-/lin-) and cells with the capacity to generate secondary human CFU after recovery from the bnx bone marrow were maintained at significantly higher levels during culture on AFT024 stroma than on human stroma. The current studies demonstrate that the AFT024 murine stromal cell line supports the ex vivo survival and maintenance of human hematopoietic progenitors that are capable of long-term multilineage reconstitution for 2-3 weeks ex vivo, to levels superior to those that can be obtained using human stromal cells.","['Division of Research Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']","['R01HL58739/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK053041/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', '2-P50-HL54850/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK53041/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK061848/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK053041-04/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK061848-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01DK54567/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The programmed cell death pathway of the cells from patient group A was caspase-3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-dependent, involved a reduction of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential DeltaPsi and a down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Mcl-1 and iNOS proteins. Early activation-associated molecules such as CD25 and CD69 were expressed at higher levels than in controls after 6 h of culture with anti-CD5 MoAb. The expression of CD5 and of CD72, the ligand for CD5, were significantly lower in group A compared with group B. Anti-CD20 MoAb had similar activity with anti-CD5 MoAb and the combination of the two MoAbs seemed to be additive. In this study, it is suggested that the cells from some B-CLL patients can be induced into programmed cell death by CD5 hypercross-linking with anti-CD5 MoAbs.","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Nagano, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that costimulation with CpG-ODN and IL-2 can overcome this proliferative defect. Cyclin D3 is the principal D-type cyclin which mediates G1 progression in normal B cells, but in B-CLL cells both cyclin D2 and cyclin D3, were strongly upregulated upon stimulation. Both cyclins were associated with cdk4 but not with cdk6, which is the catalytic partner of D-type cyclins in normal B cells. Moreover, immune complexes consisting of cyclin D2 and cdk4 or cyclin D3 and cdk4 were both functional and phosphorylated the RB protein in vitro. The cell cycle inhibitor p27 plays a pivotal role in cell cycle progression of B lymphocytes and has been shown to be overexpressed in B-CLL cells. P27 was rapidly downregulated in B-CLL cells even when stimulated with a non-CpG-ODN or IL-2 alone, while only moderate regulation could be observed in normal B cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that regulation of early cell cycle progression differs between B-CLL cells and normal B cells. These findings do not only contribute to the understanding of B-CLL pathophysiology, but might ultimately lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets.","['Third Department of Medicine, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CFU-GM assays demonstrated that at 50% of the maximum response, the relative potency of leridistim was 12-fold greater than the combination of rhG-CSF and rhIL-3 and 44-fold more potent than rhG-CSF alone. In multi-lineage CFU assays, a combination of erythropoietin (rhEPO) and leridistim resulted in greater numbers of BFU-E, CFU-GEMM and CFU-Mk than rhEPO alone.

These results demonstrate that leridistim is a more potent stimulator of hematopoietic proliferation and differentiation than the single receptor agonists (rhG-CSF and SC-65303) either alone or combined.

Eight new compounds exhibit stronger inhibitory activity on CDK1 and CDK2 and on cell proliferation than olomoucine. Some active compounds showed low inhibition of proliferation of normal myeloid growth. Improvement of inhibitory activity of known compounds with a C6-benzylamino group was brought about by substitution with one hydroxyl. Also, new C2 substituents associated with inhibitory activity on CDK and on cell proliferation are described. There was a significant correlation between effect on CDK and antiproliferative effect on the KG1 and Molt3 cell lines and on primary human lymphocytes, strongly suggesting that at least part of the antiproliferative effect of cytokinin analogues was due to inhibition of CDK activity. Cytokinin analogues induced apoptosis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and changes in cell cycle distribution. The antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of plant cytokinin analogues suggest that they are a new class of cytostatic agents and that they may find an application in the chemotherapy of cancer.","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, University of Antwerp, Antwerp University Hospital, Edegem, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, remarkable difference was not observed among LTRs in other types of human liver tumor cell lines. Essentially the same results were obtained by infecting these cells with a series of retroviral vectors. Repression of transgene expression was observed by the leader sequences from Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV), but not from mouse embryonic stem cell virus (MESV). Strengths of the promoters were further compared in murine hepatocytes in vivo. Although the proportions of genomic integration were almost the same, higher gene expression was observed by the FMEV-type vector, which contained the SFFVp LTR and the MESV leader, in comparison with that by the MoMLV-based vector.

We identified seven putative transcriptional units as well as six pseudogenes. Four of these candidate genes were already known: ETV6, encoding an ets-like transcription factor, LRP6, a member of the LDL receptor gene family, BCL-G, a recently identified pro-apoptotic gene and MKP-7, encoding a new member of the dual-specificity phosphatase family. The products encoded by the three new genes identified in this study, LOH1CR12, LOH2CR12 and LOH3CR12, have no clear homology to known proteins.

Four years after BMT, acute hepatitis occurred with a detectable level of HBV-DNA. Lamivudine rapidly reduced transaminase and bilirubin levels, and serum HBV-DNA decreased to negative. Retrospective analysis revealed that there had been a gradual decrease in serum HBsAb titers after BMT.

The patients received 121 D-incompatible pooled platelet transfusions. The mean +/- SD of RBC content was 4.17 +/- 1.74 mL. None of the 22 patients developed detectable anti-D after a median follow-up of 8 weeks (range, 1-37). CONCLUSION: The risk of D alloimmunization is low in patients with hematologic disease after D-incompatible platelet transfusions using platelet concentrates prepared by the buffy coat method.","['Center de Transfusio i Banc de Teixits, Hospital Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain. jcid@hjxxiii.scs.es']",,['Transfusion. 2002 Feb;42(2):136-8.

In human transplants, we show that donor-versus-recipient natural killer (NK)-cell alloreactivity could eliminate leukemia relapse and graft rejection and protect patients against GVHD. In mice, the pretransplant infusion of alloreactive NK cells obviated the need for high-intensity conditioning and reduced GVHD.

In Western countries, most cases of PT-LPD are B-cell-derived and Epstein-Barr virus-associated, in which alterations of c-myc, p53, and N-ras genes might play a role in disease progression. In Japan, PT-LPD of T- and NK/T-cell types are not uncommon in renal transplant patients. Mutations of p53 (exons 4 through 8), K-ras (exons 1 and 2), c-kit (exons 11 and 17), and beta-catenin genes (exon 3) in 12 cases of these diseases were analyzed by PCR single strand conformation polymorphism and then by direct sequencing. p53 gene mutations were detected in 5 of 5 cases of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, 3 (60%) of 5 cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, and 1 of 2 cases of NK/T cell lymphoma. Twenty-five percent of T and NK/T cell lymphomas showed K-ras mutations. Mutations of c-kit and beta-catenin genes were found in 33% of cases. Among a total of 42 substitution mutations, 40 were transitions with involvement of CpG sites in 20 to 30% of cases. Most cases had at least one mutation that changed an amino acid, which might have provided the selection pressure for expansion. These findings suggested that p53 gene mutations might play a central role in development of peripheral T-cell lymphoma including adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma in renal transplant patients.","['Department of Pathology, Osaka University Medical School, Suita, Osaka, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, paracrine or autocrine activation of this kinase has been postulated in numerous other malignancies, including small-cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer. In this review, we discuss the rationale for and development of KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitors for the treatment of human malignancies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies were identified through a MEDLINE search, review of bibliographies of relevant articles, and review of abstracts from national meetings. RESULTS: Four tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have activity against KIT are currently being used in clinical trials, and one, STI571, has recently been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for treating patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The role of KIT inhibitors in treating KIT-positive malignancies is reviewed. CONCLUSION: Targeted therapy to inhibit the kinase activity of KIT is a rational approach to the treatment of KIT-positive malignancies. Two key factors are the potency of a given inhibitor and the relative contribution of KIT activation to the growth of the tumor. Given our current understanding of KIT activity in human malignancy, the best candidate diseases for treatment with KIT inhibitors are GIST, mastocytosis, seminoma and possibly some cases of AML. Additionally, KIT inhibitors may play an adjunctive role in diseases such as small-cell lung cancer, in which KIT activation is secondary to ligand binding rather than an acquired mutation.","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Oregon Health and Science University, USA. heinrich@ohsu.edu']",,,,,133,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We compared cardiac outcomes in children receiving bolus or continuous infusion of doxorubicin. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a randomized study, children with high-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia received doxorubicin 360 mg/m(2) in 30-mg/m(2) doses every 3 weeks either by bolus (within 1 hour, n = 57) or by continuous infusion (over 48 hours, n = 64). Echocardiograms obtained before doxorubicin and at longest follow-up times were centrally remeasured, and z scores of cardiac measurements were calculated based on a healthy population. RESULTS: The groups were similar in age, sex distribution, doxorubicin dose, and duration of follow-up. Before treatment, measures of left ventricular (LV) structure and function did not reveal dilated cardiomyopathy and were not statistically different between bolus and continuous-infusion groups. The follow-up echocardiograms demonstrated no significant difference between the two groups for any cardiac characteristic, but both groups showed significant abnormalities of LV structure and function compared with normal and with baseline. For example, the mean LV fractional shortening fell by approximately two SD in both groups between the two echocardiograms. LV contractility was depressed in both groups (for bolus patients, median z score = -0.70 SD, P =.006; for continuous-infusion patients, median z score = -0.765, P =.005). Dilated cardiomyopathy and inadequate LV hypertrophy were noted in both groups. Clinical cardiac manifestations and event-free survival did not differ. CONCLUSION: Continuous doxorubicin infusion over 48 hours for childhood leukemia did not offer a cardioprotective advantage over bolus infusion. Both regimens were associated with progressive subclinical cardiotoxicity. Other cardioprotective strategies should be explored.","[""Division of Pediatric Cardiology, Strong Children's Hospital and University of Rochester Medical Center, University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, Rochester, NY 14642, USA. steve_lipschultz@urmc.rochester.edu""]","['CA 06516/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 55576/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 1,231 consecutive patients with either MGUS (n = 1,104) or SMM (n = 127) diagnosed from July 1975 to March 1998 were included in the study. Cumulative survival probability and cumulative probability of transformation into lymphoproliferative disease were calculated by means of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Univariate and multivariate Cox models were used to identify possible predictors of malignant evolution. RESULTS: Cumulative transformation probability at 10 and 15 years was 14% and 30%, respectively. At a median follow-up of 65 months (range, 12 to 239 months), 64 MGUS cases (5.8%) evolved to multiple myeloma (MM) (n = 43), extramedullary plasmacytoma (n = 1), primary amyloidosis (n = 1), Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (n = 12), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 6), and B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (n = 1). At a median follow-up of 72 months (range, 12 to 247 months), 25 SMMs (19.7%) evolved to overt MM. A lower evolution risk was observed in MGUS than in SMM (P <.0001). Greater than 5% marrow plasmacytosis, detectable Bence Jones proteinuria, polyclonal serum immunoglobulin reduction, and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were independent factors influencing MGUS transformation. SMM progression correlated with greater than 10% marrow plasma cells, detectable Bence Jones proteinuria, and immunoglobulin (Ig) A isotype. Neither concomitant diseases nor immunosuppression correlated with progression. CONCLUSION: Careful evaluation of marrow plasmacytosis, urinary paraprotein, background immunoglobulins, ESR, and paraprotein isotype might help identify at presentation patients with benign monoclonal gammopathies requiring stricter monitoring.","['Department of Hematology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Centre, Niguarda Ca Granda Hospital, Milan, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to other types of EMMT, cytogenetic characteristics of this rare entity are relatively unknown. This report describes a patient with EMMT who had evidence of superior vena cava syndrome and normal peripheral blood counts at diagnosis. The results from an initial biopsy specimen were consistent with a diagnosis of mediastinal large B cell lymphoma. A diagnosis of acute myeloid leukaemia was made three months after initial diagnosis by bone marrow examination. Review of the initial biopsy specimen showed strong positivity for myeloperoxidase, revealing that the patient had been initially misdiagnosed as having large B cell lymphoma. Cytogenetic studies revealed a near triploid and near tetraploid karyotype with structural abnormalities in 12 and three metaphases, respectively. Review of the literature showed that a near tetraploid or triploid karyotype is found in most of the reported cases of mediastinal EMMT. Thus, the presence of a near triploid/tetraploid karyotype and mediastinal EMMT may represent a specific subset of EMMT. The biological relevance of this observation is discussed.","['Department of Oncology, Section of Adult Hematology/BMT and Medical Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, PO Box 3354, MBC 64, Riyadh 11211, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",,,,,29,,PMC1769610,,,,,,,,,,,

We identified and characterized clusters of genes for a type IV secretion machinery in these two bacteria, and analyzed their gene expression in cell culture and mammalian hosts. Eight virB and virD genes were found in each bacterial genome, and all of the genes were transcribed in cell culture. Although the gene order and orientation were similar to those found in other bacteria, the eight virB and virD genes were clustered at two separate loci in each genome. Five of the genes (virB8, virB9, virB10, virB11, and virD4) were located downstream from a ribA gene. These five genes in both A. phagocytophila and E. chaffeensis were polycistronically transcribed and controlled through at least two tandem promoters located upstream of the virB8 gene in human leukemia cell lines. The virB9 gene of A. phagocytophila was transcriptionally active in peripheral blood leukocytes from human ehrlichiosis patients and experimentally infected animals. Three of the remaining genes (virB3, virB4, and virB6) of both A. phagocytophila and E. chaffeensis were arranged downstream from a sodB gene and cotranscribed with the sodB gene through one or more sodB promoters in human leukocytes. This suggests that transcription of the three virB genes in these two Anaplasma and Ehrlichia spp. is regulated by factors that influence the sodB gene expression. This unique regulation of gene expression for the type IV secretion system may be associated with intracellular survival and replication of Anaplasma and Ehrlichia spp. in granulocytes or monocytes.","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210-1093, USA.']","['R01 AI030010/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI047407/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI30010/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01AI47407/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC127848,,,,,,,,,,,

The interindividual variation in the activity of xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes that modify individual somatic mutation burden in the context of environmental exposure was shown to modify susceptibility to childhood ALL. Variable DNA repair capacity may further modulate induced DNA lesions. Similarly, differential capacity of ALL patients to process carcinogens and chemotherapeutic drugs could both modify an individual's risk of recurrent malignancy and response to therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We investigated the relationship between the risk of relapse in ALL patients and functional polymorphisms in genes encoding carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes, including CYP1A1, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, MPO, GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, NAT1, NAT2, NQO1, as well as DNA-repair enzymes hMLH1, hMSH3, XRCC1, XPF, and APE. Our study included 320 children with ALL, of which 68 relapsed or died because of this disease within 5 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Among children of the latter group, we found that carriers of CYP1A1*2A and NQO1*2 variants had worse disease prognosis according to Kaplan-Meier (P = 0.003) and Cox regression (P <or= 0.03) analyses. hMLH1 Ile219 contributed to the increased risk of relapse when combined with the CYP1A1*2A variant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that determining individual genotypes can become important in predicting disease outcome. Genotyping could also guide the therapeutic protocol.","[""Service d'Hematologie-Oncologie, Centre de Recherche, Hopital Sainte-Justine, Montreal, Quebec, H3T 1C5 Canada. maja.krajinovic@umontreal.ca""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The induction of acute GVHD requires host antigens to be presented to donor T cells by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Recent evidence has suggested that only host APCs can interact with donor T cells in the induction of GVHD. Because CD52 has been reported to be expressed on DCs, we reasoned that pretransplant Campath-1G might have a direct effect on circulating DCs in addition to any effects on donor T cells. Using direct immunostaining, we demonstrated expression of CD52 on DCs and that Campath-1G killed purified DCs in vitro. In vivo Campath also depleted DCs. Twenty-four hours after the first dose of Campath-1G, circulating DCs were reduced by a mean of 79% (range, 44%-96%). By day 0 after 5 doses of Campath-1G and chemoradiotherapy conditioning, DCs became undetectable in 7 of 9 cases, whereas in 6 of 7 patients receiving conditioning therapy without Campath-1G, host DCs were still detectable. The reconstitution of circulating DCs after transplantation was not affected by Campath-1G and in both groups DC1 (CD11c(+)) recovered more rapidly than DC2 (CD11c(-)). Analysis of chimerism confirmed that the DCs recovering after transplantation in patients receiving Campath-1G were of donor origin. We conclude that in vivo Campath-1G causes a rapid depletion of host circulating DCs and that this may, in part, explain the low incidence of acute GVHD. The reconstitution of donor DCs was not delayed, which may be important in preserving immune reconstitution.","['Division of Haematology, School of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, University of Nottingham, City Hospital, Hucknall Road, Nottingham NG5 1PB, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using our own and published sequences, we have investigated the frequency of potential N-glycosylation sites introduced into functional V(H) genes as a consequence of somatic mutation. FL cells were compared with normal memory B cells or plasma cells matched for similar levels of mutation. Strikingly, novel sites were detected in 55 of 70 (79%) patients with FL, compared to 7 of 75 (9%) in the normal B-cell population (P <.001). Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLCL) showed an intermediate frequency (13 of 32 [41%] patients).

In 3 of 3 random patients with FL, immunoglobulin was expressed as recombinant single-chain Fv in Pichia pastoris, and glycosylation was demonstrated. These findings indicate that N-glycosylation of the variable region may be common in FL and in a subset of DLCL. Most novel sites are located in the complementarity-determining regions. V(H) sequences of nonfunctional V(H) genes contained few sites, arguing for positive selection in FL. One possibility is that the added carbohydrate in the variable region contributes to interaction with elements in the germinal center environment.

We investigated the molecular pathways activated by VEGF on such leukemias, by performing a gene expression analysis of VEGF-treated and untreated HL-60 leukemic cells. One gene to increase after VEGF stimulation was heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). This was subsequently confirmed at the protein level, on primary leukemias and leukemic cell lines. VEGF increased the expression of Hsp90 by interacting with KDR and activating the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. In turn, Hsp90 modulated Bcl-2 expression, as shown by a complete blockage of VEGF-induced Bcl-2 expression and binding to Hsp90 by the Hsp90-specific inhibitor geldanamycin (GA). GA also blocked the VEGF-induced Hsp90 binding to APAF-1 on leukemic cells, a mechanism shown to inhibit apoptosis. Notably, VEGF blocked the proapoptotic effects of GA, correlating with its effects at the molecular level. Earlier, we showed that in some leukemias, a VEGF/KDR autocrine loop is essential for cell survival, whereas here we identified the molecular correlates for such an effect. We also demonstrate that the generation of a VEGF/VEGFR autocrine loop on VEGFR(+) cells such as ECs, also protected them from apoptosis. Infection of ECs with adenovirus-expressing VEGF resulted in elevated Hsp90 levels, increased Bcl-2 expression, and resistance to serum-free or GA-induced apoptosis. In summary, we demonstrate that Hsp90 mediates antiapoptotic and survival-promoting effects of VEGF, which may contribute to the survival advantage of VEGFR(+) cells such as subsets of leukemias.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, 1300 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']","['HL 61849/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 66592/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 67839/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 58707/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a significant proportion of diagnostic bone marrow karyotypes in AML is reported as normal by conventional cytogenetic analysis and it is suspected that these karyotypes may conceal the presence of diagnostically significant chromosome rearrangements. To address this question, we have developed a novel 12-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay for telomeric rearrangements (termed M-TEL), which uses an optimized set of chromosome-specific subtelomeric probes. We report here the application of the M-TEL assay to 69 AML cases with apparently normal karyotypes or an isolated trisomy. Of the 69 cases examined, 3 abnormalities were identified, all in the normal karyotype group. The first was a t(11;19)(q23;p13), identified in an infant with AML-M4. In 2 other young patients with AML (< 19 years), an apparently identical t(5;11)(q35;p15.5) was identified. Breakpoint mapping by FISH and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis confirmed that this was the same t(5;11) as previously identified in 3 children with AML, associated with del(5q) and resulting in the NUP98-NSD1 gene fusion. The t(5;11) was not detected by 24-color karyotyping using multiplex FISH (M-FISH), emphasizing the value of screening with subtelomeric probes for subtle translocations. This is the first report of the t(5;11)(q35;p15.5) in association with an apparently normal karyotype, and highlights this as a new, potentially clinically significant chromosome rearrangement in childhood AML.","['Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom.']",,['Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2003 Sep;145(2):183.

The molecule also performs as a receptor, modulating cell-cell interactions and delivering transmembrane signals, despite showing a structural ineptitude to the scope. CD38 ligation by agonistic monoclonal antibodies induced signals leading to activation of the lytic machinery of natural killer (NK) cells from adults; similar signals could not be reproduced in YT and NKL, 2 CD16(-) human NK-like lines. It was hypothesized that CD38 establishes a functional cooperation with professional signaling molecules of the NK cell surface. The present work answers the question about the molecule exploited by CD38 for signaling in NK cells, using as a model CD16(-) NK lines genetically corrected for CD16 expression. Our results indicate that a functional CD16 molecule is a necessary and sufficient requisite for CD38 to control an activation pathway, which includes calcium fluxes, tyrosine phosphorylation of ZAP70 and mitogen-activated protein kinase, secretion of interferon-gamma, and cytotoxic responses. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer and cocapping experiments also showed a surface proximity between CD38 and CD16. These results were confirmed by using the NKL cell line, in which CD16(+) and CD16(-) variants were obtained without genetic manipulation. Together, our findings show CD38 to be a unique receptor molecule that cannot signal by itself but whose receptor function is rescued by functional and physical associations with a professional signaling structure that varies according to lineage and environment. This molecule is CD16 in NK cells.","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Department of Genetics, Biology and Biochemistry, University of Torino Medical School, Via Santena 19, Turin, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We indirectly assessed stem/progenitor cell behavior in the first year after HSCT by examining changes in neutrophil telomere length, X-inactivation ratios, and cycling of marrow progenitors in 25 fully engrafted allogeneic HSCT recipients. Donors were sampled once and recipients at engraftment and 2 to 6 months and 12 months after HSCT. Telomere length was measured by an in-gel hybridization technique, X-inactivation ratios were measured by the human androgen receptor assay, and cell cycle status was determined by flow cytometric analysis of pyronin Y- and Hoechst 33342-stained CD34(+)CD90(+) and CD34(+)CD90(-) marrow cells. Compared with their donors, recipients' telomeres were shortened at engraftment (-424 base pairs [bp]; P <.0001), 6 months (-495 bp; P =.0001) after HSCT, and 12 months after HSCT (-565 bp; P <.0001). There was no consistent pattern of change in telomere length from 1 to 12 months after HSCT; marked, seemingly random, fluctuations were common. In 11 of 11 informative recipients, donor X-inactivation ratios were faithfully reproduced and maintained. The proportion of CD34(+)CD90(+) progenitors in S/G(2)/M was 4.3% in donors, 15.7% at 2 to 6 months (P <.0001) after HSCT, and 11.5% at 12 months after HSCT (P <.0001, versus donors; P =.04, versus 2-6 months). Cycling of CD34(+) CD90(-) progenitors was largely unchanged. We infer that (1) HSCT-induced accelerated telomere loss is temporary and unlikely to promote graft failure or clonal hematopoietic disorders and (2) the striking fluctuations in telomere length and variation in pattern of telomere loss reflect stochastic determination of HSC fate after HSCT.","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, the Hospital for Sick Children, University Health Network, University of Toronto, 610 University Avenue, Toronto, Ontario M5G 2M9, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finally, in 1 patient all Ig/TCR gene rearrangements were completely different between diagnosis and relapse, which is suggestive of secondary ALL. Based on the presented data, we propose stepwise strategies for selection of stable PCR targets for MRD monitoring, which should enable successful detection of relapse in most (95%) of childhood precursor-B-ALL.","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, 3000 DR Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed the course of 23 patients who were given gemtuzumab ozogamicin for AML that had relapsed after hematopoietic cell transplantation. Liver toxicity was assessed through physical examination, serum tests, histologic examination, and hepatic venous pressure measurements. Liver injury developed in 11 patients after gemtuzumab ozogamicin administration; it was manifested as weight gain, ascites, and jaundice in 7 patients. Seven patients died with persistent liver dysfunction and either multiorgan failure or sepsis at a median of 40 days after gemtuzumab ozogamicin infusion. Portal pressure measurements were elevated in 2 patients. Results of liver histologic examination in 5 patients showed sinusoidal injury with extensive sinusoidal fibrosis, centrilobular congestion, and hepatocyte necrosis. Six patients experienced AML remission that was sustained for at least 60 days after gemtuzumab ozogamicin infusion. In summary, hepatic sinusoidal liver injury developed after gemtuzumab ozogamicin infusion. Histology showed striking deposition of sinusoidal collagen, suggesting that gemtuzumab ozogamicin targets CD33(+) cells residing in hepatic sinusoids as the mechanism for its hepatic toxicity.","['Gastroenterology/Hepatology Section, Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']","['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,['Blood 2002 Jun 1;99(11):3915'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BT was defined as the presence of at least 30% blasts in blood or marrow or extramedullary blastic deposits. Immunophenotyping of blasts showed 57 myeloid, 19 lymphoid, and 2 biphenotypic. The median age of the patients was 39.1 years (range, 11.3-73.4 years), with 55 males and 23 females. The median survival for all patients after onset of BT was 8.2 months (95% CI, 6.4-10). Patients in lymphoid BT survived longer than those in myeloid BT (median, 11.2 months versus 6.9 months, P =.052). Initial treatment varied; 41 patients received cytotoxic drugs, 8 underwent allogeneic or autologous transplantation procedures, 21 received STI571 (imatinib mesylate, Gleevec), 1 received radiotherapy, and 7 received no therapy. Of the 25 (32%) patients who achieved a ""second chronic phase"" with first therapy, 6 of 21 (29%) were treated with STI571 and 19 of 50 (38%) were treated with chemotherapy, transplantation, or radiotherapy. Patients who achieved a second chronic phase survived longer than those who did not (median time from onset of BT 12.0 months versus 6.3 months, P =.0004). In multivariate analysis the finding of more than 50% blast cells in the blood and the presence of cytogenetic progression were independent adverse prognostic variables for survival. We conclude that survival after onset of BT has improved in recent years but is still unsatisfactory. We speculate that the combined use of STI571 with cytotoxic drugs may offer additional benefit.","['Department of Haematology, Hammersmith Hospital and Faculty of Medicine, Imperial College at Hammersmith Campus, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is, therefore, a potential tumor suppressor gene and probably plays an important role in tumor development. Moreover, reduced expression of p21 has been reported to have prognostic value in several human malignancies. In contrast with other CDKIs, mutational inactivation of p21 is infrequent, but gene inactivation by an alternative mechanism seems to be the general pathway. In this study, we analyzed the methylation status of the p21 promoter region using semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction in 124 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We observed p21 hypermethylation in bone marrow cells from 41% (51 of 124) of ALL patients. Hypermethylation within promoter strongly correlated with decreased p21 messenger RNA expression in tumoral cells. Clinical, molecular, and laboratory features and complete remission rate did not differ significantly between hypermethylated and normally methylated patients. Estimated disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival at 7 and 9 years, respectively, were 59% and 65% for healthy patients and 6% and 8% for hypermethylated patients (P =.00001 and P =.006). Multivariate analysis of potential prognostic factors demonstrated that p21 methylation status was an independent prognostic factor in predicting DFS (P =.0001). Our results indicate that the p21 gene is subject to methylation regulation at the transcription level in ALL and seems to be an important factor in predicting the clinical outcome of these patients.","['Hematology Department, Reina Sofia Hospital, Avda.

However, more recently investigators have come to recognize that antineoplastic effects mediated by immunocompetent donor T-cells transplanted with the stem cell allograft can be induced against hematological malignancies. Indeed, this graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) or graft-vs-tumor (GVT) effect is now felt to represent the principal modality required to sustain durable remissions of hematological malignancies following this approach. The powerful and potentially curative nature of the GVT effect in hematological cancers has recently lured oncologists into exploring the therapeutic potential of allogeneic stem cell transplantation as an investigational approach for treatment-refractory solid tumors.

The achievement of clinical responses marked by molecular conversion of the malignant phenotype and remissions in patients who had failed to respond to multiple courses of conventional chemotherapy provided the impetus to explore its use in multiple myeloma. Properties that favor the use of arsenic trioxide are its ability to target selectively malignant cells for apoptosis through enhancementof reactive oxygen species, to induce differentiation, and to inhibit angiogenesis.

Epub 2002 Mar 13.,,"The human T cell leukemia virus, type 1 (HTLV-1), Rex protein mediates the nuclear export of unspliced and incompletely spliced viral mRNAs. This post-transcriptional activity is dependent in part on the binding of this protein to cis-regulatory sequences termed the Rex-response element (XRE). We have proposed previously that the decreased functionality exhibited by Rex in human lymphoblastoid Jurkat T cells may be linked to alterations in the Rex/XRE interactions. The analysis of the ribonucleoprotein complexes formed between Jurkat nuclear proteins and XRE-RNA led to the identification of a 36-kDa protein as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1. In vitro binding assays revealed that hnRNP A1 proteins were found to interfere with the binding of Rex to XRE, whereas nuclear extracts depleted of these proteins were unable to disrupt Rex-XRE complexes. Furthermore, A1 proteins from Jurkat cells were acting in a concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that the amount of these RNA-binding proteins is a critical parameter in controlling Rex activity. We indeed observed a lower level of hnRNP A1 in in vitro HTLV-1-transformed virus-producing T cells than that detected in Jurkat cells. Likewise, overexpression of hnRNP A1 proteins in 293T cells and in Jurkat cells led to a decrease in the expression of a reporter gene dependent on Rex/XRE interactions. Such a decrease was not observed when the expression of the same reporter gene by cells overexpressing hnRNP A1 was dependent on the interactions of human immunodeficiency virus Rev protein with the Rev-response element. These findings indicate that hnRNP A1 by competing with Rex for the formation of REX-XRE complexes is specifically involved in the modulation of the post-transcriptional activity of Rex.","['Immuno-Virologie Moleculaire and Cellulaire, UMR 5537, CNRS-Universite Claude Bernard/Lyon 1, Faculte de Medecine RTH Laennec, Rue G.

While few of these exposed populations are suitable for studying the effects of neutron exposure, patients treated with neutron-beam therapy might be a source of information. To assess the feasibility of conducting a multi-center international study of the late effects of neutron therapy, we surveyed 23 cancer centers that had used neutron beam therapy. For the 17 responding institutions, only 25% of the patients treated with neutrons (2,855 of 11,191) were alive more than 2 years after treatment. In a two-center U.S. pilot study of 484 neutron-treated cancer patients, we assessed the feasibility of obtaining radiotherapy records, cancer incidence and other follow-up data, and of estimating patient organ doses. Patients were treated with 42 MeV neutrons between 1972 and 1989. Applying a clinical equivalence factor of 3.2 for neutrons, total average organ doses outside the treatment beam ranged from 0.14 to 0.29 Gy for thyroid, 0.40 to 2.50 Gy for breast, 0.63 to 2.35 Gy for kidney, and 1.12 to 1.76 Gy for active bone marrow depending upon the primary cancer treatment site. We successfully traced 97% of the patients, but we found that patient survival was poor and that chemotherapy was not confirmable in a quarter of the patients. Based on our findings from the international survey and the feasibility study, we conclude that a large investigation could detect a fivefold or higher leukemia risk, but would be inadequate to evaluate the risk of solid cancers with long latent periods and therefore would likely not be informative with respect to neutron-related cancer risk in humans.","['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, 6120 Executive Boulevard, Bethesda, Maryland 20892-7238, USA. sigurdsa@mail.nih.gov']","['N01-CP-40535/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP-81121/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To examine the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we investigated the changes in the time course of the rates of transcription of genes in cells of the human myeloblastic leukemia cell line ML-1 by a nuclear run-on assay. It is possible that the more rapid induction of the mRNA of the CDKN1A and GADD45 genes after exposure to 50 cGy of X rays than after 20 Gy is due to a lower level of stabilization of the mRNA of these genes after 50 cGy. In addition, our results show that 50 cGy of X rays increases the transcription rates of the CDKN1A and GADD45 genes, with a maximum induction at 0.5 to 1 h after irradiation, much earlier than the maximum accumulation of stabilized TP53 protein. We suggest the involvement of BRCA1 protein in the early induction of transcription of these two genes.","['Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Chiba University, 1-33 Yayoi-cho, Inage-ku, Chiba 263-8522, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, in differentiating myeloid leukemia cells CD11b is predominantly expressed which can associate with CD18 to form the functional heterodimeric integrin Mac-1. To elucidate the role of cell adhesion during macrophage-like differentiation, we transfected human U937 myeloid leukemia cells with a vector containing the CD11b gene in antisense orientation. Expression of the CD11b antisense gene in stably transfected U937 cells (as-CD11b cells) resulted in an attenuated response to TPA. As-CD11b cells demonstrated poor adhesion to solid substrate upon TPA treatment in contrast to U937 control cells. Constitutive expression of c-myc in as-CD11b transfectants was higher than in control cells and failed to be repressed by TPA treatment. Moreover, unlike control cells, antisense transfectants failed to induce expression of early response genes such as c-jun and the redox factor ref-1 upon TPA stimulation. Consequently, the induction of monocytic differentiation markers such as the activity of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase, the capacity to reduce nitroblue tetrazolium and the expression of the vimentin gene was much lower in antisense transfectants than in control U937 cells. According to the failure to undergo a monocytic differentiation program, TPA treatment of as-CD11b cells resulted in a progressively increasing amount of apoptotic cells whereas the differentiated population of U937 control cells remained alive. Taken together, these data suggest that the integrin-mediated (particularly CD11b-mediated) adhesion of myeloid leukemia cells in the course of induced monocytic differentiation is crucial for cell attachment, development of a monocytic phenotype and subsequent survival.","['Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, Moscow. prudoi@poa.mmc.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was first launched in the US in February 1993. Ortho Biotech and The Scripps Research Institute have since been developing the compound for its potential use in multiple sclerosis (MS). In 1997, Ortho filed air NDA in the US for the use of cladribine in the treatment of relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS. An FDA drug advisory committee was planning to meet in January 1999 to discuss the NDA. However, Ortho cancelled the meeting. Following an FDA inspection during December 1998 and January 1999, the Scripps Clinic received a warning letter from the FDA in April 1999 regarding violations in the clinical studies of cladribine for MS, and Ortho withdrew the NDA after concluding that further clinical studies would be necessary.

Although in HTA 1 there was only a trace of beta2-microglobulin (beta2m) detected by lactoperoxidase labelling of the high expressor variants, significant levels of both beta2m and HTA 1 light chain beta(t) were observed in gels stained with Coomassie blue. The physiological association of beta(t) with HTA 1 was confirmed by the substantial increase of beta(t) which parallels the increase of HTA 1.","['MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK.']",,,,,,,PMC555328,,,,,,,,,,,
