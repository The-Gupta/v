Alongside with quantitative differences in interferon production, biological differences in the properties of interferons produced of normal and sick humans and animals were revealed. The biological differences consist in that the interferon produced by leukocytes from cancer and leukemia patients interacting with homologous cell culture is conducive to more rapid formation of resistance to the indicator virus than the interferon produced by normal leukocytes. Thus, resistance of the homologous cell culture to the infection with the indicator vesicular stomatitis virus developed within 1--2 hours after contact with leukocyte interferon from patients and only within 5--6 hours after contact with that of normal subjects. This finding is not specific for cancer and leukemia, as the same was observed with specimens from patients with pneumonia and from mice hyporeactive to interferon inducer.

Detectable levels of low molecular weight viral RNA (LMW vRNA) were not present in MoMuLV grown in mouse embryo fibroblasts, nor rat cells, nor was it produced by them when they were infected with MoMuLV containing both species of vRNA. DNA probes complementary to both subunits were synthesized separately using purified reverse transcriptase (R.T.) and calf thymus DNA as primer. Polyadenylated LMW vRNA was selected and, by molecular hybridization was found to be completely homologous with the large RNA subunit. This was confirmed using cDNA probes representing defined regions of the genome. The LMW vRNA therefore contains multiple subsets of the viral RNA, which could correspond to multiple deletion mutants possibly generated by an efficient RNA splicing mechanism.

The purified, nuclease resistant single-copy DNA was then hybridized to nuclear RNA (nRNA). The results of these experiments show that actively transcribed genes are assembled into nucleosome-like structures within 5-10 nucleosomes of the replication fork and that they also acquire a conformation characteristic of actively transcribed nucleosomes (ie, a DNase I sensitive structure) within 20 nucleosomes of the fork. Assuming DNA sequence specific interactions are required for establishing a DNase I sensitive conformation on active genes during each round of replication, our results indicate that a specific recognition event can occur very rapidly and very specifically in eukaryotic cells.

By restriction enzyme analysis, it was shown that a region encompassing over 40% of the viral information was not essential for transformation or rescue of the deletion mutant. The transforming region was further localised by analysis of the transforming activity in tissue culture of isolated restriction fragments of linear duoble-stranded sarcoma viral DNA. In each case, DNA fragments that retained transforming activity preserved the cell-derived insertion sequences of the viral genome. Moreover, such transformants invariably expressed RNA specific to this region. By these two approaches, it was possible to demonstrate that the transforming region of the viral genome begins very near or within the cell-derived insertion sequences.

Electrophoretic mobility and the molecular weights of unique RNase T1-resistant oligonucleotides (T1-oligonucleotides) indicated that the 32S RNA had a complexity of about 7.4 kilobases. Hybridization with DNA complementary to Friend murine leukemia virus (Fr-MLV) has distinguished two sets of nucleotide sequences in 32S SFFV RNA, 74% which were Fr-MLV related and 26% which were SFFV specific. By the same method, SFFV RNA was 48% related to Moloney MLV. We have resolved 23 large T1-oligonucleotides of SFFV RNA and 43 of Fr-MLV RNA. On the basis of the relationship between SFFV and Fr-MLV RNAs, the 23 SFFV oligonucleotides fell into four classes: (i) seven which had homologous equivalents in Fr-MLV RNA; (ii) six more which could be isolated from SFFV RNA-Fr-MLV cDNA hybrids treated with RNases A and T1; (iii) eight more which were isolated from hybrids treated with RNases A and T1; and (iv) two which did not have Fr-MLV-related counterparts. Surprisingly, the two class iv oligonucleotides had homologous counterparts in the RNA of six amphotropic MLV's including mink cell focus-forming and HIX-MLVs analyzed previously. The map locations of the 23 SFFV T1-oligonucleotides relative to the 3' polyadenylic acid coordinate of SFFV RNA were deduced from the size of the smallest polyadenylic acid-tagged RNA fragment from which a given oligonucleotide was isolated. The resulting oligonucleotide map could be divided roughly into three segments: two terminal segments which are mosaics of oligonucleotides of classes i, ii, and iii and an internal segment between 2 and 2.5 kilobases from the 3' end containing the two oligonucleotides shared with amphotropic MLVs. Since SFFV RNA consists predominantly of sequence elements related to ecotropic and amphotropic helper-independent MLVs, it would appear that the transforming gene of SFFV is not a major specific sequence unrelated to genes of helper viruses, as is the case with Rous sarcoma and probably withe other defective sarcoma and acute leukemia viruses.","['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",['10.1128/JVI.31.1.133-146.1979 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC353429,,,

The intracellular accumulation of both the free and DNA-bound forms of daunorubicin and doxorubicin was studied in vitro. The uptake of unbound daunorubicin was higher than that of doxorubicin. At drug concentrations of 1.75 microM and higher the uptake of the free drugs was greater than that of the bound forms, but at lower drug concentrations the uptake was about the same. This could at least partly be explained by a greater dissociation of the DNA-drug complexes at lower drug concentrations. The uptake into normal leukocytes was of the same order of magnitude as that into leukemic cells. There was a great interindividual variation in the accumulation of both free and DNA-bound drugs in the cells from leukemic patients.

The overall toxicity of doxorubicin is significantly reduced after IV injection as a DNA complex while daunorubicin-DNA is as toxic as free daunorubicin. On hemopoietic stem cells, daunorubicin-DNA was found to be more cytotoxic than daunorubicin, while the opposite was observed with doxorubicin and doxorubicin-DNA. Both complexes are more effective than the corresponding free drugs on the L1210 murine leukemia, when given IV at equitoxic doses. The tissue uptake in mice, after IV administration, is generally lower when the drugs are given bound to DNA.

Both drugs exited from cells placed in drug-free medium, a process that was reduced at 0 degrees but not altered by 10 mM sodium azide. Unlike whole cells, isolated nuclei accumulated more daunorubicin than ACM. This process was not altered at 0 degrees.

Unlike daunorubicin, which localized in cell nuclei, ACM localized in the cytoplasm with no detectable nuclear fluorescence.

The decrease in the methylation of DNAs from various lymphoid organs of animals with chronic lymphoid leukemia is well correlated with the impairment. No significant changes of the m5C level and the acceptor ability of the in vitro reaction of heterologous methylation of cow lymph lymphocyte DNA have been observed.

The analogue was used for periods not exceeding 5 h, at a concentration which permits the synthesis of ribosomal precursor RNA but inhibits the maturation process. The following observations were made: 1. Ribosomal proteins, synthesized de novo in the presence of the drug, were associated with toyocamycin-containing 45-S pre-rRNA in preribosomal-like 80-S ribonucleoproteins which accumulated in the nucleolus. Two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed a full protein complement of these particles, although minor discrepancies were observed in the relative proportions of a limited number of polypeptides. 2. In the absence of 28-S and 18-S rRNA formation, a surprisingly high proportion of newly synthesized ribosomal proteins were incorporated into high-salt washed ribosomal subunits. The extent of individual protein exchange as well as their apparent turnover rates were markedly heterogeneous. Most of these exchangeable proteins were shown to be labeled rapidly in ribosomal subunits of normal cells. Some alternative interpretations of these results are discussed.","['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Ribosomal)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', 'L7995C4D7F (Toyocamycin)']","['0005-2787(79)90013-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2787(79)90013-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

The labeling patterns of ribosomal proteins were compared by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The analysis of isotopic ratios in individual protein spots showed marked differences in the relative kinetics of protein appearance within nucleolar peribosomes and cytoplasmic subunits. Among the about 60 distinct proteins characterized in 80-S preribosomes, 9 ribosomal proteins appeared to incorporate radioactive amino acids more rapidly. These proteins become labeled gradually in the cytoplasmic ribosomal subunits. It was found that one non-ribosomal protein associated with 80-S preribosomes takes up label far more quickly than other preribosomal polypeptides. It is suggested that this set of proteins could associate early with newly transcribed pre-rRNA, more rapidly than others after their synthesis on polyribosomes, and could therefore play a role in the regulation of ribosome synthesis. In isolated 60-S and 40-S ribosomal subunits, we detected five proteins from the large subunit and four proteins from the small subunit which incorporate tritiated amino acids more quickly than the remainder. These proteins were shown to be absent or very faintly labeled in 80-S preribosomal particles, and would associate with ribosomal particles at later stages of the maturation process.",['0 (Ribosomal Proteins)'],"['0005-2787(79)90012-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2787(79)90012-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

Leukemic cell populations have a longer cell cycle than their normal cell counterparts. The cell populations are comprised of proliferating and resting fractions and are capable of self-maintaining growth. Growth regulation is determined primarily by the size of the proliferating cell population or growth fraction. The growth fraction can vary as to site of disease, the clinical phase, following chemotherapeutic perturbation, and most importantly is related to the specific tumor cell type. Within a specific type of leukemia there is considerable variability of proliferative activity at time of diagnosis, but this variability bears no relationship to the subsequent clinical course. Those leukemias, such as the E rosette-positive form of lymphocytic leukemia characterized by rapid tumor growth and large tumor bulk, are also associated with tumor cell populations having larger growth fractions than standard lymphocytic leukemia. There is evidence for growth regulation of leukemic cell populations on systemic, regional, and, perhaps most importantly of all, intrinsic cell levels. It is this area of growth regulation for these tumor cell populations which currently needs the greatest research attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,

No significant difference was observed among tumor strains in the percentage of cells filtered. The cell viability was almost unchanged by filtration. The filtration time was considered to indicate the passing ability of tumor cells through capillary pores.

Mononuclear cells from normal donors and from patients with acute monocytic leukaemia served as controls. Light microscopically HC seemed to have ingested bacteria or latex particles. Treatment of the cells with lysostaphin, an enzyme that kills extracellular Staphylococcus aureus, showed that almost all 'ingested' bacteria were extracellular. Lanthanum nitrate, added during the fixation procedure for electron microscopy, stained both the outer cell membrane and the membranes of the 'phagosomes' of the HC, also indicating that the 'ingested' particles were extracellular. HC showed no increased oxygen consumption on exposure to bacteria in the presence of serum. Furthermore, HC showed no lysozyme or peroxidase activity, whereas non-specific esterase activity was much weaker than in monocytes. These findings, which show that HC are essentially non-phagocytic, constitute strong evidence against a monocytic origin of the malignant cells of hairy-cell leukaemia.","['0 (Latex)', '6I3K30563S (Lanthanum)', 'EC 3.4.24.75 (Lysostaphin)']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1979.tb02857.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic depend of the pathology class: diffuse LBS and diffuse HBS have an evolution similar to acute leukemia (44.5% and 19% at 7 years survival), on the opposite nodular LBS, diffuse LCS have 100% survival at 7 years. Diffuse cases have visceral relapses (liver, bone marrow, Waldeyer ring) or generalized lymphatic involvement; nodular cases have generally localized and only lymph-nodes relapses. The best results by large fields irradiation suggest a contiguous extension of the disease, but there is also distant lymph nodes relapses. In the nodular cases, relapses can be generally cured by localized radiotherapy. In the diffuse case, we do not know if it is better to give total lymphnode irradiation (or to give more chemotherapy with economic irradiation). 10 gastro-intestinal cases were treated by moving strip technique with excellent tolerance and 67.5% at 5 years survival.

A significant difference between observed and expected mortality from suicide was present in both males and females and there was an indication that drug overdoses were over-represented. PMRs for several cancer sites were elevated, but excesses were not always confined to particular occupational categories.

This impairment in NK function could not be accounted for by an altered organ distrubution, target selectivity, or ontogenesis. Interferon did not fully restore the response, which suggests that the defect may not result solely from a lack of endogenous interferon stimulation in beige mice. The frequency of target-binding cells was normal in all lymphoid organs, which suggests that the defect is intrinsic to the NK cell and does not involve an altered population size or an inability to recognize and interact with the target. Rather, the defect may lie within the lytic pathway subsequent to target cell contact.

The antiserum, tested in the absence of complement, affected the growth of these cells in biphasic manner. When the antiserum concentration was 0.1% or greater, there was a rapid decline in the rate of DNA synthesis, and after 5 to 7 hr, cell death. When the antiserum concentration was 0.067% or less, the decline in the rate of synthesis of DNA did not become apparent until 5 to 6 hr after treatment.

By means of the differential staining technique of chromosomes, large variations in chromosome numbers were found in the karyotypes of leucotic cells of different generations, and the formation of cell clones containing different marker chromosomes as well as the dominance of a hyperdiploid clone with 41-42 chromosomes was revealed. Chromosome analysis of such hyperdiploid cells of the 150th generation has indicated that the supernumerary chromosomes (in 88.0% of cases examined) belong to the smallest chromosomes of the mouse karyogramm (to the 18-19th chromosome pairs or to chromosomes smaller than those of 19th pair). Similar trisomy was also observed in hypodiploid and pseudodiploid leucosis cells. It is suggested that the cell clone with trisomy for the smallest chromosomes is specific to the spontaneous lympholeucosis in AKR mice as well as to the leucosis transplanted to isogenic mice for a number of subsequent generations. Increased rate of hyperdiploid cells was associated with a generalization of leucosis. It was concluded that the development rate and the severity of transplanted lympholeucosis in AKR mice was determined by the domination of the cell clone with trisomy for the 18-19th chromosome pairs in the population of leucotic cells.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although theoretically they should have important potentialities, particularly in the treatment of various forms of cancer, their development in this field has not kept pace with the progress in other treatment modalities in radiation oncology. Indications for the selection of appropriate isotopes for therapy revolve about the emission of beta particles of sufficient energy, which are administered in a chemical form that reaches the tumor. Methods of calculation of doses delivered to sites of deposition are discussed in the text. Radiobiologic considerations include the possibility of early deleterious effects from overdosage, and consideration of chromosomal changes of circulating lymphocytes and their implications. Late effects that have been of great public concern are confined almost solely to possible carcinogenesis, and this effect has been minimal in patients receiving therapeutic levels of radioactive drugs. Genetic and developmental effects, also, have been negligible. Complications encountered more frequently have been leukemia after extensive therapy of thyroid carcinoma, and local fibrosis after direct injection of radioactive colloids into tumor tissue.","['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radioisotopes)']","['S0001-2998(79)80038-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0001-2998(79)80038-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic benefit from splenectomy was satisfactory, especially in patients with well-differentiated lymphocytic leukemia of type CLL. In contrast, the diagnostic value of LS was minimal, except in patients with first diagnosis of NHL through LS. There was no change in tumor stage in any case.

No activity against L 1210 was observed, even tilorone exerted no effect. The reduction in activity against the Walker carcinosarcoma which resulted from the carbonyl substitution might be caused by a decrease in the ability to intercalate into DNA.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Fluorenes)', '0 (Hydrazines)', 'O6W7VEW6KS (Tilorone)']",,,,,,,,,,,

To study the sequence of these events, we labeled JLS-V9 cells chronically infected with Rauscher murine leukemia virus in pulse-chase experiments with the radioactive precursors [35S]methionine, [14C]mannose, [3H]glucosamine, and [32P]phosphate. Newly synthesized gag polyproteins which incorporated label, and the modified products derived from them, were identified by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with anti-p30 rabbit serum, followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Pulse-chase experiments were carried out in the presence as well as in the absence of tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation. Among the three major polyproteins synthesized in the absence of tunicamycin, two were found to be glycosylated but not phosphorylated. These were designated gPr80gag and gP94gag. Both shared identical [35S]methionine peptides with Pr65gag and p30. Of the two nonglycosylated precursors, Pr65gag and Pr75gag, only Pr65gag was found to be detectably phosphorylated, and Pr75gag could be readily identified only when glycosylation was inhibited. On the basis of these results, a scheme for the post-translational modification of gag polyproteins is proposed. According to this scheme the gag gene-encoded polyproteins are processed from a common precursor, Pr75gag, by two divergent pathways: one leading through the intermediate Pr65gag to internal virion components via cleavage and phosphorylation and the other via tunicamycin-sensitive mannosylation to the intermediate gPr80gag, which is further glycosylated to yield cell surface polyprotein gP94gag.","['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '11089-65-9 (Tunicamycin)']",['10.1128/JVI.30.1.255-266.1979 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC353320,,,

Four serological assays were used to survey sera for autologous antibody. Immune adherence, protein A, and C3-mixed hemadsorption assays detected reactivity in a high percentage of patients (80-100%), whereas mixed hemadsorption assays were negative with sera from all but one patient. Reactive sera from six patients were analyzed by absorption tests with autologous, allogeneic, and restricted to autologous renal cancer cells; class 2 antigens, present on certain allogeneic renal and nonrenal cancer cells; and class 3 antigens, found on a wide variety of normal and malignant cell types. The sera of one patient detected class 1, 2, and 3 antigens, the sera of three patients detected class 2 antigens, and the sera of two patients detected class 3 antigens. This analysis of renal cancer, with the recognition of three classes of surface antigens recognized by autologous sera, resembles the results of autologous typing of three other human malignancies: malignant melanoma, acute leukemia, and astrocytoma. Evidence provided by autologous typing of these cancers indicates that class 1 and class 2 antigens are tumor-restricted and that under certain circumstances these antigens are immunogenic for the autologous host.","['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",['10.1084/jem.150.3.564 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC2185656,,,

The viremia was regularly measured on individual mice with a radioimmunoassay of the major internal virion component p30. Three genes within the major histocompatibility complex controlled the level of circulating virus. Two of them, called Rmv.1 and Rmv.2, appear to be located in the I region, respectively, in the IA, and the IC-S or G regions. The third gene, Rmv.3, was mapped to the D end of the complex in the D or T region. Crosses between resistant and sensitive strans demonstrated that the H-2 associated resistance was inherited as a dominant or semi-dominant Mendelian trait. Rmv.1, Rmv.2, and Rmv.3 were shown to complement for resistance in trans when the hybrids between sensitive strains were examined. A good correlation was found between viremia and the appearance of leukemias, the most viremic strains being also the most leukemic. Nevertheless, additional non-H-2 genes must control viremia and/or the appearance of leukemia since, despite high levels of viremia, some sensitive strains do not become leukemic.",['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of the target enzyme, L-aspartate transcarbamylase (ATCase), was evaluated in homogenates of a spectrum of murine neoplasms. ATCase activity was significantly lower in PALA-sensitive as opposed to PALA-refractory tumors. However, among tumors sensitive to PALA, there was no clearcut relationship between ATCase activity and degree of sensitivity to PALA. Thus, a number of hypotheses were proposed to explain differential sensitivity to PALA in vivo. Enzyme activities in the salvage pathway which phosphorylate pyrimidine nucleosides and deoxynucleosides were found to be greater in refractory tumors. The uptake of PALA, in vitro, though quite slow, was found to be two to eight times greater in two sensitive tumors as compared to the refractory L1210 leukemia. However, in vivo, 24 hours following graduated doses of PALA, nearly identical intratumoral drug concentrations were observed in representative sensitive and refractory tumors. Thus, ultimately, PALA transport would not appear to correlate with differences in drug sensitivity. A number of other biochemical parameters were also found to have no association with sensitivity to PALA in vivo. These included: kinetics of inhibition of ATCase, capacity for restitution of ATCase activity after a dose of PALA, degree of inhibition of ATCase at various doses of PALA, detoxification of PALA by tumor cells, kinetics of uptake of uridine, or catabolism of pyrimidines or pyrimidine nucleosides.","['0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.3.2 (Aspartate Carbamoyltransferase)', 'N919E46723 (Phosphonoacetic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of thymidine to the medium produces reversal (6 to 40%) of this steady-state growth rate inhibition. This study utilized combinations of methotrexate and thymidine for an evaluation of the accompanying relationship between steady-state growth rate and changes in the ribo- and deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools. In L1210 cells exposed to methotrexate alone, the deoxythymidine 5'-phosphate (dTTP) pools decreased, whereas deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate, deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate, and deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP) remained relatively constant up to 70% inhibition of growth rate, with dCTP at a constant 112% of controls. The corresponding ribonucleoside triphosphates decreased only slightly. With the combination of methotrexate and thymidine resulting in up to 40% inhibition of growth rate, there was also a decrease in the dTTP pool while the other deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates remained relatively constant, and the corresponding ribonucleoside triphosphates again decreased only slightly. The dCTP pool was reduced to a constant 42% of control comparable to that produced by thymidine alone. With greater than 40% (with thymidine) or 70% (without thymidine) inhibition of growth rate, all pools decreased, but only dTTP was substantially reduced in proportion to the growth rate inhibition caused by methotrexate. The dTTP pool became depleted in spite of the presence of exogenous thymidine. Evaluation of CCRF-CEM cells indicated that inhibition of growth rate and nucleotide pool perturbations by methotrexate were similar to those observed in L1210 cells. However, in the presence of thymidine, inhibition of growth rate appeared related to decreased pools of dCTP, deoxyadenosine 5'-triphosphate, and deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate, rather than dTTP as was observed for L1210 cells. Hence, mammalian cells were capable of responding in a differential fashion to pharmacological perturbations, and this capacity may play a role in determining therapeutic selectivity. Since the ribonucleoside triphosphate decreases were slight and relatively uniform during methotrexate-induced perturbations, the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools appear to be more directly related to inhibition of growth rate. The results are consistent with the concept that slight imbalances in the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools dramatically inhibit DNA synthesis, as mediated through their interaction with DNA polymerase.","['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,

A striking increase in activity occurs in lymphocytes stimulated by phytohemagglutinin to divide in culture. Enzyme activity rises severalfold before cell number increases. Stimulated lymphocytes take up [3-14C]serine from the medium and incorporate its radioactivity into DNA, RNA, and other cell fractions. The rate of incorporation increases sharply before the rise in cell number. Thus, serine hydroxymethyltransferase activity and serine incorporation in vivo show a temporal correlation in stimulated lymphocytes.

The drug has recently been shown to produce selective ultrastructural damage to the mitochondria of proliferating cell populations. It is important to understand the molecular basis for this action, since it may be related to the known ability of MGBG to block polyamine biosynthesis. Accordingly, the effect of MGBG treatment on the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA has been examined. Exponentially growing L1210 leukemia cells were prelabeled with [14C]thymidine, treated with MGBG for 1.5 to 16 hr, and then pulse labeled with [3H]-thymidine. Incorporation of [3H]thymidine into mitochondrial DNA was selectively inhibited at 5 hr with concentrations of 1 to 10 microM MGBG. Nuclear DNA, however, was not similarly affected until 8 to 11 hr of drug treatment. Dye-CsCl gradients of mitochondrial DNA indicated that the inhibition of synthesis occurred in replicative forms of circular DNA. Uptake studies excluded the possibility of drug interference with cellular uptake of thymidine. Ultrastructural studies revealed a very close correlation between the dose-response curve for mitochondrial damage and that for MGBG inhibition of mitochondrial DNA synthesis. This correlation suggests a direct cause-and-effect relationship between inhibition of mitochondrial DNA synthesis and ultrastructural damage, but the possibility of both phenomena being related to another action by the drug, such as inhibition of polyamine biosynthesis, or a drug effect on mitochondrial function, must also be considered.","['0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Polyamines)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

By means of a rosette assay employing erythrocytes coated with IgG (EAG), a receptor for the Fc of IgG is shown to be strongly expressed on all HCs, whether in suspension or in monolayers. This receptor is shed and re-expressed over a period of some 6 h. In EAG rosette formation the indicator erythrocytes are deformed and the receptor is not blocked by an antiserum to the Ia-like antigen. By ultrastructural acid-phosphatase cytochemistry, it is established that HCs phagocytose latex particles, but do not phagocytose a variety of other particles to a significant extent. These, and other features, are discussed in relation to the literature and it is shown that all are compatible with the current view that HCL is a form of B-cell lympholiferative.",['0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)'],['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1979.tb00436.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Ultrasound treatment of serum can activate enzymes normally bound to carrier proteins. In normal bone marrow cultures, growth was inhibited by sonicated serum when the cells were cultured in a single layer without exogenous colony-stimulating factor (CSF) included in the culture, while an enhancing effect with a 2--5 fold increase in the number of colonies was seen in feeder layer-stimulated cultures. Morphologically, in contrast to the normal change to eosinophils and monocytes-macrophages during the culture period, the cultures with sonicated serum added showed continuous growth of neutrophils and no increase of other cell types. Experiments using tritiated thymidine indicated that the enhancing effect of sonicated serum involved marrow cells which were more prone to thymidine S-phase kill. The effect of sonicated serum was further evaluated in cultures from patients with leukaemia. In AML in relapse, feeder-layer stimulated cultures of bone marrow cells were inhibited (11/14 cases) by sonicated serum, while reversion to the normal enhancing pattern was seen for patients in remission.",['0 (Culture Media)'],['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1979.tb00423.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Pr200gag-pol was found to contain peptide sequences of the viral core proteins p30, p15, p12, and p10, as well as peptide sequences found in the cell-associated reverse transcriptase. Intermediate reverse transcriptase precursor Pr125pol lacked peptide sequences of the four-core proteins but contained reverse transcriptase-specific tryptic peptides plus two additional tyrosine-containing tryptic peptides not related to gag or pol gene products. Methionine-containing tryptic peptide analysis also suggested the presence of additional protein material in Pr125pol (Kopchick et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 75:2016-2020, 1978). Pr200gag-pol, although containing both viral core and reverse transcriptase-assoicated methionine and tyrosine tryptic peptides, also contained additional tryptic peptides. Thes are of two classes: (i) tryptic peptides associated with the Pr125pol but not Pr80pol and (ii) tryptic peptides not found in Pr125pol or in any known viral protein. One interpretation of these results is that Pr200gag-pol contains additional gene products aside from the gag and pol genes. Pr80gag and Pr65gag peptide maps were also examined and found to have sequences of all four core proteins. Pr65gag was found to contain two p30 tyrosine tryptic peptides that were absent in Pr80gag, suggesting that Pr80gag may not be the precursor to Pr65gag. Pr80gag, as expected from its larger size, also contained tryptic peptides not found in Pr65gag. Two of these additional Pr80gag tryptic peptides were found in Pr80pol as well but not in any of the viral core proteins, suggesting that Pr80gag and Pr80pol may have overlapping peptide sequences. Consistent with this finding is the conclusion that Pr80gag terminates within the pol gene. A model that describes the relationship of these recent findings to viral gene products is presented.","['0 (Peptides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)']",['10.1128/JVI.30.2.610-623.1979 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC353364,,,

After allowing adsorption to Sc-1 fibroblasts at a low multiplicity of infection, the cells were seeded individually into wells of a microtitier test plate and the resulting colonies were grown into large cultures. Among 14 of these cell cultures that have been analyzed thoroughly, 6 contained F-SFFV alone, 1 contained F-MuLV plus F-SFFV, and 7 were uninfected. Each of the Sc-1 cell lines which had been infected with cloned F-SFFV contained a glycoprotein with an apparent molecular weight of 55,000 (gp55) that was absent from the cell lines that lacked F-SFFV. gp55 was also present in Friend erythroleukemia cells and in fibroblasts infected with an F-SFFV that had been doubly cloned in another laboratory. These results indicate that gp55 is encoded by the F-SFFV genome. gp55 has the following additional properties. It can be immunoprecipitated with antiserum made to the F-MuLV virion envelope glycoprotein (gp75). Its unglycosylated polypeptide, formed in cells treated with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, has a molecular weight of approximately 45,000. Its tryptic peptide map contains peptides in common with F-MuLV gp75 but it also contains unique peptides. It appears to be absent or present in only low concentrations in erythroleukemia cell plasma membranes as determined by lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination, and it accumulates intracellularly in large amounts. In addition, it is absent from released virions. The majority of the cellular gp55 has an isoelectric point of 8.5 to 9.0. These results are consistent with the idea that an env gene recombination event was involved in the origin of F-SFFV.","['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)']",['10.1128/JVI.30.2.564-575.1979 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC353360,,,

It has been shown by others that Pr65gag is the immediate precursor of the internal structural (gag) protein, and that Pr180gag-pol is the precursor to reverse transcriptase. In studies reported here, the 80,000-dalton gag-related polyprotein from Moloney strain murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV)-infected cells was found to be glycosylated by the following criteria: (i) incorporation of [3H]mannose, (ii) a change in electrophoretic mobility upon digestion with endoglycosidase H, and (iii) a change in electrophoretic mobility when glycosylation was inhibited by treatment of the cells with tunicamycin during labeling. The 80,000-dalton gag polyprotein has therefore been designated GpP80gag. The unglycosylated form of GpP80gag was a polypeptide of 75,000 daltons. A comparison of [3H]mannose and [3H]galactose labeling experiments suggested that GpP80gag is further glycosylated to yield a glycopolypeptide of 95,000 daltons. This 95,000-dalton polypeptide is relatively rapidly cleaved to yield two glycopeptides of 55,000 and 40,000 daltons which are released into the cell culture fluid, as soluble proteins. Cell-free translation of M-MuLV genomic RNA resulted in two major gag-related products of 75,000 and 65,000 daltons. The 65,000-dalton gag-related cell-free translation product comigrated with Pr65gag, and the 75,000-dalton cell-free product comigrated with the unglycosylated form of GpP80gag. Both of the gag-related cell-free translation products could be labeled with [35S]formyl methionine, which is incorporated only as the N-terminal amino acid during translation. Other investigators have shown that GpP80gag and Pr65gag differ at their N-termini, and these results combined with those reported here suggest that GpP80gag and Pr65gag are translated from two separate initiation sites in M-MuLV RNA.","['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'PHA4727WTP (Mannose)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",['10.1128/JVI.30.2.551-563.1979 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC353359,,,

In the spleen erythroid colony forming units (CFU-E) increase exponentially up to 800-fold that of normal levels by the third week of infection. In vitro these CFU-E are dependent on erythropoietin for colony formation, their erythropoietin requirements being higher than that of CFU-E from normal mice. Numbers of CFU-E in spleen and degree of splenomegaly in anemic RLV infected mice were also shown to be modified by red blood cell transfusion, but progression of the disease was not stopped. Erythroid burst forming units (BFU-E) were also responsive to erythropoietin. However, a small proportion of cells also formed BFU-E colonies at concentrations which did not support growth of normal marrow BFU-E. When compared to normal, CFU-E found in RLV-infected spleen have similar velocity sedimentation rates. However, buoyant density separation of leukemic spleen cells indicated that CFU-E were more homogeneous (modal density 1.0695 g/cm3) than CFU-E from normal spleen. Analysis of physical properties of CFU-E and the nonhemoglobinized erythroblast-like cells, which accumulate in the spleen showed that they differed mainly in their distribution of cell diameter. Our findings show that erythroid progenitor cells in RLV infected mice are responsive to erythropoietin in vitro. Also in vivo erythropoiesis appears to be under control of erythropoietin but other factors which lead to progression of RLV disease apparently exist. Most proerythroblast-like cells, which are characteristic of this disease, apparently lack the potential to form colonies and may be more mature than CFU-E.",['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],['10.1002/jcp.1041000108 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Daily local subcutaneous injections of MCR produced the prolongation of life span of mice to which LEWIS lung carcinoma was subcutaneously inoculated with some cured mice, but daily intraperitoneal injections of MCR showed no activity. Single intravenous administration of MCR inhibited early LEWIS lung carcinoma, but not advanced LEWIS lung carcinoma. The combination of MCR with aracytidine, or cyclophosphamide showed a synergistic activity against L1210 leukemia. MCR was not inactivated by treatment with serum, although neocarzinostatin was markedly inactivated by the same treatment.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Peptides)']",['10.7164/antibiotics.32.340 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Shortly after infection, the relative cellular [125I]gp71 binding level decreased, first with splenic cells (at day 7 to 10 after infection) and later with thymic cells (at day 10 to 20 after infection). The dependency of the reduction of binding on the replication of the inoculated virus was demonstrated by regression analyses using cellular gp71 binding level as the dependent variable and infectious virus titer, as well as viral gp71 and p30 levels, of spleens and thymuses from infected mice as independent variables. With each independent variable, the reduction of gp71 binding for both cell types was highly dependent (P less than 0.01) on the level of virus detected in their respective organ. In the early stages of leukemogenesis, the [125I]gp71 binding level declined to approximately 20 to 30% of control values. During this period the rate of reduction of binding was very rapid and, in general was similar for both splenic and thymic cells.

The resistant phenotype of these Blar cells is retained without change for at least four months in the absence of the antibiotic. These Blar cells are 10- to 20-fold more resistant to the cytotoxic action of the antibiotic than their parental cells in vivo. Polyuridylate dependent polyphenylalanine synthesis in vitro with S-30 extracts either from N742 or S501 is 10- to 50-fold more resistant to the inhibitory action of blasticidin S compared to the parental FM3a cells.

In all cases there was an increase in plasma volume, closely correlated to the size of the spleen, indicating that the true degree of anaemia can only be appreciated by red cell volume measurement. Moderately increased haemolysis was observed in most cases, which did not correlate with the spleen size. Simultaneous study of autologous and isologous red cell life-span suggested an extra-corpuscular mechanism for the haemolysis in most patients. A quantitative erythropoietic defect, either relative or absolute, was found in half the cases, without any qualitative defect. Only one case showed erythroid metaplasia of the spleen. Thus marrow failure appears to be largely responsible for the anaemia and granulocytopenia in hairy-cell leukaemia. A clear correlation was shown between the short-term prognosis after splenectomy and the degree of hypersplenism.

The protective function of such lymphocytes was not affected by their irradiation, but no protection occurred in sublethally irradiated recipients. This indicated that the sensitized lymphocytes did not inhibit tumor cell growth directly but recruited an effector protective response in the recipient mice. This protective activity was different from the one elicited by lymphocytes which had been sensitized directly against cells carrying antigens cross-reacting with RadLV.

In studies using these cells, delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC) and delta8-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta8-THC) were inactive when tested both in vitro and in vivo.

The classification system by stages, which at the present time is the most simple and useful method for the prognosis of this disease, recognizes five degrees of involvement: stage 0 (medullary and peripheral lymphocytosis); stage I (lymphocytosis + enlarged lymph nodes); stage II (lymphocyosis + hepato-and/or splenomegaly); stage III (lymphocytosis + anemia), and stage IV (lymphocytosis + thrombocytopenia). In the present report 95 controlled patients at the Farreras Valenti School of Hematology are analyzed using the classification by stages; there were 19 cases in stage 0; 16 in stage I; 30 in stage II; 21 in stage III, and 9 in stage IV. The mean survival rate in the global series was 63 months and the average 90.9 months. As in other series, it was observed that patients in stages 0 and I have a much better prognosis than those in stages III and IV. Stage II occupies an intermediate position in relation to prognosis, since the actuarial survival figure for this stage can practically be superimposed on that of the global series. The classification of chronic lymphocytic leukemia by stages permits the specification of the therapeutic indications for this condition; it also encourages the search for new modalities of treatment for stages with poor prognosis, since in these cases chronic lymphocytic leukemia behaves in the manner of an acute or subacute hemopathy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Although both drugs were avidly accumulated by cells, intracellular concentrations of 7-OMEN were 5 to 10 times those of daunorubicin. Lowered temperature (0 degrees C) reduced intracellular accumulation of both drugs, but 10 mM sodium azide reduced the accumulation of 7-OMEN only. Both drugs exited from cells placed in drug-free medium, a process that was reduced at 0 degrees C. Sodium azide, 10 mM, did not alter the efflux of daunorubicin from cells but hastened the efflux of 7-OMEN. Unlike whole cells, isolated nuclei accumulated more daunorubicin than 7-OMEN. This process was not reduced at 0 degrees C. Both drugs were lost from nuclei placed in drug free buffer with only slight reduction at 0 degrees C. Unlike daunorubicin which localized in cell nuclei, 7-OMEN localized in the cytoplasm with no detectable nuclear fluorescence.

The block to productive infection by these oncogenic viruses is at a postpenetration step in the replication cycle of these viruses but the precise level of the block has not been established for any of these viruses. In this report we describe teratocarcinoma-derived stem and differentiated cell lines which should be especially useful in determining the level of the block to replication of ecotropic murine leukemia virus in murine teratocarcinoma stem cells. The stem cell line, OTT6050AF1 BrdU, which is completely nonpermissive to productive infection by Moloney murine leukemia virus and consists of 97% pluripotent stem cells, contains DNA copies of an RNA tumor virus which is indistinguishable from the N-tropic murine leukemia virus of AKR mice. The stem cells are negative for expression of viral reverse transcriptase, p30 and gp69/71 and no virus is found by XC plaque assay or other biological tests. Differentiated cells established from the same teratocarcinoma tumor are 100% positive for viral gp69/71, p30, and produce large amounts of reverse transcriptase activity and N-tropic virus as detected by biological assay. The virus isolated from the differentiated cells is closely related, if not identical to AKR N-tropic virus by nucleic acid hybridization studies and is thus not an endogenous virus of the 129 strain of mice. The teratocarcinoma tumor from which the cell lines were established had been carried in 129 mice and perhaps at some time in the mouse passage history the tumors were infected (nonproductively) with the N-tropic virus. Regardless of the origin of this viral DNA, the OTT6050A derived stem and differentiated cell lines should be extremely useful in defining in stem cells the step at which ecotropic murine leukemia virus replication is blocked.","['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",['10.1084/jem.150.2.392 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC2185633,,,

As controls leukaemic cells from a patient with a prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) and blood lymphocytes from healthy individuals were used. The specificity of the energy-independent capping of the HCL-cells as compared to the controls was tested by incubation of the cells at 4 degrees C in the presence of 0.1 M sodium azide with different FITC-labelled ligands. In order to find an explanation for this phenomenon, the influence of cytochalasin B, colchicine and the combination of both drugs on capping of S-Ig and concanavalin (Con-A)-receptors at 37 degrees C was investigated. Furthermore the effect of Con A on S-Ig capping and vice versa was studied. The results show that only S-Ig on HCL cells could form caps at 4 degrees C in the presence of sodium-azide. Cytochalasin B alone induced a strong inhibition of Con A capping on all 3 cell types, whereas S-Ig capping was unaffected. Colchicine alone had practically no effect. Anti-Ig inhibited subsequent patch and cap formation with Con A on both HCL cells and PLL cells, whereas Con A caps and patches were redistributed by anti-Ig on PLL cells, but not on HCL cells. Conversely, Con A could link S-Ig to other receptors, leading to inhibition of S-Ig capping at 4 degrees C on HCL cells and to co-capping of S-Ig at 37 degrees C on both cell types. In addition Con A induced redistribution of S-Ig caps. The combination of co-capping of S-Ig by Con A, followed by redistribution of the caps by FITC-anti-Ig simulated inhibition of S-Ig capping by Con A on PLL cells. The major conclusions are: in some cases inhibition of capping may actually be caused by redistribution of caps; the energy-independent capping cannot be explained by free diffusion of S-Ig in the membrane through lack of any connexion with receptor-mobility regulating systems. It is proposed that the energy requirement of capping is needed to inactivate a specific mechanism,w which restrains receptor mobility and which is non-operative in HCL cells.","['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Concanavalin A)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Using cinephotomicrography, it was observed that the majority of cells that initially succumbed to PH failed to undergo successful mitosis. With respect ot chromosomal, cell size distribution and flow microfluorometric analyses, the PH-resistant cells are very similar to a spontaneous tetraploid cell line (R1T) previously cloned. The isolated cells, designated R1/P, were also found to be cross-resistant to analogues of PH, namely, lidocaine, tetracaine and dibucaine. The naturally-occurring tetraploid cell line (R1T) was also found to be more resistant to local anesthetics, although not to the same extent as R1/P cells. Since the enzyme that hydrolyzes procaine appears to be absent in all these lymphoid cell lines, the difference in resistance does not appear to depend on differences in the ability of these cells to remove the agent. It is suggested that an alteration in the structure and/or function of the plasma membrane in R1/P cells have rendered them either less sensitive to the membrane-perturbing effects of the local anesthetics or less permeable to local anesthetics molecules.

The second molecule migrated faster on agarose gels and was the predominant species of the two closed circular DNAs. Using the restriction endonuclease maps which we derived, we demonstrate that this novel form I DNA is a smaller homogeneous species of viral DNA, missing about 600 nucleotides found in the linear and larger closed circular DNA molecules.

Most of the data are derived from the experience at the Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, Italy, at the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Md, and at the Farmitalia Research Laboratories, Nerviano, Italy. In vitro cytotoxicity tests are useful for determining the doses to be used in vivo. Antitumor activity tests in mice can be divided into different stages. P388 and L1210 leukemias are generally used in primary screening; the value of adding L1210 leukemia is briefly discussed. Other experimental tumors adopted include disseminated leukemia and transplanted solid tumors. The importance of the route and schedule of treatment is stressed. Drugs should be administered iv in the case of solid tumors, and the schedule of treatment can be adjusted according to the pharmacokinetic properties of the new analog, when these are known. If possible, the parent compound and the new analog should be dissolved in the same solvents. In the toxicity tests, cardiac toxicity deserves particular attention. Until now, the only experimental model in which a number of new anthracyclines have been tested is the rat model proposed by Zbinden. A comparison between cardiotoxicity data obtained in such models and antitumor data obtained in mice shows that cardiac toxicity can be dissociated from the antitumor activity. Knowledge of pharmacokinetic properties of new analogs is of importance for selecting the schedules of treatment and for explaining selective toxic effects.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Naphthacenes)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Leucine completely abolishes this long-term survival by interfering with melphalan uptake into the tumor cells. L-alpha-Amino-gamma-guanidinobutyric acid, the lower homolog of arginine, promotes melphalan uptake in vitro only in the presence of leucine. When administered to mice with melphalan and a dose of leucine which negates the 50% cure rate of melphalan, it reduces the therapeutic interference of leucine.

S-94 is purified more than 20-fold from the 100 000 X g supernatant of murine L or L1210 lymphoma cells by DEAE-Sephadex (A-50) chromatography in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol followed by Sephadex G-200 chromatography in 8 M urea.

Furthermore, most, if not all, cells were induced to produce p30 protein. Similar kinetics were found for the accumulation of M-MuLV-specific RNA in the cytoplasm of induced cells.

Cytotoxic activity for erythroleukemia cells remained after repeated absorption of B6 anti-FV antiserum with Friend-Moloney-Rauscher MuLV lymphoma cells but was removed by absorption with erythroleukemia cells induced by FV or Rauscher Vrus. This serologic test system identified a previously unrecognized cell-surface antigen of mouse leukemia, designated Friend Erythroleukemia (FE) antigen to signify its appearance as a determinant of virally induced erythroleukemic differentiation. FE antigen was not detected on 15 transplanted or primary hematopoietic neoplasms, nor was it detected on cells infected with ecotropic, xenotropic, or dualtropic MuLV isolates in tissue culture. Two spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) nonproducer cells of rats and one of mice express FE antigen in amounts comparable to primary erythroleukemia cells. Absorption tests with FE typing serum indicated that FE antigen was expressed on bone marrow and spleen but not thymus, lymph node, or peripheral blood of uninfected AKR, BALB/c, DBA, and SWR mice; all five tissues from B6 and C57L were negative. Quantitiative absorption tests indicated that the expression of FE antigen, though much lower than on erythroleukemic cells, was greatest on fetal liver, less on bone marrow, and lowest on spleen from BALB and SWR mice. Treatment of BALB/c or SWR fetal liver, bone marrow, spleen, thymus, or lymph node cells with FE typing serum did not result in significant lysis. These observations are consistent with the interpretation that FE antigen is expressed by a minor cell population present in fetal liver, bone marrow, and spleen. Expression of FE antigen, determined by absorption with bone marrow cells, cosegregated with inheritance of the Fv-2s allele in the 17 inbred, 7 recombinant inbred, and 4 congenic mouse strains tested. In summary, the FE antigenic system identifies a cell-surface determinant that has the properties of a SFFV-specified antigen and hematopoietic differentiation alloantigen controlled by the Fv-2 locus. The similarity of FE antigen to Abelson antigen may provide insight into the pathogenic properties of defective transforming MuLV.","['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",['10.1084/jem.149.5.1152 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC2184867,,,

Cells maintained in medium containing glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone exhibit a 10--20% inhibition of growth, whereas progesterone of 17 beta estradiol produce a 40--50% inhibition of growth. The response is due to growth inhibition and not to any cytolytic effect of the steroids. L1210 cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts contain high affinity binding sites for [3H]dexamethasone, [3H]progesterone and [3H]17 beta-estradiol. Competition with various steroids indicate that estrogens bind to one class of cytoplasmic binding sites, while glucocorticoids and progestins bind to a second class of receptor sites. These receptors appear not be be completely responsible for growth inhibition since there is no correlation between the magnitude of growth inhibition and the intracellular concentration of receptor sites, and since the concentration of steroid required to cause significant growth inhibition exceeds those concentrations required to saturate the cytoplasmic receptors.","['0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '0 (Steroids)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",['10.1016/0303-7207(79)90076-5 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effects of inhibitors of oxidative phosphorylation on uptake and retention of DAU and ADR in order to characterize the transport process for these anthracyclines and to clarify further the alteration in resistant cells. In glucose-free medium, uptake of DAU and ADR was accelerated by metabolic inhibitors to a greater extent in resistant cells than in sensitive cells. Under these conditions, drug uptake was similar in sensitive and resistant cells. When glucose was added to the incubation medium in the presence of 2,4-dinitrophenol, efflux of DAU from both sensitive and resistant cells was observed. Net efflux of ADR was also observed with the resistant cells, whereas glucose markedly inhibited 2,4-dinitrophenol-stimulated uptake of ADR by the sensitive cells. Furthermore, in sensitive and resistant cells preloaded with ADR and DAU, efflux of the drugs was inhibited by the addition of 2,4-dinitrophenol. These results suggest that there is an active outward transport mechanism for anthracyclines in P388 leukemia cells and that enhanced activity of this efflux process renders cells highly resistant to the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of ADR and DAU.","['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents to M1 cells in suspension cultures inhibited the induction of differentiation by glucocorticoid (dexamethasone) or the protein inducer. The inhibition was unrelated to cytotoxicity and was reversible. The nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent indomethacin inhibited dexamethasone-induced differentiation only when added before the time of commitment of the cells to differentiation. The indomethacin-mediated inhibition was counteracted by prostaglandins E1 or E2 but not by prostaglandins F1alpha or F2alpha. Prostaglandin E stimulated phagocytosis induced by a suboptimal concentration of dexamethasone, but prostaglandin F did not. Moreover, lysozyme activity, which is a typical biochemical marker of macrophages, was induced in M1 cells by prostaglandin E alone, as well as by inducers of differentiation.

IgG receptors were detected on 19 +/- 1.6% (mean +/- SEM) of neutrophils from 45 normal subjects.

That the characterizations pertained to the transport system per se was ensured, (i) by employing recently developed methods for rapid sampling of cell/substrate mixtures in order to follow isotope movements within a few seconds after initial exposure of cells to substrate; (ii) by utilizing cells rendered, by genetic or chemical means, incapable of metabolizing thymidine; and (iii) by demonstrating conformity of the transport data to an integrated rate equation derived for a simple, carrier-mediated system. The results indicate that thymidine is transported into mammalian cells by a functionally symmetrical, non-concentrative system for which the carrier : substrate dissociation constant ranges from about 100 microM in Chinese hamster ovary cells, to 230 microM in Novikoff hepatoma cells. In all cell lines investigated, the velocity of transport was sufficient to nearly completely equilibrate low concentration of thymidine across the membrane membrane within 15 s.

A distinction was made between glomerulonephritis as a primary disease entity and glomerulonephritis associated with other disease processes. Primary idiopathic glomerulonephritis occurred in all species but was most commonly recognized as a clinically important disease in dogs and cats.

The kinetics of induction were measured by cell growth, cell volume distributions, and [3H]thymidine incorporation. From the volume distributions, it was found that the rate of induction was both agent sensitive and concentration dependent. The changes in volume distributions occurred approximately 4 hr earlier with dimethyl sulfoxide induction relative to butyric acid induction. However, the changes with the butyric acid induction were more dependent on concentration. A decrease in labeling indices during the 12- to 20-hr time period was correlated to a decrease in mean cell volume and an increase in the proportion of G1 cells. After the 20-hr time period of induction, an increase in labeling indices and in the percentage of large cells was observed. The data suggest that a transient block of cells in G1 occurred between 12 to 20 hr, and that the early differentiation involved a volume decrease which was related to a redistribution of cell cycle stages. The study was also shown that the changes of cell volume are a rapid monitor to determine the early events of the differentiation process.","['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",['10.1177/27.1.438503 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

This was evidenced by elevated levels of viral DNA-polymerase in mouse sera. This stimulation of viral replication correlated with aggrevation of viral leukemogenicity, as reflected by increment of splenomegalic response and shortening of survival time. The in vivo potentiation of replication and leukemogenicity of RLV is achieved at least partly by the enhancing factor at the cellular level, since RLV replication was found to be stimulated also in an in vitro system. We assume that the stimulatory effect of the enhancing factor on viral replication is connected with its stimulatory effect on the synthesis of cellular DNA.","['0 (Growth Substances)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)']",['10.1159/000162920 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

This cardiac toxicity seems to be correlated with the maximal plasma DCL concentration, about 130 mg/L in the monkey.

After the rapid intravenous infusion of 10 mg/m2 of radioactive [1- or 4-14C]DCL, 250 muCi per patient, the mean peak plasma concentration of unchanged DCL in four patients was 2.9 +/- 0.3 mg/L.

The current work explores the nature of the agents that produce this effect and the quantitative relationship between the breaks and crosslinks. The protein-associated DNA breaks were produced by a wide variety of intercalators in addition to the above-mentioned compounds: actinomycin D, daunoycin, ethidium and lucanthone (miracil D). Treatment with several drugs that bind to DNA without intercalation, or that inhibit DNA synthesis without binding to DNA, did not cause DNA breaks.

The template activity of the single-stranded DNA, purified by chromatography of denatured calf thymus DNA through hydroxylapatite columns, was found to be equally as sensitive to the inhibition as denatured calf thymus DNA. However, contrary to denatured DNA, the single-stranded DNA thus purified showed no significant binding to adriamycin as analyzed by cosedimentation of the drug and DNA through a sucrose gradient. This indicated that inhibition of RNA synthesis on a single-stranded DNA template might involve a mechanism other than DNA intercalation. Kinetic studies of the inhibition showed that the inhibition of RNA synthesis by adriamycin could not be reversed by increasing the concentrations of RNA polymerase and four nucleoside triphosphates, but it could be reversed by increasing DNA concentrations. Analysis of the size of RNA synthesized indicated that the ultimate size of the product RNA was not altered by adriamycin, suggesting that the drug may inhibit RNA synthesis by reducing RNA chain initiation.","['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'EC 2.7.7.6 (DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases)']",['10.1021/bi00577a035 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In five cases the authors were able to remove these surface immunoglobulins by trypsinization or overnight incubation in serum-free tissue-culture medium. There was no evidence of synthesis of surface immunoglobulins in these cases following incubation in serum-free tissue-culture medium; however, surface immunoglobulins could again be detected after subsequent reintroduction of these hairy cells into the patients' own sera.

The GRSL cells specifically bound purified Rauscher leukemia virus gp70 while the E36 cells exhibited no binding. The hybrids selectively bound Ruascher gp70 depending on the presence of a mouse cellular gene for the ecotropic murine luekemia gp70 receptor. A syntenic relationship was observed between the DIP-3 chromosome marker (on chromosome 5) and the gp70 receptor in primary clones and subclones of these hybrids; this was confirmed by chromosome analysis. The involvement of H-2 in the binding of Rauscher MuLV gp70 could be ruled out, because discordancies of the receptor presence and H-2 absence as well as of the receptor absence and H-2 presence type could be observed.

The heat production per CLL lymphocyte was lower (1.8 pW/cell) than that found in normal lymphocytes (2.6 pW/cell). Due to the high numbers of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood the estimated heat production of the intravascular lymphocyte pool in CLL was considerably higher than in normals. Since the circulating lymphocytes constitute a minute fraction of the total lymphoid mass in CLL it is suggested that the accumulation of metabolically active lymphocytes in blood and tissues may explain the common clinical signs of hypermetabolism in this disease.

The condition is classified as such according to Hardy and Anderson's criteria, accepted by many other authors. Other diseases of known etiology which may present high levels of eosinophils in the peripheral blood, such as parasitosis, allergies, neoplasias, collagenosis, etc., were discounted beforehand. The difficulties in distinguishing between these diseases are discussed; they are often accompanied by clinical manifestations which also arise in very different conditions including eosinophilic leukemia, Engfeldt and Zetterstrom's eosinophilic collagenosis, Loffler's fibroplastic endocarditis, etc. A particularly striking feature of this condition is the formation of large tumor masses of mature eosinophils. They begin in various bones, which they destroy almost completely, and invade the surrounding tissues, destroying them as well. These tumors act similarly to malignant eosinophilic myelocytomas, a fact which has not been reported previously in the literature as far as we know. Although the eosinophils act as though they were neoplastic, they maintain the characteristics of mature cells, both cytomorphologically and ultrastructurally as well as cytochemically (consistently chloroacetate esterase negative). The tendency to diagnose eosinophilic leukemia solely on the basis of the malignancy of the condition and a tissue infiltration of eosinophils without determining the existence of cytologic and/or cytochemical anomalies of the cells showing them to be leukemic is discussed. The authors were unable to find any reports in the literature in which the eosinophils were presented with unmistakeably blastic cellular characteristics. Various nosologic considerations are offered.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The finished virion glycoprotein (gp70) was largely resistant to the action of endoglycosidase H. Chromatography of the glycopeptides of Pr80env in conjunction with endoglycosidase H digestion studies suggested that the precursor contained two distinct major glycosylation sites. Analysis of partial proteolytic cleavage fragments of Pr80env before and after endoglycosidase H treatment placed the two glycosylation sites within a 30,000-dalton region of the apoprotein sequence.

M-MSV-specific RNA was then quantitated in the cytoplasm of several M-MSV-transformed, non-virus-producing, clonal NIH 3T3 cell lines. These lines, designated 71 N clones 5, 6, and 3, have been characterized previously by the degree to which they exhibit transformation properties and transcribe Moloney murine leukemia virus-related RNA (S. Salzberg and M. Green, J. Virol. 13:1001-1004, 1974; N. Tsuchida and M. Green, J. Virol. 14:587-591, 1974). By the criteria of cell morphology and agglutination by concanavalin A, cells of clone 5 are highly transformed, cells of clone 6 are almost normal in the sense that they resemble the parent NIH 3T3 cells, and cells of clone 3 are phenotypically intermediate. In the present study, the amounts of cytoplasmic MSV-specific RNA correlated well with the relative degrees of transformation of the cell lines, varying over 35-fold between the least transformed (clone 6) and most transformed (clone 5) lines. Superinfection of either clone 5 or clone 6 with Moloney murine leukemia virus resulted in a fivefold increase in the MSV-specific RNA in the cell cytoplasm. Evidence from (3)H-labeled complementary DNA:cell DNA hybridization studies indicated that the quantity of M-MSV-specific RNA in the nonproducer lines was not directly related to DNA provirus copy number in the cell DNA. Although clones 5 and 6 differ greatly in transformation characteristics and in MSV-specific RNA content, they each apparently contain about two copies of MSV-specific DNA sequence per haploid genome. Thus, factors such as site of provirus integration may be of primary importance in determining virus-specific transcription and cell transformation.","['0 (RNA, Viral)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",['10.1128/JVI.29.1.76-82.1979 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC353076,,,

These compounds were prepared from the reaction of deacetyl-VLB acid azide with the appropriate amines and were characterized by mass spectral analysis, 1H and 13C NMR spectra, electrometric titration, and infrared spectra. N-Alkylvindesines have reduced activity compared to that of VDS against the Gardner lymphosarcoma (GLS). N-beta-Hydroxyethyl-VDS surpasses vindesine in its activity against the Ridgway osteogenic sarcoma and the GLS, whereas against the B16 melanoma it is less active than VDS. N-beta-(4-Hydroxyphenethyl)-VDS, envisaged as a substrate for the enzyme tryosinase, was shown to be more active than VDS against the B16 melanoma but has only marginal activity against the GLS. In terms of collective antitumor activity against the model systems used, vindesine emerges as the congener with optimum qualities. Bis(N-ethylidenevindesine) disulfide, the first example of a bridged bisvindesine and comparable to VDS in its antitumor profile, shows evidence of activity against a P388/VCR leukemia strain known to be resistant to maytansine as well as to vincristine.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",['10.1021/jm00190a008 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Among normal individuals, groups of 50 adults, 24 children, and 43 term and preterm newborns were each significantly different (p less than 0.001) and the level was positively correlated with age. Three fetal samples of approximately 20 weeks' gestation were near the lower limit of detection of the assay. P component levels in selected groups of patients demonstrated a 1.5 fold elevation of the mean level in 15 patients with high erythrocyte sedimentation rates, no difference in the mean level of 23 patients on warfarin or 16 patients with plasma cell dyscrasia or chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and a depression of the mean level to one fourth of normal in 14 patients with alcoholic liver disease. Among the latter, the prolongation of the prothrombin time was correlated with the depression of P component (p less than 0.05). Conditioned media, even after 10-fold concentration, and lysed cell fractions of cultured adult fibroblasts, B and T lymphocytes, and endothelial and smooth muscle cells failed to demonstrate P component. Circulating levels of P component increase during growth and development to adult life and the hepatocyte is the most likely site of synthesis.

Kinetic parameters for purine/pyrimidine transport were determined by measuring substrate influx into cells in which substrate conversion to nucleotides was negligible either due to lack of the appropriate enzymes or to depletion of the cells of ATP (5'-phosphoribosylpyrophosphate), and by computer fitting exact, integrated rate equations derived for various carrier-mediated transport models directly to zero-trans influx data. The results indicate that different carriers function in the transport of hypoxanthine/guanine, adenine, and uracil with substrate:carrier association constants (K) at 24 degrees C of 300 to 400 muM, 2 to 3 mM, and about 14 mM, respectively, for Novikoff cells. K and Vmax for hypoxanthine transport by L and P388 cells are similar to those for Novikoff cells, but the transport capacity of Chinese hamster ovary cells is much lower and K = 1500 muM. All transport systems are completely symmetrical. Hypoxanthine transport is so rapid that an intracellular concentration of free hypoxanthine (90%) close to that in the medium is attained within 20 to 50 s of incubation at 24 degrees C, at least at extracellular concentrations below K. In cells in which conversion to nucleotides is not blocked free hypoxanthine accumulates intracellularly to steady state levels with equal rapidity and thereafter the rate of hypoxanthine uptake into total cell material is strictly a function of the rate of phosphoribosylation. The low Km systems for hypoxanthine (1 to 9 muM) and adenine (0.2 to 40 muM) uptake detected previously in many types of cells reflect the substrate saturation of the respective phosphoribosyltransferases rather than of the transport system.","['0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)']",['S0021-9258(17)30225-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,

To account for this phenomenon, we have proposed that the extent of aminoacylation of a given tRNA species in vivo controls the relative rate of synthesis or turnover of that species. Previously, we reported that Friend leukemia cells respond to histidine deprivation by increasing their relative level of tRNAHis by as much as two-fold, with no change in the relative level of tRNALeu. In this paper, we show that deprivation of leucine or tryptophan also causes a specific increase in the relative level of tRNAs cognate to the deprived amino acid. At least in the case of tRNATrp, the increases in relative tRNA levels are preceded by extensive declines in the steady-state extent of aminoacylation of the tRNA in vitro. We also find that different isoacceptors may respond differently to amino acid deprivation.

The structure-activity relationships among this class of compounds are discussed. Several derivatives had very high antitumor activity in several tumor systems. Two of the most active derivatives, namely, 1,4-bis(2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethylamino)-9,10-anthracenedione (bisalkylAAD) and 1,4-dihydroxy-5,8-bis(2-[(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethylamino)-9,10-anthracenedione (dihydroxybisalkylAAD), which had curative activity in the above-mentioned tumors, were compared in considerable detail. DihydroxybisalkylAAD showed distinct advantages over bisalkylAAD in several tumor systems and is tenfold more potent with respect to effective dose range. This last difference is important for two reasons. First, these aminoanthraquinones are strong and persistent blue dyes and the administration of lower doses would minimize a potential cosmetic drawback of these compounds. Second and most important, iv administration of dose levels of bisalkylAAD which are within the therapeutic dose range on intermittent dose schedules produced convulsions and immediate death. IV administration of dihydroxybisalkylAAD also caused acute toxicity, but, because of its increased potency relative to antitumor activity and delayed toxicity, this acute toxicity was apparent only at doses well above the therapeutic dose range. All of the aminoanthraquinones evaluated, regardless of their activity as antitumor agents in vivo, proved to be potent inhibitors of DNA and RNA synthesis in vitro and bound strongly to DNA as evidenced by deltaTm values (deltaTm = upward shift in DNA melting temperature). Thus, the strong antitumor activity of aminoanthraquinones would appear to be due to some mechanism other than, or in addition to, DNA binding and inhibition of nucleic acid synthesis.","['0 (Anthraquinones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

In P815 cells treated with [2-14C]psi l Cyd, we have detected radioactivity in nucleotide fractions and in RNA and DNA. Degradation to nucleosides of the labeled triphosphate nucleotide fraction and of RNA showed that the radioactivity present was chromatographically identical to psi l Cyd. Half-saturation concentrations for the incorporation of [2-14C]psi l Cyd into the triphosphate nucleotide fraction and into RNA and DNA were 370, 280, and 94 microgram/ml, respectively, which were greater than 100-fold higher than those for tritiated cytidine. The incorporation of psi l Cyd was competitively inhibited by cytidine. Phosphorylation and incorporation of psi l Cyd into nucleic acids of P815 cells and of a P815 subline resistant to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine are about 2- to 20-fold higher than in P815 sublines resistant to psi l Cyd or to both 5-azacytidine and 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine. These data suggest that the phosphorylation of psi l Cyd and possibly its incorporation into nucleic acids are essential for therapeutic activity in P815 leukemias. In vitro metabolic studies also suggest that psi l Cyd and 5-azacytidine are cross-resistant and that P815 cells resistant to psi l Cyd are collaterally sensitive to 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine. These predictions were confirmed by therapeutic experiments carried out in mice bearing P815 leukemias.","['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '5CSZ8459RP (Cytidine)', 'TDH73L8XQD (pseudoisocytidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

The cell electrophoretic mobility decreased by 18% within 30 min of treatment with 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in highly inducible clones but not in noninducible clones. The reduced mobility persisted for 5 days of incubation with DMSO until hemoglobin synthesis. DMSO treatment for less than 16 hr and subsequent incubation without the drug resulted in the complete recovery of the mobility and no hemoglobin synthesis. Longer exposure to DMSO resulted in the loss of recovery of mobility and an increasing fraction of benzidine-positive cells seen on Day 5. Measurement of the electrophoretic mobility after the removal of acidic sugars by their specific enzymes suggested that hyaluronidase-sensitive negative charges were lost from the cell surface only in highly inducible clones. The mobility reduction associated with hyaluronic acid was also caused by other potent inducers (sodium butyrate, N-methylacetamide, and N,N-dimethylacetamide). These results suggest that the decrease in cell surface glycocalyx might be an early step in the induction of differentiation of Friend erythroleukemia cells.","['EC 3.2.1.35 (Hyaluronoglucosaminidase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Cell counts were not related to the number of smudge cells present; the number of smudge cells were unrelated to the nature of the patient's disease state. We conclude that in the presence of smudge cells, leukocyte counts can be made as reliably by automated methods as by pipette and chamber technics.

In an attempt to obtain a homogeneous cell population, cells were both fractionated by discontinuous albumin density gradient centrifugation (DADGC) and selectively grown in nutrient agar. Both cell preparations underwent the critical point drying technique before examination under both the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and subsequently the light microscope (LM). When the SEM image of individual cells was compared with the corresponding LM image, it was not easy to identify the different cell types, because of the shrinkage and distortion that occurred during their preparation. The shrinkage observed under the SEM amounted to a 45% reduction in mean cell diameter. This shrinkage was confirmed by comparing the SEM and LM images of the same cell. Although shrinkage occurred throughout the dehydration sequence, critical point drying was responsible for a 25% reduction in mean cell diameter. Furthermore, direct observation under LM of fixed cells drying in air from ethanol, revealed visible contraction of the cell and distortion of the cell membrane. We assume that a similar morphological change occurred during critical point drying. We conclude that the shrinkage and distortion, caused by the dehydration process involved in SEM preparation, severely limit the value of a study of surface morphology by SEM in the identification of the different cell types found in human bone marrow.","['0 (Albumins)', '9002-18-0 (Agar)']",['10.1111/j.1365-2818.1979.tb00150.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Three measures of biologic response were examined: ILSmax, the percentage increase in mean life span of leukemic animals at the LD10 dose; D40, the drug dose necessary to provide 40% increase in life span; and CI (=LD 10/D40), the chemotherapeutic index. A cross correlation matrix between these three measures and the LD10 values demonstrates ILSmax and CI to be independent of toxicity. D40 is highly inversely correlated with LD10 and positively correlated with ILSmax, suggesting that this parameter measures a composite of both drug selectivity and toxicity. Superior regression equations resulted at all stages employing ILSmax as a measure of antitumor selectivity. Acceptable equations modeling LD10 could not be obtained. There was a parabolic relationship between agent lipophilic-hydrophilic balance, measured as chromatographic Rm values, and ILSmax. To reduce residual variance in the L1210 screening data, not accepted by this parabolic equation, measures of agent-DNA interaction were investigated as possible indices of site fit. Relative levels of drug-DNA interaction were obtained by spectrofluorimetric quantitation of drug displacement of DNA-bound ethidium. Addition to regression equations of agent C50 values for calf thymus DNA, those micromolar drug concentrations necessary to displace 50% of the ethidium bound to that DNA, provided a significant reduction in the screening data variance. C50 values for drug interactions with poly[d(A-T)] and poly[d(G-C)] were also investigated as possible indicators of drug selectivity towards different DNA sites. Marked differences were observed in the C50 values for the two synthetic nucleic acids, with those for calf thymus DNA and poly[d(G-C)] proving highly covariant. A regression equation containing a positive term in C50[poly[d(G-C)]] and a negative term in C50-[poly[d(A-T)]] provided the greatest acceptance of the variation in the biologic data. The term in C50[poly[d(A-T)]] is the single most important equation term, alone accounting for 35% of the variance in the data. This best equation provides both an adequate summary of the L1210 screening data for the 174 active compounds considered and a physical explanation for the antitumor selectivity for these agents. The major factor influencing antitumor selectivity in these drugs is their ability to distinguish alternating adenine-thymine sequences in DNA.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Quaternary Ammonium Compounds)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",['10.1021/jm00188a005 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

When shifted from permissive (31 degrees C) to nonpermissive (39 degrees C) temperature, cells infected with ts-26 rapidly begin to accumulate gPr90enr, the glycoprotein precursor to the membrane envelope glycoprotein gp70 and to the membrane-associated protein p15E. Simultaneously, formation of these mature virion proteins ceases. In addition, lactoperoxidase-catalyzed surface labeling with 125I--iodine indicates that the plasma membrane of cells infected with ts-26 becomes depleted of gp70 antigens at 39 degrees C. Nevertheless, at 39 degrees C these cells release defective MuLVs which lack gp70 and p15E but contain an outer membrane. The released particles also contain an aberrantly processed form of the major virion core protein p30, and many of these virion cores have an unusual immature crescent shape. It has previously been reported that cells infected with the ts-26 mutant of R-MuLV process a 65,000 dalton precursor (Pr65gag) of the virion core proteins more slowly at 39 degrees C than do cells infected with wild-type virus (Stephenson, Tronick and Aaronson, 1975).

(1977) Science 195, 489--492). We have characterized some of the properties of this probe in sonicated phospholipid vesicles. The CF undergoes a pH-dependent quenching as previously reported and both a pH- and temperature-dependent efflux from vesicles. Decreasing the pH from 7.4 to 5.0 results in almost a 100-fold increase in CF efflux from the vesicles. The simultaneous measurement of cell-associated tritiated lipid and CF fluorescence reveals a discrepancy between the two markers with the tritiated phospholipid becoming associated to 5--10-fold greater extent than the CF. In the presence of cells the leakage of CF from vesicles increases from 1.5- to 10-fold depending on the vesicle composition. This data suggests that interpretations of cell-vesicle interactions followed by the CF technique or other aqueous space markers should be done with caution. However, in experiments where the leakage of CF from vesicles can be controlled, the technique can provide useful information.","['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '0 (Palmitic Acids)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Stearic Acids)']","['0005-2736(89)90007-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(89)90007-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

The effect of polyene antibiotic treatment was lectin and cell specific. Concanavalin A induced agglutination was not inhibited, wheat germ agglutination induced agglutination of untransformed 3T3 interphase cells was not influenced, and other aggregation phenomena, including those of erythrocytes with blood group specific antibodies or divalent cations, were unaffected by polyene treatments. This suggests that the formation of polyene-cholesterol complexes in transformed and erythrocyte cell membranes may specifically affect wheat germ agglutinin receptors and/or secondary events necessary for wheat germ agglutinin induced agglutination. Fluorescence studies of membrane filipin-cholesterol complexes showed that pretreating the cells with wheat germ agglutinin, but not concanavalin A, perturbed the fluorescence properties of filipin. Electron spin resonance studies with spin-labeled fatty acids revealed at best only a slight decrease in fatty acyl chain flexibility following filipin treatment.

These cells retained the surface characteristics of CLL, i.e. the information of mouse RBC rosettes and sparse surface-bound immunoglobulin.

However, previous reports have not noted a clinical presentation which may be confused with lymphoma. This report documents a case of leukemic reticuloendotheliosis in a 29 year old man with clinical findings of diffuse lymphadenopathy, organomegaly and cutaneous involvement. As cytotoxic agents may be dysfunctional in leukemic reticuloendotheliosis, the ability to distinguish between the disorder and a lymphomatous process may be critical to the patient's management. Both morphologic examination of the ""hairy-cell"" and cytochemistry may not give an unequivocal differentiation between these two diseases. However, functional studies of the neoplastic cell, such as cell-marker analysis, phagocytic function and ultrastructural morphology, can define by noninvasive methods the correct diagnosis in the atypical presentation of leukemic reticuloendotheliosis.","['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']","['0002-9343(79)90509-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(79)90509-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

Fifty-one cases of untreated CLL were tested and the lymphocytes of thirty-eight of these cases bore Ig of a single light chain type.

There was a clear relationship between fungal disease and corticosteroid therapy, and the overall incidence of infection was correlated with the degree of neutropenia and corticosteroid treatment. No relationship was found between age, duration of disease, or the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy and infectious complications. Of the 13 infectious episodes, 11 occurred in patients prior to splenectomy. Only two episodes were seen in splenectomized patients, both occurring in the immediate postoperative period. We conclude that splenectomy has a beneficial effect in reducing the incidence of infections in hairy-cell leukemia and that corticosteroids should be used cautiously, since they predispose to opportunistic infection in this disease.",['0 (Adrenal Cortex Hormones)'],['S0006-4971(20)70078-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,

The results allow the following conclusions: (1) As previously reported, transcobalamin (TC) III and to a lesser extent TC I are artifactually elevated in serum. The appear to be released in vitro during the clotting process, presumably from granulocytes. (2) Blood cells of patients with polycythemia vera release exceedingly large amounts of TC I and TC III in vitro. (3) The above findings support, but do not prove, at least a partial granulocytic source of TC I. Nevertheless, factors other than granulocytes influence TC I levels, as disorders characterized by increased TC I (most prominently chronic myelogenous leukemia but also several cases of cancer) manifest relatively little cellular release of TC I in vitro. (4) Despite the serum artifact, the serum abnormalities described in various conditions were seen in plasma also, even though the actual values of themselves were lower in plasma. The chief exception was TC III, which was elevated in plasma only in polycythemia vera (and in a few cases of leukocytosis). (5) EDTA-NaF anticoagulant is not suitable, as it causes plasma dilution, thus explaining previous reports of TC II level differences between serum and plasma. EDTA is therefore a preferable anticoagulant for vitamin B12-binding protein studies, although it too may not be ideal.","['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Transcobalamins)', '8ZYQ1474W7 (Sodium Fluoride)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'Q80VPU408O (Fluorides)']",['10.1093/ajcp/69.1.319 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

This is believed to arise from synthesis by the leukaemic cells of a small molar excess of the light chains incorporated into their surface IgM. Antibodies to this light chain have been raised in rabbits and separated by immunosorption into those directed against idiotypic determinants (anti-Id), and those against determinants also present on other lambda chains (anti-lambda). Both antibodies react with L2C cells via the surface immunoglobulin. In accord with prediction anti-Id is specific for L2C cells while anti-lambda also reacts with 7 per cent of normal nodal lymphocytes. L2C cells are agglutinated strongly by anti-Id, weakly by anti-lambda. Both antisera inhibit migration of the cells, and both can kill them by invoking complement or K-cell cytotoxic mechanisms. The results emphasize the potential of anti-idiotype sera for identifying and specifically attacking neoplastic B lymphocytes.","['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,,,PMC1445483,,,

The development of the enzyme asparaginase from Escherichia coli in the USA and of the serologically different asparaginase from the plant pathogen Erwinia carotovora in this Establishment, has not only added to the choice of antileukaemia drugs but also provided a valuable guide to the selection and development of new therapeutic enzymes. Our own programme has led to the study of enzymes that degrade other amino acids (glutamine, arginine, phenylalanine and tyrosine) that appear to be important to certain leukaemia cells. Microbes with only remote associations with man were considered as a source of these to minimize initial immunological sensitivity. In the case of erwinia asparaginase the benefits of this have probably included a lower incidence of anaphylaxis compared with the escherichia enzyme. The selection of a stable, high-affinity enzyme that operates efficiently under physiological conditions ensures effective depletion of a circulating amino acid but the choice is very limited. It is also difficult to assess from laboratory tests the likely persistence, toxicity and efficacy of the enzyme in clinical use and to arrive at meaningful biological tests for the quality control of the finished product. Some of the difficulties will be described and proposals made for criteria of acceptance for this type of drug in experimental use.","['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 3.5.1.2 (Glutaminase)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Adequate amounts of vindesine for biological testing were prepared by preferential hydrazinolysis of the C23-ester in the vindoline moiety of VLB, followed by hydrogenolysis of the resulting deacetylvinblastine hydrazide. Vindesine in its activity spectrum against rodent tumor systems resembles vincristine (VCR) rather than its parent VLB, while its neurotoxic potential appears to be less than that of VCR. The experimental models developed to estimate this potential include in vitro measurements of axoplasmic transport effects in the cat sciatic nerve and the estimation of neuromuscular disturbances in chickens and monkeys by vindesine in comparison with VCR. A radioimmunoassay for VLB, VCR, and VDS, developed by means of deacetylvinblastine acid azide, has been used to study the pharmacokinetics of vindesine in man. The clinical investigation of vindesine is in progress.

The drug regimen consisted of daily mercaptopurine (MP) and weekly methotrexate (MTX) at the maximum tolerated dose. Of 140 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia allocated to receive this drug regimen during and after cranial irradiation, 8 died in complete remission within 6 months of the end of irradiation. Details of the nature of these deaths are given. This result led the Working Party to modify the chemotherapy scheduled for this stage in treatment. The modified chemotherapy consisted of MP at reduced dosage before and during cranial irradiation and omission of MP and MTX for 3 weeks after irradiation, during which time daily prednisolone with 2 doses of vincristine were substituted. Following that, the treatment reverted to the original schedule of daily MP and weekly MTX at maximum tolerated dose. Of 109 patients allocated to this modified regimen only one died in remission within 24 weeks after cranial irradiation. Analysis of the anti-leukaemic effect of the modified regimen showed that up to 600 days it was at least as effective as the original more intensive regimen. We conclude that there is a definite advantage in keeping chemotherapy to a minimum during and immediately following cranial prophylactic irradiation.","['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['10.1038/bjc.1977.240 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC2025393,,,

Organs in which DL-alanosine accumulates include the kidneys, lungs, liver, and small intestine. Considerable drug-derived radioactivity persists for periods up to 14 days in the hepatic and renal parenchyma. Studies on the clearance of DL-alanosine in mice using a specific enzymatic assay procedure indicated that the plasma half-life of the parent drug was shorter than the half-life of total radioactivity. In both cases, however, the kinetics were complex and not readily resolvable into discrete phases. In murine lymphoblasts (L5178Y/AR) the transport of DL-alanosine was found to be a sodium-stimulated, saturable, and thermosensitive process which was inhibited by L-threonine, L-asparagine, L-glutamine, L-serine, L-leucine, L-isoleucine, L-valine, L-cysteine, and L-homoserine. Kinetic studies on the influence of L-asparagine and L-glutamine on this transport revealed that the inhibition was competitive in nature.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Nitrosamines)', '142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide)', '2CNI71214Y (alanosine)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",,,,,,,,,,,

It is therefore supposed that these antigens should not be associated with predispositional factors of the illness, instead, they are more likely to have influence over the course of the illness itself. Consequently, the authors have examined 15 children of various age who had acute leukemia. All children were examined for all antigens of the first and second HLA system, as well as for ABO and Rh genotype. The patients' blood was also checked for existence of cytotoxic antigens.

The uptake of chromate by the platelets was 2.0 times higher in the RCD as compared to the plasma experiments. An identical pattern for the immediate behaviour of infused labelled platelets was observed in the duplicate studies, and the recovery of platelet-bound radioactivity remained stable at the 90% level during 2 h after infusion. In these experiments the means for platelet mean life span were almost identical, 5.4+/-0.6 and 5.3+/-0.5 days, respectively, and significantly (p less than 0.05) shorter than the mean for a control group consisting of 21 healthy males (6.9+/-0.3 days).

These cores have an average diameter of 850 A, a smooth proteinaceous perimeter, and a collapsed internal strand, and they contain predominantly p30. Treatment of RLV with low levels of Nonidet P-40 for 16 hr at 22 degrees yielded cores that showed (I) a 70% decrease in the number of immature forms and concomitant increase in the number of mature forms, (II) a 60-90% decrease of P70, and (iii) a 30% increase in a 40,000- to 42,000-dalton protein.

The estimated 1% incidence of leukemia in treated Hodgkin's disease patients, however, is greater than would be expected in the general population. There is a vast amount of literature which indicates that alkylating agents, procarbazine and irradiation are leukemogenic and immunosuppressive in animals and man. It is than conceivable that the current intensive treatment programs which use these agents are promoting the development of acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (ANLL). This leukemia has occurred most often in patients whose Hodgkin's disease is poorly controlled and who have received more aggressive therapy. The latent period from the diagnosis of Hodgkin's disease to the diagnosis of leukemia is significantly shorter (p less than .0005) in those patients who have received intensive and near maximal radiotherapy (total nodal irradiation), combination chemotherapy (MOPP or equivalent) or a sequential combination of the two modalities than similar patients who were treated with less than total nodal irradiation and or single agent chemotherapy. The following characteristic features have occurred with sufficient frequency to suggest that the subsequent leukemia is a distinct clinicopathological entity: pancytopenia, megaloblastoid marrow, nucleated red blood cells in the peripheral blood, random chromosomal aberrations of the bone marrow in most patients (94%), and refractoriness to antileukemia therapy (response rate 6.5%) with a very short survival (median one month).",['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],['10.1002/1097-0142(197709)40:3<1280::aid-cncr2820400343>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],,,,,,,,127,,

Increased enzyme activity was found in myelocytic, myelomonocytic and monocytic leukaemia and equally in secondary granulocytosis and polycythaemia vera. Reduced rates were found in lymphocytie leukaemia, malignant lymphoma with bone marrow involvement, and myelophthisic conditions. A rise in urinary lysozyme occurred when the serum level exceeded 50 microgram/ml. Abundant activities were found in myelomonocytic and monocytic leukaemias. Using the bacteriolytic method in blood smears, no enzyme activity was demonstrated in cells of acute or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, in monocytic leukaemia however, almost all cells show strong reaction. In acute myelocytic or myelomonocytic leukaemia, the portion of positive cells changes from case to case depending on the degree of cell differentiation and maturation. In chronic myelocytic leukaemia there was no difference as compared to enzyme activity of myelocytes in bone marrow of control cases. Thus the bacteriolytic demonstration of lysozyme in blood smears may additionally contribute to distinction of different types of blastic leukaemias, and serum lysozyme also may allow more reliable insight into granulocytic and monocytic myelopoiesis than morphologic studies of blood or bone marrow smears can do, e.g. in agranulocytosis and pancytopenia.",['EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)'],['10.1007/BF01478834 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Seven patients with acute myelogenous leukemia received HLA-matched leukocytes during the period of maximal granulocytopenia associated with initial remission induction therapy; 20 concurrently treated patients who did not receive leukocyte transfusions were the control group. The patients receiving HLA-matched leukocytes had significantly fewer (P = 0.043) infectious episodes (not bacteriologically proven) during the study period, and remission occurred in 5 of the 7, compared with 10 of the 20 controls.

Whether or not this close cellular association corresponded to emperipolesis could not be determined with phase and interference contrast cinemicrography alone. In combination with transmission electron microscopy, it could be demonstrated that the compartment, in which the spread leukemia cells move, is not the cytoplasm of the target cells, but the narrow space created by the target cells and the underlying glass surface. Thus, emperipolesis could be ruled out for L 5222 leukemia cells.

Nine also received radiotherapy. The relative risk for patients given chemotherapy was 36.1 and rose to 171.4 for those surviving for two years (rate = 13.75 per 1000 patients per year). To evaluate the role of therapy versus underlying disease, a historical control of 13,309 patients with ovarian cancer in the National Cancer Institute's End Results Program was analyzed. No excess of leukemia was noted in this group, even among 6596 women receiving radiation.

Whenever there was neoplastic involvement of the spleen by MLV, the hepatic lesions produced by PCB were more pronounced than in those of non-MLV inoculated mice. Mice were exposed to PCB Aroclors, 1254, 1242, and 1221 for six months. Aroclors 1254 and 1242 were hepatotoxic with Aroclor 1254 causing death. Aroclor 1221 did not affect the mice.

The absence of hemoglobin abnormalities in the parents led us to suspect a latent malignant disease that, on follow-up, was confirmed to be myelomonocytic leukemia. Hemoglobin biosynthetic studies provided evidence of unbalanced synthesis of globin subunits by reticulocytes, while the production of non-alpha chains was equal to that of alpha chains in bone marrow cells. The expression of red cell antigen i was increased, while those of I, A, and A1 antigens were found to decrease progressively. Two populations of erythrocytes, A-positive and A-negative, were distinguished and could be separated by differential agglutination. Unbalanced globin chain synthesis, increased fetal hemoglobin, and antigenic changes of the membrane were shown to be restricted to the A-negative population. The biologic data were not entirely consistent with a genuine reversion to fetal erythropoiesis.

Analysis of S. faecalis values in the serum in normal subjects and in patients with various disorders showed that levels of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate are raised in coeliac disease, leukaemia, rheumatoid arthritis, and schizophrenia. 5-Methyltetrahydrofolate is readily absorbed by normal human subjects and by patients with pernicious anaemia but poorly absorbed by patients with coeliac disease or leukaemia. 5-Methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate was quickly absorbed by normal human subjects, being reflected by a considerably raised level of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in serum when sodium bicarbonate was given by mouth before the 5-methyl-5,6-dihydrofolate.

Essentially all the CLL cases (15 of 16) had lower NA-AAF induced repair synthesis values than the normal subjects. Concurrent measurements for the levels of 3H-labeled 7,12-dimethyl-benz(a)anthracene (DMBA) to the DNAs of the normal and CLL lymphocytes after 18 h of culturing in 5 micronM DMBA have shown that 14 of 16 CLL cases had reduced levels of DNA bound carcinogen when compared to the normal individuals.

Lymphocytes from each CLL patient demonstrated a restriction of VH subgroups expressed on the cell membrane; six were restricted to the VHI subgroup, seven to VHII, and seven to the VHIII subgroup. This restriction gave further evidence for monoclonality of the membrane-bound Ig and the leukemic cell proliferation.

Patients with common variable hypogammaglobulinemia, thymoma and hypogammaglobulinemia, ataxia telangiectasia, and selective IgA deficiency had significantly decreased mean serum IgE concentrations. In turnover studies, this was found to be due to decreased IgE synthesis. In spite of these depressed mean values, some patients with common variable hypogammaglobulinemia had normal serum IgE concentrations and synthetic rates. Patients with the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome had a significantly elevated mean serum IgE concentration. In one of four patients studied with the turnover technique, a strikingly high IgE concentration was present and was associated with an elevated IgE synthetic rate. Three other patients had both normal serum IgE concentrations and synthetic rates. Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia had significantly decreased mean serum concentrations and synthetic rates for IgE. The depressed IgE synthesis was associated with a significantly prolonged IgE half-life. Patients with Hodgkin's disease had significantly increased serum IgE concentrations. One of three patients studied had a high serum IgE concentration and synthetic rate of IgE. The two other patients had normal serum IgE concentrations associated with normal synthetic rates. Finally patients with protein-losing enteropathy or familial hypercatabolic hypoproteinemia had normal IgE concentrations associated with normal IgE metabolic parameters. In these cases, the disorder in the catabolic rate was not severe enough to affect the total amount of circulating IgE because IgE normally has a very high fractional catabolic rate. In general, IgE levels in a variety of disease states were correlated with IgE synthetic rates and abnormalities in the catabolic rate of IgE in disease did not exert an important effect on IgE concentration.","['0 (Immunoglobulin A)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",['10.1172/JCI108695 [doi]'],,,,,,,PMC372281,,,

Strains of the following bacteria were used in this study: Arizona hinshawii, Escherichia coli strains 1 and 2, Bacillus globigii, Brucella melitensis, Corynebacterium diphtheriae strains 1 and 2, Corynebacterium xerosis, Sarcina lutea, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. For identification of immunoglobulin-bearing lymphocytes, a strain of E. coli that did not bind to human lymphocytes was coated with anti-human light-chain antibody. Labeling of lymphocytes with bacteria was promoted by centrifugation. In the eight CLL patients studied, in which greater than 90% of the lymphocytes were leukemic cells, 52 to 77% were labeled by anti-human light-chain antibody-E. coli, 80 to 93% were labeled by Br. melitensis, and 78 to 95% were labeled by E. coli 1 compared to 11 to 24, 11 to 22, and 30 to 44%, respectively, in normal individuals, Thus, Br. melitensis, E. coli 1, and the anti-human light-chain antibody-E. coli may have diagnostic value for CLL. The percentage of the lymphocyte population that bound each of the other bacteria varied from patient to patient. Preliminary results obtained by studying the pattern of binding of E. coli 2, B. globigii, Sa. lutea, or S. aureus by leukemic lymphocytes suggest that categories of CLL patients may be distinguished by this method.","['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)']",,,,,,,,,,,

However, women exposed to lower doses of radiation in the pelvic area, in the induction of an artificial menopause, appear to show increased risks of both leukemia and cancers of those sites directly in the radiation field. The studies of these two types of radiation exposure are reviewed. The findings may possibly be reconciled with each other on the basis of the distribution of radiation dose to the bone marrow. Irradiation for cancer of the cervix delivers radiation doses to a small portion of the marrow which are probably lethal for most marrow cells. The mean dose to cells distant from the cervix may be too small to produce a detectable increase in leukaemia incidence. The lower and more uniformly distributed radiation dose used to induce an artificial menopause will be less lethal for marrow cells and may consequently deliver a higher ""effective"" marrow dose to surviving--cells, resulting in an increased leukemia risk.",,['10.1002/1097-0142(197704)39:4+<1901::aid-cncr2820390826>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The results indicate that the surface morphology of leukemic cells is a stable cytologic parameter, if certain technical prerequisits are fulfilled.

The capacities of mouse reaginic serum (MRS), rat reaginic serum, and IgEr to inhibit the binding of radiolabeled 125I-IgEr to RBL cells were shown to be similar. These results suggest that the binding of IgE of either species occurs on the same or on adjacent receptor sites of mast cells and RBL cells. The antigenic cross-reactivity between IgEm and IgEr was established by depletion of the reaginic activity from MRS by treatment of MRS with anti-epsilon. The reaginic activity of MRS could be recovered by the addition of IgEr to anti-epsilon:IgEm complexes.

It is argued that the unusual economic environment of the delivery of catastrophic illness care works with the ""social contract"" in medicine to encourage the use of innovative therapies, even before their efficacy has been demonstrated and often irrespective of their costs, in striking contrast with the conventional innovation adoption process. The primary constraint on catastrophic illness treatment may well be the technology or the state of knowledge. In the case of the management of leukemias in Connecticut, decisions to use drug therapies appear to have been based on a treatment trend rather than on the inherent merits of the therapies. The trend seems to have spread from the treatment of one leukemia, which responded significantly, to the management of three other leukemias. The influence on treatment decisions of a few indiviudal varibles differed across the leukemia. For example, treatment decisions in the acute leukemias were unrelated to the patient's economic status, whereas receipt of chemotherapy for one of the chronic leukemias was significantly positively correlated with economic status.",,['10.1097/00005650-197701000-00002 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Regardless of AgB phenotype, BN backcrosses produced low levels of cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CMC) that were comparable to those of BN parents. Le backcrosses developed high levels of CMC similar to those produced in Le parents. An inverse relationship between levels of CMC and serum antibodies (cytotoxic for tumor cells and anti-p30 of MuLV) was observed; BN parents and backcrosses produced high levels of serum antibodies whereas levels in Le parents and backcrosses were low. LBN hybrids developed relatively high levels of CMC and serum antibodies. An additional finding was that the CMC response in Le parents and back-crosses was directed primarily against tumor-associated antigens rather than histocompatability antigens expressed on the tumor cells. The results suggest that humoral and cellular responses to Moloney sarcoma in rats are not determined solely by the major AgB histocompatibility locus but do have a genetic association. This genetic association was detected with a 51Cr release assay which detects T-cells, suggesting that select populations of effector T-cells may be genetically regulated.","['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens)']",['10.1002/ijc.2910190114 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Little difference from that of normal CFUc was found in the radiosensitivity of two mouse myeloid leukemia cell lines. The effect of TBI on growth of WEHI-3 or J774 cells in millipore diffusion chambers was stimulatory. These AML cell lines as well as others derived from Friend or Abelson virus infected in vitro long term mouse marrow cultures showed some morphologic differentiation by 7 days growth in diffusion chambers in irradiated heterologous rat hosts, but immature cells predominated by day 21.

A salient conclusion from this analysis is that the present drugs in clinical use are more hydrophilic than one might expect. The reason for this may be that they have been developed using leukemia as the test system which may in part account for the fact that while the currently used drugs are effective against leukemia, they are not effective in general against solid tumors.","['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '0 (Triazenes)', 'CUJ6745Z9J (Aniline Mustard)']",,,,,,,,,54,['CA 11110/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],

Follow-up was for at least six years. At diagnosis, 17 patients had a major population of chromosomally abnormal cells and of these 11 had identifiable clones. The commonest abnormality was hyperdiploidy. Eight patients had predominantly normal cells, but four of these had a minor abnormal clone. In remission, some samples were completely normal but, when pooled, remission samples had a minor population of chromosomally aberrant cells which were rarely clonal. The incidence of structural abnormalities was the same in patients who ultimately relapsed and those who remained in first remission at the end of the study, but the presence of hyperdiploid cells and/or clones in remission was more frequently associated with subsequent relapse. Relapse patterns were of two kinds: in three patients there was a return of the chromosomal abnormalities seen at diagnosis; in six others, chromosomal features in relapse were distinct from those at diagnosis. It is suggested that relapse associated with distinct chromosomal features may represent malignant transformation of a previously unaffected cell line. While chromosomal abnormalities seen prior to treatment can be related to the leukaemic event alone, abnormalities seen in remission and in relapse may result partly from drug and X-ray treatment.

The granules appear to possess tissue thromboplastin activity by both immunologic and clotting assays. Coagulation studies in APL are generally consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Observations in the 19th century clearly established CNS leukemia as a disease involving the leptomeninges. Although infiltration of the leptomeninges by leukemic cells remains the principal CNS lesion in patients with this disease, other histopathologic changes have become evident with the development of antileukemic therapy. During the early years of chemotherapy, as patient survival increased, the effects of chronic meningeal leukemia, e.g., increased intracranial pressure, became prominent. Only recently, following effective control of CNS leukemia with chemotherapy and irradiation, did it become clear that current methods of treatment can produce neurotoxic effects. Two specific examples are leukoencephalopathy and mineralizing microangiopathy, both apparently induced by the effects of radiation on the microvasculature. Only through careful prospective studies can the consequences and actual incidence of these two lesions be determined. These results will permit sounder judgments of whether the risks of CNS radiotherapy outweigh the known benefits.",['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],,,,,,,,,51,,

At different intervals over a period of 20 d changes in surface characteristics were examined by labelling the cells with AcALLG, ATCG as well as with polyvalent AIg. The evaluation was performed by using direct immunofluorescence. In addition, the ability to form rosetts with SRBC, AET-treated sheep erythrocytes, mouse red blood cells and EoxAC was tested. On day 0 of the diffusion chamber culture the cells only carried cALLA, and no rosette formation was observed. In the course of the diffusion chamber culture the cells unequivocally developed T-cell antigen, and in 1 of 2 experiments they further acquired a receptor for forming AET- and E-rosettes. Conversely, in the other experiment a receptor for mouse red blood cells was detected in a considerable portion of the cells. Our data show that the rather undifferentiated Reh line cells in vitro are able to develop features of mature T-cells and attributes of early B-cells during the diffusion chamber culture.

Numerical and structural chromosome changes in bone marrow cells have been described in subjects with benzene haemopathy. Increased rates of structural chromosomal aberrations both of the ""unstable"" and of the ""stable"" type in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes have been observed not only in subjects with chronic benzene poisoning, but also in individuals with past benzene haemopathy and in subjects with past benzene exposure without signs of poisoning; these findings persisted for years or decades after cessation of exposure. In some cases of benzene-induced leukaemias the cytogenetic pattern was variable, as it is true also for the ""spontaneous"" acute leukaemias. The possible implications of the finding of chromosome damage from benzene to bone marrow cells for the occurence of leukaemias are discussed.

FLV-containing leukemic cells markedly depressed the humoral immune response to SRBC in the appropriate mouse strain. Both immunosuppression and leukemogenesis were readily transmitted by cell-free virus-containing homogenates of the FLV leukemic splenocytes into normal BALB/c mice. In the present study it was found that both Friend leukemic splenocytes as well as virus containing extracts from the leukemic cells were neutralized by heating and by specific antisera. Suppressive activity passed through a 0.45 mu filter but not a 300,000 MW filter and could be pelleted at 100,000 x g. They were also highly resistant to inactivation by irradiation. Mice given leukemic splenocytes after irradiation with up to 32.000 rads still developed leukemia. Addition of either normal or irradiated FLV-leukemic cells to normal spleen cell cultures in vitro markedly suppressed antibody formation. At least 32,000 rads were required to significantly impair the immuno-suppressive activity of the FLV-leukemic cells.

The first lymphokine described was the macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) which has been studied most extensively with regard to its chemical and biological properties. Using sensitive radiolabelling techniques and an antiserum against highly purified fractions of MIF we were able to identify several products of activated guinea pig lymphocytes with different molecular weights of 15.000, 30.000, 45.000, 60.000 which all had an isoelectric point of 5.2 and were all inhibitory to macrophage migration. It is suggested, that these molecules are oligomers of a common subunit of molecular weight 15.000. It was further shown, that molecules of the same physical-chemical and serological characteristics are produced by activated B-cells, L2C leukemia cells and growing fibroblasts, thus further substantiating earlier reports on the production of MIF by lymphoid and non-lymphoid cells. The described molecules were also shown not to contain determinants of the major histocompatibility complex and to be distinct from lymphotoxin, another lymphocyte activation product. It is concluded, that MIF is not a single molecule but rather a system of structurally related molecules. Their interaction with macrophages and possible relationships to macrophage activating factor is discussed.","['0 (Leukocyte Migration-Inhibitory Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",['10.1007/BF00223364 [doi]'],,,,,,,,121,,

Identification of virus and cell surface antigens in situ has been accomplished in indirect reactions by conjugated and unconjugated markers. Hemocyanin (Hcy) from whelk, Busycon canniculatum, has been developed as an immunospecific marker for virion and cell surface labeling in the electron microscope. Its size (approximately 30 x 50 nm) and distinct cylindrical shape permit easy visualization in the SEM and TEM. The Hcy method involves the preparation of antisera to Hcy in appropriate hosts for use in an unlabeled antibody macromolecular procedure based exclusively on antigen-antibody affinity to couple the macromolecule to the antigen site. Further correlative data from fluorescence microscopy can be obtained from similarly labeled samples by binding fluorescein to the bridging antibodies used in the Hcy technique. The usefulness of the Hcy marker system was demonstrated using antisera to the major envelope and cell surface glycoprotein (gp70) of Rauscher murine leukemia virus (R-MuLV), a type C retrovirus. The antiserum was shown to bind to the virion and cell surfaces of virus-infected cells in the homologous virus-infected cell system. It also demonstrated the expression of R-MuLV gp70-related antigens on a murine cell line Mm5mt/c1 which produces mouse mammary tumor virus (MuMTV), A type B retrovirus. Furthermore, when used in the Hcy marker system this antiserum was able to distinguish type B from type C budding virus on the same cell. Examples of other marker systems (ferritin, peroxidase, colloidal gold, and latex) used to show anti-gp70 serum reactivity will be presented to demonstrate their applicability to cell surface labeling studies. Methods for the preparation of immunoreagents and labeling of cells are discussed.","['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9013-72-3 (Hemocyanins)']",,,,,,,,,,,

Reactions initiated by tissue factor bypass many of the early stages of coagulation (contact phase) and involve factors VII, X, V, II and fibrinogen but also factor IX (and VIII) as it was recently demonstrated. So, it appears that tissue factor has a key-role in the haemostasic process as it has been suggested by the mildness or the absence of haemorrhagic syndrome in contact factors deficiencies. Tissue factor activity has been found in many types of cells, especially in white bloods cells. Experimental studies have demonstrated the presence of tissue factor activity in polymorphonuclears, lymphocytes, monocytes (or macrophages). This activity is enhanced by gram-negative endotoxin stimulation, inflammation, cell mediated immunologic phenomena or malignancy. These data are in good agreement with a wild range of features observed in human pathology: fibrin deposits in inflammatory lesions, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) during the course of gram-negative septicemias or acute promyelocytic leukemias, local thrombi at the early phase of graft rejection. The protective effect of a phospholipase C against DIC induced in rats by tissue factor infusion suggests in the future, a specific therapy would be possible in man that, in the frequent clinical conditions involving clotting activation through tissue factor pathway.","['0 (Blood Coagulation Factors)', '9001-31-4 (Fibrin)', '9035-58-9 (Thromboplastin)']",,,,,,,,,32,,
