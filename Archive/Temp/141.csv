Epub 2007 May 24.,"The Wilms' tumor gene WT1 is overexpressed in most of human leukemias regardless of disease subtypes. To characterize the expression pattern of WT1 during normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis, we generated a knock-in reporter green fluorescent protein (GFP) mouse (WT1(GFP/+)) and assayed for WT1 expression in normal and leukemic hematopoietic cells. In normal hematopoietic cells, WT1 was expressed in none of the long-term (LT) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and very few (<1%) of the multipotent progenitor cells. In contrast, in murine leukemias induced by acute myeloid leukemia 1 (AML1)/ETO+TEL/PDGFbetaR or BCR/ABL, WT1 was expressed in 40.5 or 38.9% of immature c-kit(+)lin(-)Sca-1(+) (KLS) cells, which contained a subset, but not all, of transplantable leukemic stem cells (LSCs). WT1 expression was minimal in normal fetal liver HSCs and mobilized HSCs, both of which are stimulated for proliferation. In addition, overexpression of WT1 in HSCs did not result in proliferation or expansion of HSCs and their progeny in vivo. Thus, the mechanism by which expansion of WT1-expressing cells occurs in leukemia remains unclear. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that the WT1(GFP/+) mouse is a powerful tool for analyzing WT1-expressing cells, and they highlight the potential of WT1, as a specific therapeutic target that is expressed in LSCs but not in normal HSCs.","['Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA. hnaoki@stanford.edu']","['CA55209/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA86017/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 24.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is generally regarded as a stem cell disease. In CD34-positive AML, the leukemic stem cell has been recognized as CD38 negative. This CD34+CD38- population survives chemotherapy and is most probable the cause of minimal residual disease (MRD). The outgrowth of MRD causes relapse and MRD can therefore serve as a prognostic marker. The key role of leukemogenic CD34+CD38- cells led us to investigate whether they can be detected under MRD conditions. Various markers were identified to be aberrantly expressed on the CD34+CD38- population in AML and high-risk MDS samples at diagnosis, including C-type lectin-like molecule-1 and several lineage markers/marker-combinations. Fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis revealed that marker-positive cells were indeed of malignant origin. The markers were neither expressed on normal CD34+CD38- cells in steady-state bone marrow (BM) nor in BM after chemotherapy. We found that these markers were indeed expressed in part of the patients on malignant CD34+CD38- cells in complete remission, indicating the presence of malignant CD34+CD38- cells. Thus, by identifying residual malignant CD34+CD38- cells after chemotherapy, MRD detection at the stem cell level turned out to be possible. This might facilitate characterization of these chemotherapy-resistant leukemogenic cells, thereby being of help to identify new targets for therapy.","['Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 24.,"Several histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), which have recently entered early clinical trials, exert their anticancer activity in part through the induction of apoptosis although the precise mechanism of this induction is not known. Induction of apoptosis by structurally diverse HDACi in primary cells from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and different leukemic cell lines was mediated by the Bcl-2 regulated intrinsic pathway and demonstrated a requirement for de novo protein synthesis. A marked time-dependent induction of the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, Bim, Noxa and Bmf was observed, which preceded the induction of apoptosis. A key role for both Bim and Noxa was proposed in HDACi-mediated apoptosis based on our findings that siRNA for Bim and Noxa but not Bmf largely prevented the HDACi-induced loss in mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase processing and phosphatidylserine externalization. Noxa, induced by HDACi, in CLL cells and tumor cell lines, bound extensively to Mcl-1, a major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member present in CLL cells. Our data strongly suggests that HDACi induce apoptosis primarily through inactivation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members by increases in Bim and Noxa and highlights these increases as a potential clinical target for CLL/lymphoma therapy.","['MRC Toxicology Unit, Hodgkin Building, University of Leicester, Leicester, UK.']","['MC_U132615750/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MC_U132670597/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 24.,"Leukemic cells exert immunosuppressive effects that interfere with dendritic cell (DC) function and hamper effective antileukemic immune responses. Here, we sought to enhance the immunogenicity of leukemic cells by loading them with the double-stranded (ds) RNA Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) ligand polyriboinosinic polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)), mimicking viral infection of the tumor cells. Given the responsiveness of DC to TLR ligands, we hypothesized that the uptake of poly(I:C)-loaded leukemic cells by immature DC (iDC) would lead to DC activation. Primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and AML cell lines markedly responded to poly(I:C) electroporation by apoptosis, upregulation of TLR3 expression, enhanced expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and costimulatory molecules and by production of type I interferons (IFN). Upon phagocytosis of poly(I:C)-electroporated AML cells, DC maturation and activation were induced as judged by an increased expression of MHC and costimulatory molecules, production of proinflammatory cytokines and an increase of T helper 1 (T(H)1)-polarizing capacity. These immune effects were suboptimal when AML cells were passively pulsed with poly(I:C), indicating the superiority of poly(I:C) transfection over pulsing. Our results demonstrate that poly(I:C) electroporation is a promising strategy to increase the immunogenicity of AML cells and to convert iDC into activated mature DC following the phagocytosis of AML cells.","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Antwerp University Hospital, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erythroid precursors (EPs) may be indistinguishable from myeloblasts in BM sections (aspirate clots/cores). We compare the usefulness of immunohistochemistry (IHC) [ie, CD34, CD117, myeloperoxidase (MPO), Hemoglobin A1 (HbA1), and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)] of BM sections (IHC-BM) with BMA, bone marrow touch preparation (BMTP), and flow cytometry (FC) BCs. DESIGN: The initial BC (48), percentage (%) of Eps (38) (both based on initial 100 to 600-cell counts), and FC expressions of CD34, CD117, Glycophorin A(GLY A), and TdT (44) were tabulated from 50 BMs (MDS, MDS/MPD, or AML). BMAs (48) and BMTPs (25) subsequently received 500-cell counts. IHC-BM was performed (45:formalin, 5:B5-fixed) [CD34 (46), CD117 (45), HbA1 (45), TdT (42), and MPO (45)]. RESULTS: Retrospective BMA BCs revealed a 31% (15/48) discrepant rate between the original/retrospective BMA BCs; 80% revealed an underestimated initial BC. There was a 28% discordance rate between the retrospective BMA and BMTP reviews; 77% showed a higher BMTP BC. IHC showed significantly higher BCs in 19% (9/47), resulting in a different dx (5). However, CD34 and CD117 IHCS revealed lower BCs in 38% and 48%, respectively. The CD34 IHC results were primarily due to CD34-negative blasts by FC. The CD117 IHC results were largely unexplained. EPs were CD34 and CD117-negative. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Evaluation for MDS/AML requires 500-cell counts of BMAs and/or BMTPs. (2) CD34 and/or CD117 blasts by FC indicate IHC-BM may increase BC accuracy. (3) CD34 is more reliable than CD117 by IHC; however, in combination, they are most reliable and should be performed on BM clots/cores due to variable reactivity.","['Divisions of Hematopathology, Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7525, USA. cdunphy@unch.unc.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 20.,"The molecular mechanisms that control the proliferation and differentiation of specific cell types remain poorly understood. Positive ETS factors play important roles in mediating proliferative responses to Ras/MAPK signaling in many cell types following mitogenic stimulation. PE-1/METS, a member of the ETS-domain family transcription factors that functions as a transcriptional repressor, can block mitogenic responses mediated by positively acting Ets factors. The anti-proliferative functions of PE-1/METS require its interaction with DP103, a multifunctional DEAD-box protein that mediates interactions with corepressor proteins and acts in a cooperative manner with Rb family members and to repress cell cycle control genes. ETS-2 repressor factor (ERF) is structurally related to and also functions as a transcriptional repressor, but endogenous target genes and mechanisms of repression remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that like PE-1/METS, ERF-mediated repression also requires DP103, and that ERF negatively regulates the c-myc and cdc2 genes. In contrast to PE-1/METS, however, ERF-mediated repression of these genes is inactivated by MAPK signaling through phosphorylation sites that are ERF-specific. Furthermore, constitutive activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway in RAW 264.7 cells transformed by the v-Abelson leukemia virus is associated with constitutive inactivation of ERF in this cell type. We propose that ERF and PE-1/METS function to impose 'repression checkpoints' on a subset of cell cycle control genes that are differentially regulated by growth factor signaling pathways that control proliferation and differentiation and that ERF is targeted for inactivation by transforming oncogenes such as vAbl.","['Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program, Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA.']","['R01 HL59694/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM08666/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, a human chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line (K562) was induced to differentiate into megakaryocytes by TPA, and erythroid by STI571. A human acute myeloblastic leukemia cell line (HL60) was also induced to differentiate into monocytes by TPA and VD3, and granulocyte by ATRA. TPA induced transient increase of telomerase activity (mainly nuclear fraction) during megakaryocytic differentiation, while the expression of hTERT decreased gradually throughout the same period. Pretreatment with PKC inhibitors inhibited the megakaryocytic differentiation, transient increase of telomerase activity, while recombinant PKC increased telomerase activity. ChIP assay resulted STAT3 and STAT5 dissociated from the hTERT promoter, indicating that STAT3 and STAT5 are one of the transcriptional regulators. These results suggest that telomerase activity is regulated by two mechanisms during megakaryocytic differentiation.","['Humanities and Sciences School, Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 24.,"OBJECTIVES: It is believed that adipose tissue acts as an endocrine organ by producing inflammatory mediators and thereby contributes to the increased cardiovascular risk seen in obesity. A link between adipose tissue mass and angiogenesis has been suggested. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) seems to be implicated in this process. Members of the glycoprotein (gp)130 ligand family regulate VEGF expression in other cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: We used tissue explants as well as primary cultures of preadipocytes and adipocytes from human subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue to investigate whether the gp130 ligands oncostatin M (OSM), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) regulate VEGF expression in human adipose tissue. Human subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue responded to treatment with IL-6 and OSM with a significant increase in VEGF production. Human preadipocytes were isolated from subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. Adipocyte-differentiation was induced by hormone-supplementation. All cell types responded to IL-6 and OSM with a robust increase in VEGF protein production and a similar increase in VEGF-specific mRNA. Furthermore, IL-1beta synergistically enhanced the effect of OSM on VEGF production. AG-490, a JAK/STAT inhibitor, abolished the OSM-dependent VEGF induction almost completely. In mice, IL-6 and OSM increased serum levels of VEGF and VEGF mRNA and vessel density in adipose tissue. CONCLUSION: We speculate that the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and OSM might support angiogenesis during adipose tissue growth by upregulating VEGF.","['Department of Internal Medicine II, Medical University Vienna, Waehringer Guertel 18-20, A-1090 Vienna, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 24.,"Histone modifications play a crucial role during embryonic stem (ES) cell differentiation. During differentiation, binding of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which mediates trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (K27me3), is lost on developmental genes that are transcriptionally induced. We observed a global decrease in K27me3 in as little as 3 days after differentiation of mouse ES cells induced by retinoic acid (RA) treatment. The global levels of the histone K27 methyltransferase EZH2 also decreased with RA treatment. A loss of EZH2 binding and K27me3 was observed locally on PRC2 target genes induced after 3 days of RA, including Nestin. In contrast, direct RA-responsive genes that are rapidly induced, such as Hoxa1, showed a loss of EZH2 binding and K27me3 after only a few hours of RA treatment. Following differentiation induced by leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF) withdrawal without RA, Hoxa1 was not transcriptionally activated. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of EZH2 resulted in loss of K27me3 during LIF withdrawal, but the Hoxa1 gene remained transcriptionally silent after loss of this repressive mark. Induction of histone hyperacetylation overrode the repressive K27me3 modification and resulted in Hoxa1 gene expression. Together, these data show that there are multiple temporal phases of derepression of PRC2 target genes during ES cell differentiation and that other epigenetic marks (specifically, increased acetylation of histones H3 and H4), in addition to derepression, are important for gene-specific transcriptional activation. This report demonstrates the temporal interplay of various epigenetic changes in regulating gene expression during early ES cell differentiation.","['Cancer Biology Program, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706, USA.']","['R01 DK064243/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 GM008692/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-DK064243/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 24.,"AIMS: To investigate the relationship between extremely low frequency magnetic field (ELF-MF) exposure and mortality from leukaemia and brain tumour in a cohort of Swiss railway workers. METHODS: 20,141 Swiss railway employees with 464,129 person-years of follow-up between 1972 and 2002 were studied. Mortality rates for leukaemia and brain tumour of highly exposed train drivers (21 muT average annual exposure) were compared with medium and low exposed occupational groups (i.e. station masters with an average exposure of 1 muT). In addition, individual cumulative exposure was calculated from on-site measurements and modelling of past exposures. RESULTS: The hazard ratio (HR) for leukaemia mortality of train drivers was 1.43 (95% CI 0.74 to 2.77) compared with station masters. For myeloid leukaemia the HR of train drivers was 4.74 (95% CI 1.04 to 21.60) and for Hodgkin's disease 3.29 (95% CI 0.69 to 15.63). Lymphoid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's disease and brain tumour mortality were not associated with magnetic field exposure. Concordant results were obtained from analyses based on individual cumulative exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Some evidence of an exposure-response association was found for myeloid leukaemia and Hodgkin's disease, but not for other haematopoietic and lymphatic malignancies and brain tumours.","['Department of Social and Preventive Medicine, University of Berne, Switzerland.

Epub 2007 May 24.,"BACKGROUND: The invasion of first trimester extravillous trophoblast (EVT) to decidua is an important event in placentation. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is an essential factor for mouse implantation, and it is reported that LIF may be involved in human first trimester EVT invasion. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is also known as a critical factor for first trimester EVT invasion. In this study, we investigated the role of LIF in PGE2 production and EVT invasion using a human first trimester EVT cell line, HTR-8/SVneo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Co-stimulation with LIF and IL-1beta induced higher amounts of PGE2 production and further migration of HTR-8/SVneo cells compared with that by stimulation with LIF or IL-1beta alone. Enhanced PGE2 production was most probably due to the enhanced expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1). PGE2 produced by HTR-8/SVneo cells promoted the migration of HTR-8/SVneo cells. A COX-2 inhibitor suppressed PGE2 production and the migration of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Agonists to PGE2 receptors, EP1, EP2 and EP4, promoted the migration of HTR-8/SVneo cells. Moreover, stimulation with LIF up-regulated EP1, EP2 and EP4 expression in HTR-8/SVneo cells. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that LIF participates in placentation through EVT invasion by up-regulating PGE2 production and PGE2 receptor expression in first trimester EVT.","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Kitakyushu 807-8555, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preferentially expressed in CD34+ haematopoietic progenitors and down-regulated in more-differentiated cells, the WT1 transcription factor has been implicated in regulation of apoptosis, proliferation and differentiation. Putative target genes, such as BCL2, MYC, A1 and cyclin E, may cooperate with WT1 to modulate cell growth. However, the effects of WT1 on target gene expression appear to be isoform-specific. Certain WT1 isoforms are over-represented in leukaemia, but the exact mechanisms underlying the role of WT1 in transformation remain unclear. The ubiquity of WT1 in haematological malignancies has led to efforts to exploit it as a marker for minimal residual disease and as a prognostic factor, with conflicting results. In vitro killing of tumour cells by WT1-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes facilitated design of Phase I vaccine trials that showed clinical regression of WT1-positive tumours. Alternative methods employing WT1-specific immunotherapy are being investigated and might ultimately be used to optimise multimodal therapy of haematological malignancies.","['Division of Pediatric Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD 21231, USA.']",['5T32CA060441-13/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,148,,,,,,,,,,

Less clear is whether this cooperation is generalized in mammalian genomes, such as mouse genome. Here we use epigenomic tools to simultaneously interrogate chromatin modifications and DNA methylation in a mouse leukemia cell line, L1210. RESULTS: Histone modifications on H3K9 and DNA methylation in L1210 were profiled by both global CpG island array and custom mouse promoter array analysis. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation microarray (ChIP-chip) to examine acetyl-H3K9 and dimethyl-H3K9. We found that the relative level of acetyl-H3K9 at different chromatin positions has a wider range of distribution than that of dimethyl-H3K9. We then used differential methylation hybridization (DMH) and the restriction landmark genome scanning (RLGS) to analyze the DNA methylation status of the same targets investigated by ChIP-chip. The results of epigenomic profiling, which have been independently confirmed for individual loci, show an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and histone acetylation in regulating gene silencing. In contrast to the previous notion, dimethyl-H3K9 seems to be less distinct in specifying silencing for the genes tested. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates in L1210 leukemia cells a diverse relationship between histone modifications and DNA methylation in the maintenance of gene silencing. Acetyl-H3K9 shows an inverse relationship between DNA methylation and histone acetylation in regulating gene silencing as expected. However, dimethyl-H3K9 seems to be less distinct in relation to promoter methylation. Meanwhile, a combination of epigenomic tools is of help in understanding the heterogeneity of epigenetic regulation, which may further our vision accumulated from single-gene studies.","['Department of Molecular Genetics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH, USA.

To evaluate the possible impact of these activities on the health of communities living on the Colorado Plateau, mortality rates between 1950 and 2000 among Montrose County residents were compared to rates among residents in five similar counties in Colorado. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed as the ratio of observed numbers of deaths in Montrose County to the expected numbers of deaths based on mortality rates in the general populations of Colorado and the United States. Relative risks (RRs) were computed as the ratio of the SMRs for Montrose County to the SMRs for the five comparison counties. Between 1950 and 2000, a total of 1,877 cancer deaths occurred in the population residing in Montrose County, compared with 1,903 expected based on general population rates for Colorado (SMR(CO) 0.99). There were 11,837 cancer deaths in the five comparison counties during the same 51-year period compared with 12,135 expected (SMR(CO) 0.98). There was no difference between the total cancer mortality rates in Montrose County and those in the comparison counties (RR = 1.01; 95% CI 0.96-1.06). Except for lung cancer among males (RR = 1.19; 95% CI 1.06-1.33), no statistically significant excesses were seen for any causes of death of a priori interest: cancers of the breast, kidney, liver, bone, or childhood cancer, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, renal disease or nonmalignant respiratory disease. Lung cancer among females was decreased (RR = 0.83; 95% CI 0.67-1.02). The absence of elevated mortality rates of cancer in Montrose County over a period of 51 years suggests that the historical milling and mining operations did not adversely affect the health of Montrose County residents. Although descriptive correlation analyses such as this preclude definitive causal inferences, the increased lung cancer mortality seen among males but not females is most likely due to prior occupational exposure to radon and cigarette smoking among underground miners residing in Montrose County, consistent with previous cohort studies of Colorado miners and of residents of the town of Uravan in Montrose County.","['International Epidemiology Institute, Rockville, MD 20850, USA. john.boice@vanderbilt.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, markedly high incidences of stem cell leukemias were observed at 5 Gy in p53(+/-) mice, i.e., 87% (100%) in the transplantation assay and 60% (83.3%) in the whole-body assay, whereas a conventional whole-body assay induced only 14% in wild-type mice. The high incidence of stem cell leukemias observed in this study using heterozygous p53-deficient mice agrees with results of a previous study of homozygous p53-deficient mice and is consistent with the high frequency of loss of heterozygosity in the p53 wild-type allele observed in leukemias. This suggests that the target cells for radiation-induced stem cell leukemias may be p53-deficient hematopoietic stem cells.","['Research Center for Radiation Emergency Medicine, National Institute of Radiological Sciences, Chiba, Japan. yosida@nirs.go.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This retrospective analysis utilised electronic healthcare claims data from a US managed care provider. Adult patients with CML (as determined by International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9-CM] diagnosis code) were identified who began treatment with imatinib from 1 June 2001 through 31 March 2004. Treatment interruptions (i.e. failure to refill imatinib within 30 days from the run-out date of the prior prescription) were identified during the 12-month follow-up period. Medication possession ratio (MPR), calculated as total days' supply of imatinib divided by 365, was also examined. Healthcare costs (i.e. paid amounts for all prescription medications and medical services received, including health plan and patient liability) were examined in three ways: (i) total healthcare costs; (ii) total healthcare costs exclusive of imatinib costs; and (iii) total medical costs. All costs were converted to US dollars (2004 values) using the medical component of the Consumer Price Index. MPR was modelled using ordinary least squares regression. Presence of treatment interruptions was modelled using logistic regression. The association between MPR and healthcare costs was estimated using a generalised linear model specified with a gamma error distribution and a log link. All models included adjustment for age, gender, number of concomitant medications, starting dose of imatinib and cancer complexity. RESULTS: A total of 267 patients were identified. Average age was approximately 50 years, and 43% were women. Mean MPR was 77.7%, with 31% of patients having a treatment interruption. However, all of these patients resumed imatinib within the study period. In this population, MPR decreased as the number of concomitant medications increased (p = 0.002), and was lower among women (p = 0.003), patients with high cancer complexity (p = 0.003) and patients with a higher starting dose of imatinib (p = 0.04). Women were approximately twice as likely as men to have a treatment interruption (p = 0.009), as were patients with a high cancer complexity (p = 0.03). After adjusting for the aforementioned covariates, MPR was found to be inversely associated with healthcare costs excluding imatinib (p < 0.001) and medical costs (p < 0.001). A 10% point difference in MPR was associated with a 14% difference in healthcare costs excluding imatinib and a 15% difference in medical costs. For example, patients with an MPR of 75% incur an additional 4072 US dollars in medical costs annually compared with patients with an MPR of 85%. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment interruptions and non-adherence with imatinib, both of which could lead to undesired clinical and economic outcomes, appear to be prevalent. Physicians and pharmacists should educate patients and closely monitor adherence to therapy, as improving adherence and limiting treatment interruptions may not only optimise clinical outcomes but also reduce the economic burden of CML.","['i3 Innovus, Eden Prairie, Minnesota 55344, USA. theodore.darkow@i3innovus.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Current treatment approaches are tailored according to the clinical features of the host, genotypic features of the leukemic blast, and early response to therapy. Although these approaches have been successful in dramatically improving outcomes, approximately 20% of children with ALL still relapse and many of these children do not have an identifiable adverse risk factor at presentation. Further insights into the biologic basis of the disease may contribute to novel, rational treatment strategies. Childhood ALL has served as an example for demonstrating the feasibility and potential of high-throughput technologies such as global gene expression or transcript profiling. In the last decade or so, utilization of these techniques has grown exponentially. As the methodology undergoes refinement and validation, it is plausible that microarrays may be used in the routine management of childhood ALL in the next few years. This article discusses the numerous applications to date of gene expression profiling in childhood ALL. Multiple investigators have made it evident that microarrays can be used as a single platform for the accurate classification of ALL into the various cytogenetic subtypes. Additional promising utilities include prediction of early response to therapy, overall outcome, and adverse effects. Identification of patients who are predicted to have an unfavorable outcome may allow for early intervention such as intensification of therapy or avoidance of drugs that are associated with specific secondary effects such as therapy-related acute myelogenous leukemia. Knowledge has been gained into pathways contributing to leukemogenesis and chemoresistance. Therapeutic targets have been identified, some of which are entering clinical trials following validation in additional preclinical models. These newer methods of genome analyses complemented by studies involving the proteome as well as host polymorphisms will have a profound impact on the diagnosis and management of childhood ALL.","['NYU Cancer Institute, Division of Pediatric Hematology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, New York 10016, USA. deepa.bhojwani@med.nyu.edu']",['U01 CA114762/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,36,,,,,,,,,,

Novel statistical approaches have been developed that allow the estimation of sensitivity and specificity in situations where the true state of the disease in individual animals cannot be assured. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of a variety of retrovirus tests, including some screening tests, in a population of cats potentially infected with either feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and/or feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) by using a Bayesian statistical approach. METHODS: Four hundred and ninety blood samples from cats being evaluated for FIV infection were tested by 2 rapid immunomigration tests (Witness single [WS], Witness combi [WC]) and a plate-based ELISA (Petcheck) for FIV antibody, and by a newly designed real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for FIV provirus. Four hundred and ninety-five blood samples from cats being evaluated for FeLV infection were tested by 2 rapid immunomigration tests (WS, WC) and a plate-based ELISA (Petcheck) for FeLV antigen, and by a FeLV virus isolation technique. Results were then analyzed by using a Bayesian statistical method. RESULTS: For FIV tests, median sensitivity estimates were 0.98 for WS, 0.97 for WC, 0.98 for ELISA, and 0.92 for PCR. Median specificity estimates were 0.96 for WS, 0.96 for WC, 0.93 for ELISA, and 0.99 for PCR. For FeLV tests, median sensitivity estimates were 0.97 for WS, 0.97 for WC, 0.98 for ELISA, and 0.91 for virus isolation. Median specificity estimates were 0.96 for WS, 0.96 for WC, 0.98 for ELISA, and 0.99 for virus isolation. CONCLUSIONS: The use of Bayesian statistical methods overcomes a variety of methodologic problems associated with diagnostic test evaluations, including the lack of a definitive reference test. The sensitivity and the specificity of all 6 evaluated screening tests was high: however, specificity estimates were slightly lower than those reported by most recent studies.","['Department of Clinical Veterinary Science, University of Bristol, UK. mark.pinches@wcdx.co.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 6-year-old girl who presented with bilateral proptosis revealing acute myeloid leukemia. The patient was treated by a combination of chemotherapeutic drugs in two phases, associated with intravenous steroids. After a follow-up period of 24 months, the patient was in complete remission.

Genomewide scans have identified multiple large linkage regions across the genome, with fine-mapping studies and other investigations of biologically plausible targets demonstrating several promising candidate genes of modest effect. The recent introduction of technological platforms for whole-genome association (WGA) studies can provide an opportunity to rapidly identify novel targets, although no WGA studies have been reported in the psychiatric literature to date. We report results of a case-control WGA study in schizophrenia, examining approximately 500 000 markers, which revealed a strong effect (P=3.7 x 10(-7)) of a novel locus (rs4129148) near the CSF2RA (colony stimulating factor, receptor 2 alpha) gene in the pseudoautosomal region. Sequencing of CSF2RA and its neighbor, IL3RA (interleukin 3 receptor alpha) in an independent case-control cohort revealed both common intronic haplotypes and several novel, rare missense variants associated with schizophrenia. The presence of cytokine receptor abnormalities in schizophrenia may help explain prior epidemiologic data relating the risk for this illness to altered rates of autoimmune disorders, prenatal infection and familial leukemia.","['Department of Psychiatry Research, The Zucker Hillside Hospital, Division of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System, Glen Oaks, NY 11004, USA. lencz@lij.edu']","['MH001760/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'MH065580/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States', 'MH074543/MH/NIMH NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 23.,"A major entry route for the gammaretrovirus amphotropic murine leukemia virus (A-MLV) into NIH 3T3 fibroblasts is via caveola-dependent endocytosis. However, during the infection time, few viral particles can be observed intracellularly. Analyzing the dynamics of the A-MLV infection process by using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, we show that the majority of viruses are extracellular and bound to the fibronectin matrix. Moreover, the amounts of bound virus and of fibronectin correlated. Using confocal microscopy, nanoparticles targeted to fibronectin by a III1C-fibronectin fragment or anti-fibronectin antibody were detected intracellularly in NIH 3T3 cells; unconjugated nanoparticles neither bound to cells nor were detectable intracellularly. Furthermore, A-MLV colocalized intracellularly with the fibronectin-targeted nanoparticles, suggesting that they were taken up by the same cellular pathway. Both A-MLV entry and fibronectin turnover depend on caveolar endocytosis, and we found that inhibiting viral binding to the extracellular NIH 3T3 fibronectin-matrix dramatically reduced A-MLV infection, indeed, showing an active role of fibronectin in infection. We suggest that binding to the cellular fibronectin matrix provides a new mechanism by which viruses can enter cells.","['Department of Molecular Biology, Aarhus University, C. F.

Epub 2007 May 23.,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effect of external radiation exposure on the mortality of French nuclear workers. METHODS: A cohort of 29 204 workers employed between 1950 and 1994 at the French Atomic Energy Commission (Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique (CEA)) or at the General Company of Nuclear Fuel (COmpagnie GEnerale des MAtieres nucleaires (Cogema, now Areva NC)) was followed up for an average of 17.8 years. Standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were computed with reference to French mortality rates. Dose-effect relationship were analysed through trend tests and Poisson regression, with linear and log-linear models. RESULTS: The mean exposure to X and gamma radiation was 8.3 mSv (16.9 mSv for exposed worker population). A total of 1842 deaths occurred between 1968 and 1994. A healthy worker effect was observed, the number of deaths in the cohort being 59% of the number expected from national mortality statistics. Among the 21 main cancer sites studied, a statistically significant excess was observed only for skin melanoma, and an excess of borderline statistical significance was observed for multiple myeloma. A dose-effect relationship was observed for leukaemia after exclusion of chronic lymphoid leukaemia (CLL). The relative risk observed for non-CLL leukaemia, n = 20, was 4.1 per 100 mSv (90% CI 1.4 to 12.2), linear model and 2.2 per 100 mSv (90% CI 1.2 to 3.3), log-linear model. Significant dose-effect relationship were also observed for causes of deaths associated with alcohol consumption: mouth and pharynx cancer, cirrhosis and alcoholic psychosis and external causes of death. CONCLUSION: The risk of leukaemia increases with increasing exposure to external radiation; this is consistent with published results on other nuclear workers cohorts.","[""Institut de Radioprotection et de Surete Nucleaire, Direction de la radioprotection de l'Homme BP17 F92262 Fontenay aux Roses, France. maylis.telle-lamberton@irsn.fr""]",,,,PMC2078398,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We compared 22 long-term survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), aged 8-18, to 22 age- and gender-matched controls on tasks emphasizing cerebellar-frontal functioning including judgment of time duration and motor timing. Groups were also compared on a judgment of pitch task, used as a control measure. Children with ALL were at least 5 years from diagnosis, treated with intrathecal chemotherapy (methotrexate in all, hydrocortisone and cytarabine in 20/22), but not radiation therapy, and free from recurrence of disease. RESULTS: After controlling for IQ, the ALL group had poorer performance than controls on judgment of long duration and motor timing, but not judgment of pitch. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with intrathecal and infusional chemotherapy for childhood ALL may be associated with skill deficits comparable to those seen in individuals with cerebellar-frontal abnormalities.","['Department of Neuropsychology, Kennedy Krieger Institute, 1750 E.

The current understanding of rat LGLL and a search for mechanistic data/correlations to human leukemia were examined with the goal of improving evaluation of the LGLL endpoint in cancer bioassays as it relates to human cancer risk assessments. The exact cell of origin of the F344 rat LGLL is not fully resolved, although natural killer (NK) cell characteristics were demonstrated in most, if not all cases. Similarities between rat LGLL and a rare human NK-LGLL exist, invalidating claims of no human counterpart, although the underlying etiopathogenesis may be different. There is insufficient data to establish a mode of action of chemical-induced rat LGLL. Evaluation of the National Toxicology Program database revealed only 34 substances (out of over 500 studied) that were possibly associated with increased incidences of LGLL. Of these, only five produced definitive LGLL effects in both sexes; the remaining 29 produced single sex responses and/or only ""equivocal"" associations with LGLL. Trends of increasing background/variability in LGLL incidence and its modulation by extraneous factors (e.g., corn oil gavage) are key confounders in interpretation. Given that LGLL is a common tumor in control F344 rats, interpretations of bioassays can be improved by increasing the statistical stringency (e.g., p<0.01 over traditional p<0.05), as an indicator of possible carcinogenic effects, but that alone would be insufficient evidence for declaring treatment-related increases. Thus, it was concluded that the evaluation of possible chemically related increases in rat LGLL utilize a ""weight-of-evidence"" approach.","['Toxicology & Environmental Research and Consulting, The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan 48674, USA. jthomas4@dow.com']",,,,,84,,,,,,,,,,

Pilot experiments indicated that the viability of spiral ganglion cells in vitro depended critically on the use of Hibernate medium with B27 supplement. With an optimized protocol, we obtained 2 x 10(3) neurons immediately after dissociation, or about one-fifth of those present in the intact spiral ganglion. After four days in culture, 4% of the seeded neurons survived without any exogenous growth factors other than insulin. This yield was highly reproducible in five independent experiments and enabled us to measure systematically the numbers and lengths of the regenerating neurites. Furthermore, the survival rate compared well to the few published protocols for culturing adult spiral ganglion neurons from other species. Enhanced survival and neurite outgrowth upon the addition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor demonstrated that both are potent stimulants for damaged spiral ganglion neurons in adults. This responsiveness to exogenous growth factors suggested that our culture protocol will facilitate the screening of molecular compounds as potential treatments for sensorineural hearing loss.","['Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, MC-251, Urbana, IL, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genotypic disparity of SNP between transplantation donors and recipients gives rise to mHag as non-self antigens for both the donor and the recipient. Subsequently, mHag have been explored as immunotherapeutic antigens for use against recurring hematological malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), because mHag expressed only on hematopoietic cells are considered to augment graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effects without increasing the risk of life-threatening graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Accumulating evidence suggests that T-cell responses to mHag aberrantly expressed on solid tumor cells are also involved in the eradication of sensitive tumors such as renal cell carcinomas following HCT. Over the past decade, the number of putative GVL-directed mHag has increased to a level that covers more than 30% of the Japanese patient population, so that clinical trials may now be executed in the setting of either vaccination or adoptive immunotherapy. As it is expected that immune responses to alloantigens are more powerful than to tumor antigens mostly derived from overexpressed self-proteins, mHag-based immunotherapy may lead to a new treatment modality for high-risk malignancies following allogeneic HCT.","['Division of Immunology, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, 1-1 Kanokoden, Nagoya 464-8681, Japan. yakatsuk@aichi-cc.jp']",,,,,66,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 24.,"In this paper, new composite nanoparticles based on hyaluronic acid (HA) chemically cross-linked with alpha,beta-polyaspartylhydrazide (PAHy) were prepared by the use of a reversed-phase microemulsion technique. HA-PAHy nanoparticles were characterized by FT-IR spectroscopy, confirming the occurrence of the chemical cross-linking, dimensional analysis, and transmission electron micrography, showing a sub-micrometer size and spherical shape. Zeta potential measurements demonstrated the presence of HA on the nanoparticle surface. A remarkable affinity of the obtained nanoparticles toward aqueous media that simulate some biological fluids was found. Stability studies showed the absence of chemical degradation in various media, while in the presence of hyaluronidase, a partial degradation occurred. Cell compatibility was evaluated by performing in vitro assays on human chronic myelogenous leukaemia cells (K-562) chosen as a model cell line and a haemolytic test. HA-PAHy nanoparticles were also able to entrap 5-fluorouracil, chosen as a model drug, and release it in a simulated physiological fluid and in human plasma with a mechanism essentially controlled by a Fickian diffusion.","['Dipartimento di Chimica e Tecnologie Farmaceutiche, Universita degli Studi di Palermo, Via Archirafi, 32-90123 Palermo, Italy. giopitar@unipa.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, despite this pre-clinical success, the clinical use of 1,25D is currently impeded by the dose-limiting hypercalcemia, and the risk of development of resistance to 1,25D. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of resistance to 1,25D of HL60-40AF cells, a model of drug-resistant acute myeloid leukemia, derived from HL60 cells by cultivation in the presence of 1,25D. The data indicate that transcriptional activity of vitamin D receptor (VDR) in 40AF cells increases only briefly when the cells are treated with 1,25D, despite greater basal cellular levels of VDR protein in the resistant than in the 1,25D-sensitive cells. Analysis of the 40AF VDR mRNA sequence indicated alterations in the 5' untranslated region (UTR), but coding domain variations were not observed. When resistance to 1,25D-induced differentiation of 40AF cells was reversed by a combination of 1,25D with potentiators of differentiation (plant derived antioxidants and a p38MAPK inhibitor), an increase in the level of nuclear VDR, as well as an increase in CYP24 mRNA expression was observed. These data suggest that decreased ability of 1,25D to induce VDR nuclear localization and the consequent VDR target gene transcription may be an important reason for the resistance of 40AF cells to 1,25D. Further, our data show that VDR localization and phosphorylation can be increased by combining 1,25D with potentiators of differentiation. Analysis of the mechanisms that underlie the reduction and potentiation of 1,25D-mediated changes in VDR activity may lead to the identification of new cellular targets that enhance 1,25D-induced monocytic differentiation.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey 07103, USA.']","['R01 CA044722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA044722-17/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-044722/PHS HHS/United States']",,,PMC2843698,,,,"['2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['NIHMS170013'],,,,,,

We examined 7 MLV chimeric envelope derivatives that contained either the HBV PreS1 peptide or PreS1 aa 21-47 segment (partial PreS1, pPreS1), which was inserted at various locations within the SU of the MoMLV Env. In addition to infecting host NIH 3T3 cells, some of pseudotyped viruses could transduce human cells.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Radiotherapy for central nervous system tumors, acute leukemia, neuroblastoma, Hodgkin's disease, Wilms' tumor, and sarcoma was simulated on three humanoid phantoms representing patients of 5, 10, and 15 years of age. Ovarian and testicular dose measurements were performed using thermoluminescent dosimeters on a linear accelerator with multileaf collimator (MLC) producing 6-MV X-rays. The effect of lead block introduction into the primary beam on the gonadal dose was evaluated. Gonadal dose from radiotherapy for abdominal tumors was measured using an 18-MV photon beam. RESULTS: For a tumor dose range of 12-55 Gy, the scattered dose to ovaries was 0.5-62.4 cGy depending upon the patient's age (corresponding phantom) and treatment site. The corresponding dose to testes was 0.4-145.0 cGy. The use of blocks for field shaping can increase the gonadal dose up to a factor of 2.0 compared to that measured using MLC. Abdominal irradiation with 18-MV instead of 6-MV X-rays reduced the gonadal dose by more than 1.3 times. For female and male patients, the risk for induction of hereditary disorders was less than 81 x 10(-4) and 188 x 10(-4), respectively. CONCLUSION: The present dosimetric data suggest that pediatric radiotherapy is not associated with a risk for permanent damage to gonads excluded from the treatment volume. The risk for development of hereditary disorders in offspring conceived after exposure is low.","['Department of Medical Physics, University Hospital of Iraklion, 71110 Iraklion, Crete, Greece. mazonak@med.uoc.gr']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Feb 20.,"BACKGROUND: Since 1997, Fallon, Nevada, has experienced a cluster of childhood leukemia that has been declared ""one of the most unique clusters of childhood cancer ever reported."" Multiple environmental studies have shown airborne tungsten and cobalt to be elevated within Fallon, but the question remains: Have these metals changed through time in correspondence with the onset of the leukemia cluster? METHODS: We used dendrochemistry, the study of element concentrations through time in tree rings, in Fallon to assess temporal variability of airborne tungsten and cobalt since the late 1980s. The techniques used in Fallon were also tested in a different town (Sweet Home, OR) that has airborne tungsten from a known source. RESULTS: The Sweet Home test case confirms the accuracy of dendrochemistry for showing temporal variability of environmental tungsten. Given that dendrochemistry works for tungsten, tree-ring chemistry shows that tungsten increased in Fallon relative to nearby comparison towns beginning by the mid-1990s, slightly before the onset of the cluster, and cobalt has been high throughout the last approximately 15 years. Other metals do not show trends through time in Fallon. DISCUSSION: Results in Fallon suggest a temporal correspondence between the onset of excessive childhood leukemia and elevated levels of tungsten and cobalt. Although environmental data alone cannot directly link childhood leukemia with exposure to metals, research by others has shown that combined exposure to tungsten and cobalt can be carcinogenic to humans. CONCLUSION: Continued biomedical research is warranted to directly test for linkage between childhood leukemia and tungsten and cobalt.","['Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, University of Arizona, Tucson, Arizona 85721, USA. sheppard@ltrr.arizona.edu']",,,['Environ Health Perspect. 2012 Feb;120(2):A57'],PMC1867993,,,,,,"['Environ Health Perspect. 2007 May;115(5):A263.

Epub 2007 Feb 14.,"BACKGROUND: Chronic arsenic exposure is associated with cardiovascular abnormalities. Prolongation of the QT (time between initial deflection of QRS complex to the end of T wave) interval and profound repolarization changes on electrocardiogram (ECG) have been reported in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia treated with arsenic trioxide. This acquired form of long QT syndrome can result in life-threatening arrhythmias. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cardiac effects of arsenic by investigating QT interval alterations in a human population chronically exposed to arsenic. METHODS: Residents in Ba Men, Inner Mongolia, have been chronically exposed to arsenic via consumption of water from artesian wells. A total of 313 Ba Men residents with the mean arsenic exposure of 15 years were divided into three arsenic exposure groups: low (< or = 21 microg/L), medium (100-300 microg/L), and high (430-690 microg/L). ECGs were obtained on all study subjects. The normal range for QTc (corrected QT) interval is 0.33-0.44 sec, and QTc > or = 0.45 sec was considered to be prolonged. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of QT prolongation and water arsenic concentrations showed a dose-dependent relationship (p = 0.001). The prevalence rates of QTc prolongation were 3.9, 11.1, 20.6% for low, medium, and high arsenic exposure, respectively. QTc prolongation was also associated with sex (p < 0.0001) but not age (p = 0.486) or smoking (p = 0.1018). Females were more susceptible to QT prolongation than males. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant association between chronic arsenic exposure and QT interval prolongation in a human population. QT interval may potentially be useful in the detection of early cardiac arsenic toxicity.","['US Environmental Protection Agency, National Health and Environmental Effects Research Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27711, USA. mumford.judy@epa.gov']",,,,PMC1867981,,,,,,['Environ Health Perspect. 2007 May;115(5):A262.

Epub 2007 Mar 22.,"The majority of chronic phase chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients treated with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib mesylate maintain durable responses to the drug. However, most patients relapse after withdrawal of imatinib and advanced stage patients often develop drug resistance. As CML is considered a hematopoietic stem cell cancer, it has been postulated that inherent protective mechanisms lead to relapse in patients. The ATP binding-cassette transporters ABCB1 (MDR-1; P-glycoprotein) and ABCG2 are highly expressed on primitive hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and have been shown to interact with TKIs. Herein we demonstrate a dose-dependent, reversible inhibition of ABCG2-mediated Hoechst 33342 dye efflux in primary human and murine HSC by both imatinib and nilotinib (AMN107), a novel aminopyrimidine inhibitor of BCR-ABL. ABCG2-transduced K562 cells were protected from imatinib and nilotinib-mediated cell death and from downregulation of P-CRKL. Moreover, photoaffinity labeling revealed interaction of both TKIs with ABCG2 at the substrate binding sites as they compete with the binding of [(125)I] IAAP and also stimulate the transporter's ATPase activity. Therefore, our evidence suggests for the role of ABC transporters in resistance to TKI on primitive HSCs and CML stem cells and provides a rationale how TKI resistance can be overcome in vivo.","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Philipps-University Marburg, Baldingerstrasse, Marburg, Germany. brendelc@mailer.uni-marburg.de']",['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 12.,"The frequency of vascular events and evolution to myelofibrosis (MF) in young individuals with essential thrombocythemia (ET) is not well known. The incidence and predisposing factors to such complications was studied in 126 subjects diagnosed with ET at a median age of 31 years (range: 5-40). Overall survival and probability of survival free of thrombosis, bleeding and MF were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and the presence of the Janus Kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation correlated with the appearance of such complications. The JAK2 mutation (present in 43% of patients) was associated with higher hemoglobin (Hb) (P<0.001) and lower platelets at diagnosis. With a median follow-up of 10 years (range: 4-25), 31 thrombotic events were registered (incidence rate: 2.2 thromboses/100 patients/year). When compared with the general population, young ET patients showed a significant increase in stroke (odds ratio 50, 95% CI: 21.5-115) and venous thromboses (odds ratio 5.3, 95% CI: 3.9-10.6). Thrombosis-free survival was 84% at 10 years, with tobacco use being associated with higher risk of thrombosis. Actuarial freedom from evolution to MF was 97% at 10 years. In conclusion, young ET patients have thrombotic events, especially stroke and venous thrombosis, more frequently than generally considered, whereas they rarely transform to MF.","['Department of Hematology, Hospital del Mar, Barcelona, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2008 Apr;22(4):864-5; author reply 865-7.

Epub 2007 May 22.,"BACKGROUND: Renal insufficiency is a common complication early after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Over the past several years, significant advancement has been achieved in HSCT, especially in nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation. Compared with traditional HSCT, nonmyeloablative HSCT employs significantly lower doses of chemoradiotherapy and lower toxicity. The current study evaluated renal insufficiency during the first 100 days in patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) who underwent nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (allo-PBSCT) in a single center. METHODS: A total of 26 consecutive patients with CML received nonmyeloablative allo-PBSCT from 2002 to 2005 in Zhong Da Hospital. The average age of the patients was 40.2 +/- 8.2 years. Renal function was measured by serum creatinine concentration and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) during the first 100 days after nonmyeloablative allo-PBSCT. Renal dysfunction was classified as follows: grade 0 (<25% decline in GFR), grade 1 (> or =25% decrease in GFR but <twofold rising in serum creatinine), grade 2 (> or =twofold increase in serum creatinine but no need for dialysis) and grade 3 (> or =twofold increase in serum creatinine and need for dialysis). Acute renal failure (ARF) was defined as a doubling of baseline serum creatinine, grade 2 and grade 3. RESULTS: All the patients were successfully engrafted. Of the 26 patients, 10 (38%) patients had some degree of renal dysfunction (grade 1, 5 patients; grade 2, 4 patients; grade 3, 1 patient). They developed ARF at an average of 32.8 +/- 4.0 days after transplantation. No significant difference was observed in terms of age, baseline serum creatinine, albumin and hemoglobin between the patients with ARF and without ARF. Renal dysfunction was associated with significantly higher frequencies of sepsis and hepatic veno-occlusive disease (VOD, p < 0.01, respectively). The overall mortality rate at the end of 100 days was 19% (5/26). The mortality rate for patients with ARF was significantly higher than those without ARF (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: During the first 100 days following nonmyeloablative allo-PBSCT in patients with CML, a 38% incidence of renal dysfunction and a 19% of ARF were found, which were much less than previous studies. Sepsis and VOD were significantly correlated with the development of renal dysfunction.

Epub 2007 May 21.,"A global protein survey is needed to gain systems-level insights into mammalian cell signaling and information flow. Human Jurkat T leukemic cells are one of the most important model systems for T cell signaling study, but no comprehensive proteomics survey has been carried out in this cell type. In the present study we combined subcellular fractionation, multiple protein enrichment methods, and replicate tandem mass spectrometry analyses to determine the protein expression pattern in a single Jurkat cell type. The proteome dataset was evaluated by comparison with the genome-wide mRNA expression pattern in the same cell type. A total of 5381 proteins were identified by mass spectrometry with high confidence. Rigorous comparison of RNA and protein expression afforded removal of the false positive identifications and redundant entries but rescued the proteins identified by a single high scoring peptide, resulting in the final identification of 6471 unique gene products among which 98% of the corresponding transcripts were detected with high probability. Using hierarchical clustering of the protein expression patterns in five subcellular fractions (cytosol, light membrane, heavy membrane, mitochondria, and nuclei), the primary subcellular localization of 2241 proteins was assigned with high confidence including 792 previously uncharacterized proteins. This proteome landscape can serve as a useful platform for systems-level understanding of organelle composition and cellular functions in human T cells.","['Department of Cell Biology and Center for Vascular Biology, School of Medicine, University of Connecticut, Farmington, Connecticut 06030, USA.']","['P01 HL 70694/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 67569/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR 13186/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine the findings in children who were initially thought to have an infectious disease but ultimately proved to have a malignancy. METHODS: The database of patients diagnosed with a malignancy in the Northern Alberta Children's Cancer Program (NACCP) January 1, 1993 to December 31, 2003 was merged with the database of inpatients referred to the infectious diseases service at the Stollery Children's Hospital and charts were reviewed on all patients referred to the infectious diseases consult service prior to the diagnosis of malignancy. RESULTS: An infectious diseases consultation for diagnosis was requested in 21 of 561 patients prior to the confirmation of malignancy, and 3 of these 21 patients had both infection and malignancy (leukemia (N = 13), lymphoma (N = 3), rhabdomyosarcoma (N = 1), Langerhan's cell histiocytosis (N = 1), fibrous histicocytosis (N = 1), ependymoma (N = 1), and neuroblastoma (N = 1). The most common reason for infectious diseases consultation was suspected muskuloskeletal infection (N = 9). A palpable or radiographically enlarged spleen was noted in 11 patients (52%). All but 2 patients had abnormal hematologic parameters while an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) occurred in 10 patients (48%). Delay of diagnosis because of investigation or therapy for an infectious disease occurred in only 2 patients. CONCLUSION: It is not common for treatment of pediatric malignancies to be delayed because infection is thought to be the primary diagnosis. However, pediatric infectious diseases physicians should consider malignancy in the differential diagnosis when they see patients with fever and bone pain, unexplained splenomegaly or abnormal complete blood cell counts. Other clues may include hepatomegaly or elevated LDH.","[""Department of Pediatrics and Stollery Children's Hospital, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. sarahforgie@cha.ab.ca""]",,,,PMC1885437,,,,,,,,,,,

As a marker of hematologic dyscrasia/malignancy, expression of CD23 is associated with small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia. An absence of CD23 expression within small lymphocytes is typically seen in marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. Positive CD23 expression amidst neoplastic cells in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma is not a reported phenomenon. METHODS: This paper reports nine patients with cutaneous B-cell lymphoma manifesting CD23 expression. RESULTS: In seven of the nine cases CD23 expression was observed in the setting of recurrent disease, being present in both large and small lymphocytes. CD23 expression paralleled staining for CD40 in all but one case. CONCLUSIONS: A potential mechanism of CD23 upregulation may involve the anti-apoptotic nuclear kappa beta CD40-CD40 ligand pathway. Neoplastic B cells manifesting CD23 expression could have a survival advantage, predisposing to recurrent disease and or oncogenic events permissive to disease progression.","['Department of Pathology, Weill Medical College of Medicine, NY 10021, USA. cym2003@med.cornell.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These successes have shown the potential of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy, but treatment-related leukemia and benign expansion of gene-modified clones have shifted the attention toward safety. The delayed onset of adverse events in gene therapy clinical trials emphasizes the importance of long-term integration site studies in large animal models. We have addressed safety by characterizing the genomic location of 555 integration sites of the three most commonly used integrating retroviral vectors, that is, gammaretrovirus, lentivirus, and foamy virus, in long-term repopulating cells from dogs. Gammaretroviral integrants showed the most significant frequency of occurrence very close (<2.5 kb) to transcription start sites, but a substantial portion of all three retroviral integrants were within 50 kb. Importantly, gammaretroviral integrants were found more frequently in and near proto-oncogenes, suggesting this retroviral system may be the most prone to adverse gene activation. These data suggest that gammaretroviral vectors may have the highest intrinsic risk, but also emphasize that no vector system can be defined as ""safe"" based solely on integration profile.","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']","['KD56465/PHS HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL200010/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK071657/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a strategy to track the anatomic location of seeded cells within TE constructs and neighboring tissues using a retroviral vector system encoding green and red fluorescent proteins (GFPs and RFPs, respectively) in ovine circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). We demonstrate that stable transduction ex vivo with high-titer Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector yields transduction efficiency of greater than 97% GFP(+) EPC- and RFP(+) mesenchymal stem cell (MSC)-derived cells. Cellular phenotype and transgene expression were also maintained through 25 subsequent passages. Using a retroviral vector system to distinguish our pre-seeded cells from tissue-resident progenitor cells and circulating endothelial and marrow-derived precursors, we simultaneously co-seeded 2 x 10(6) GFP(+) EPCs and 2 x 10(5) RFP(+) MSCs onto the TE patches. In a series of ovine pulmonary artery patch augmentation studies, transplanted GFP(+) EPC- and RFP(+) MSC-derived cells persisted within the TE patch 7 to 14 days after implantation, as identified using immunofluorescence. Analysis showed 81% luminal coverage of the TE patches before implantation with transduced cells, increasing to 96% at day 7 and decreasing to 67% at day 14 post-implantation. This suggests a temporal association between retroviral expression of progenitor cells and mediating effects of these cells on the physiological remodeling and maturation of the TE constructs. To our knowledge, this is the first cardiovascular tissue-engineering in vivo study using a double-labeling method to demonstrate a direct evidence of the source, persistence, and incorporation into a TE vascular patch of co-cultured and simultaneously pre-seeded adult progenitor cells.","[""Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Children's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]","['F32 EB003353-01/EB/NIBIB NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-60463/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-68816-01/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In recent years, expression of this type of proteins has also been reported in numerous cell types under physiological conditions; here, these transporters are often reported to alter systemic and local drug disposition (e.g. in the brain or the gastrointestinal tract). In this context, peripheral blood cells have also been found to express several ABC-type transporters. While erythrocytes mainly express multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 1, MRP4 and MRP5, which are discussed with regard to their involvement in glutathione homeostasis (MRP1) and in the efflux of cyclic nucleotides (MRP4 and MRP5), leukocytes also express P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein. In the latter cell types, the main function of efflux transporters may be protection against toxins, as these cells demonstrate a very high turnover rate. In platelets, only two ABC transporters have been described so far. Besides MRP1, platelets express relatively high amounts of MRP4 not only in the plasma membrane but also in the membrane of dense granules, suggesting relevance for mediator storage. In addition to its physiological function, ABC transporter expression in these structures can be of pharmacological relevance since all systemic drugs reach their targets via circulation, thereby enabling interaction of the therapeutic agent with peripheral blood cells. Moreover, both intended effects and unwanted side effects occur in peripheral blood cells, and intracellular micropharmacokinetics can be affected by these transport proteins. The present review summarises the data available on expression of ABC transport proteins in peripheral blood cells.","['Department of Pharmacology, Research Center of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Ernst Moritz Arndt University, Greifswald, Germany.']",,,,,203,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the surface proteins of E. chaffeensis, membrane-impermeable, cleavable Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin was used to label intact bacteria. The biotinylated bacterial surface proteins were isolated by streptavidin-agarose affinity purification. The affinity-captured proteins were separated by electrophoresis, and five relatively abundant protein bands containing immunoreactive proteins were subjected to capillary-liquid chromatography-nanospray tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Nineteen out of 22 OMP-1/P28 family proteins, including P28 (which previously was shown to be surface exposed), were detected in E. chaffeensis cultured in human monocytic leukemia THP-1 cells. For the first time, with the exception of P28 and P28-1, 17 OMP-1/P28 family proteins were demonstrated to be expressed at the protein level. The surface exposure of OMP-1A and OMP-1N was verified by immunofluorescence microscopy. OMP-1B was undetectable either by surface biotinylation or by Western blotting of the whole bacterial lysate, suggesting that it is not expressed by E. chaffeensis cultured in THP-1 cells. Additional E. chaffeensis surface proteins detected were OMP85, hypothetical protein ECH_0525 (here named Esp73), immunodominant surface protein gp47, and 11 other proteins.

It can function as a target for T cell-mediated immune response. Clinical trials of IgHV protein vaccines against lymphoma have demonstrated induction of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. However, complementary determining regions-based individual vaccines have disadvantages for wide clinical application. Although a recent study demonstrated that immunogenic peptides are derived from framework regions (FR) shared among patients with B-cell lymphoma, how to choose the appropriate peptides for each patient is still unsolved. The aim of this study was to investigate whether immunoglobulin heavy chain FR-derived peptides shared in each IgHV family are potential CTL epitopes presented by B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Such CTL epitopes might be beneficial to shifting vaccination strategies against B-ALL from individual specificity to family specificity. METHODS: Seven IgHV gene families were amplified respectively by PCR and sequenced directly from 71 childhood B-ALL cases. Bioinformatics was applied in analyzing characteristics of sequences available and predicting HLA-A*0201-restricted CTL epitopes for each IgHV family. An antigen-specific T cell expansion system was used to generate peptide-specific CTLs. The cytotoxicity of CTLs against B-ALL cells was assessed in the lactate dehydrogenase release assay. RESULTS: Complete IgHV rearrangements were identified in all of the 71 B-ALL cases. All of 40 sequences available showed > or = 98% homology with the nearest germline IgHV genes, indicating IgHV genes in B-ALL of germline nature. Twelve nonapeptides of high HLA-A*0201-binding scores were obtained from 26 productive IgHV protein sequences. Ten (83%) of the peptides were located in FR1 and FR3 shared among the corresponding IgHV family. CTLs specific for the peptide QLVQSGAEV located in FR1 (3 - 11) shared among the IgHV1 family could be successfully generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two HLA-A*0201 + healthy donors in vitro and were capable of killing HLA-matched B-ALL cell clones belonging to the IgHV1 family. CONCLUSION: Anti-B-ALL CTLs against immunoglobulin heavy chain FR-derived peptides have family-specific cytotoxicity.","[""Department of Pediatrics, General Hospital of People's Liberation Army, Beijing, China. ly_lwd@sohu.com""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances include the development of 2-D DIGE, a proteomic equivalent to mRNA differential display, in which differentially labeled samples are multiplexed and analyzed by high-resolution 2-DE. This study presents a new 2-D DIGE protocol, in which complex protein samples from normal and leukemic human bone marrow mesenchymal progenitor cells were used as model samples for a novel combination of liquid-phase IEF with 2-D DIGE. Using liquid-phase IEF, the normal and leukemic cells were pre-fractionated into five subproteomes after multiplexing but prior to DIGE. Under these conditions, 2-D DIGE resolved >5000 protein-containing spots within the pH range 4.6-7.0. Differential labeling combined with subsequent MALDI-MS/MS identified proteins that were differentially expressed in leukemic cells. This analysis mapped protein identities to 128 mesenchymal progenitor cell proteins with at least one unique peptide match at >95% confidence. Of these proteins, 72 (56%) were expressed more than 1.25-fold higher or lower in leukemic cells compared with normal cells (p<0.05).

A 25% occurrence of an antibody against PEG (anti-PEG) was previously reported in healthy blood donors. The objective of the study was to determine whether anti-PEG was associated with rapid clearance PEG-ASNase. METHODS: The investigation reanalyzed stored sera from pediatric patients enrolled in the ALL Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster 2000 studies. Twenty-eight samples were selected to include 15 subjects with undetectable ASNase activity after receiving PEG-ASNase. Sixteen subjects treated with unmodified ASNase were also included, 8 with low ASNase activity. Sera were tested for anti-PEG using 2 techniques: 1) serology, by agglutination of PEG-coated red blood cells; 2) flow cytometry, by analysis of 10 microm PEG beads stained for bound immunoglobulins. RESULTS. Of the 15 sera from PEG-ASNase-treated patients with undetectable ASNase activity, anti-PEG was detected in 9 by serology and in 12 by flow cytometry. Anti-PEG was detected in 1 PEG-ASNase-treated patient with lower ASNase activity (123 U/L). No relation was observed between anti-PEG and serum ASNase activity for patients treated with unmodified ASNase. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of anti-PEG was very closely associated with rapid clearance of PEG-ASNase. Further comprehensive studies are warranted to fully elucidate the effect of anti-PEG on PEG-conjugated agents. Screening and monitoring for anti-PEG may allow identification of patients for whom a modified dosing strategy or use of a non-PEGylated drug would be appropriate.","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90033, USA. jonathan.armstrong@usc.edu']","['HL 15722/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 65637/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 70595/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,['Copyright (c) 2007 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 10.,"BACKGROUND: Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a serum lectin involved in innate immune response. Low serum MBL concentration may constitute a risk factor for infection in patients receiving myelosuppressive chemotherapy. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study that assessed MBL concentration as a risk factor for infection in patients with hematological malignancy who were hospitalized to undergo at least 1 chemotherapy cycle. MBL deficiency was defined using an algorithm that considered the serum MBL concentration and the MBL genotype. The primary end point was the ratio of duration of febrile neutropenia to the duration of neutropenia. Secondary end points included the incidence of severe infection (e.g., sepsis, pneumonia, bacteremia, and invasive fungal infection). Logistic regression analysis was conducted, and Fisher's exact test was used to analyze binary outcomes, and Kaplan-Meier estimates and log rank tests were used for time-to-event variables. RESULTS: We analyzed 255 patients who received 569 cycles of chemotherapy. The median duration of neutropenia per cycle was 7 days (interquartile range, 0-13 days). Sixty-two patients (24%) were found to have MBL deficiency. Febrile neutropenia occurred at least once in 200 patients. No difference in the primary outcome was seen. The incidence of severe infection was higher among MBL-deficient patients than among non-MBL-deficient patients (1.96 vs. 1.34 cases per 100 days for analysis of all patients [P=.008] and 1.85 vs. 0.94 cases per 100 days excluding patients with acute leukemia [P<.001]). CONCLUSIONS: MBL deficiency does not predispose adults with hematological cancer to more-frequent or more-prolonged febrile episodes during myelosuppressive chemotherapy, but MBL-deficient patients have a greater number of severe infections and experience their first severe infection earlier, compared with nondeficient patients.","['Infectious Diseases Department, Institut Jules Bordet, Brussels, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His past medical history was unremarkable except for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia diagnosed two years previously: he was no longer receiving treatment for this disorder. His visual acuity was 20/200 in the right eye and 20/63 in the left eye and he had a bilateral papilledema. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit were performed and showed an infiltrative mass in the orbit with extension to the ethmoid bone and both optic nerves. Biopsy of the mass was compatible with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. DISCUSSION: Leukaemic infiltration of the optic nerve and central nervous system is a rare complication of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, although it is common in the acute forms of this disease. Optic nerve infiltration is the most important ophthalmologic manifestation of leukaemia because it threatens vision and it is treatable.","['Servicio de Oftalmologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario San Carlos, Madrid, Espana. federicosaenzfrancessb@gmail.com']",,,,,,,Edema bilateral del nervio optico por leucemia linfocitica cronica.,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we monitored dihydroethidium (DHE)-derived fluorescence at 570 nm, which indicates hydroxyethidium derived from reaction with superoxide produced by human leukemia cells (HL-60) and microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 100 ng/ml) caused an increase in fluorescence and lucigenin chemiluminescence in HL-60, which was abolished by superoxide dismutase (SOD; 600 U/ml) indicating that DHE detects extracellular superoxide. Furthermore, both HL-60 cells and HMEC-1 generated a fluorescence signal in the presence of DHE under resting conditions, which was unaffected by SOD, but abolished by polyethylene glycosylated-SOD (PEG-SOD) (100 U/ml) and MnTmPyP (25 microM), indicating that DHE also detects superoxide produced intracellularly. In HMEC-1, silencing of either Nox2 or Nox4 components of NADPH oxidase with small interference RNA (siRNA) resulted in a significant reduction in superoxide detected by both DHE fluorescence (Nox2 siRNA; 71 +/- 6% and Nox4 siRNA 83 +/- 7% of control) and lucigenin chemiluminescence (Nox2; 54 +/- 6% and Nox4 74 +/- 4% of control). In conclusion, DHE-derived fluorescence at 570 nm is a convenient method for detection of intracellular and extracellular superoxide produced by phagocytic and vascular NADPH oxidase.","[""Cytoprotection Pharmacology Laboratory, Bernard O'Brien Institute of Microsurgery, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Vic., Australia.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 22.,"In this study, we extracted a polysaccharide (short-chain polysaccharide [PS]) from porcine cartilage and examined its function in chronic myeloid leukaemia by using human K562 cells and mouse L1210 cells. Results of cell proliferation assay indicated that PS inhibited cancer cell growth at different concentrations, while it had little effect on normal cells. The presence of morphological aspects of apoptosis, such as nuclear shrinkage, was shown in H&E stained sections. The occurrence of PS-induced apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL assay and cell cycle analysis. The results of immunofluorescent staining indicated the molecular mechanism underlying. Through interfering with the cell cycle of tumor cells, PS may induce apoptosis by downregulating the expression level of cyclin D1 and upregulating the level of p21 protein. Correlation analysis of apoptosis and MAPK suggested that inactivation of ERK was crucial for PS induced apoptosis, while JNK phosphorylation had a small effect and p38 was not involved. In vivo assay showed that PS inhibited L1210 cell growth in vivo and prolonged the life span of L1210-bearing mice. We conclude that PS is a polysaccharide with anticancer effects and induced apoptosis in human K562 cells.","['Tianjin Key Laboratory of Food Nutrition and Safety, Institute of Food Engineering and Biotechnology, Tianjin University of Science and Technology, Tianjin, PR China. liuanjun666@yahoo.com.cn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Along with targeted re-sequencing, our comparative oncogenomic studies identified FBXW7 and PTEN to be commonly deleted both in murine lymphomas and in human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia/lymphoma (T-ALL). The murine cancers acquire widespread recurrent amplifications and deletions targeting loci syntenic to those not only in human T-ALL but also in diverse human haematopoietic, mesenchymal and epithelial tumours. These results indicate that murine and human tumours experience common biological processes driven by orthologous genetic events in their malignant evolution.

Epub 2007 May 21.,"Nur77 (NR4A1) and Nor-1 (NR4A3) are highly homologous orphan nuclear receptors that regulate the transcription of overlapping target genes. The transcriptional activity of both proteins is regulated in a ligand-independent manner by cell- and stimulus-specific gene induction and protein phosphorylation. Nor-1 and Nur77 have been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including the transduction of hormonal, inflammatory, mitogenic, apoptotic and differentiative signals. Cellular responses to these proteins suggest that they may function as homeostatic regulators of proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation, and thus may regulate cellular susceptibility to tumorigenesis. Their physiological functions, however, remain poorly understood. Here we describe a previously unsuspected function of Nor-1 and Nur77-as critical tumor suppressors of myeloid leukemogenesis. The abrogation of these proteins in mice led to rapidly lethal acute myeloid leukemia (AML), involving abnormal expansion of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and myeloid progenitors, decreased expression of the AP-1 transcription factors JunB and c-Jun and defective extrinsic apoptotic (Fas-L and TRAIL) signaling. We found that downregulation of NR4A3 ( NOR-1 ) and NR4A1 ( NUR77 ) was a common feature in leukemic blasts from human AML patients, irrespective of karyotype. Thus Nor-1 and Nur77 may provide potential targets for therapeutic intervention in AML.","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']","['CA111411/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U19DK62434/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the T-cell lineage, calcineurin activation is important for pre-T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling, TCR-mediated positive selection of thymocytes into mature T cells, and many aspects of the immune response. The critical role of calcineurin in the immune response is underscored by the fact that calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506, are powerful immunosuppressants in wide clinical use. We observed sustained calcineurin activation in human B- and T-cell lymphomas and in all mouse models of lymphoid malignancies analyzed. In intracellular NOTCH1 (ICN1)- and TEL-JAK2-induced T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, two mouse models relevant to human malignancies, in vivo inhibition of calcineurin activity by CsA or FK506 induced apoptosis of leukemic cells and rapid tumor clearance, and substantially prolonged mouse survival. In contrast, ectopic expression of a constitutively activated mutant of calcineurin favored leukemia progression. Moreover, CsA treatment induced apoptosis in human lymphoma and leukemia cell lines. Thus, calcineurin activation is critical for the maintenance of the leukemic phenotype in vivo, identifying this pathway as a relevant therapeutic target in lymphoid malignancies.","['Institut Curie, Batiment 110, Centre Universitaire, 91405 Orsay, France.']",,,,,,,,,,['Nat Med. 2007 Jun;13(6):669-71.

METHODS: The expressions of the mRNA and the protein of PLZF were determined by real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The changes in the expression of the PLZF gene of cultured HCECs were investigated at different times after cell-cell contacts were disrupted by incubation with EDTA. The cell proliferation rate was assessed with a real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) system after cultured HCECs were infected with either PLZF or LacZ encoding adenovirus vector (Ad-PLZF or Ad-LacZ). The PLZF-regulating genes were analyzed by DNA microarray analysis in cultured HCECs infected with Ad-PLZF. RESULTS: The expression of the mRNA of PLZF was first detected when the cultured HCECs became confluent, and the relative amount of PLZF mRNA continued to increase for up to 5 days as the cell-cell contacts were formed more firmly. On the other hand, the expression of the mRNA of PLZF decreased about 20 fold 3 h after EDTA exposure, and gradually returned to the original level as the cell-cell contacts were reformed at 72 h after the exposure. The assessment using the RT-CES system showed that the proliferation of cultured HCECs was inhibited for up to 72 h when infected by Ad-PLZF. DNA microarray analysis revealed that the transforming growth factor-beta stimulated clone 22 (TSC-22) gene was up-regulated by 2.32 fold when infected by Ad-PLZF. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that the expression of PLZF in HCECs is closely related to the formation of cell-cell contacts, and that PLZF may play a role in suppressing their proliferation.","['Department of Ophthalmology, Ehime University Graduate School of Medicine, Shitsukawa, Toon, Ehime, Japan. takeshi@m.ehime-u.ac.jp <takeshi@m.ehime-u.ac.jp>']",,,,PMC2765476,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Parental and child expectancies were significantly correlated. Parents consistently expected their children to experience more pain than children were expecting themselves. Parental expectancy was found to mediate the relationship between child expected and experienced pain during every phase of the study.

Epub 2007 May 21.,"PURPOSE: The aim of this retrospective analysis was to determine the outcome of patients with follicular lymphoma who received myeloablative therapy supported by autologous bone marrow transplantation as consolidation of second or subsequent remission, with a minimum follow-up of 12 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred twenty-one adults received cyclophosphamide (CY) and total-body irradiation (TBI) supported by autologous bone marrow transplantation, with the marrow mononuclear cell fraction having been treated with monoclonal antibodies and complement. Data from St Bartholomew's Hospital and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute were combined for the purpose of this analysis because the patients were treated in an identical manner. RESULTS: Fifty-seven patients are alive, 41 without progression between 9 and 19 years; 64 patients have died, 20 without progression. With a median follow-up of 13.5 years, 60 patients have developed recurrent lymphoma. There is an apparent plateau on the remission duration curve at 48% at 12 years. Survival of patients treated in second remission was significantly longer than the survival of patients treated later in the course of the illness. Both remission duration and overall survival were also significantly longer for patients treated in second remission compared with an age-matched, remission-matched group of patients treated at St Bartholomew's Hospital before the introduction of this treatment. However, use of CY+TBI was associated with a significant risk of secondary myelodysplasia and secondary acute myeloblastic leukemia, resulting in 15 patient deaths. CONCLUSION: These mature data confirm that prolonged freedom from recurrence may be achieved with myeloablative therapy and that a plateau on the curve seems to emerge with long follow-up.","[""Cancer Research UK Medical Oncology Unit, St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, United Kingdom. ama.rohatiner@cancer.org.uk""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A bone marrow aspirate contained 89.6% of undifferentiated tumor cells. A hematological malignancy was suspected and the patient was treated with idarubicin and cytarabine. However, further examination revealed that tumor cells were positive for CD56 and lacked lineage markers of lymphoid or myeloid cells. They were positive for PAS, HHF35 and desmin, and negative for MPO. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction demonstrated PAX3/FKHR fusion transcripts, confirming the diagnosis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. Radiological examination revealed only one enlarged lymph node being 1.5 cm in diameter at the paraaortic region in the abdomen, and failed to find a primary tumor. After three courses of chemotherapy containing etoposide, cyclophosphamide, pirarubicin, cisplatin and vincristine, tumor cells were eradicated from the bone marrow. The patient received an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation eight months after diagnosis, although he died of hepatic veno-occlusive disease on day 21.

Although chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) has dramatically improved response rates in patients with CLL, some CIT regimens are not well tolerated by many patients >or=70 years of age. METHODS: Sixty-four previously untreated patients with CLL and serum creatinine <1.5 times the upper limit of normal who met National Cancer Institute (NCI) 96-WG criteria for treatment received pentostatin (2 mg/m(2)), cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m(2)), and rituximab (375 mg/m(2)). The authors measured performance status at study entry and used age, weight, and baseline creatinine to calculate creatinine clearance (CrCl). RESULTS: Eighteen of 64 (28%) patients were ages >or=70 years. Although individuals ages >or=70 years were more likely to have delayed treatment cycles (28% vs 7%; P=.03), there were no significant differences in the number of cycles administered, need for dose reductions, or grade 3-4 hematologic, infectious, or other toxicities. No significant differences in overall response rate, complete response rate, or progression-free survival were observed by age. Twenty-five (39%) patients had a CrCl < 70 mL/min (range, 34-67). Although individuals with CrCl < 70 were more likely to require dose reduction (24% vs 5%; P=.05), there were no significant differences in the number of cycles administered or grade 3-4 hematologic, infectious, or other toxicities. No significant difference in overall response rate, complete response rate, or progression-free survival were observed between patients with CrCl >or= 70 mL/min and those with CrCl < 70 mL/min. CONCLUSIONS: In this clinical trial, the PCR regimen was well tolerated by older patients and individuals with CrCl <or= 70.

Although increased asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression may contribute to ASNase resistance, there is conflicting data from patient samples with regard to correlation between ASNS mRNA content and ASNase sensitivity. PROCEDURE: Both T-cell and B-cell derived ALL cell lines were treated with ASNase and then monitored for cell proliferation, cell death, and ASNS mRNA and protein expression. RESULTS: Despite elevated ASNS mRNA following ASNase treatment, different ALL cell lines varied widely in translation to ASNS protein. Although ASNS mRNA levels did not consistently reflect ASNase sensitivity, there was an inverse correlation between ASNS protein and ASNase-induced cell death. Expression of ASNS in an ASNase-sensitive cell line resulted in enhanced ASNase resistance, and conversely, siRNA-mediated inhibition of ASNS expression promoted increased drug sensitivity. CONCLUSIONS: These observations provide an explanation for the ASNase sensitivity of ALL cells and demonstrate the importance of measuring ASNS protein rather than mRNA in predicting ASNase responsiveness.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida Shands Cancer Center, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida, USA.']","['CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-52064/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052064/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-107437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA107437/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC8441542,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",['NIHMS51514'],,,,,,

The molecular effects of CTX III on HL-60 cells were dissected in the present study. We found that the antiproliferative action of CTX III on HL-60 cells was mediated through apoptosis, as characterized by an increase of sub G1 population, DNA fragmentation and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Upregulation of Bax, downregulation of Bcl-2, the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c to cytosol and the activations of capase-9 and -3 were noted, while CTX III had no appreciable effect on the levels of Bcl-X(L) and Bad proteins. Moreover, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) was activated shortly after CTX III treatment in HL-60 cells. Consistently, the SP600125 compound, an anthrapyrazolone inhibitor of JNK, suppressed apoptosis induced by CTX III. As expected, this JNK inhibitor also attenuated the modulation of Bax and Bcl-2, as well as the cytosolic appearance of cytochrome c and the activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 that induced by CTX III. These findings suggest that CTX III can induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells via the mitochondrial caspase cascade and the activation of JNK is critical for the initiation of the apoptotic death of HL-60 cells.","['Faculty of Medicinal and Applied Chemistry, Kaohsiung Medical University, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, ROC.']",,,,,,,,"['2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 4,260 patients with newly diagnosed ALL enrolled from 1988 to 1995 onto five concurrent Children's Cancer Group studies. Results were verified in a second cohort of 1,733 patients enrolled onto a sixth study from 1996 to 2002. RESULTS: The 1988 to 1995 cohort included 343 obese and 3,971 nonobese patients. The 5-year event-free survival rate and risk of relapse in obese versus nonobese patients were 72% +/- 2.4% v 77% +/- 0.6% (P = .02) and 26 +/- 2.4 v 20 +/- 0.6 (P = .02), respectively. After adjusting for other prognostic variables, obesity's hazard ratios (HRs) of events and relapses were 1.36 (95% CI, 1.04 to 1.77; P = .021) and 1.29 (95% CI, 1.02 to 1.56; P = .04), respectively.

In neutrophils, Rac and Cdc42 are activated during phagocytosis but less is known about the involvement of these GTPases during the different stages of the phagocytic process. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of Cdc42 in phagocytosis and the subsequent phagosomal maturation. Using a TAT-based protein transduction technique, we introduced dominant negative and constitutively active forms of Cdc42 into neutrophil-like HL60 (human leukemia) cells that were allowed to phagocytose IgG-opsonized yeast particles. Staining of cellular F-actin in cells transduced with constitutively active Cdc42 revealed that the activation of Cdc42 induced sustained accumulation of periphagosomal actin. Moreover, the fusion of azurophilic granules with the phagosomal membrane was prevented by the accumulated F-actin. In contrast, introducing dominant negative Cdc42 impaired the translocation per se of azurophilic granules to the periphagosomal area. These results show that efficient phagosomal maturation and the subsequent eradication of ingested microbes in human neutrophils is dependent on a strictly regulated Cdc42. To induce granule translocation, Cdc42 must be in its active state but has to be inactivated to allow depolymerization of the F-actin cage around the phagosome, a process essential for phagolysosome formation.","['Division of Medical Microbiology, Institute for Molecular and Clinical Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This prompted us to revisit the intriguing issue of CXCL10 production, which we previously showed to be inducible in neutrophils stimulated with LPS and IFN-gamma but not with either stimulus alone, contrary to other myeloid cells. We now report that in neutrophils the MyD88-independent pathway is not activated by LPS. Indeed, microarray and real-time PCR experiments showed that neither IFNbeta nor IFNbeta-dependent genes (including CXCL10) are inducible in LPS-treated neutrophils, in contrast to monocytes. Further investigation into the inability of LPS to promote IFNbeta expression in neutrophils revealed that the transcription factors regulating the IFNbeta enhanceosome, such as IFN-regulatory factor-3 and AP-1, are not activated in LPS-treated neutrophils as revealed by lack of dimerization, nuclear translocation, confocal microscopy, and inducible binding to DNA. Moreover, we show that the upstream TANK-binding kinase-1 is not activated by LPS in neutrophils. A lack of IFNbeta/CXCL10 mRNA expression and IFN-regulatory factor 3 activation was also observed in myeloid leukemia HL60 cells differentiated to granulocytes and then stimulated with LPS, indicating that the inability of neutrophils to activate the MyD88-independent pathway represents a feature of their terminal maturation. These results identify a disconnected activation of the two signaling pathways downstream of TLR4 in key cellular components of the inflammatory and immune responses and help us to better understand the primordial role of neutrophils in host defense against nonviral infections.","['Department of Pathology, University of Verona, Verona, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following adoptive transfer of naive TCR-transgenic CD8(+) T cells into a host expressing a transgenic Ag that is a potentially targetable tumor Ag in normal hepatocytes as a self-Ag, we found that the majority of Ag-specific CD8(+) T cells were deleted, with the remaining cells rendered anergic. Studies in BM chimeric mice and with purified cell populations demonstrated that these events were not dependent on cross-presentation by BM-derived APCs including Kupffer cells or liver sinusoidal endothelial cells, and apparently can occur entirely as a consequence of direct recognition of Ag endogenously processed and presented by hepatocytes. Direct recognition of Ag-expressing hepatocytes in vivo induced a proliferative response and up-regulation of activation markers in responding CD8(+) T cells, but proliferating cells did not accumulate, with most cells rapidly eliminated, and the persisting T cells lost the capacity to proliferate in response to repeated Ag stimulation. The results suggest that parenchymal tissues may retain the capacity to directly regulate in vivo responses to self-Ags processed and presented in the context of class I MHC molecules.","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA.']","['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One way to elicit potent immune responses against these Ags is to use recombinant viruses, which activate both the innate and the adaptive arms of the immune system. In this study, we have compared Semliki Forest virus (SFV), adenovirus, and ALVAC (poxvirus) vectors for their capacity to induce CD8(+) T cell responses against the P1A tumor Ag and to elicit protection against subsequent challenge injection of P1A-expressing P815 tumor cells in DBA/2 mice. Both homologous and heterologous prime-boost regimens were studied. In most cases, both higher CD8(+) T cell responses and better tumor protections were observed in mice immunized with heterologous prime-boost regimens, suggesting that the combination of different viral vectors is beneficial for the induction of an effective immune response. However, homologous immunization with SFV provided potent tumor protection despite a rather moderate primary CD8(+) T cell response as compared with mice immunized with recombinant adenovirus. SFV-immunized mice showed a rapid and more extensive expansion of P1A-specific CD8(+) T cells in the tumor-draining lymph node after tumor challenge and had a higher frequency of CD62L(+) P1A-specific T cells in the blood, spleen, and lymph nodes as compared with adenoimmunized mice. Our results indicate that not only the magnitude but in particular the quality of the CD8(+) T cell response correlates with tumor protection.","['Department of Microbiology, Tumor and Cell Biology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present investigations were directed at determining the mechanism of action of this agent. NK314 induced significant G(2) cell cycle arrest in several cell lines, independent of p53 status, suggesting the existence of a common mechanism of checkpoint activation. The Chk1-Cdc25C-Cdk1 G(2) checkpoint pathway was activated in response to 100 nmol/L NK314 in ML-1 human acute myeloid leukemia cells. This was associated with the phosphorylation of the histone variant H2AX, an action that was predominant in the G(2) population, suggesting that double-strand DNA breaks caused cells to activate the checkpoint pathway. Double-strand DNA breaks were visualized as chromosomal aberrations when the G(2) checkpoint was abrogated by 7-hydroxystaurosporine. In vitro assays showed that NK314 inhibited the ability of topoisomerase IIalpha to relax supercoiled DNA and trapped topoisomerase IIalpha in its cleavage complex intermediate. CEM/VM1 cells, which are resistant to etoposide due to mutations in topoisomerase IIalpha, were cross-resistant to NK314. However, CEM/C2 cells, which are resistant to camptothecin due to mutations in topoisomerase I, retained sensitivity. These findings support the conclusion that the major mechanism of NK314 is to inhibit topoisomerase IIalpha, an action that leads to the generation of double-strand DNA breaks, which activate the G(2) DNA damage checkpoint pathway.","['Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Box 71, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']","['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tumours can, on occasion, occur without concurrent or antecedent leukaemia. Myeloid sarcomas have been described at unusual locations including the female genital tract. An unusual case of therapy-related acute myeloid leukaemia (t-AML) presenting as isolated monoblastic myeloid sarcoma of the uterus in a patient who had received adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is presented. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis performed on paraffin-wax-embedded tumour tissue revealed a mixed-lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene rearrangement, supporting the association of this malignancy with prior chemotherapy. This case illustrates that t-AML can rarely present as isolated extramedullary tumours, and the detection of specific chromosomal abnormalities in these myeloid sarcomas can be useful for risk assessment and guiding definitive therapy.","['Division of Haematology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010, USA. vpullarkat@coh.org']","['P01 CA030206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2 P01 CA030206-24A1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5P30 CA33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1994540,,,,,,,,,,,

The small-molecule inhibitor imatinib (Gleevec/STI-571) can specifically inactivate the tyrosine kinase c-Abl, whose normal mechanism of autoinhibition is disrupted in chronic myelogenous leukemia. Crystallographic analysis of c-Abl reveals that imatinib recognizes a distinct inactive conformation of the Abl kinase domain that relies on the mechanism of autoinhibition achieved in the context of a larger fragment of the protein. This mechanism is distinct from that seen in the related Src family kinases, where autoinhibition is achieved through the internal engagement of a C-terminal phosphotyrosine residue by the Src homology 2 domain (SH2) domain. Notably, this phosphotyrosine residue is lacking in c-Abl, where instead autoinhibition is mediated by an interaction between the kinase domain and the N-terminal myristoyl modification. Within the framework of these 2 distinct modes of autoinhibition, the SH3-SH2 unit is structurally conserved between Abl and Src, leading to large conformational differences in their kinase domains. These differences help explain the ability of imatinib to preferentially inhibit Abl over Src.","['Department of Biochemistry, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3G 1Y6, Canada. bhushan.nagar@mcgill.ca']",,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1093/jn/137.6.1518S [doi],,

Total oligomers flavonoids (TOF) enriched, methanol and ethyl acetate extracts were prepared from powdered R. alaternus leaves and characterized quantitatively for the presence of polyphenolic compounds. We explored the response to oxidative stress using the transcriptional profile of genes in K562 cells stressed with H2O2 after incubation with plant extracts. For this purpose, we used a cDNA microarrays containing 82 genes related to cell defense, essentially represented by antioxidant and DNA repair genes. Analysis revealed that SOD1, AOE 372, TXN genes involved in the antioxidant defense system and XPC, LIG4, POLD2, PCNA genes implied in the DNA repair system were among the most expressed ones in the presence of the tested extracts. These results were in accordance with those obtained when we tested the antigenotoxic and antioxidant effects of the same extracts with, respectively the SOS chromotest and the xanthine/xanthine oxidase enzymatic assay system. The effect of the tested extracts on SOS response induced by both Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1: 10 microg/assay) and nifuroxazide (20 microg/assay) showed that the TOF extract exhibited the highest antimutagenic level towards the indirect mutagen AFB1. Whereas ethyl acetate extract showed the highest antimutagenic effect towards the direct mutagen, nifuroxazide. None of the tested extracts induced mutagenic activity. However all the tested extracts exhibited xanthine oxidase inhibiting and superoxide anions scavenging effects. R. alaternus extracts contain compounds with significant antioxidant and antigenotoxic activities. These compounds modulate gene expression as detected by using cDNA arrays.","['Unite de Pharmacognosie/Biologie Moleculaire 99/UR/07-03, Faculte de Pharmacie/Medecine Dentaire de Monastir, Rue Avicenne 5000 Monastir, Tunisie.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 21.,"OBJECTIVES: Arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) was found to induce apoptosis in certain types of cancer cells including acute promyelocytic leukemia, and recently in solid tumors. We have previously demonstrated that As(2)O(3) has a therapeutic effect on cervical cancer by apoptosis promotion in vitro and in vivo. Here we further our study on the role of arsenic trioxide in regulating invasive activity of cervical cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The effects of As(2)O(3) on human cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa, SiHa, Caski) adhesion, migration and invasion were observed by means of cell adhesion test, cell migration test and cell invasion test. The effects of As(2)O(3) on p-IkappaB, MMP-2, E-cadherin, caveolin-1 and beta-catenin protein expressions of tumor cells were determined by Western blot. In addition, the effects of As(2)O(3) on NF-kappaB activity of tumor cells were analyzed by immunoblot in whole lysates, cytosol and nucleus, respectively. In animal experiments, cervical cancer cells TC-1 were injected into tail veins of C57BL/6 mice and then the mice were treated by intraperitoneal injection of different doses As(2)O(3). Lung weights and the foci on the surface of lungs were measured. RESULTS: As(2)O(3) inhibited attachment of tumor cells to Fibronectin and Matrigel, reduced cell motility and inhibited tumor invasion potential. As(2)O(3) treatment also resulted in a positive regulation of caveolin-1, upregulation of E-cadherin and decreased activity of beta-catenin, NF-kappaB and NF-kappaB-regulated gene MMP-2. In animal experiments, lung weights in PBS group (0.31+/-0.07 g) were significantly elevated compared with those in As(2)O(3)-treated groups (0.21+/-0.03 g and 0.17+/-0.03 g) also As(2)O(3) reduced number of metastatic lesions of lungs (15.4+/-3.5 vs. 8.3+/-2.0 and 6.3+/-2.3) in a dose-dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to report the effectiveness of As(2)O(3) as an inhibitor of cervical cancer invasion both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a potential clinical application of As(2)O(3) in cervical cancer therapies combining apoptosis induction and metastasis inhibition.","['State Key Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Cancer Institute/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, No.17 Panjiayuan Nanli, Chao Yang District, PO Box 2258, Beijing 100021, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 3.,"Atypical retinoids, or retinoid-related molecules (RRMs), represent a class of proapoptotic agents with a promising potential in the treatment of neoplastic diseases. In the present work, the synthesis and structure-activity relationship of a series of 3'-adamantan-1-yl-biphenyl-4-yl-acrylic acids substituted in ring A were studied. The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their antiproliferative activity in a human promyelocitic leukemia cell line (NB4), and in an ovarian carcinoma cell system including IGROV-1, carrying a functional wild-type p53, and a cisplatin-resistant subline, IGROV-1/Pt-1. The presence of at least one oxygenated substituent in positions 4' or 5' appears determinant for the antiproliferative activity. With two substituents of this kind the activity increases, particularly in the case of alkylenedioxy compounds. The activation of DNA damage response as indicated by phosphorylation of H2AX histone, RPA-2 protein, and p53 at serine 15 by the most apoptotic compounds provides additional support to the hypothesis that the genotoxic stress is a critical event mediating apoptosis induction by compounds of this group.","['Dipartimento di Scienze Molecolari Agroalimentari, Universita di Milano, Via Celoria 2, 20133 Milano, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed the potential impact of HIV-1 infection and/or anti-retroviral drugs on the placental cytokine profiles that may be involved in controlling HIV-1 placental dissemination. Placental explants were obtained after elective caesarean section from anti-retroviral-treated HIV-1-infected pregnant women and from HIV-1 non-infected pregnant women. The main placental cytokines were assessed for protein secretion in the supernatants of 24-h placental culture explants and/or in uncultured placental explants for mRNA expression levels. The cytokine profiles were different between the HIV-1-infected and the non-infected groups. Higher medians of leukaemia inhibiting factor (LIF), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 secretion were found in the 24-h culture supernatant of term placenta from HIV-1-infected women. High median levels of IL-16 and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) levels were found in both groups. The mRNA expression medians were lower for TNF-alpha and IL-8 and higher for stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) in uncultured placental explants from HIV-1-infected women. In the HIV-1-infected group, but not in the non-infected group, the secretion levels of TNF-alpha and IL-8, as well as their mRNA expression levels, were highly positively correlated; furthermore, their secretion levels were correlated positively with LIF and IL-10 secretion levels. We found no correlation between the cytokine levels and the immunovirological status of the HIV-1-infected mothers or the type or duration of treatment. These results highlight the potential impact of HIV-1 and of the anti-retroviral treatments on the placental cytokines pattern, independently of their anti-viral activity.","['Unite de Regulation des Infections Retrovirales, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France, and INSERM U782, Clamart, France.']",,['ANRS 1267 study team and the HIV-1 PMTCT-PlaNet'],,PMC2219329,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 18.,"Bcr-Abl is the cause of Philadelphia-positive (Ph(+)) leukemias and also constitutes their principal therapeutic target, as exemplified by dramatic effects of imatinib mesylate. However, mono-targeting of Bcr-Abl does not always achieve complete leukemia eradication, and additional strategies those enable complete elimination of leukemic cells are desired to develop. Here we demonstrate that INNO-406, a much more active Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor than imatinib, augments the activities of several proapoptotic Bcl-2 homology (BH)3-only proteins (Bim, Bad, Bmf and Bik) and induces apoptosis in Ph(+) leukemia cells via Bcl-2 family-regulated intrinsic apoptosis pathway. ABT-737, an inhibitor of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L), greatly enhanced the apoptosis by INNO-406, even in INNO-406-less sensitive cells with Bcr-Abl point mutations except T315I mutation. In contrast, co-treatment with INNO-406 and other pharmacologic inducers of those BH3-only proteins, such as 17-allylaminogeldanamycin, an heat shock protein-90 inhibitor, or PS-341, a proteasome inhibitor, did not further increase the BH3-only protein levels or sensitize leukemic cells to INNO-406-induced apoptosis, suggesting a limit to how much expression levels of BH3-only proteins can be increased by anticancer agents. Thus, double-barrelled molecular targeting for Bcr-Abl-driven oncogenic signaling and the cell protection by antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins may be the rational therapeutic approach for eradicating Ph(+) leukemic cells.","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']","['CA 43540/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 80188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data were collected at 2 children's hospitals. HUI3 scores could not be calculated for 52% to 61% of the nurse reports at each of the 3 data points because of nurses' use of the ""do not know"" response option. Missing data of this proportion indicate that the nurse serving as a proxy rater independent of directly soliciting responses from the patient will not be able to rate certain attributes of the HUI3 more than half of the time despite having ongoing familiarity with the patient. Because of this, use of the HUI3 by nurse proxies for patients with pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia is not recommended.","[""Division of Nursing Research, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA. pam.hinds@stjude.org""]","['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NR07610/NR/NINR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,['Cancer Nurs. 2008 Jul-Aug;31(4):261-2.

Here, we show that honokiol can induce a cell death distinct from apoptosis in HL60, MCF-7, and HEK293 cell lines. The death was characterized by a rapid loss of integrity of plasma membrane without externalization of phosphatidyl serine. The broad caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk failed to prevent this cell death. Consistently, caspase activation and DNA laddering were not observed. The death was paralleled by a rapid loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, which was mechanistically associated with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore regulated by cyclophilin D (CypD) based on the following evidence: (a) cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of CypD (an essential component of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore), effectively prevented honokiol-induced cell death and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; (b) inhibition of CypD by RNA interference blocked honokiol-induced cell death; (c) CypD up-regulated by honokiol was correlated with the death rates in HL60, but not in K562 cells, which underwent apoptosis after being exposed to honokiol. We further showed that honokiol induced a CypD-regulated death in primary human acute myelogenous leukemia cells, overcame Bcl-2 and Bcl-X(L)-mediated apoptotic resistance, and was effective against HL60 cells in a pilot in vivo study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to document an induction of mitochondrial permeability transition pore-associated cell death by honokiol.","['Cancer Institute, The Second Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 17.,"Overexpression of the human HOXB4 has been shown to induce the expansion and self-renewal of murine hematopoietic stem cells. In preparation for clinical studies, we wished to investigate the effects of HOXB4 on cells from other species, in particular preclinical large animals such as dogs and nonhuman primates. Thus, we transduced CD34(+) cells from nonhuman primates, dogs, and humans with a HOXB4-expressing gammaretroviral vector and a yellow fluorescent protein-expressing control vector. Compared with the control vector, HOXB4 overexpression resulted in a much larger increase in colony-forming cells in dog cells (28-fold) compared with human peripheral blood, human cord blood, and baboon cells (two-, four-, and fivefold, respectively). Furthermore, we found that HOXB4 overexpression resulted in immortalization with sustained growth (>12 months) of primitive hematopoietic cells from mice and dogs but not from monkeys and humans. This difference correlated with increased levels of retrovirally overexpressed HOXB4 in dog and mouse cells compared with human and nonhuman primate cells. The immortalized cells did not show any evidence of insertional mutagenesis or chromosomal abnormalities. Competitive congenic transplantation experiments showed that HOXB4-expanded mouse cells engrafted well after 1 or 3 months of expansion, and no leukemia was observed in mice. Our findings suggest that the growth promoting effects of HOXB4 are critically dependent on HOXB4 expression levels and that this can result in important species-specific differences in potency.

Epub 2007 May 17.,"The measurement of telomere length can give an insight into the replicative history of the cells in question. Much of the observed telomere loss occurs at the stem and progenitor cell level, even though these populations express the enzyme telomerase. Telomerase-transfected hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), although able to maintain telomere length, are still limited in terms of ability to undergo sequential transplantation, and other factors require to be addressed to achieve optimal levels of stem cell expansion. Unchecked telomere loss by HSC, meanwhile, would appear to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure, as observed in the condition dyskeratosis congenita. This heterogeneous inherited condition appears to exhibit telomerase dysfunction as a common final pathogenic mechanism. Although less well-established for acquired marrow failure syndromes, mutations in key telomerase components have been described. The identification of the leukemic stem cell (LSC), along with the desire to target this population with anti-leukemia therapy, demands that telomerase biology be fully understood in this cell compartment. Future studies using primary selected LSC-rich samples are required. A better understanding of telomerase regulation in this population may allow effective targeting of the telomerase enzyme complex using small molecule inhibitors or additional novel approaches.

T-LGL diseases cover a heterogeneous spectrum of disorders that include reactive conditions, typically associated with autoimmune disease, to outright leukemia. These disorders are found in older people, with an average age at initial examination of approximately 60 years and a median survival of more than 10 years in T-LGL leukemia. Systemic symptoms and neutropenia are common at initial examination. Lymphocytosis, composed of small mature lymphocytes with increased cytoplasm, is common. The spleen and bone marrow are involved in T-LGL leukemia, although morphologic findings may be subtle. The immunophenotype is typically that of CD3+/CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. Some cases may be due to chronic immune stimulation, with subsequent clonal escape and proliferation of a neoplastic population of lymphocytes.","['US Labs, Irvine, CA 92612, USA.']",,,,,57,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about this serious infection in the pediatric population. We conducted this study to analyze characteristics of CNS aspergillosis in infants and children. METHODS: The English literature was reviewed and all CNS aspergillosis cases in patients younger than 18 years of age were analyzed. RESULTS: Ninety cases were recorded up to June 2005. The median age of the patients was 9 years, ranging from 18 days to 18 years (15.6% younger than 1 year). CNS aspergillosis most commonly presented as brain abscess(es), either single or multiple. While prematurity was the predominant underlying condition among infants, leukemia was the most frequent underlying disease in children. Aspergillus fumigatus was isolated from 75.5% of the cases. The overall mortality in published cases was 65.4%. In multivariate analysis, surgical treatment was independently associated with survival. CONCLUSION: CNS aspergillosis in infants and children predominantly presents as brain abscess(es) and has significantly better outcome compared to published adult data. The findings of this systematic review could assist future investigations for improved outcome of this life-threatening infection in pediatric patients.","['Third Department of Pediatrics, Aristotle University, Hippokration Hospital, Konstantinoupoleos 49, GR 54642 Thessaloniki, Greece.']",,,,,73,,,,,['Int J Infect Dis. 2008 Jul;12(4):450.

METHODS: Eighty-one unselected children with HL aged 5 years or under at diagnosis, treated on the United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) Hodgkin's trials HD1 (1982-1992) and HD2 (1992-2000), were included in the study. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (81%) presented with early stage disease (n=66). Fifty-three patients (65%) received combination chemotherapy, 28 (34%) received involved field radiotherapy (IF-RT) and 4 patients were treated with combined modality therapy. Eighteen children relapsed after primary therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Children treated with IF-RT had a higher rate of primary treatment failures as well as increased late treatment-related morbidity.","['Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, University College Hospital NHS Trust, 1st Floor, West Wing, 250, Euston Road, London NW1 2PG, UK.']",,"[""Children's Cancer and Leukaemia Group""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most common central nervous system infection caused by L. monocytogenes is acute bacterial meningitis; meningoencephalitis is uncommon and encephalitis is rare. Early diagnosis of L. monocytogenes meningitis is difficult because only 50% of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram stains are negative. L. monocytogenes is one of the few central nervous system pathogens associated with red blood cells in the CSF. When L. monocytogenes presents as encephalitis with red blood cells in the CSF, the clinical presentation mimics most closely herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 encephalitis. Because the therapies for L. monocytogenes and HSV-1 are different, early diagnostic differentiation is clinically important. The CSF lactic acid is the best way to rapidly differentiate between these two entities; the CSF lactic acid level is elevated in L. monocytogenes but is not elevated in HSV-1 encephalitis. The case presented is an elderly man with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who presented with encephalitis. Advanced age and chronic lymphocytic leukemia predispose him to a wide variety of pathogens, but the rapidity and severity of his clinical presentation made L. monocytogenes and HSV-1 encephalitis the most likely diagnostic possibilities. The CSF Gram stain was negative, but the elevated CSF lactic acid levels with encephalitis and red blood cells in the CSF indicated L. monocytogenes as the most likely pathogen. We present a case of L. monocytogenes encephalitis mimicking HSV-1 encephalitis. While receiving ampicillin therapy, the patient remained unresponsive for more than 1 week and then suddenly regained consciousness and recovered without neurologic sequelae.","['Infectious Disease Division, Winthrop-University Hospital, Mineola, New York, 11501, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with newly diagnosed chronic-phase CML treated with the TKI imatinib mesylate typically experience a complete cytogenetic remission. Outcomes for patients with advanced-phase disease are distinctly worse. Unfortunately, a small proportion of chronic-phase patients experience relapse during this therapy, and most with advanced-phase disease develop resistance to imatinib mesylate after months of therapy. Hematopoietic cell transplantation remains the only curative approach for CML and can salvage patients with advanced-phase disease. Therefore, physicians must carefully monitor patients with chronic-phase CML treated with TKIs so that they can undergo hematopoietic cell transplant (or treatment with another TKI or experimental therapy) before frank progression occurs. Fortunately, monitoring CML using cytogenetic and molecular methods (i.e., quantitative polymerase chain reaction) effectively defines end points that correlate highly with outcome.","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, Seattle, WA 98109, USA. jradich@fhcrc.org']",,,,,39,,,,,,,,,,

The discrimination efficiency for a given hybridization time grows monotonously with the frequency of flow pulsations. The mixing with frequency 10 Hz accelerates the hybridization rate approximately thrice and improves the discrimination efficiency 1.5-2.5 times higher for overnight hybridization.

The sensitivity in self-reporting cancers was 85.7%, ranging from 92.1% for breast cancer to 42.9% for leukemia. The accuracy for breast cancer and Hodgkin's Lymphoma was significantly better than other cancers (p=0.00027, CI: 1.4-3.88). Analysis of patient's characteristics showed that Caucasians reported breast cancer more accurately than Asian/Pacific Islanders (p=0.008), and those with Jewish ancestry more accurately than non-Jewish (p=0.0435).

Epub 2007 May 17.,"Idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES) comprise a spectrum of indolent to aggressive diseases characterized by persistent hypereosinophilia. Hypereosinophilia can result from the presence of a defect in the hematopoietic stem cell giving rise to eosinophilia, it can be present in many myeloproliferative disorders or alternatively it may be a reactive form, secondary to many clinical conditions. The hybrid gene FIP1L1-PDGRFalpha was identified in a subset of patients presenting with HES or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL). In spite of this, the majority of HES patients do not present detectable molecular lesions and for many of them the diagnosis is based on exclusion criteria and sometimes it remains doubt. In this study we explored the possibility to distinguish between HES/CEL and reactive hypereosinophilia based on WT1 transcript amount. For this purpose, 312 patients with hypereosinophilia were characterized at the molecular and cytogenetic level and analyzed for WT1 expression at diagnosis and during follow-up. This study clearly demonstrates that WT1 quantitative assessment allows to discriminate between HES/CEL and reactive eosinophilia and represents a useful tool for disease monitoring especially in the patients lacking a marker of clonality.","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Department of Clinical and Biological Sciences, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. daniela.cilloni@unito.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 17.,"We studied the effect of CTLA-4 blockade on graft-versus-leukemia and graft-versus-host responses in a mouse model of minor histocompatibility-mismatched bone marrow transplantation. Early CTLA-4 blockade induced acute graft-versus-host disease. Delayed CTLA-4 blockade resulted in a lethal condition with lymphosplenomegaly, but with stable mixed T-cell chimerism, unchanged alloreactive T-cell frequencies and absent anti-host reactivity in vitro. In contrast, multiorgan lymphoproliferative disease with autoimmune hepatitis and circulating anti-DNA auto-antibodies were documented. Splenic lymphocytes exhibited ex vivo spontaneous proliferation and a marked proliferative response against host-type dendritic cells pulsed with syngeneic (host-type) tissue-peptides. Both phenomena were exclusively mediated by host and not donor T cells, supporting an autoimmune pathogenesis. Selectively host-derived T-cell immune reactivity was equally documented against leukemia-peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, and this was paralleled by a strong in vivo antileukemic effect in anti-CTLA-4-treated and subsequently leukemia-challenged chimeras. In conclusion, delayed CTLA-4 blockade induced a host-derived antileukemic effect, occurring in the context of an autoimmune syndrome and strictly separated from graft-versus-host disease. Both antileukemic and autoimmune responses depended on the allogeneic component, as neither effect was seen after syngeneic bone marrow transplantation. Our findings reveal the potential of using CTLA-4 blockade to establish antileukemic effects after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, provided autoimmunity can be controlled.","['Laboratory of Experimental Transplantation, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incidence of AML and MDS increases with age, peaking in the seventh decade. Despite improved Ara-C and anthracyclin-based chemotherapy regimens, the prognosis of AML in patients beyond 60 years of age is dismal. The introduction of peripheral blood-derived stem cell grafts into allogeneic HCT and the known anti-leukaemic effect of donor lymphocyte infusions paved the way for reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, which makes transplant in advanced age possible and significantly reduces transplant-related organ toxicity and mortality. The success of RIC HCT relies on the alloreactivity of the donor immune system and the graft-versus-leukaemia effect. We try to answer the following questions in this paper: who should receive RIC HCT? when and how should the transplant be performed? is there an upper age limit and what is the future of RIC HCT?","['Division of Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation, Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany.']",,,,,45,,,,,,,,,,

Use of AS101 with Bryostatin-1 or with a low concentration of PMA resulted in the differentiation of HL-60 cell line to cells with characteristics of macrophages. A similar synergistic effect was found in vivo. Compared with mice treated with AS101 alone or with Bryostatin-1 alone, the infiltration of leukemic cells into the spleen and the peritoneum of mice treated with both compounds, as well as the number of the HL-60 colonies extracted from those organs, were markedly reduced. The antitumor effects were associated with significantly prolonged survival (100% for 125 days) of the treated mice. Finally, the mechanism of action of this antitumor effect was explored, and was found to involve the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway. Combined treatment with AS101 and Bryostatin-1 synergistically increased p21(waf1) expression levels independently of p53. Upregulation of p21(waf1) was necessary for HL-60 cell differentiation, which was found to be both c-raf-1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase dependent. This study may have implications for the development of strategies to induce differentiation in myeloid leukemias, myelodysplasias and possibly in other malignancies.","['The Mina and Everard Goodman Faculty of Life Sciences, Safdie Institute for AIDS and Immunology Research, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, antithymocyte globulin (ATG), a polyclonal immunoglobulin induces hematological responses in up to 60% of MDS patients. We report herein on the results of a retrospective multicenter study on the use of ATG in the treatment of 96 patients with MDS. Patients were evaluated for duration of response to ATG, as well as survival after administration of ATG. The median age of the cohort was 54.7 years (range: 19-75 years), with a median follow-up of 33.8 months (range: 0.8-133 months). A total of 40 patients (42%) achieved a hematological response, of which 30 patients (75%) had a durable hematological response lasting a median duration of 31.5 months (range: 6-92 months). On multivariate analysis, both low International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) and bone marrow (BM) hypocellularity were independent predictive factors for improved response to ATG (IPSS Int-2/high: odds ratio (OR) 0.08, P=0.018 and BM normo/hypercellularity: OR 0.49, P=0.012). In addition, IPSS was the sole predictor of overall survival, with Int-2/high risk patients having a significantly poorer survival outcome (OR 0.08, P<0.01). In conclusion, this study identifies BM hypocellularity and a low IPSS as important factors predicting response to ATG.","['Kings College London, Department of Haematological Medicine, Kings College Hospital, London, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,['Acta Haematol. 2016;136(1):23-42.

In this context, p53-inducible genes encoding the BH3-only proteins of the Bcl-2 family, Noxa and Puma, were identified. Gene knockout studies revealed that both Noxa and Puma are involved in apoptosis induction in oncogene-expressing cells. BH3-only proteins induce apoptosis, and activate the downstream apoptosis effectors Bax and Bak. In this study, we found that Noxa and Puma synergistically activate Bax and Bak, and induce apoptosis. Although Noxa activates Bak by inactivating Mcl-1 and Bcl-X(L), gene knockdown studies revealed that neither Mcl-1 nor Bcl-X(L) is involved in this synergism. Moreover, Puma, but not Noxa, directly activated Bax in the absence of Bak, and Noxa enhanced Puma-mediated Bax activation in Bak-deficient cells. These results suggest the existence of a novel regulatory pathway for Noxa-mediated apoptosis. Although we detected synergistic induction of apoptosis by Noxa and Bim, a tumor suppressive transcriptional factor FoxO3-inducible protein, no such synergism was observed for other pairs of BH3-only proteins, Bim and Bid, or Bim and Puma. From these results, it can be considered that p53 carefully controls apoptosis by allowing two molecules to share full ability to induce apoptosis.","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Institute of Gerontology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School, 1-396 Kosugi-cho, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki, Kanagawa 211-8533, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ectopic expression of TAL1 and LMO1 genes is linked to the development of T-ALL in humans. In TAL1xLMO1 mice, leukemia develops in 100% of mice at 5 months. To identify the molecular events crucial to leukemic transformation, we produced several mouse models. We report here that expression of P16(INK4A) in developing TAL1xLMO1 thymocytes blocks leukemogenesis in the majority of the mice, and the leukemias that eventually develop show P16(INK4A) loss of expression. Events related to the T-cell receptor beta selection process are thought to be important for leukemic transformation. We show here that the absence of the pTalpha chain only slightly delays the appearance of TAL1xLMO1-induced T-ALL, which indicates a minor role of the pTalpha chain. We also show that the CD3epsilon-mediated signal transduction pathway is essential for this transformation process, since the TAL1xLMO1xCD3epsilon-deficient mice do not develop T-ALL for up to 1 year.","[""Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U462, Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",['Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC1988920,,,,,,,,,,,

However, genotypes determined in tumor and somatic tissues may differ due to cytogenetic and molecular changes associated with malignant transformation and progression. Discordance between germ line and tumor genotypes may be particularly relevant in leukemia because cytogenetic abnormalities are frequent. We compared genotypes determined in DNA extracted from paired pretreatment bone marrow and buccal samples from 80 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Paired AML and buccal DNA samples were genotyped for polymorphisms (21 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 2 gene deletions) on genes encoding proteins involved in drug metabolism (CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CDA, and GSTP1), oxidative stress mechanisms (CAT, MnSOD, GSTT1, GSTM1, GSTA1, and GPX1), drug transport (MDR1, MRP1, and BCRP), and DNA repair (MGMT, XPD, and XRCC1). Genotypes were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, except GSTM1 and GSTT1, for which deletion genotypes were determined using multiplex PCR. Concordance of genotypes was tested by kappa statistics. kappa statistics for paired AML and buccal DNA samples ranged between 0.94 and 1.00, indicating excellent agreement. The GSTT1 and GSTM1 genotypes were in perfect concordance for the paired samples. Agreement was also excellent for genes at AML chromosome deletion and translocation breakpoints, including MDR1 at 7q21.1 and MRP1 at 16p13.1. Based on these data, genotypes derived from archived AML bone marrow samples were not likely to differ from those from genomic DNA, and archived bone marrow samples may be useful for the conduct of retrospective pharmacogenetic studies.","['Department of Epidemiology and Cancer Prevention, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that primarily infects CD4+ T lymphocytes and causes adult T-cell leukemia. Here, we report that overexpression of human PTTG cooperated with the HTLV-I Tax oncoprotein in cellular transformation. Coexpression of Tax and PTTG enhanced chromosomal instability and neoplastic changes to levels greater than overexpression of either factor singularly. Cells that overexpressed both PTTG and Tax induced tumors more robustly in nude mice than cells that expressed either PTTG alone or Tax alone.","['Molecular Virology Section, Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",,,,PMC1951308,,,,,,,,,,,

Ten-fold serial dilutions of three recombinant IFNs available for therapy, human IFNalpha(2a), IFNalpha(A/D) and feline IFNomega were added to the chronically FeLV-infected cell line FL74. IFNs did not apparently affect viral protein expression. However, reverse transcriptase activity (RT), directly proportional to the amount of infectious free virions, decreased with increasing concentrations of IFN and longer treatment times. The induction of apoptosis by IFN was suspected. Results of its evaluation by annexin V-Fluos staining showed that IFNs decreased the viability of treated FeLV-infected cells, and increased apoptosis, but not of non-infected cells. According to the IC(50), rHuIFNalpha(A/D) appeared to be the most effective IFN in inhibiting RT.","['Departamento de Sanidad Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense, 28040 Madrid, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transcriptional activation of this gene through chromosome rearrangements or other, yet to be identified mechanisms leads to particularly aggressive forms of human myeloid leukemia. In vitro as well as in animal model systems, EVI1 affected cellular proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis in cell type specific ways. Retroviral integrations into the EVI1 locus provided cells with increased abilities to engraft, survive, and proliferate in bone marrow transplantation experiments. Experimental overexpression of EVI1 by itself was insufficient to cause leukemia in animal model systems, but it cooperated with other genes in this process. This review summarizes the currently available experimental evidence for the proposed biochemical and biological functions of this important oncogene.","['Department of Medical Genetics, Medical University of Vienna, Wahringerstr, 10, A-1090 Wien, Austria. rotraud.wieser@meduniwien.ac.at']",['P 17896/Austrian Science Fund FWF/Austria'],,,,100,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 16.,"AIMS: To characterize alemtuzumab pharmacokinetics and its exposure-response relationship with white blood cell (WBC) count in patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). METHODS: Nonlinear mixed effects models were used to characterize plasma concentration-time data and WBC count-time data from 67 patients. Logistic regression was used to relate summary measures of drug exposure to tumour response. RESULTS: Alemtuzumab pharmacokinetics were best characterized by a two-compartment model with nonlinear elimination where V(max) (microg h(-1)) was [1020 x (WBC count/10 x 10(9) l(-1))(0.194)], K(m) was 338 microg l(-1), V(1) was 11.3 l, Q was 1.05 l h(-1) and V(2) was 41.5 l. Intersubject variability (ISV) in V(max), K(m), V(1) and V(2) was 32%, 145%, 84% and 179%, respectively. The reduction in WBC over time was modelled by a stimulatory loss indirect response model with values of 18.2 for E(max), 306 microg l(-1) for EC(50), 1.56 x 10(9) cells l(-1) h(-1) for K(in) and 0.029 per h for K(out). The probability of achieving a complete or partial response was >/=50% when the maximal trough concentration exceeded 13.2 microg ml(-1) or when AUC(0-tau) exceeded 484 microg h(-1) ml(-1). CONCLUSIONS: Alemtuzumab displayed time- and concentration-dependent pharmacokinetics with large interpatient variability, both in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which was probably reflective of differences in tumour burden among patients. A direct relationship between maximal trough concentrations and clinical outcomes was observed, with increasing alemtuzumab exposure resulting in a greater probability of positive tumour response.","['Projections Research, Phoenixville, PA, USA.']",,,,PMC2000651,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the treatment of acute promyelocic leukemia with all-trans retinoic acid is an outstanding example, the full potential of retinoids in oncology has not yet been exploited and a more generalized use of these compounds is not yet a reality. This may be the result of issues such as natural and induced resistance as well as local and systemic toxicity. One way to enhance the therapeutic and chemopreventive activity of retinoic acid and derivatives is to identify rational combinations between these compounds and other pharmacological agents. This is now possible given the wealth of information available on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms underlying the biological activity of retinoids. At the cellular level, the anti-leukemia and anti-cancer activity of retinoids is the result of three main actions, cell-differentiation, growth inhibition and apoptosis. At the molecular level, retinoids act through the activation of nuclear-retinoic-acid-receptor-dependent and-independent pathways. The cellular pathways and molecular networks relevant for retinoid activity are modulated by a panoply of other intra-cellular and extra-cellular pathways that may be targeted by known drugs and other experimental therapeutics. The review article aims to summarize and critically discuss the available knowledge in the field and provide a rational framework that may be useful for the design of effective drug combinations with the potential to enhance the therapeutic index of retinoids.","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Centro Catullo e Daniela Borgomainerio, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy. egarattini@marionegri.it']",,,,,346,,,,,,,,,,

AML is the only human neoplasm proven to be potentially caused by benzene, which actually is an obsolete form of chemotherapy. Despite many years of environmental regulation, alleged toxic exposure to this ubiquitous chemical has become an expanding area of litigation. A review of benzene-induced AML suggests that, in developed countries, this entity should no longer merit serious consideration among workers in the modern petrochemical industry and related fields.","['Department of Medicine, Weill Medical College at the Methodist Hospital, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. enatelson@tmh.tmc.edu']",,,,,79,,,"['2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc']",,,,,,,

Urinary symptoms are frequent in patients with myelopathy and consist principally of nocturia, frequency, urgency, and urinary incontinence; however, the importance of these dysfunctions and their correlation with myelopathy is still to be fully clarified. This review gives particular emphasis to the high frequency of urinary and sexual complaints not only in patients with myelopathy but also in individuals considered to be HTLV-I carriers. Detrusor overactivity and bladder-sphincter dyssynergia are the most common urodynamic findings. The fact that urinary complaints and urodynamic parameters reported in individuals considered to be carriers are similar to those detected in patients with myelopathy supports the hypothesis that urinary disorders may represent an oligosymptomatic form of HAM/TSP. Erectile dysfunction is frequently observed in HTLV-I-infected patients with or without myelopathy. Urinary tract infections are also highly prevalent in these patients. Despite the lack of an effective treatment for myelopathy, the use of anticholinergic drugs and phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors may improve urinary complaints and erectile dysfunction in these patients.","['Immunology Service, Hospital Universitario, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, BA, Brazil. paulourologia@hotmail.com']",,,,,30,,,,,,,,,,

No cases of congestive heart failure were reported, whereas four decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction occurred after FEC100 and five after Epi-Vnr. One case of acute myeloblastic leukaemia was registered in the FEC100 arm. After 7 years of follow-up, there was no difference between treatment arms.

We quantified such risk using a large dataset from 13 population-based cancer registries. METHODS: The registries provided individual data on cases of leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma occurring in children aged 0-14 years and on subsequent second malignant neoplasms for different time periods from 1943 to 2000. Risks of second malignant neoplasms were assessed through standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), using the incidence rates in the general populations covered by the registries as a reference. Cumulative absolute risks were also calculated. RESULTS: A total of 133 second malignant neoplasms were observed in 16,540 patients (12,731 leukemias, 1246 Hodgkin lymphomas, and 2563 non-Hodgkin lymphomas) after an average follow-up of 6.5 years. The most frequent second malignancies after leukemia were brain cancer (19 cases, SIR = 8.52, 95% CI = 5.13 to 13.3), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (nine cases, SIR = 9.41, 95% CI = 4.30 to 17.9), and thyroid cancer (nine cases, SIR = 18.8, 95% CI = 8.60 to 35.7); the most frequent after Hodgkin lymphoma were thyroid cancer (nine cases, SIR = 52.5, 95% CI = 24.0 to 99.6), breast cancer (six cases, SIR = 20.9, 95% CI = 7.66 to 45.4), and neoplasms of skin (non-melanoma) (six cases, SIR = 34.0, 95% CI = 12.5 to 74.0); and the most frequent after non-Hodgkin lymphoma were thyroid cancer (six cases, SIR = 40.4, 95% CI = 14.8 to 88.0) and brain cancer (four cases, SIR = 6.97, 95% CI = 1.90 to 17.9). Cumulative incidence of any second malignant neoplasm was 2.43% (95% CI = 1.09 to 3.78), 12.7% (95% CI = 8.29 to 17.2), and 2.50% (95% CI = 1.04 to 3.96) within 30 years from diagnosis of leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study provides, to our knowledge, the most precise and up-to-date estimates for relative and absolute risks of second malignant neoplasms after childhood leukemia and lymphoma.","['Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont, Cancer Epidemiology Unit, CPO Piemonte, CeRMS, University of Turin, Via Santena 7, 10126, Turin, Italy. milena.maule@unito.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 15.,"To determine whether the leukemia-associated Wilms tumor antigen (WT1) contributes to a graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect after allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (SCT) for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we studied CD8(+) T-cell responses to WT1 in 10 human lymphocyte antigen (HLA)-A*0201-positive ALL patients during the early phase of immune recovery after SCT (days 30-120). Seven of 10 patients had detectable WT1 expression in their peripheral blood (PB) before SCT by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Using WT1/HLA-A*0201 tetramers and intracellular interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) staining, WT1(+) CD8(+) T-cell responses after SCT were found only in patients with detectable WT1 expression before SCT (5 of 7 vs. 0 of 3; P < .05). To monitor the kinetics of WT1(+) CD8(+) T-cell responses and disease regression after SCT, absolute WT1(+) CD8(+) T-cell numbers and WT1 expression were studied for each time point. The emergence of WT1(+) CD8(+) T cells was associated with a decrease in WT1 expression, suggesting a WT1-driven GVL effect. Loss of WT1(+) CD8(+) T-cell responses was associated with reappearance of WT1 transcripts, consistent with a molecular relapse (P < .001). WT1(+) CD8(+) T cells had a predominantly effector-memory phenotype (CD45RO(+) CD27(-)CD57(+)) and produced IFN-gamma. Our results support the immunogenicity of WT1 after SCT for ALL and highlight the potential for WT1 vaccines to boost GVL after SCT for ALL.","['Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1201, USA. rezvanik@nhlbi.nih.gov']",['G0501963/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,PMC1976363,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 15.,"UNLABELLED: Resistance to radiotherapy or chemotherapy is a common cause of treatment failure in high-risk leukemias. We evaluated whether selective nanoirradiation of DNA with Auger electrons emitted by 5-(123)I-iodo-4'-thio-2'-deoxyuridine ((123)I-ITdU) can induce cell kill and break resistance to doxorubicin, beta-, and gamma-irradiation in leukemia cells. METHODS: 4'-thio-2'-deoxyuridine was radiolabeled with (123/131)I and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Cellular uptake, metabolic stability, DNA incorporation of (123)I-ITdU, and the effect of the thymidylate synthase (TS) inhibitor 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd) were determined in HL60 leukemia cells. DNA damage was assessed with the comet assay and quantified by the olive tail moment. Apoptosis induction and irradiation-induced apoptosis inhibition by benzoylcarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (z-VAD.fmk) were analyzed in leukemia cells using flow cytometry analysis. RESULTS: The radiochemical purity of ITdU was 95%. Specific activities were 900 GBq/micromol for (123)I-ITdU and 200 GBq/micromol for (131)I-ITdU. An in vitro cell metabolism study of (123)I-ITdU with wild-type HL60 cells demonstrated an uptake of 1.5% of the initial activity/10(6) cells of (123)I-ITdU. Ninety percent of absorbed activity from (123)I-ITdU in HL60 cells was specifically incorporated into DNA. (123)I-ITdU caused extensive DNA damage (olive tail moment > 12) and induced more than 90% apoptosis in wild-type HL60 cells. The broad-spectrum inhibitor of caspases zVAD-fmk reduced (123)I-ITdU-induced apoptosis from more than 90% to less than 10%, demonstrating that caspases were central for (123)I-ITdU-induced cell death. Inhibition of TS with FdUrd increased DNA uptake of (123)I-ITdU 18-fold and the efficiency of cell kill about 20-fold. In addition, (123)I-ITdU induced comparable apoptotic cell death (>90%) in sensitive parental leukemia cells and in leukemia cells resistant to beta-irradiation, gamma-irradiation, or doxorubicin at activities of 1.2, 4.1, 12.4, and 41.3 MBq/mL after 72 h. This finding indicates that (123)I-ITdU breaks resistance to beta-irradiation, gamma-irradiation, and doxorubicin in leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: (123)I-ITdU-mediated nanoirradiation of DNA efficiently induced apoptosis in sensitive and resistant leukemia cells against doxorubicin, beta-irradiation, and gamma-irradiation and may provide a novel treatment strategy for overcoming resistance to conventional radiotherapy or chemotherapy in leukemia. Cellular uptake and cell kill are highly amplified by inhibiting TS with FdUrd.","['Nuclear Medicine Clinic, Universitat Ulm, Ulm, Germany. sven.reske@uniklinik-ulm.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the mechanism by which the virus causes diseases is still not known, studies indicate that viral replication is critical for the development of HTLV-1 associated myelopathy, and initial studies suggested that blocking replication with reverse transcriptase inhibitors had a therapeutic effect. Therefore, based on the success of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, the HTLV-1 protease is also a potential target for chemotherapy. Furthermore, mutated residues in HIV-1 protease that confer drug resistance are frequently seen in equivalent positions of other retroviral proteases, like HTLV-1 protease. Therefore, comparison of HTLV-1 and HIV-1 proteases is expected to aid the rational design of broad spectrum inhibitors effective against various retroviral proteases, including the mutant HIV-1 enzymes appearing in drug resistance. This review describes the characteristics of HTLV-1 protease, makes comparison with HIV-1 protease, and discusses the status of inhibitor development for the HTLV-1 protease.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Research Center for Molecular Medicine, Debrecen University, Debrecen, Hungary. tozser@indi.biochem.dote.hu']","['R01 GM062920/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 062920/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'TW01001/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",,,,45,,,,,,,,,,

The rationale for using such a combination was that deletions and/or mutations of the p53 gene occur in only 5-10% of AML and that TRAIL and nutlin-3 activate the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis, respectively. TRAIL induced a rapid increase of apoptosis when added to OCI M4-type and MOLM M5-type AML cells, carrying a wild-type p53, as well as to NB4 M3-type AML, carrying a mutated p53. On the other hand, the small molecule activator of the p53 pathway nutlin-3 induced p53 accumulation, cell cycle arrest and a slow progressive increase of apoptosis in OCI and MOLM but not in NB4. Of note, nutlin-3 up-regulated the surface expression of TRAIL-R2 and synergized with TRAIL in inducing apoptosis in OCI and MOLM as well as in primary M4-type and M5-type AML blasts, but not in NB4 cells. Moreover, while nutlin-3 up-regulated the expression of cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21, a p53-target gene mediating cell cycle block and showing anti-apoptotic activity, the simultaneous addition of TRAIL plus nutlin-3 induced the caspase-dependent cleavage of p21. The relevance of p21 down-regulation for sensitizing AML cells to apoptosis was underscored in knocking-down experiments with small interfering RNAs. Our data suggest that the combined treatment of nutlin-3 plus TRAIL might offer a novel therapeutic strategy for AML.","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, Human Anatomy Section, University of Ferrara, Via Fossato di Mortara 66, 44100 Ferrara, Italy. secchier@mail.umbi.umd.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations of this equilibrium, mainly affecting the two interdependent mechanisms of DNA methylation and histone acetylation, are frequently involved in the genesis of cancer. The histone code, regulating gene expression, is constituted by the combination of different acetylated lysine residues of histones. In neoplastic cells, the abundance of deacetylated histones is usually associated with DNA hypermethylation and gene silencing. Several compounds, known to have in vitro antineoplastic activity, have been eventually shown to act as histone deacetylase inhibitors. Thus, HDAC inhibitors have been successfully introduced in clinical trials as antitumour agents. They are classified according to their chemical structures and are endowed with different specificity and affinity for the HDACs of classes 1, 2, 4. Among HDAC inhibitors, the most potent are the hydroxamic acid derivatives, like SAHA, which has been recently approved for therapy of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Other classes of HDAC inhibitors are short chain fatty acids (SCFA), benzamides, epoxyketone and non-epoxyketone containing cyclic tetrapeptides, and hybrid molecules. SCFA, although widely used (especially valproic acid) and clinically efficacious, have weak HDAC inhibition constants. Benzamides, like MS-275, and cyclic peptides, like depsipeptide, have been studied in numerous clinical trials and demonstrated low toxicity and activity in solid and haematological neoplasms. HDAC inhibitors are also potent radiation sensitizers. Their future in oncology may thus be based on their activity as single agents and on their synergy with the hypomethylating drugs and with chemo- and radiotherapeutics.","['Hematology Unit, AOU Careggi, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy. santini@unifi.it']",,,,,117,,,,,,,,,,

While their complex mechanisms of action remain unclear, IFNs are used clinically in the treatment of viral infections, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C, and remain the primary treatment for a limited number of malignancies, such as melanoma, hairy cell leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis. IFNs not only regulate somatic cell growth and division but also influence cell survival through the modulation of apoptosis. Paradoxically, IFNs are described to be both pro- and anti-apoptotic in nature. The biological effects of IFNs are primarily mediated via activation of the JAK/STAT pathway, formation of the ISGF3 and STAT1:STAT1 protein complexes, and the subsequent induction of IFN-stimulated genes. However, the activation of JAK/STAT-independent signal transduction pathways also contribute to IFN-mediated responses. To further demonstrate the complexity of the downstream events following stimulation, oligonucleotide microarray studies have shown that in excess of 300 genes are induced following treatment with IFN, some of which are crucial to the induction of apoptosis and cell growth control. In this review we describe the recent advances made in elucidating the various signaling pathways that are activated by IFNs and how these diverse signals contribute to the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis and inhibition of viral replication. Furthermore, we highlight the role of specific signaling molecules and the function(s) of particular IFN-stimulated genes that have been implicated in determining cell fate in response to IFN, as well as the clinical experience of IFN immunotherapy.","['Cancer and Inflammation Program, Laboratory of Experimental Immunology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Frederick, MD 21702-1201, USA.']",,,,,190,,,,,,,,,,

Of note, due to its physico-chemical properties, kinase specificity of Imatinib is limited. Despite of its well documented clinical efficacy mediated by inhibition of constitutively activated tyrosine kinases such as BCR/ABL in CML, PDGF-RA in HES and mutated c-kit in GIST patients, other tyrosine kinases such as Flt-3, Lck and mitogen-activated kinases (MAPK) are affected as well. Accordingly, it has recently been shown that therapeutic doses of Imatinib also target a variety of immune cells, e.g. by modulating the differentiation of dendritic cells (DC) as well as by impeding proper T-cell and macrophage function. In contrast, combining Imatinib with Interleukin 2 (IL-2) potently activates NK-cells and led to the description of a new subclass of DC, so-called IK-DC. The latter mediate Imatinib/IL-2-induced regression of tumors in pre-clinical animal models via production of high amounts of IFN-gamma and the death receptor ligand TRAIL. Thus, Imatinib exerts potent immuno-modulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, which will be discussed together with their clinical relevance in detail throughout this review.","['Laboratory for Tumorimmunology, Tyrolean Cancer Center, Innsbruck Medical University, Austria. dominik.wolf@i-med.ac.at']",,,,,43,,,,,,,,,,

However, the role of different AML1 isoforms within these primitive compartments is unclear. Here we investigate whether altering relative expression of AML1 isoforms impacts the balance between cell self-renewal and differentiation in vitro and in vivo. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The human AML1a isoform encodes a truncated molecule with DNA-binding but no transactivation capacity. We used a retrovirus-based approach to transduce AML1a into primitive haematopoietic cells isolated from the mouse. We observed that enforced AML1a expression increased the competitive engraftment potential of murine long-term reconstituting stem cells with the proportion of AML1a-expressing cells increasing over time in both primary and secondary recipients. Furthermore, AML1a expression dramatically increased primitive and committed progenitor activity in engrafted animals as assessed by long-term culture, cobblestone formation, and colony assays. In contrast, expression of the full-length isoform AML1b abrogated engraftment potential. In vitro, AML1b promoted differentiation while AML1a promoted proliferation of progenitors capable of short-term lymphomyeloid engraftment. Consistent with these findings, the relative abundance of AML1a was highest in the primitive stem/progenitor compartment of human cord blood, and forced expression of AML1a in these cells enhanced maintenance of primitive potential both in vitro and in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that the ""a"" isoform of AML1 has the capacity to potentiate stem and progenitor cell engraftment, both of which are required for successful clinical transplantation. This activity is consistent with its expression pattern in both normal and leukaemic cells. Manipulating the balance of AML1 isoform expression may offer novel therapeutic strategies, exploitable in the contexts of leukaemia and also in cord blood transplantation in adults, in whom stem and progenitor cell numbers are often limiting.","['Division of Molecular Medicine, Aichi Cancer Center Research Institute, Nagoya, Japan. stsuzuki@aichi-cc.jp']",['MC_U137973817/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,PMC1868041,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/D43967', 'GENBANK/D43968', 'GENBANK/D43969', 'GENBANK/U40462', 'GENBANK/X17254', 'RefSeq/NM_001987', 'RefSeq/NM_003189', 'RefSeq/NM_009821']",,,,

Moreover, there are a few literature data about clinical significance of p53 overexpression in multiple myeloma. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical significance of p53 immunoexpression in multiple myeloma. METHOD: A total of 58 patients with newly diagnosed MM (26 females and 32 males, mean age 62 years) were enrolled in the study. The diagnosis of MM was made according to criteria of Chronic Leukemia-Myeloma Task Force. Clinical staging was done according to Durie and Salmon classification (4 patients had disease stage 1, 15 patients stage II and 39 patients stage III). The histological grade and histological stage were determined according to predominant plasma cell morphology and volume of myeloma infiltration, respectively. Standard immunohistochemical analysis with p53 antibody in B5-fixed and paraffin-embedded bone marrow specimens was used to evaluate the expression of p53 in myeloma cells. The specimens were considered positive when 25% of plasma cells exhibited clear nuclear positivity. RESULTS: Out of 58 patients, p53 expression was detected in 9 (15.52%). No significant correlation was found between p53 expression and clinical stage (I+II vs. III), beta2-microglobulin level (< or =6 mg/L vs. > 6 mg/L), histological grade (I vs. II+III), histological stage (<20% vs. 21-50% vs. >50%) and the extent of osteolytic lesions (< or =3 vs. >3 lesions). Median survival of patients with p53 immunoreactivity in =>5% of plasma cells was 10 months, whilst median survival of patients with p53 immunoreactivity in <5% of plasma cells was 36 months.

The effect of Hck on STAT5 was first explored independently of Bcr/Abl by expressing the constitutively active Hck mutant (Hck(ca)) in MEF3T3-TetOff fibroblasts. As previously reported, Hck(ca)-expressing cells form podosomes which are actin-rich structures involved in trans-tissular cell migration and found in the few cell types able to cross anatomic boundaries. We demonstrated that in these cells, the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of STAT5 (PY-STAT5) increased and preferentially localized on podosomes together with Hck, instead of translocating to the nucleus as observed with conventional stimuli such as IFNgamma. To examine whether similar results were obtained in the presence of Bcr/Abl, the CML cell line K562 was used. We observed that (i) podosomal structures are present in these cells in contrast to Bcr/Abl-negative leukemic cells, (ii) podosome formation was inhibited by Bcr/Abl- and Src-kinase inhibitors, and (iii) PY-STAT5 mainly colocalized with Hck on these structures. The presence of podosomes was not sufficient to trap STAT5 since in normal macrophages which spontaneously form podosomes and express regulated Hck, PY-STAT5 is in the nucleus. In conclusion, this is the first report showing that PY-STAT5 associates to podosomes in a process dependent on constitutive activation of Hck. We propose that STAT5, previously classified as a transcription factor, could play another role outside the nucleus, elicited by the Bcr/Abl-Hck transforming pathway.","['Institut de Pharmacologie et de Biologie Structurale, CNRS UMR 5089, Universite Paul Sabatier Toulouse III, Route de Narbonne, Toulouse, France.']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Studies reported the occurrence of additional cytogenetic abnormalities in the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-negative cell population emerging after treatment-induced suppression of the Ph-positive clone. These abnormalities were described in a relatively high proportion of patients treated with imatinib compared with the anecdotal reports of similar cases in patients treated with other drugs. However, the origin of these abnormalities as well as their biological and clinical significance are unknown. METHODS: The study involved 13 cases of patients diagnosed with CML carrying cytogenetic abnormalities in their Ph-negative cell population after imatinib treatment. The presence of the markers within the CD34+ stem cell compartment and the cell culture growth were analyzed and patients were followed over time. RESULTS: CD34+ cells express the cytogenetic markers present in Ph- cells, suggesting a possible involvement of the stem cell population. Cultured cells showed normal growth in all but 1 patient. No growth advantage was demonstrated for the Ph-negative or the Ph-positive clone after cell culture. CONCLUSIONS: After follow-up of up to 49 months, none of the patients had evolved to myelodysplasia or acute leukemia. Hypothesis regarding the biological and clinical significance of these abnormalities are formulated.","['Hematology, S.

Bcr-Abl plays a major role in the development and progression of CML through chronic, accelerated, and blast phases. The interaction between Bcr-Abl and other oncogenic molecules has been extensively documented. Nonetheless, negative regulatory mechanisms of Bcr-Abl are not completely defined. One major inhibitory pathway is mediated via the SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp1. In the present study, we demonstrate that Shp1 levels are markedly decreased in advanced stage CML patients compared with those in chronic phase. This process was independent of DNA methylation. Furthermore, we did not detect mutations in the Shp1 gene in CML cell lines or patient samples. These data suggest that the decrease in Shp1 in advanced stage CML patients is due to post-transcriptional modifications. Our findings suggest that the decrease in Shp1 expression levels plays a role in the progression of CML. Also, the decrease in Shp1 and subsequently its inhibitory effect on Bcr-Abl could provide an explanation for imatinib resistance seen in advanced stage CML patients.","['Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA. hamin@mdanderson.org']","['CA100067/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA105771/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114395/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

This allows to determine directly the different clusterings of the samples present in the data. As a clustering is a structure, genes belonging to the same group are functions of the same structure. Hence, the determination of groups of genes which support the same clustering could also be viewed as the detection of non-linearly linked genes.

Finally, it clustered together cell-cycle genes, showing its ability to group genes related in a non-linear way.","['IBA LAB, Post Box: 704, Graduate School of Frontier Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwanoha 5-1-5, Kashiwa-shi, Chiba 277-8561, Japan. davenet@iba.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 15.,"The objective of this research was to compare the association of birthweight alone with gender-specific birthweight-for-gestational age on childhood cancer risk in a large population-based case-control study in Germany. Incident cases of childhood cancer (n=2,024, diagnosed 1992-1994) were ascertained from the German Childhood Cancer Registry. Controls were randomly drawn from population registries. Parents reported risk factor information in a mailed questionnaire and telephone interview. The odds ratio for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was 1.41 (95% confidence interval 1.08-1.84) in the high-birthweight category (>4 kg) and was 1.45 (1.07-1.97) in the large-for-gestational age (LGA) category compared to the normal birthweight (2.5-4 kg) and the appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) categories, respectively. However, the agreement between the birthweight and birthweight-for-gestational age was only moderate. Subgroup analyses revealed elevated odds ratios for ALL and CNS tumors in first born's who were LGA but of normal birth weight. Thus, two findings from this post-hoc analysis are worthy of note: (1) the use of birthweight-for-gestation age categories within birthweight sub-groups potentially identified new high-risk groups among firstborns for ALL tumors and among all children for CNS tumors; and (2) although the magnitudes of risk estimators for ALL were comparable in the traditional high-birthweight group and in the LGA, the same children were not jointly classified in the same newborn categories indicating two potentially different subsets of children at risk.","['Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100, Copenhagen, Denmark. joachim@cancer.dk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We reviewed the results of diagnostic evaluations of all CSF samples analyzed for localization of a hematologic malignancy between 2001 and 2004 at our center. RESULTS: A total of 1,054 samples from 219 patients were available for analysis. Sixty patients had a CSF localization diagnosed by positive flow cytometry, cytomorphology, or both. The first sample was positive by flow cytometry in 44 (73%) patients, by cytomorphology in 19 (32%). Four first samples were positive by cytomorphology but negative by flow cytometry. Patients with positive cytomorphology had more frequent clinical symptomatology (95% vs 58%) and CSF pleocytosis (84% vs 25%), and tended to a poorer progression-free survival than patients with positive flow cytometry only. OR for CNS localization in case of CSF pleocytosis was 10.1 (95% CI 4.9 to 20.8); OR for CNS localization in case of elevated protein content was 2.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 5.4). Nevertheless, 26 of 137 (19%) patients with normal cell count and protein concentration had a CNS localization. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic value of flow cytometry is more than twice that of cytomorphology. However, cytomorphologic examination of the CSF has additional diagnostic and possibly prognostic value, and should still be performed in conjunction with flow cytometry.","['Department of Neuro-Oncology, Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. j.bromberg@erasmusmc.nl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 17.,"Previous studies indicated that dacarbazine and Temozolomide could be highly effective against refractory acute leukaemia. Their activity relies mainly on the generation of methyl adducts at the O(6)-position of guanine in DNA. High levels of O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) or a defective mismatch repair (MMR) system, are associated with cellular resistance to triazenes. The MGMT inhibitor, O(6)-(4-bromothenyl)guanine (Lomeguatrib), can restore in vitro sensitivity to Temozolomide in MMR-proficient blasts. In the early 1970s we discovered that, in vivo, triazene compounds induce the appearance of novel transplantation antigens in murine leukaemia (""Chemical Xenogenization"", CX). Non-self peptides presented by class I MHC molecules are generated by triazene-induced somatic mutations, affecting retroviral sequences that are detectable in the mouse genome. Moreover, preliminary experiments suggested that human cancer cells can also undergo CX. Therefore, we designed a chemo-immunotherapy strategy in leukaemic patients as follows: (a) cytoreduction and a hypothetical CX phase, i.e. treatment with Lomeguatrib (to suppress MGMT activity) and Temozolomide (to kill sensitive blasts and to presumably induce CX in resistant leukaemic cells); (b) immune response recovery phase using interleukin-2 (to possibly restore an immune response and take advantage of the hypothetical, triazene-induced CX). Here we present the results of pilot study which is in progress in patients with refractory/relapsed acute leukaemia. In all tested cases, Lomeguatrib suppressed MGMT activity in vivo. Six out of eight patients showed partial or complete disappearance of blast cells in peripheral blood or in bone marrow. We observed severe and long-lasting myelosuppression, accompanied by limited non-haematological toxicity. Up to now, two patients are alive (after 9 and 10 months, respectively), four died of opportunistic infections and two of progressive disease. This investigation confirms the potential role of triazenes in leukaemia and highlights the contribution of Lomeguatrib in overcoming drug resistance. Further studies are required to establish whether Temozolomide can induce CX in human leukaemia, and thus offer a new approach to control minimal residual disease.","[""Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Istituto Dermopatico dell'Immacolata-IRCCS, Via dei Monti di Creta 104, 00167 Rome, Italy.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Myeloid sarcoma of female genital tract is very rare with no cases of vulvar location reported in English-language literature. CASE: A 73-year-old female presented with an indurated mass encompassing her left labia majora and vulva. The mass was diagnosed as vulvar myeloid sarcoma. The patient's peripheral blood smear revealed Auer rods and other findings consistent with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (M-2 type, FAB classification). CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge this case is the first report in the English-language literature of the myeloid sarcoma of the vulva. Correct diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma in an otherwise asymptomatic patient is crucial for early administration of antileukemic chemotherapy.","['Department of Pathology, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL 60153, USA. cersahi@hotmail.com <cersahi@hotmail.com>']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 11.,"OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of combination chemotherapy with intravenous irinotecan and oral etoposide in women with platinum- and taxane-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer. METHODS: Between October 2002 and September 2005, we studied 27 women with platinum- and taxane-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer. Irinotecan was administered in an intravenous dose of 70 mg/m(2) as a 90-min infusion on days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle, and etoposide was administered in an oral dose of 50 mg/day on days 1 to 21. For heavily pretreated patients, the initial dose of irinotecan was lowered to 60 mg/m(2). Treatment cycles were repeated until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. RESULTS: All 27 patients were eligible and assessable. There were 11 partial responses and 1 complete response for an overall response rate of 44.4%. The median durations of overall response and of stable disease were 11 months and 8 months, respectively. The major toxicity was neutropenia (grade 3, 22.2%; grade 4, 37.1%). Diarrhea was infrequent and mild, and gastrointestinal toxicity was moderate and manageable. Acute myeloid leukemia (M5) developed as a secondary malignancy in 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: The results of our pilot study suggest that a combination of irinotecan and oral etoposide is effective and tolerable in women with platinum- and taxane-resistant epithelial ovarian cancer.","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kurume University School of Medicine, 67 Asahimachi, Kurume, Fukuoka Pretecture, 830-0011, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We propose a new sedimentation field flow fractionation (SdFFF) cell separation application in the field of cancer research. It concerns the study of megakaryocytic differentiation processes after a short exposure to an inducting agent (diosgenin). Washout process and early dual SdFFF separation--removing the influence of diosgenin and decreasing the influence of undifferentiated cells--resulted in the preparation of an enriched population to study the mechanism and kinetics of megakaryocytic differentiation. A short exposure to diosgenin was able to induce complete differentiation leading to maximal maturation which ended naturally after 192h incubation without the influence of a secondary effect of diosgenin. The study of isolated undifferentiated cells also showed that no resistance to diosgenin was observed. This result suggested different sensitivities to differentiation induction, and SdFFF cell separation would be of great interest to explore this phenomena.","['Laboratoire de Biochimie, EA 4021 Biomolecules et Therapies Anti-tumorales, Universite de Limoges, Faculte de Pharmacie, 2 rue du Dr Marcland, 87025 Limoges Cedex, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were cultured for 24 h with IgE treatment in the presence of azelastine or epinastine at the concentration of 10(-5) M. The FcepsilonRIalpha mRNA expression was determined by northern blot analysis. The protein level of FcepsilonRI expressed on the plasma membrane was examined following IgE treatment by immunoprecipitation with anti-IgE light chain, followed by western blot analysis with anti-gamma chain of FcR. Azelastine and epinastine had no effect on the FcepsilonRIalpha, beta and gamma mRNA levels. Although the amount of gamma chain assembled into IgE-bound FcepsilonRI was not changed by treatment with azelastine nor epinastine, phosphorylation levels of gamma chains of IgE-bound FcepsilonRI were inhibited by azelastine. The inhibitory effect of azelastine on the IgE-mediated expression of FcepsilonRIgamma protein is not due to their inhibition of mRNA and protein expression, but due to abrogating phosphorylation of the gamma chains, which is important for initiation of FcepsilonRI signaling cascade elicited by IgE interaction.","['1st Department of Physiology, Unit of Physiological Science, School of Medicine, University of the Ryukyus, 207 Uehara, Nishihara, Okinawa 903-0215, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study aimed to investigate the pharmacological effects of an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeted at Gab2 on the immune responses of rat basophilic leukemic (RBL)-2H3 cells. Gab2 ASOs were rationally designed and transfected into RBL-2H3 cells. Gab2 mRNA and protein knockdown was confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. Effects of Gab2 ASO on FcepsilonRI-induced release of histamine and beta-hexosaminidase was measured by EIA and an enzymatic assay, respectively; signaling events by immunoblotting; and cytokine mRNA expression by RT-PCR. Effects of Gab2 ASO on cell adhesion and migration were performed on fibronectin-coated 96-well plate and transwells cell culture chambers, respectively. We have characterized a phosphorothioate-modified ASO targeted at Gab2 mRNA that was able to knockdown Gab2 mRNA and protein in RBL-2H3 cells. Gab2 ASO significantly blocked IgE-mediated mast cell release of beta-hexosaminidase and histamine; phosphorylation of Akt, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and PKCdelta; and up-regulation of cytokine mRNA levels (e.g. IL-4, -6, -9 and -13, and TNF-alpha). In addition, Gab2 ASO markedly prevented mast cell adhesion to fibronectin-coated plates and restrained random migration of RBL-2H3 cells in cell culture chambers. Our findings show that Gab2 knockdown in RBL-2H3 cells by ASO strategy can suppress many aspects of the mast cell functions and, therefore, a selective Gab2 ASO may have therapeutic potential for mast cell-dependent allergic disorders.","['Department of Pharmacology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Mar 15.,"Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDACi's) are promising novel tools for cancer therapy. We have compared the growth inhibitory and apoptogenic potential of the pan-HDACi SAHA and the sub-class I selective HDAC inhibitor MS275, as well as valproic acid (VPA) on glucocorticoid sensitive and resistant B (B-ALL) and T (T-ALL) cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells and patients blasts. In contrast, to our previous results with U937 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells which showed a similar activity of MS275 and SAHA in growth inhibition and apoptosis induction, both B and T-ALL cells were much more efficiently killed by SAHA and VPA than by MS275. The same relative potency was observed with some patient ALL blasts treated ex vivo. SAHA displayed similar efficacy on glucocorticoid-sensitive and insensitive ALL cells but did not synergize with dexamethasone. In studying mediators of apoptosis we found that the TRAIL receptor DR5 is constitutively expressed in glucocorticoid-sensitive CEM-C7 cells which are also TRAIL sensitive. In contrast, glucocorticoid-insensitive CEM-C1 cells do not express DR5 and are insensitive to TRAIL. However, SAHA induces, in addition to p21(WAF1/CIP1) also re-expression of DR5. Importantly, SAHA-induced apoptosis of CEM-C7 cells operates through initiator caspase 10, while it induces apoptosis of CEM-C1 cells through the intrinsic, as well as through caspase-independent death pathways. Our data suggest that the generation of resistance to glucocorticoids has dramatically altered death signaling in these cells and that SAHA overcomes these restrictions by inducing alternative death pathways.","['Department of Cell Biology and Signal Transduction, Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC)/CNRS/INSERM/ULP, BP 10142, F-67404 Illkirch Cedex, C.U. de Strasbourg, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phylogenetic clustering, genotyping, and geographic distribution of BLV env variations corresponded in most cases. Most natural variations are mapped to the surface of the proposed conformational models of BLV gp51 N-terminus and gp30 external domain, overlapping with or adjacent to immunogenic epitopes. Analyses for evidence of possible selection pressures suggest the BLV env is under stringent negative selection overall, while strong positive selection is indicated for immunogenic epitope G. Natural env deletions bounded by similar flanking sequences were observed in multiple isolates and would result in truncated signal peptides, missing gp51, and aberrant coding frames for other proteins.","['Graduate Program in Endocrinology, 3060 Valley Life Science Building, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-3140, USA. xzhao@berkeley.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/EF065635', 'GENBANK/EF065636', 'GENBANK/EF065637', 'GENBANK/EF065638', 'GENBANK/EF065639', 'GENBANK/EF065640', 'GENBANK/EF065641', 'GENBANK/EF065642', 'GENBANK/EF065643', 'GENBANK/EF065644', 'GENBANK/EF065645', 'GENBANK/EF065646', 'GENBANK/EF065647', 'GENBANK/EF065648', 'GENBANK/EF065649', 'GENBANK/EF065650', 'GENBANK/EF065651', 'GENBANK/EF065652', 'GENBANK/EF065653', 'GENBANK/EF065654', 'GENBANK/EF065655', 'GENBANK/EF065656', 'GENBANK/EF065657', 'GENBANK/EF065658', 'GENBANK/EF065659', 'GENBANK/EF065660', 'GENBANK/EF065661', 'GENBANK/EF065662']",,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 19.,"Retroviruses are well known for their ability to incorporate envelope (Env) proteins from other retroviral strains and genera, and even from other virus families. This characteristic has been widely exploited for the generation of replication-defective retroviral vectors, including those derived from murine leukemia virus (MLV), bearing heterologous Env proteins. We investigated the possibility of ""genetically pseudotyping"" replication-competent MLV by replacing the native env gene in a full-length viral genome with that of another gammaretrovirus. Earlier, we developed replication-competent versions of MLV that stably transmit and express transgenes inserted into the 3' untranslated region of the viral genome. In one such tagged MLV expressing green fluorescent protein, we replaced the native env sequence with that of gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV). Although the GALV Env protein is commonly used to make high-titer pseudotypes of MLV vectors, we found that the env replacement greatly attenuated viral replication. However, extended cultivation of cells exposed to the chimeric virus resulted in selection of mutants exhibiting rapid replication kinetics and different variants arose in different infections. Two of these variants had acquired mutations at or adjacent to the splice acceptor site, and three others had acquired dual mutations within the long terminal repeat. Analysis of the levels of unspliced and spliced viral RNA produced by the parental and adapted viruses showed that the mutations gained by each of these variants functioned to reverse an imbalance in splicing caused by the env gene substitution. Our results reveal the presence of previously unknown cis-acting sequences in MLV that modulate splicing of the viral transcript and demonstrate that tagging of the retroviral genome with an easily assayed transgene can be combined with in vitro evolution as an approach to efficiently generating and screening for replicating mutants of replication-impaired recombinant viruses.","['Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA. logg@ucla.edu']","['R25 CA098010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA059318-080006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA059318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA105171-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R25 CA098010-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA105171/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA59318/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2938735,,,,,['NIHMS24338'],,,,,,

Converting these three SUMO acceptor Lys to Arg 3KR does not significantly affect PLZF nuclear body formation, which is distinct from the scenario of PML sumoylation in PML nuclear body formation. Furthermore, PLZF-3KR markedly reduced the transcriptional repression activity, correlating with a loss of PLZF-mediated growth suppression.

Remarkably, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that only one of the oncogene loci was transcriptionally upregulated in both instances.

A total of 56 samples from 49 patients with CLL were studied using commercially available probes for chromosome regions 11q22.3 (ATM), 13q14 (13S272), 17p13 (p53) and 12 centromere (D12Z3). We compared the results obtained with I-FISH-PBMC and those with I-FISH on TPA (tetradecanoylphorbol acetate; phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) stimulated peripheral blood cells (I-FISH-TPA) used for conventional cytogenetics, to evaluate the usefulness of I-FISH-TPA. The proportion of abnormal nuclei obtained with the I-FISH-TPA was higher than that found with I-FISH-PBMC (P < 0.001). Consequently, 15 cases with a negative or borderline result with I-FISH-PBMC became positive with I-FISH-TPA for 11q- (n = 2), 13q- (n = 9), and trisomy 12 (n = 4). In all but one of these, chromosomal abnormalities were confirmed by either metaphase FISH or conventional G-banding. Detection of cytogenetic aberrations thus increased from 51% with I-FISH-PBMC to 78% with I-FISH-TPA. Notably, all 15 of the cases that reached the diagnostic thresholds for 11q-, 13q-, and trisomy 12 had a slight lymphocytosis. An absolute lymphocyte count <8.7 x 10(9)/L was found to be the critical threshold (P = 0.037) below which I-FISH-TPA rather than I-FISH-PBMC should be performed. Not only could I-FISH-TPA detect a higher proportion of abnormal interphase nuclei, but it could also identify abnormal CLL cases that might be overlooked with use of I-FISH-PBMC, especially those with low absolute lymphocyte counts. I-FISH-TPA is thus a reliable technique for clinical diagnostics in CLL.","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Sant Pau, Autonomous University of Barcelona, Avda.

Progression from a BCR-ABL negative chronic myeloproliferative disorder (CMPD) to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has been reported in very few cases. We describe the case of a 62-year-old man who developed precursor T-cell (pre-T) ALL 18 months after the diagnosis of an unclassifiable chronic myeloproliferative syndrome (CMPD, U), which had been treated with hydroxyurea (HU) over 12 months. The transformation from CMPD to pre-T-ALL was accompanied by clonal evolution from normal to a high hyperdiploid karyotype with an i(17q): 52,XY,+X,+2,+13,+14,+15,i(17)(q10),+19. Diverse pathways should be considered in this transformation process: although therapeutic induction of ALL is extremely rare and no MLL/11q23 rearrangement was detected by chromosome banding analyses and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), T-lineage ALL might have been caused by HU therapy for the CMPD. Chance coincidence of both disorders seems improbable, given the short interval from the diagnosis of the CMPD to the development of the pre-T-ALL, but nonetheless must be considered. A third explanation might be provided by a spontaneous interlineage switch, which would give further support to the theory that the CMPDs are disorders of a pluripotent stem cell. Interlineage switch might result from an aberrant differentiation of the malignant clone or from selection within a mixed population.","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistr. 52, 20246 Hamburg, Germany. ubacher@uke.uni-hamburg.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next, the Duet system was used to evaluate BCR/ABL D-FISH for FISH minimal residual disease (MRD) detection in CML patients. Up to 6,000 nuclei were evaluated for four signal pattern categories for each of 60 CML MRD samples. Excluding four abnormal specimens with insufficient samples, the Duet system correctly identified all of the abnormal specimens and identified four additional abnormal specimens previously diagnosed as normal by MTS. The technologist time required for evaluation and reclassification of the Duet system data for the FISH MRD samples averaged only 1 minute per case, saving significant technologist effort. We conclude that the Duet system appears to be more sensitive and cost-effective than MTS for CML FISH MRD testing.","['Division of Laboratory Genetics, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work observed the effects of tripterine on this ATRA-caused increasing in adhesion. METHODS: The effects of tripterine on ATRA-induced expressions of adhesive molecules in acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4 and human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) were detected by flow cytometry. The effects of tripterine on adhesion between ATRA-treated NB4 and HUVEC were determined by adhesive assays. RESULTS: ATRA caused remarkable elevation of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in NB4 cells, which could be significantly reduced by tripterine (P<0.01). The expressions of E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and ICAM-1 in HUVEC were elevated by conditioned medium from ATRA-induced NB4 (ATRA-NB4-CM) (P<0.01), and inhibited by tripterine with inhibition rates being 25.3%, 42.4% and 61.0% respectively. ATRA increased the adhesion between NB4 and HUVEC, which was reversed completely by tripterine. CONCLUSION: Tripterine can inhibit ATRA-caused adhesion between leukemia cells and endothelial cells, and it might be a potential agent for treating retinoic acid syndrome.","['Sino-French Clinical Laboratory, Gongli Hospital, Shanghai 200135, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The juxtamembrane mutation of FLT3 is the strongest independent marker for disease relapse and is associated with elevated Bcl-2 protein and p53 hyper-phosphorylation in AML. DNA damage forms the basic mechanism of cancer cell eradication in current therapy of AML. Hdm2 and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members are among the most intensely induced genes immediately after chemotherapy and Hdm2 is proposed a role in receptor tyrosine kinase regulation. Thus we examined the DNA damage related modulation of these proteins in relation to FLT3 mutational status and induction of apoptosis. RESULTS: Within one hour after exposure to ionizing radiation (IR), the AML cells (NB4, MV4-11, HL-60, primary AML cells) showed an increase in Flt3 protein independent of mRNA levels, while the Hdm2 protein decreased. The FLT3 mutant MV4-11 cells were resistant to IR accompanied by presence of both Mcl-1 and Hdm2 protein three hours after IR. In contrast, the FLT3 wild type NB4 cells responded to IR with apoptosis and pre-apoptotic Mcl-1 down regulation. Daunorubicin (DNR) induced continuing down regulation of Hdm2 and Mcl-1 in both cell lines followed by apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Both IR and DNR treatment resulted in concerted protein modulations of Mcl-1, Hdm2 and Flt3. Cell death induction was associated with persistent attenuation of Mcl-1 and Hdm2. These observations suggest that defining the pathway(s) modulating Flt3, Hdm2 and Mcl-1 may propose new strategies to optimize therapy for the relapse prone FLT3 mutated AML patients.","['Institute of Medicine, Hematology Section, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. line.wergeland@med.uib.no']",,,,PMC1876473,,,,,,,,,,,

These studies have identified synaptotagmins (Syts) II, III, and IX as well as neuronal Ca(2+) sensor 1 (NCS-1) as important regulators of mast cell function. Strikingly, we find that these Ca(2+)-binding proteins contribute to mast cell function by regulating specific endocytic pathways. Syt II, the most abundant Syt homologue in mast cells, resides in an amine-free lysosomal compartment. Studying the function of Syt II-knocked down rat basophilic leukemia cells has shown a dual function of this homologue. Syt II is required for the downregulation of protein kinase Calpha, but it negatively regulates lysosomal exocytosis. Syt III, the next most abundant homologue, localizes to early endosomes and is required for the formation of the endocytic recycling compartment (ERC). Syt IX and NCS-1 localize to the ERC and regulate ERC export, NCS-1 by activating phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase beta. Finally, we show that recycling through the ERC is needed for secretory granule protein sorting as well as for the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2. Accordingly, NCS-1 stimulates Fc epsilon RI-triggered exocytosis and release of arachidonic acid metabolites.","['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, Sackler School of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel. histol3@post.tau.ac.il']",,,,,138,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 12.,"We have previously shown that the anticancer agent doxorubicin undergoes oxidation and inactivation when exposed to myeloperoxidase-containing human leukemia HL-60 cells, or to isolated myeloperoxidase, in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and nitrite. In the current study we report that commercial fetal bovine serum (FBS) alone oxidizes doxorubicin in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and that nitrite accelerates this oxidation. The efficacy of inactivation was dependent on the concentration of serum present; no reaction was observed when hydrogen peroxide or serum was omitted. Peroxidase activity assays, based on oxidation of 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine, confirmed the presence of a peroxidase in the sera from several suppliers. The peroxidative activity was contained in the >10000 MW fraction. We also found that hemoglobin, a heme protein likely to be present in commercial FBS, is capable of oxidizing doxorubicin in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and that nitrite further stimulates the reaction. In contrast to intact doxorubicin, the serum + hydrogen peroxide + nitrite treated drug appeared to be nontoxic for PC3 human prostate cancer cells. Together, this study shows that (pseudo)peroxidases present in sera catalyze oxidation of doxorubicin by hydrogen peroxide and that this diminishes the tumoricidal activity of the anthracycline, at least in in vitro settings. Finally, this study also points out that addition of H2O2 to media containing FBS will stimulate peroxidase-type of reactions, which may affect cytotoxic properties of studied compounds.","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Iowa, USA.']","['R01 AI 34954/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066081-060003/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA066081-069001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA081090-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI034954/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA66081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC3617216,,,,,['NIHMS23550'],,,,,,

On the other hand the biological role of MMP-2 in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is not fully clear. Serum samples from 37 adult patients with AML had been taken before chemotherapy was administered. In addition 20 out of the 37 patients were analysed again after achieving complete remission (CR). Ten samples from healthy volunteers were evaluated as the control. Total MMP-2 levels were measured using ELISA Kit obtained from R&D system. MMP-2 serum levels were significantly lower in pretreatment AML patients than that in the normal controls (p = 0.000) and in CR (p = 0.007). No significant correlations were detected between pretreatment sMMP-2 levels and FAB subtypes, peripheral blood blast cell counts, peripheral blood WBCs, bone marrow blast cell counts or blast cell distribution ratio. The prognostic value of MMP-2 was evaluated by dividing AML patients into high and low MMP-2 groups using the pretreatment median MMP-2 level of the AML group as the cut-off. The authors found that patients in the high group survived for a significantly shorter time than those patients in the lower MMP-2 group. High pretreatment levels of sMMP-2 among AML patients were associated with poor survival.

Typical myelocytomatosis was demonstrated not only in livers, spleens, kidneys, and sternums, as in white meat-type chickens, but also in thymuses and the bursa of Fabricius. Especially, severe myeloid cell infiltration was found throughout the whole enlarged thymuses of some birds. ALV-J was isolated at high positive rates from both liver tumour samples and embryos collected from breeder flocks with tumours.

Five patients with refractory metastatic CRC who failed all previous standard chemotherapy were enrolled in this study. They were treated with 0.25 mg/kg body weight/day As2O3 and 1000 mg/day of ascorbic acid for 5 days a week for 5 weeks. Each treatment cycle extended for 7 weeks with 5 weeks of treatment and 2 weeks of rest. All the patients developed moderate to severe toxic side effects to arsenic trioxide/AA therapy and therefore the study was discontinued. No CR (complete remission) or PR (partial remission) was observed. CT scans demonstrated stable or progressive disease. Three of the five patients died within 2 to 5 months after cessation of the therapy. None of the deaths could be related to this clinical trial. Two years of follow-up study showed that two patients were alive with stable disease.

This review focuses on these problems in the young cancer survivors, where methods of protecting or restoring endocrine function and fertility need to be considered. In females, treatment adverse effects can result in infertility, but premature ovarian failure (POF) is probably relevant for more female cancer survivors, affecting also those who do not wish post-treatment parenthood. POF affects present and future health, especially through oestrogen deficiency symptoms and an increased risk of developing osteoporosis. A lower risk of developing POF has been considered in young females than in older due to a larger pool of oocytes. However, a recent long-term follow-up study reported a prevalence of POF in young females with Hodgkin's lymphoma of 37% showing that young age at time of treatment only delays the development of POF. In male gonads, germ cells are much more sensitive to irradiation and chemotherapy than Leydig cells. Thus, infertility is a more common adverse effect than hypogonadism. Some malignancies are particular relevant. Persistent azoospermia was formerly common after treatment for Hodgkin's lymphoma, but currently, most patients recover spermatogenesis. Modern treatment of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia is also unlikely to cause infertility. Norwegian testicular cancer survivors diagnosed in 1980-1994 who attempted conception had an overall 15-year actuarial post-treatment paternity rate of 71% (range 48-92% depending on the treatment). However, the rate was significantly higher among men diagnosed in1989-1994 (over 80%) than in 1980-1988 (about 63%). Patients at risk for hypogonadism and infertility should be defined prior to treatment, and available methods for gonadal preservation should maximally be utilised. During follow-up, oncologists should routinely address these issues.","['Department of Oncology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway. marianne.brydoy@helse-bergen.no']",,,,,74,,,,,,,,,,

The effects of deguelin on cell proliferation were assessed by MTT assay. Apoptosis were detected by Annexin V/PI double-labeled cytometry. The effects of deguelin on the cell cycle were studied by a propidium iodide method. Our study showed that deguelin inhibited the proliferation of K562 cell and K562/ADM cell in a time- and dose-dependent manner and had minimal effects on normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The ratio of IC(50) value of deguelin of 24 h on K562/ADM cells to K562 cells was only 1.27, which was significantly lower than the ratio of IC(50) value of ADM (higher than 20). Deguelin could induce apoptosis of K562 cells and K562/ADM cells. K562 cells were arrested at G(2)/M phase while K562/ADM cells were arrested at G(0)/G(1) phase.

They mainly occur in the small- and middle-sized arteries of lung and brain. Less frequently, leukemic emboli have also been observed in the cardiac chambers. The occlusion of large arteries by a leukemic embolus is a rare event. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old woman was admitted with hyperleukocytosis and acute pain in her right leg. An occlusion of the right femoral arteries as the presenting symptom of a de novo AML (FAB M1/WHO: AML without maturation) with hyperleukocytosis was diagnosed. CONCLUSION: Leukemic emboli of large vessels are uncommon in leukemia with hyperleukocytosis. Most frequently, small- and middle-sized vessels of the brain and lung are affected. Leukemic emboli mainly occur in AML and CML in blast crisis and are rare in acute (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Risk factors are hyperleukocytosis and the expression of adhesion surface molecules which modulate blast-blast and endothelium interaction. Therapeutic options, apart from the immediate start of chemotherapy, are leukapheresis and embolectomy.","['Abteilung Hamatologie und Onkologie, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik, Zentrum Innere Medizin, Universitat Gottingen, Germany.']",,,,,,,Femoralarterienverschluss bei De-novo-AML.,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 12.,"PURPOSE: There is evidence that cholesterol affects the ATPase and transport functions of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). To study the influence of cholesterol on P-gp in a well defined lipid environment, we reconstituted P-gp in egg phosphatidylcholine (PhC) and PhC/cholesterol proteoliposomes with negligible residual amounts of detergents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: P-gp proteoliposomes were prepared by continuous dialysis from micelles consisting of P-gp, lipids, sodium dodecyl sulfate and cholate. Basal and modulator-induced ATPase activities were studied in an established enzyme assay. Modulator affinities to P-gp and to the lipid bilayers were determined by equilibrium dialysis. RESULTS: In the absence of cholesterol the basal ATPase activity was six fold lower than in the presence of 20 or 40% cholesterol, and no P-gp binding and ATPase induction was detected for the tested modulators verapamil and progesterone. In proteoliposomes containing 20 and 40% cholesterol, respectively, the modulators showed significant P-gp binding and ATPase activation. The concentration of the modulators for half maximal activation of the ATPase was higher with 40% than with 20% cholesterol. CONCLUSIONS: Cholesterol influences P-gp in three ways: (a) it enhances its basal ATPase activity, (b) it renders P-gp sensitive towards the modulators verapamil and progesterone and (c) it affects the modulator concentration at half maximal ATPase activation.","['Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, ETH Zurich, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 10, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complexes were prepared by adding an aqueous solution of lanthanum(III) salt to an aqueous solution of the ligand subsequently raising the pH of the mixture gradually to circa 5.0 by adding dilute solution of sodium hydroxide. The lanthanum(III) complexes with bis-coumarins were characterized by different physicochemical methods-elemental analysis, IR-, (1)H-, and (13)C-NMR-spectroscopies, and mass spectral data. The spectral data of lanthanum(III) complexes were interpreted on the basis of comparison with the spectra of the free ligands. This analysis showed that in the La(III) complexes, the ligands coordinated to the metal ion through both deprotonated hydroxyl groups. On the basis of the nu(C=O) red shift observed, participation of the carbonyl groups in the coordination with the metal ion was also suggested. In the present study, we performed a cytotoxic-effects screening of the lanthanum complexes with H(2)L1 and H(2)L2 in a panel of human tumor cell lines, using the standard MTT-dye reduction assay for cell viability.

Following a 24- hour treatment of BV-173 cells with lanthanum complex of H(2)L1 at 100 or 200 microM led to a DNA-laddering. The findings suggest that the observed cytotoxicity of the lanthanum complex of H(2)L1 on BV-173 is at least partly mediated through induction of programmed cell death.","['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Medical University, 2 Dunav Street, Sofia 1000, Bulgaria.']",,,,PMC1686302,,,,,,,,,,,

A fraction of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cases carry the translocation t(9;22) (q34;q11.2) which juxtaposes the ABL proto-oncogene to the BCR gene generating a chimeric gene, BCR/ABL. This aberration is more frequent in adult ALL (20%-40%) than in pediatric ALL (<5%), and predicts poor clinical outcome. AIM OF OUR WORK: Is to study BCR/ABL fusion gene in ALL cases using fluorescent in situ hybridization. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty newly diagnosed ALL patients, 16 adult and 4 paediatric cases, were included in the study, 11 cases (55%) were of precursor B phenotype, 8 cases (40%) belonged to T lineage, while one case was biphenotypic expressing mainly precursor B cell markers tether with CD13, CD33, CD117, Detection of BCR/ABL fusion gene was done using interphase FISH technique and was confirmed molecularly using the RT-PCR technique. RESULTS: BCR/ABL fusion gene was negative in all the examined cases, yet abnormality involving 9q34, ABL gene, either by addition or deletion was detected in three cases (15%). Two of these cases were associated with BCR gene extra copies (three and four copies, respectively). CONCLUSION: This may reflect the frequency of association of ABL gene and BCR gene abnormality in our cases, and that absence of fusion gene BCR/ABL does not exclude their role in the leukomogenic process, yet a larger study is required to confirm and detect the prevalence of these gene disturbances in ALL and their association.","['Department of Haematology, King Saud University, KSA. aelsissy@yahoo.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 14.,"B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cell is characterized by the accumulation of long-lived CD5+ B lymphocytes, whose survival in vivo is in part dependent on exogenous factors such as cytokines and/or extracellular matrix proteins. Homeostatic chemokines are critical mediators of lymphoid cell trafficking. However, how they function in cell signaling and survival remains ill-defined. In this study, we have investigated the role of the homeostatic chemokines, CXCL12, CCL21, CCL19 and CXCL13, in B-CLL cell survival. Using primary leukemic cells isolated from 26 patients, we observed that each chemokine enhances cell survival. Chemokines induced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p90RSK, and of Akt and its effectors GSK3 and FOXO3a. Consistently, inhibitors against mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibited chemokine-induced survival. Moreover, using a constitutively active mutated form of FOXO3a or siRNAs against FOXO3a in transfection experiments performed in primary B-CLL cells, we directly demonstrated the critical role of FOXO3a in both spontaneous and chemokine-induced B-CLL cell survival. Overall, our data support the notion that homeostatic chemokines contribute to B-CLL resistance to cell death through inactivation of the transcription factor FOXO3a, which may represent a novel therapeutic target in this hematopoietic malignancy.","[""Departement d'Immunologie, Hopital de l'Archet, Universite de Nice-Sophia Antipolis, Nice, France. michel.ticchioni@unice.fr""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As well as depleting donor T cells, alemtuzumab may also work by targeting host dendritic cells (DC). To determine whether this second mechanism of action is significant, we investigated the effects of intravenous alemtuzumab by comparing skin and blood DC numbers of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, before and after a 4-week course of alemtuzumab treatment. Although skin DC express CD52, the epitope is only weakly detectable and their numbers were not consistently reduced by alemtuzumab. In contrast, circulating blood DC, with stronger CD52 expression, were invariably diminished by alemtuzumab. Because DC depletion in the transplant recipient remains a promising approach for GvHD prophylaxis and therapy, more potent techniques, such as an antibody of different specificity, may be required for effective DC eradication in GvHD target organs.","['Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik I Universitatsklinikum Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cancer patients who have great risk of gram-negative bacteria leading to fatal infection, P. aeruginosa bacteremia easily results in septicemia with shock and life-threatening complications such as vital organ failure. Among those complications, necrotizing pneumonia is an infectious disease of lung caused by P. aeruginosa characterized by rapid cavitation and progressive clinical course, which is fatal not only in cancer patients but also in healthy hosts. P.aeruginosa is one of the pathogens targeted for empirical therapy neutropenic patients. Three case series of necrotizing pneumonia were reviewed in this report. All three had hematological malignancies and were immunocompromised. One of the three cases,a 30-year-old man with malignant lymphoma, recovered from pneumothorax and pyothorax complicated with lung cavitation. The other two patients died with a short course; a 55-year-old man with chronic myelogeneous leukemia within 7 hours, and a 54-year-old man with malignant lymphoma within 2 days after the onset of pneumonia, respectively.

For chronic myeloid leukemia, imatinib has become the treatment of choice in initial treatment, and its long-term effectiveness and safety have been confirmed. For acute myelogenous leukemia, cytarabine with anthracycline agent is believed to be the standard treatment in first remission induction therapy. To improve the efficacy of the first remission induction chemotherapy, the addition of gemutuzumab ozogamicin has been investigated intensively all over the world. However, there are many obstacles to conducting its clinical trial in Japan. The addition of rituximab to CHOP improves the survival of patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. For follicular lymphoma patients, rituximab with conventional chemotherapies are considered the standard treatments, but the question of which conventional chemotherapy is better is unsolved. MP therapy had long been the standard treatment for elderly patients with multiple myeloma, but MP therapy plus thalidomide with MP therapy has been found to be superior. In patients who are candidates for autologous stem-cell transplantation, VAD therapy or high-dose dexamethasone therapy followed by autologous stem-cell transplantation is considered the treatment of choice. But the number of transplantations and the timing of second transplantation need more investigation. Considering the overall situation with regard to the standard treatments of hematological malignancies in Japan, there is little difference in practice from western countries. However, the framework of conducting clinical trials to investigate standard treatment in Japan is unsatisfactory.","['Division of Hematopathology, Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study has been conducted as a nested case-control study within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort (409 cancer cases and 757 matched controls). We included never and ex-smokers. SNPs were in genes involved in oxidative stress, phase I metabolizing genes, phase II metabolizing genes and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). RESULTS: The most notable findings are: GSTM1 deletion and bladder cancer risk [odds ratio (OR) = 1.60; 95% confidence interval 1.00-2.56]; CYP1A1 and leukemia (2.22, 1.33-3.70; heterozygotes); CYP1B1 and leukemia (0.47, 0.27-0.84; homozygotes); MnSOD and leukemia (1.91, 1.08-3.38; homozygotes) and NQO1 and lung cancer (8.03, 1.73-37.3; homozygotes). Other statistically significant associations were found in subgroups defined by smoking habits (never or ex-smokers), environmental tobacco smoke or gender, with no obvious pattern. When gene variants were organized according to the three main pathways, the emerging picture was of a strong involvement of combined phase I enzymes in leukemia, with an OR of 5 (1.63-15.4) for those having three or more variant alleles. The association was considerably stronger for leukemias arising before the age of 55.","['Imperial College London, London, UK. p.vineis@imperial.ac.uk']",['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dasatinib, a novel, oral, multitargeted kinase inhibitor of BCR-ABL and SRC family kinases, has previously induced responses in patients with imatinib-resistant or -intolerant Ph-positive ALL. We present the interim results of a phase 2 study designed to further assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of dasatinib 140 mg in this patient population (n = 36). With a minimum follow-up of 8 months, treatment with dasatinib resulted in substantial hematologic and cytogenetic response rates. Major hematologic responses were achieved in 42% (15/36) of patients, 67% of whom remained progression-free. Complete cytogenetic responses were attained by 58% (21/36) of patients. The presence of BCR-ABL mutations conferring imatinib resistance did not preclude a response to dasatinib. Dasatinib was also tolerable, with 6% (2/36) of patients discontinuing therapy as a result of study-drug toxicity. Most adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2; febrile neutropenia was the most frequent severe AE, but this and other cytopenias were manageable with dose reduction. Dasatinib represents a safe and effective treatment option and an important therapeutic advance for patients with Ph-positive ALL.

Epub 2007 May 10.,"CD19 is a B-lineage-specific transmembrane signaling protein participating in the control of proliferation and differentiation. It is present at high surface density on chronic B-lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells and cells of other B-cell malignancies, and is a prime target for therapy with antibody-derived agents. Many attempts have been made to target malignant cells via CD19, but to date none of these agents have received drug approval. Here we report the design of a monovalent immunotoxin consisting of a CD19-specific single-chain Fv antibody fragment fused to a derivative of Pseudomonas Exotoxin A. This fusion protein induced efficient antigen-restricted apoptosis of several human leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cell lines including Nalm-6, which it eliminated at an effective concentration (EC(50)) of 2.5 nM. The agent displayed synergistic toxicity when used in combination with valproic acid and cyclosporin A in cell-culture assays. It induced apoptosis of primary malignant cells in 12/12 samples from B-CLL patients, including patients responding poorly to fludarabine, and of cells from one pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia patient. In NOD/SCID mice transplanted with Nalm-6 cells, the toxin prevented engraftment and significantly prolonged survival of treated mice. Owing to its efficient antigen-restricted antileukemic activity, the agent deserves further development towards clinical testing.","['Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erwin-Rommel-Strasse 3, Erlangen, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we report the results of a comprehensive cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), molecular and histopathological survey of a large series of B-cell malignancies with t(14;19) or variant translocations. A total of 56 B-cell malignancies with a FISH-proven BCL3 involvement were identified with the translocation partners being IGH (n=51), IGL (n=2), IGK (n=2) and a non-IG locus (n=1). Hierarchical clustering of chromosomal changes associated with the t(14;19) indicated the presence of two different groups of IG/BCL3-positive lymphatic neoplasias. The first group included 26 B-cell malignancies of various histologic subtypes containing a relatively high number of chromosomal changes and mostly mutated IgVH genes. This cluster displayed three cytogenetic branches, one with rearrangements in 7q, another with deletions in 17p and a third one with rearrangements in 1q and deletions in 6q and 13q. The second group included 19 cases, mostly diagnosed as B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), and characterized by few additional chromosomal changes (e.g. trisomy 12) and unmutated IgVH genes. In conclusion, our study indicates that BCL3 translocations are not restricted to B-CLL but present in a heterogeneous group of B-cell malignancies.","['Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein Campus Kiel, Christian-Albrechts University, Kiel, Germany.']",['MC_U132670597/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regions of acquired homozygosity were detected in 43/52 (83%) primary specimens with a mean of 1.7 and 3.0 aberrations in the FL and t-FL, respectively. A notable feature was the occurrence of recurring sites of acquired uniparental disomy (aUDP) on 6p, 9p, 12q and 17p in cell lines and primary samples. Homozygosity of 9p and 17p arose predominantly in t-FL and in three cases rendered the cell homozygous for a pre-existing mutation of either CDKN2A or TP53. These data suggest that mutation precedes mitotic recombination, which leads to the removal of the remaining wild-type allele. In all, 18 cases exhibited abnormalities in both FL and t-FL samples. In 10 cases blocks of homozygosity were detected in FL that were absent in the subsequent t-FL sample. These differences support the notion that FL and t-FL may arise in a proportion of patients by divergence from a common malignant ancestor cell rather than by clonal evolution from an antecedent FL.","['Cancer Research UK, Centre for Medical Oncology, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK. jude.fitzgibbon@cancer.org.uk']","['A6438/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom', 'A6789/Cancer Research UK/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib mesylate is a potent inhibitor of ABL but also of PDGFR-alpha, and has been associated with durable hematologic responses in patients with HES. However, development of mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain may hamper the activity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which suggests that novel agents are warranted to prevent or overcome resistance. We evaluated the efficacy of the novel TKI EXEL-0862 in FIP1L1-PDGFR-alpha-expressing cell lines and in cells from a patient with HES harboring the FIP1L1-PDGFR-alpha gene. EXEL-0862 inhibited the proliferation of EOL-1 and imatinib-resistant T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR-alpha-expressing cells and resulted in potent inhibition of the phosphorylation of PDGFR-alpha and downstream proteins STAT3 and Erk1/2, both in vitro and ex vivo. Moreover, EXEL-0862 induced apoptotic death in EOL-1 cells and imatinib-resistant T674I FIP1L1-PDGFR-alpha-expressing cells, and resulted in significant downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Mcl-1 through a caspase-dependent mechanism.

In this study, we compared a quantitative PCR method--quantitative multiplex PCR of short fluorescent fragment (QMPSF)--with FISH for the detection of these acquired aneuploidies in a series of 110 patients with Binet stage A CLL. Genes located in the deleted or gained regions were selected as target genes and amplified using a method based on the simultaneous amplification of short fluorescent genomic fragments under quantitative conditions. A chromosomal imbalance involving one or several of the four loci was detected by either method in 72 patients (65%). A chromosome 13 deletion was present in 61 patients (54%), a 11q22 deletion in nine (8%), a trisomy 12 in nine and a 17p deletion in one. FISH and QMPSF results were identical for 103 out of 110 patients and discrepancies could be explained in most cases. This study demonstrates that a quantitative multiplex PCR represents a cost-effective method that could replace FISH in CLL patients. However, although QMPSF is perfectly adapted to the detection of primary defects, care should be taken when searching for clonal evolutions present in a small proportion of tumor cells.","[""Groupe d'Etude des Proliferations Lymphoides, Centre Henri Becquerel, Rouen, France. christian.bastard@rouen.fnclcc.fr""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its anti-tumor activity is mediated by proteasome inhibition leading to decreased cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. However, an unimpaired proteasomal function plays a crucial role for the induction of anti-tumor immunity by dendritic cells (DCs), which are currently used for therapeutic vaccination against various tumors including myeloma. In the present study, we investigated the impact of bortezomib on the immunostimulatory capacity of 6-sulfo LacNAc (slan) DCs, which represent a major subset of human blood DCs. We demonstrated that this proteasome inhibitor efficiently impairs the spontaneous in vitro maturation of slanDCs and the release of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha as well as interleukin (IL)-12 upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation. Functional data revealed that bortezomib profoundly inhibits slanDC-induced proliferation and differentiation of CD4(+) T cells. In addition, the capacity of slanDCs to promote interferon-gamma secretion and tumor-directed cytotoxicity of natural killer (NK) cells is markedly impaired by bortezomib. These results provide evidence that bortezomib significantly reduces the ability of native human blood DCs to regulate innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity and may have implications for the design of therapeutic strategies combining DC vaccination and bortezomib treatment.","['Medical Faculty, Institute of Immunology, Technical University of Dresden, Dresden, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 10.,"Arsenic trioxide (ATO) and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib have been successfully applied to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and multiple myeloma (MM), respectively. Their synergistic effects with other anticancer drugs have been widely studied. Here, we investigated the potential synergy of bortezomib and ATO on Bcr-Abl(+) leukemic K562 cells. The results showed that cotreatment of bortezomib at 32 nM, a half concentration for growth arrest, and ATO at 1 microM, a dose with no significant cytotoxic effect, synergistically induced apoptosis in the cell line, followed by enhanced mitochondrial dysfunction, release of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor, caspase-3 cleavage and degradation of poly-adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase together with the decreased Bcr-Abl protein. These two drugs synergistically induced proteolytic activation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) with enhanced activation of two mitogen-activated protein kinases phospho-c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase and p38. The specific PKCdelta inhibitor rottlerin markedly decreased bortezomib plus ATO-induced apoptosis, suggesting that PKCdelta plays an important role in bortezomib plus ATO-induced apoptosis. Moreover, apoptosis synergy of bortezomib and ATO could also be seen in some kinds of acute leukemic cell lines and primary cells. Totally, our results indicate that combined regimen of bortezomib and ATO might be a potential therapeutic remedy for the treatment of leukemia.","['Department of Pathophysiology, Key Laboratory of Cell Differentiation and Apoptosis of Chinese Ministry of Education, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 10.,"The repertoire of B cells secreting antibodies with unique antigen-binding specificities is produced at two stages: a primary B-cell repertoire is formed in the bone marrow through immunoglobulin gene rearrangements, whereas a secondary B-cell repertoire is generated in the peripheral lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) through somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination upon antigen encounter. The latter events take place within highly specialized histological structures, designated B follicles, which are composed of distinct microanatomical compartments namely the follicle centre, lymphocytic corona and marginal zone. Each compartment comprises a particular subset of B cells, characterized by unique properties, thereby reflecting the complexity and variability in the spectrum of defence mechanisms against invading pathogens. The past years have spawned an avalanche of new data and information that encompasses both the structure and function of each compartment and its B cells. This review incorporates up-to-date information on peripheral B-cell differentiation into a challenging working model, thereby pointing to the structural and functional imprint of both the T-cell-dependent and T-cell-independent immune response on the B follicle. As such, this article aims to form an excellent base for a better understanding of the normal counterpart of B-cell-derived haematological malignancies (leukemias and lymphomas).","['Department of Morphology and Molecular Pathology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. xavier.sagaert@uz.kuleuven.ac.be']",,,,,68,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) cell lines revealed pronounced resistance to death ligands as compared to cell lines of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). The proapoptotic activity of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha was blocked, sensitivity to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand was significantly reduced, and 1/4 CTCL cell lines was resistant to CD95 activation. In parallel, there was no activation of effector caspase-3 and initiator caspase-8 in nonresponsive CTCL cells, whereas caspase-10 was cleaved selectively in sensitive CTCL cells. No indication for a responsibility of typical downstream regulators of apoptosis was obtained, but loss of CD95 was found in 1/4, loss of TNF-R1 in 3/4, loss of caspase-10 in 2/4, loss of Bid in 1/4, and overexpression of cellular flice inhibitory protein was found in 4/4 CTCL cell lines. This clearly indicates an inhibition of apoptosis early in the extrinsic cascade, namely at the formation of the death-inducing signaling complex. Parallels with regard to expression of apoptosis regulators were seen in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and biopsies of CTCL patients. This study may indicate defects in apoptosis in CTCL and may help to guide CTCL therapy.","['Department of Dermatology and Allergy, Skin Cancer Center, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously demonstrated that vaccine with MBD2 elicited potent antileukemia responses in the L1210 murine model. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is an essential cytokine for the generation of Th1 response and natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) activation. As MBD2 and IL-18 appear to function on different components required by an effective antitumor immune response including both innate and adaptive immunity, we investigated whether combinatorial delivery of MBD2 and IL-18 transduced L1210 cells could elicit synergistic antileukemia effects. First, we constructed a single plasmid vector carrying both pro-IL-18 and IL-1beta converting enzyme (ICE) genes, and found that transfection of this vector into L1210 cells resulted in efficient secretion of bioactive IL-18. Combinatorial delivery of MBD2 and pro-IL-18-ICE modified L1210 cells conferred a superior inhibition of leukemogenicity over either L1210-MBD2 or L1210-pro-IL-18-ICE alone; moreover, the survived mice developed long-lasting protective immunity as determined by rechallenge experiments. This combined vaccine also elicited the most marked therapeutic effect, CTL activity and interferon-gamma production. These results suggest that the combination of MBD2 and IL-18 induces more effective antileukemia activity and provides a promising strategy for cancer therapy.","['State Key Laboratory for Experimental Hematology, Institute of Hematology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Tianjin, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-two patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor or chronic myeloid leukemia initially received imatinib 600 mg daily with dosage subsequently toxicity adjusted. Pharmacokinetic parameters on day 1 and at steady-state were compared with elimination phenotype and single-nucleotide polymorphisms of CYP3A5 and ABCB1. A fivefold variation in estimated imatinib clearance (CL/F) was present on day 1 and mean CL/F had fallen by 26% at steady state. This reduction in imatinib CL/F was associated with ABCB1 genotype, being least apparent in thymidine homozygotes at the 1236T>C, 2677G>T/A and 3435C>T loci. Toxicity-related dose reduction also tended to be less common in these individuals.

METHODS: The cohort consisted of 10,621 employees with an average follow-up of 34 years. We used the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) adjusted for age, race, and calendar years as a measure of risk. RESULTS: Overall mortality (SMR=0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.74-0.79), all cancer mortality (SMR=0.87, 95% CI=0.82-0.93), and most cause-specific mortalities for the total study population were lower than or similar to that of the population of Harris County, Texas. This study did not show a significant increase in leukemia in the total population or in any of the subgroups. The only statistically significant excess of mortality found in this study was an increase in mesothelioma among maintenance employees; the SMR was 4.78 (95% CI=2.54-8.17) among employees who worked for a minimum of one year and was 7.51 (95% CI=3.75-13.45) among those with 10 or more years of employment and 20 or more years of latency. CONCLUSIONS: After more than half a century of follow-up, employees at this facility continue to show more favorable mortality outcomes than the general local population. Overall, no statistically significant increase of leukemia or of any of the specific cell types was found. The increased mesothelioma is likely related to past exposure to asbestos.","['Shell Health Services, Shell Oil Company, Houston, TX 77252-2463, USA. shan.tsai@shell.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A large number of epidemiological studies have consistently shown an association between the risk of childhood leukemia and residential extremely low-frequency magnetic field exposures. There is virtually no supportive data from experimental research and, so far, no proposed explanation has reached a level beyond speculation. The contradictory results from epidemiological and experimental research may either be due to methodological limitations creating a spurious association in the epidemiological studies or to a failure of experimental research to examine mechanisms relevant in the complex origin of childhood leukemia. Taking this together, the overall evidence is not strong enough to demand a revision of the current guidelines for public protection. Application of precautionary measures may be an option; however, decision-makers should be advised that these measures are often not straightforward and a careful evaluation of a possible benefit needs to be performed for each individual situation. Undoubtedly there are gaps in research, and no substantial contribution for clarification of the apparent inconsistencies emerges from recent studies. However, there are important lessons to learn, either with respect to the etiology of childhood leukemia or with respect to the need for improving epidemiological methods for the identification of presumably weak associations.","['Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology, The Danish Cancer Society, Strandboulevarden 49, Copenhagen, Denmark. joachim@cancer.dk']",,,,,24,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 19.,"Autophagy is an ancient cell survival pathway that allows cells to recoup ATP and essential building blocks for biosynthesis when they are starved of nutrients or when they are exposed to hypoxia, which are hallmarks of the tumor microenvironment. This pathway involves the formation of double-membraned vesicles, coined autophagosomes, which envelop bulk cellular material and/or organelles and that subsequently fuse with lysosomes that degrade their cargo. Autophagy has been suggested to play important roles in chemoresistance of cancer to some therapeutic agents, which typically induce an apoptotic response. For example, the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA induces both apoptosis and autophagy, suggesting that agents that disrupt the autophagy pathway might augment its efficacy as a therapeutic agent. We tested this notion in a model of Imatinib-refractory chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and in imatinib-resistant primary CML cells from patients bearing mutations in Bcr-Abl, including the T315I mutation that causes resistance to currently utilized tyrosine kinase inhibitors and translates into a very poor clinical prognosis. Agents that disrupt autophagy were shown to synergize with SAHA in provoking apoptotic death of these refractory tumors. These findings support the use of agents that disrupt the autophagy pathway in settings of chemorefractory malignancies.","[""Department of Biochemistry, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['CA76379/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), a key component of the Wnt signaling pathway, is involved in multiple physiologic processes such as protein synthesis, tumorigenesis, and apoptosis. Here, we report that expression of Mcl-1 was correlated with phosphorylated GSK-3beta (p-GSK-3beta) at Ser(9) (an inactivated form of GSK-3beta) in multiple cancer cell lines and primary human cancer samples. In addition, Mcl-1 was strikingly linked with poor prognosis of human breast cancer, in which the high level of Mcl-1 was related to high tumor grade and poor survival of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, we found that activation of GSK-3beta could down-regulate Mcl-1 and was required for proteasome-mediated Mcl-1 degradation. Under some physiologic conditions, such as UV irradiation, anticancer drug treatment, and inhibition of growth factor pathways, Mcl-1 was down-regulated through activation of GSK-3beta. Our results indicate that Mcl-1 stabilization by GSK-3beta inactivation could be involved in tumorigenesis and serve as a useful prognostic marker for human breast cancer.","['Department of Molecular and Cellular Oncology, The University of Texas M.

Although cardiac hypertrophy drastically alternates the expression of various growth factors such as endothelin-1, angiotensin II, and leukemia inhibitory factor, little is known about nerve growth factor expression and its effect on the cardiac sympathetic nerves. This study investigated the impact of pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy on the innervation density and cellular function of cardiac sympathetic nerves, including kinetics of norepinephrine synthesis and reuptake, and neuronal gene expression. Right ventricular hypertrophy was induced by monocrotaline treatment in Wistar rats. Newly developed cardiac sympathetic nerves expressing beta(3)-tubulin (axonal marker), GAP43 (growth-associated cone marker), and tyrosine hydroxylase were markedly increased only in the right ventricle, in parallel with nerve growth factor upregulation. However, norepinephrine and dopamine content was paradoxically attenuated, and the protein and kinase activity of tyrosine hydroxylase were markedly downregulated in the right ventricle. The reuptake of [(125)I]-metaiodobenzylguanidine and [(3)H]-norepinephrine were also significantly diminished in the right ventricle, indicating functional downregulation in cardiac sympathetic nerves. Interestingly, we found cardiac sympathetic nerves in hypertrophic right ventricles strongly expressed highly polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM) (an immature neuron marker) as well as neonatal heart. Taken together, pressure overload induced anatomical sympathetic hyperinnervation but simultaneously caused deterioration of neuronal cellular function. This phenomenon was explained by the rejuvenation of cardiac sympathetic nerves as well as the hypertrophic cardiomyocytes, which also showed the fetal form gene expression.","['Department of Regenerative Medicine and Advanced Cardiac Therapeutics, Keio University School of Medicine, Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,['Circ Res. 2007 Jun 22;100(12):1670-2.

We identified a 116-member genomic classifier that could accurately distinguish all 6 induction failure (IF) cases from 44 patients who achieved remission; network analyses suggest a prominent role for genes mediating cellular quiescence. Seven genes were similarly upregulated in both the genomic classifier for IF patients and T-ALL cell lines having acquired resistance to neoplastic agents, identifying potential target genes for further study in drug resistance.

Epub 2007 May 10.,"Cyclosporin A (CSA) is commonly used to prevent graft-versus-host disease. The influence of CSA on T-cell function has been extensively investigated; however, the effect of CSA on natural killer (NK) cells is less understood. NK cells were cultured with IL-2 and IL-15 with and without CSA for 1 week. Compared with controls, CSA-treated cultures showed fewer CD56(+)CD16(+)KIR(+) NK cells and a reciprocal increase in CD56(+)CD16(-)KIR(-) cells. These changes were due mainly to a reduced proliferation of the CD56(dim) NK-cell subpopulation and a relative resistance of CD56(bright) NK cells to CSA. Following coculture with K562 targets, CSA-exposed NK cells differed from controls and lacked Ca(2+) oscillations, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) dephosphorylation, and NFAT nuclear translocation. NK cells cultured in CSA retained cytotoxicity against K562, Raji, and KIR ligand-expressing lymphoblastoid cells. NK cells cultured in CSA showed increases in NKp30 and reductions in NKp44 and NKG2D. Following IL-12 and IL-18 stimulation, CSA-treated NK cells showed more IFN-gamma-producing cells. Using in vitro NK-cell differentiation, progenitor cells gave rise to more CD56(+)KIR(-) NK cells in the presence of CSA than controls. Collectively, these studies show that CSA influences NK-cell function and phenotype, which may have important implications for graft-versus-leukemia effects.","['Department of Pediatrics, Cancer Center, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA.']","['P01 CA65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA065493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL055417/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL004505/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI034495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA72669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI34495/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA072669/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K08 HL04505-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL55417/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1975839,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 10.,"Aurora kinases play an important role in chromosome alignment, segregation, and cytokinesis during mitosis. We have recently shown that hematopoietic malignant cells including those from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) aberrantly expressed Aurora A and B kinases, and ZM447439, a potent inhibitor of Aurora kinases, effectively induced growth arrest and apoptosis of a variety of leukemia cells. The present study explored the effect of AZD1152, a highly selective inhibitor of Aurora B kinase, on various types of human leukemia cells. AZD1152 inhibited the proliferation of AML lines (HL-60, NB4, MOLM13), ALL line (PALL-2), biphenotypic leukemia (MV4-11), acute eosinophilic leukemia (EOL-1), and the blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia K562 cells with an IC50 ranging from 3 nM to 40 nM, as measured by thymidine uptake on day 2 of culture. These cells had 4N/8N DNA content followed by apoptosis, as measured by cell-cycle analysis and annexin V staining, respectively. Of note, AZD1152 synergistically enhanced the antiproliferative activity of vincristine, a tubulin depolymerizing agent, and daunorubicin, a topoisomerase II inhibitor, against the MOLM13 and PALL-2 cells in vitro. Furthermore, AZD1152 potentiated the action of vincristine and daunorubicin in a MOLM13 murine xenograft model. Taken together, AZD1152 is a promising new agent for treatment of individuals with leukemia. The combined administration of AZD1152 and conventional chemotherapeutic agent to patients with leukemia warrants further investigation.","['Department of Hematology and Respiratory Medicine, Kochi University, Nankoku, Kochi, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 10.,"BACKGROUND: Plant-derived cardenolides reportedly possess anticancer properties in human leukemic cells via selective induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and differentiation. Selective induction of apoptosis with mammalian-derived digoxin-like immunoreactive factor (DLIF) could provide new strategies for anticancer drug development or the identification of biomarkers for cancer. We investigated whether DLIFs selectively induce apoptosis in human lymphoblastic leukemic cells. METHODS: We compared the relative potencies of digoxin, ouabain, and DLIF on induction of programmed cell death in Jurkat cells (an acute T-leukemic cell line), K-562 (a myelogenous leukemia cell line), and nonpathologic human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometry with the annexin V/propidium iodide method. RESULTS: Digoxin and ouabain induced apoptosis in Jurkat cells [digoxin 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)), 24 nmol/L; ouabain IC(50), 26 nmol/L]. Neither digoxin nor ouabain induced apoptosis in K-562 cells or PBMCs. DLIF was more potent (IC(50), 1.9 nmol/L) and >2-fold more effective than digoxin or ouabain at inducing maximum apoptosis in Jurkat cells. The IC(50) values in the apoptosis assays were >100-fold lower (DLIF) and 20-fold lower (digoxin and ouabain) than the IC(50) required for Na(+)- and K(+)-dependent ATPase (DLIF, 200 nmol/L; digoxin, 910 nmol/L; ouabain, 600 nmol/L). CONCLUSION: DLIF selectively induces apoptosis in a human acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia cell line but not in K-562 cells or PBMCs. These data suggest a new physiological role for these endogenous hormone-like factors.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Louisville School of Medicine, Louisville, KY 40202, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 9.,"Overexpression of wild-type MN1 is a negative prognostic factor in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with normal cytogenetics. We evaluated whether MN1 plays a functional role in leukemogenesis. We demonstrate using retroviral gene transfer and bone marrow (BM) transplantation that MN1 overexpression rapidly induces lethal AML in mice. Insertional mutagenesis and chromosomal instability were ruled out as secondary aberrations. MN1 increased resistance to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-induced cell-cycle arrest and differentiation by more than 3000-fold in vitro. The differentiation block could be released by fusion of a transcriptional activator (VP16) to MN1 without affecting the ability to immortalize BM cells, suggesting that MN1 blocks differentiation by transcriptional repression. We then evaluated whether MN1 expression levels in patients with AML (excluding M3-AML) correlated with resistance to ATRA treatment in elderly patients uniformly treated within treatment protocol AMLHD98-B. Strikingly, patients with low MN1 expression who received ATRA had a significantly prolonged event-free (P = .008) and overall (P = .04) survival compared with patients with either low MN1 expression and no ATRA, or high MN1 expression with or without ATRA. MN1 is a unique oncogene in hematopoiesis that both promotes proliferation/self-renewal and blocks differentiation, and may become useful as a predictive marker in AML treatment.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, Vancouver, BC, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 9.,"Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is an inborn disorder of granulopoiesis. Like most other bone marrow failure syndromes, it is associated with a marked propensity to transform into a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia, with a cumulative rate of transformation to MDS/leukemia that exceeds 20%. The genetic (and/or epigenetic) changes that contribute to malignant transformation in SCN are largely unknown. In this study, we performed mutational profiling of 14 genes previously implicated in leukemogenesis using 14 MDS/leukemia samples from patients with SCN. We used high-throughput exon-based resequencing of whole-genome-amplified genomic DNA with a semiautomated method to detect mutations. The sensitivity and specificity of the sequencing pipeline was validated by determining the frequency of mutations in these 14 genes using 188 de novo AML samples. As expected, mutations of tyrosine kinase genes (FLT3, KIT, and JAK2) were common in de novo AML, with a cumulative frequency of 30%. In contrast, no mutations in these genes were detected in the SCN samples; instead, mutations of CSF3R, encoding the G-CSF receptor, were common. These data support the hypothesis that mutations of CSF3R may provide the ""activated tyrosine kinase signal"" that is thought to be important for leukemogenesis.","['Division of Oncology, Department of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, MO 63110, USA. dlink@im.wustl.edu']","['CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA031946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA101140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA101937/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1975847,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the incidence and risk factors for this complication based on a single-center experience. METHODS: 255 consecutive patients, aged 29 (10-56) years, who survived without disease progression after alloHCT performed between 1992-2003 were included in the analysis. The preparative regimen was myeloablative, donors were either related (n=177) or unrelated volunteers (URD-HCT) (n=78). RESULTS: Cumulative incidence of the overall and extensive cGVHD equaled 48% and 22%, respectively. In a multivariate analysis the following factors were associated with increased risk of cGVHD: preceding grade II-IV acute GVHD, recipient age > or =40 years, URD-HCT, the diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or myelodysplastic syndrome, and CD3 cell dose 50 x 10(6)/kg. Similar factors, excluding recipient age contributed to increased risk of extensive cGVHD, however, the cut-point for CD3 cell dose was 100 x l0(6)/kg and the use of steroids for acute GVHD prophylaxis was found an additional risk factor. In a CML subgroup the risk of cGVHD was increased for patients previously treated with interferon. CONCLUSIONS: Various recipient-, donor-, and procedure-related factors are related to the risk of cGVHD. Individualized treatment and modification of risk factors may contribute to improved outcome.","['Dept. of Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Silesian Medical University, Katowice, Poland. klinhem@slam.katowice.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recently completed Chernobyl Forum concluded that after a number of years, along with reduction of radiation levels and accumulation of humanitarian consequences, severe social and economic depression of the affected regions and associated psychological problems of the general public and the workers had become the most significant problem to be addressed by the authorities. The majority of the affected land is now safe for life and economic activities. However, in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and in some limited areas of Belarus, Russia and Ukraine some restrictions on land-use should be retained for decades to come. Most of the 600,000 emergency and recovery operation workers and five million residents of the contaminated areas in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine received relatively minor radiation doses which are comparable with the natural background levels. Apart from the dramatic increase in thyroid cancer incidence among those exposed at a young age and some increase of leukaemia and solid cancer in most exposed workers, there is no clearly demonstrated increase in the somatic diseases due to radiation.","['International Atomic Energy Agency, Wagramerstrasse 5, P.O.

Epub 2007 Apr 19.,"Stem cell factor (SCF) has important roles in the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells. The complex of c-Kit and its ligand SCF induce hematopoiesis, melanogenesis, and gametogenesis. However, the mechanism by which SCF induces cell proliferation in the human megakaryoblastic leukemia cell line, MO7e, and the signaling molecules involved, especially in downstream signaling of c-Kit, remain unclear. Here, we show that pharmacological inhibition of the PI3K pathway inhibits SCF/c-Kit signaling and cell proliferation. In addition, we find that the Shc/PDK1/PKC/Akt/c-raf signaling cascade is essential for SCF/c-Kit signal pathway. Our results also suggest that ERK5 is activated and translocated to the nucleus, activating CREB and STAT3. Interestingly, chrysin shuts down the SCF/c-Kit complex-induced signaling cascade. Taken together, these studies give additional insight into the molecular mechanism of SCF/c-Kit-induced cell proliferation and its inverse agonist, chrysin. Finally, these findings enhance our understanding of MO7e cell proliferation.","['Pharmaceutical Screening Team, Medicinal Science Division, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, 100 Jang-dong, Yuseong-gu, Daejeon 305-600, Republic of Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotyping was performed on medullary specimens of 197 acute leukemia (AL) patients by using three-color flow cytometry analysis and CD45/SSC gating. The scoring systems proposed by EGIL was adopted to classify the AL patients into five groups: 43 of ALL, 53 of AML, 53 of My + ALL, 39 of Ly + AML and 9 of BAL patients. The results showed that in Ly + AML, CD7 was the most common (53.8%) as compared to other lymphoid markers, however, in My + ALL CD13 was the most common (47.2%) as compared to other myeloid markers. Compared with Ly + AML, My + ALL had higher incidences of enlargement of liver, spleen and lymphnodes significantly (P<0.05). As for the case numbers of WBC counts > 100 x 10(9)/L, the positive rate of CD34 and the complete remission rate there was no obvious difference between groups of Ly + AML and My + ALL (P>0.05). As for incidences of enlargement of liver, spleen and lymphnodes, the case numbers of WBC counts > 100 x 10(9)/L, the positive rate of CD34 and complete remission rate, no obvious difference was found between ALL and My + ALL (P>0.05). Compared with AML, Ly + AML had lower complete remission rate significantly (P<0.05). As for incidences of enlargement of liver, spleen and lymphnodes, the case numbers of WBC counts > 100 x 10(9)/L and the positive rate of CD34, no obvious difference was found between AML and Ly + AML (P>0.05). Compared with Ly + AML and My + ALL, BAL showed no significant difference in complete remission rate (P>0.05) because the number of BAL patients was too small. It is concluded that since Ly + AML has lymphoid markers, and the prognosis of Ly + AML is worse than AML, the clinical therapy for Ly + AML should contain both AML and ALL. Though My + ALL had myeloid markers, no significant difference was found between My + ALL and ALL, it might be supposed that their therapy could be the same.","['Department of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430022, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The toxicities of 70 return infusions were evaluated. All patients were mobilized by chemotherapy plus recombination human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), and then PBSCs were collected by a separator CS-3000 plus or COBE spectra-4. The grafts were cryopreserved in 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSD) and stored in liquid nitrogen. There were totally 70 PBSC transfusions. The total volume of PBSCs transfused: 190 - 420 ml (265 +/- 73 ml or 13.7 +/- 4.2 ml/kg) with a mean of (4.43 +/- 1.91) x 10(8)/kg of PBSCs, and 0.94 +/- 0.18 g/kg of DMSO. The single dose: 90 - 300 ml (132 +/- 37 ml or 6.6 +/- 5.2 ml/kg) with a mean of 0.68 +/- 0.12 g/kg of DMSO. Symptoms occurring during the infusions were recorded. All patients were monitored for 24 hours after infusion. Pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, and respiratory rate were recorded every 15 minutes. At four hours before and 8 hours after infusion, urinalysis was performed. Serum potassium, sodium, creatinine, total bilirubin, aspartate amino transferase (AST), and alanine amino transferase (ALT) levels were examined within 24 hours before and after the first infusion. The results showed that the toxicities observed included hemoglobinuria in 54 return infusions (77.1%), headache in 28 (40.0%), nausea in 24 (34.3%), vomiting in 17 (24.3%), and abdominal pain in 8 (11.4%). Patients who received a graft > 200 ml tended to have a higher frequency of hemoglobinuria, headache, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (P<0.01), and they disappeared quickly, too. Total bilirubin increased after the first return infusion (P<0.01), and there was a significant correlation between the volume of infusion and the degree of total bilirubin increase (r=0.8977, P<0.01). No renal failure or shock occurred. It is concluded that transient hemoglobinuria, headache, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain are common toxicities associated with PBSC autograft, and these toxicities are related with a single volume of PBSCs transfused. Total bilirubin increase is correlated with the volume of infusion. In a word, the toxicity is less frequent and lower severe in children with fractionated infusions of cryopreserved peripheral blood stem cell.","['Department of Pediatrics, The PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biotin-streptavidin method was used to detect the expression of NF-kappaB P65 protein and the effects of TPCK and Dex at clinically relevant dosage on activity of NF-kappaB P65 protein in 20 childhood ALL patients. The results indicated that the expression of NF-kappaB P65 protein was strongly diminished and reached to negative level at 2 hours by treatment with 40 micromol/L TPCK, the positive expression of NF-kappaB P65 protein was (2.5 +/- 1.6)%. TPCK had a time-dependent inhibitory effect on ALL cells cultured in vitro. The expression of NF-kappaB P65 protein in ALL cells was strongly inhibited by clinically relevant concentration of dexamethasone 5.0 microg/ml for 24 hours in vitro. The positive expression was (25.0 +/- 3.0)%, there was significant difference, as compared with untreated ALL cells (T=55, P<0.01). It is concluded that TPCK and Dex can inhibit NF-kappaB activity.

In spite of its potential clinical relevance, this subtype leukemia usually would be undetected with conventional cytology procedures, and easily confused with acute promyelocyte leukemia (APL) in morphology. In order to investigate the immunophenotypic characteristics of bone marrow cells in AML-M(2) patients with AML-ETO gene rearrangement classified by FAB, immunophenotype of bone marrow cells in 17 AML-M(2) patients with AML-1/ETO(+) confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization was analyzed by using flow cytometry as compared with immunophenotype in 34 APL patients with AML-1/ETO(-). The results showed that population of blast cells (15.89% - 68.53%) and population of more heterogeneous myeloid cells were detected with right-angle scatter in 17 patients with AML-1/ETO(+), i.e. AML-M(2) by FAB classification. The blast cells expressed stem cell associated antigens CD34, HLA-DR and myeloid antigens CD33, CD13, MPO. The mean fluorescent intensity of CD33 in M(2)/ETO(+) patients was significantly lower than that in APL patients (121 +/- 92 vs 845 +/- 523, P<0.001), meanwhile positive expression rates of HLA-DR, CD19 and CD34(+)CD56(+) in M(2)/ETO(+) patients were significantly higher than that in APL patients (100%, 88.24%, 100% vs 27.27%, 8.82%, 0%, P<0.001), expression rate of CD9 in M(2)/ETO(+) patients was significantly lower than that in APL patients (P<0.001). In patients with M(2)/ETO(+) (AML-M(2)), the pattern of CD15/CD11b expression was seen as granulocytic differentiation with immature events showing CD15(+)CD11b(-) and more mature CD15(+)CD11b(+) populations, the expression of mature granulocytes CD10 was negative and similar to APL in expression figure. The granulocytes expressed CD56 in 17 patients with M(2)/ETO(+) (17/17, 100%) and its expression rate was significantly higher than that in patients with M(3) (6/34, 17.56%). It is concluded that AML-M(2) with AML-1/ETO gene rearrangement was confirmed to express an exclusive immunophenotype that shows highly predictive value for the cytogenetic pattern, and the multiparametric flow cytometry with FISH provides a technical approach to easily distinguish leukemia subtype M(2)/ETO(+) from APL.","[""Flow Cytomertry Laboratory, Department of Laboratory Medical Examination, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangzhou 510080, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood dendritic cell (DC) subsets of patients and healthy controls were detected by flow cytometry, and the correlations between reconstitution of DC and cGVHD, relapse were analyzed. The results showed that compared with healthy subjects, patients with leukemia had a significantly decreased proportion and absolute number of myeloid dendritic cell (MDC), MDC1, DC and the ratio of MDC/PDC (P<0.05). There were not statistically different in MDC2 and PDC between patients and healthy subjects. After transplant, all the proportion of WBC and absolute numbers of DC reached to healthy controls levels at 9 months (P>0.05), besides the proportion of PDC which reached to healthy controls levels at 1 year (P=0.494). Compared with levels before relapse, the proportions of MDC1, MDC, DC and the ratio of MDC/PDC were lower, but proportions of MDC2 and PDC were slightly higher after relapse.

Peripheral blood and bone marrow in 27 patients who received myeloablative allogenetic cell transplantation were collected before and after transplantation in different times. 10 and 7 different STR markers were co-amplified in a single reaction by using a commercial AmpF/STR Profiler Plus/Cofiler plus PCR amplification kits. Separation of the PCR products and fluorescence detection were performed by ABI prism 310 Genetic Analyzer with capillary electrophoresis. The Genescan and Genotype soft ware were used for size calling and quantification of peak areas. The formula to calculate donor chimerism values was based on the different allelic distribution type between donor and recipient. The results showed that donor chimerism was similar by the two methods. The median number of informative alleles was 6.3 (4 - 9) by Profiler Plus and 4.9 (2 - 6) by Cofiler Plus. The donor alleles appeared in 26 patients on day 28 post transplantation. One patient was not observed to appear donor alleles. 14 patients with 100% donor chimerism (DC) had stable engraftment and they still survive in free leukemia. 9 patients had unstable mixed chimerism (DC: 0% - 90.2%), and 5 of them relapsed after allo-HSCT, 6 patients died. Decrease of donor chimerism appeared prior to graft rejection and disease relapse. The incidence of GVHD was higher in group of full donor chimerism.

This study was aimed to find single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in the promotor region of asparagine synthetase (AS) gene and to determine if these SNPs have influence on the transcriptional activity of AS promotor. The DNA sequences of AS promoter (pAS) from 82 leukemic children and 45 controls were determined to screen for SNPs in this region and the AS mRNA level in these samples was quantified using real-time PCR assay. The results indicated that three SNPs were found in the sequenced pAS fragment. They were -239C/T, -92G/A and -62A/T respectively. The frequency of -92A allele was higher in leukemic samples than that in nonleukemic control (P<0.05). The gene expression level differed among the individuals with genotype of the -92G/A SNP, and the descending order was as follows: GA heterozygote > AA homozygote > GG homozygote. It is concluded that some features in leukemia might associate with SNP on -92A locus, and this SNP in pAS can be one of the factors influencing transcriptional activity of AS gene. The existence of the -92A allele variant contributes to a high expression of AS gene.","['Shanghai Children Medical Center, Xinhua Hospital, Medical College of Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai 200127, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results showed that 29 specimens were Ph (+) with different positive ratio and 3 specimens with lower cells were not analyzed by CC. 36 specimens were bcr/abl mRNA (+) by RT-PCR. 4 specimens from case 1 at 12, 18, 26 and 38 months after allo-NSCT were Ph (-) and bcr/abl mRNA (-), 4 Ph (-) bcr/abl (+) specimens containing 2 from case 1 at 9 and 10 months after allo-NSCT, 1 from case 2 at 15 months after allo-NSCT, 1 from case 3 at 12 months after allo-NSCT showed 5.4%, 0%, 16.5% and 1.5% bcr/abl (+) cells by FISH. 3 specimens with lower cells containing 2 from case 5 at 20 and 60 days after allo-NSCT and 1 from case 7 at 40 days after allo-NSCT were analyzed by FISH and showed 55.0%, 27.5% and 73.5% bcr/abl (+) cells. The Ph (-) bcr/abl (-) specimen from case 1 at 12 months post-allo-NSCT showed 0% bcr/abl (+) cells by FISH. It is concluded that CC can be used as a basic tool to monitor the change of tumor load in CML during treatment. When specimen with lower cells can not be analyzed by CC in early period after allo-NSCT, or result of CC can not evaluate precisely dynamic change of tumor load and when tumor load in treated patient are lower to Ph (-) by CC while bcr/abl mRNA (+) by RT-PCR, FISH must be used to detect precisely tumor load and monitor dynamic change of it. More sensitive RT-PCR is used to monitor tumor load when it is lower to bcr/abl (-) by FISH during treatment.","['Department of Hematology, The Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan 030001, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

P210(bcr/abl) plays a central role in the pathophysiology of CML. The purpose of this study was to construct a cell line model that bcr/abl expression can be regulated by Tet-off inducing-expression-system. The full-length b3a2 bcr/abl cDNA was subcloned into the pTRE2hyg expression vector to construct the pT2-P210 plasmid. 293 cells were firstly transfected with Tet-off plasmid and the clone that the Tet-off system can work effectively after transfected with pTRE2hyg-LUC was selected by luciferase activity assay. The pT2-P210 plasmid was then transfected into the selected clone and cells were then selected for hygromycin B and G418 resistance. The results showed that individual subclones expressing bcr/abl after withdrawing doxycycline were 293pT2-P210 cell line. In conclusion, selected 293pT2-P210 cells are cells that bcr/abl expression can be regulated by Tet-off inducing-expression-system.

Caspofungin and amphotericin B have been reported to have synergistic activity against Fusarium spp. CASE PRESENTATION: We herein report a case of disseminated fusariosis diagnosed by chest CT scan and positive blood cultures to Fusarium spp. Because the patient's clinical condition deteriorated, CRP levels increased, and blood cultures continued to yield Fusarium spp. despite liposomal amphotericin B monotherapy up to 5 mg/kg daily, treatment with caspofungin was added. Within 2 weeks of onset of combined antifungal therapy, the chest CT scan demonstrated a progressive resolution of the pulmonary lesions. Upon discontinuation of intravenous antifungals, the patient received suppressive therapy with oral voriconazole. Three months later, a chest CT scan showed no abnormalities. Twenty-five months after discontinuation of all antifungal therapy, the patient remains in complete remission of her neoplastic disease with no signs of clinical activity of the Fusarium infection. CONCLUSION: This is the first description of successful treatment of disseminated fusariosis in a pediatric patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia with caspofungin and amphotericin B followed by oral suppressive therapy with voriconazole.","['Department of Hematology, Complejo Hospitalario Infanta Cristina, Badajoz, Spain. jvagacev@aehh.org']",,,,PMC1878481,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-four patients underwent myeloablative conditioning and 19 received busulphan/fludarabine-based reduced intensity conditioning (RIC). In patients with acute myelogenous leukaemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (AML/MDS; n = 18), no relapse occurred following transplants meeting both a high (above median) natural killer (NK) cell count and missing HLA-ligand(s) to donor's KIR(s), compared to all other AML/MDS patients (0% versus 44%; P = 0.049). Missing HLA-B and/or HLA-C ligand combined with missing HLA-A3/11 (KIR3DL2 unblocked) predicted for reduced relapse incidence regardless of diagnosis or conditioning type (P = 0.028). Moreover, in AML/MDS patients, this constellation predicted superior overall survival (OS) (P = 0.046). Transplants with more than two different activating donor KIRs were associated with an increased risk for non-relapse mortality (NRM), both by univariate and multivariate analysis. Quantitative graft composition had a significant impact exclusively in RIC transplants. Here, a trend towards reduced relapse incidence was found in patients receiving high numbers of NK cells (16% versus 54%; P = 0.09). In patients receiving high versus low T cell numbers, OS was superior (83% versus 37%; P = 0.01), due mainly to reduced NRM (0% versus 33%; P = 0.046). By multivariate analysis, relapse risk was decreased significantly in patients receiving high NK cell numbers (P = 0.039). These data suggest that both the number of transplanted NK cells and the donor KIR genotype play a role in graft-versus-malignancy mechanisms in HLA-identical PBSCT.","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria. johannes.clausen@uibk.ac.at']",,,,PMC1941931,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a powerful technique able to disclose interpatient variance in gene expression. Such variation in gene expression may be the cause of different disease outcome and may reflect disease phenotypes or chemoresistance. Acute myeloid leukemia is a malignant disease of the bone marrow where overall long-term disease-free survival is less than 50%. The need for better disease classification and evaluation is consequently evident. Gene expression profiling in acute myeloid leukemia has, in recent years, proven able to distinguish acute myeloid leukemia subclasses and predict clinical outcome and is, as such, a promising technique for improved disease evaluation. The early detection of gene expression in response to chemotherapy may be a novel way of monitoring disease management.

Anecdotal experiences suggest that GD may go undiagnosed for many years, leading to severe complications that are preventable or reversible by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with imiglucerase. We conducted surveys of patients and Hematology-Oncology specialists to assess the frequency of diagnostic delays. Additionally, we report a series of patients who suffered diagnostic delays and as a result developed disabilities including potentially life-threatening manifestations of GD. Of 136 patients surveyed, the average time from first appearance of GD symptoms to final diagnosis was 48.7 +/- 123.6 months. More than two-thirds were evaluated and managed by a hematologist-oncologist (Hem-Onc). A global survey of 406 Hem-Oncs found that only 20% considered GD in the differential diagnosis for all of its classic symptoms (cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, bone pain); the diagnosis considered most likely included leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. To illustrate actual consequences of diagnostic delays, we describe 14 patients with GD who suffered from symptoms for up to 10 years before correct diagnosis. Diagnostic delays led to complications that are preventable or reversible with ERT (i.e., avascular necrosis, severe bleeding, chronic bone pain, life-threatening sepsis, pathologic fractures, growth failure, liver pathology). Patients homozygous for N370S mutation in this series were vulnerable to diagnostic delays. In conclusion, prolonged diagnostic delays occur in GD and may result in severe disease manifestations. Our findings suggest that physician education will increase the likelihood of prompt detection of GD and improve its management with ERT with imiglucerase when indicated.","['Department of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Yale University, School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA. pramod.mistry@yale.edu']",['K24DK066306/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,['Am J Hematol. 2008 Dec;83(12):937.

Permanent hair dye colors are formed by an oxidative process involving arylamines, giving rise to concerns about the potential adverse health effects of long-term exposure, especially cancer. A 1993 International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) review concluded that evidence was inadequate to evaluate the carcinogenicity of personal hair dye use. This systematic review synthesizes the results from studies of personal hair dye use and cancer published since 1993, taking into consideration the quality of exposure assessment. Thirty-one English-language articles published in January 1992-February 2005 that investigated the association between personal hair dye use and cancer were identified through the PubMed search engine. Quality of exposure assessment was rated between 1+ (lowest quality: assessed ever use of hair dyes) and 4+ (highest quality: assessed dye type [permanent/nonpermanent], dye color/shade, frequency and duration of use). Because of the heterogeneity of the exposure assessment across the studies, a formal meta-analysis was not conducted. Associations between personal hair dye use and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple myeloma, acute leukemia, and bladder cancer were observed in at least one well-designed study with detailed exposure assessment (rated 3+ or 4+), but were not consistently observed across studies. Results for bladder cancer studies suggest that subsets of the population may be genetically susceptible to hair dye exposures, but these findings are based on small subgroups in one well-designed case-control study. Replication of these findings is needed to determine whether the reported associations are real or spurious.","['Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, H.

We tested two homemade, continuous-flow thermocycler microdevices for amplification of reverse-transcribed messages from cell lysates without nucleic acid extraction. Amplification yield and specificity were assessed with state-of-the-art, real-time quantitative equipment. Carryover contamination between consecutive samples was absent.

Epub 2007 May 10.,"PURPOSE: Some methoxyflavones (MFs) are known to inhibit the function of P-glycoprotein. The aim of this study is to characterize the reversal of multidrug resistance (MDR) by MFs. METHODS: The effects of 19 MFs, including 3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone, nobiletin, and tangeretin, and flavone on the uptake of [3H]vincristine into an adriamycin-resistant variant of human chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562/ADM) cells were investigated. Potentiation of vincristine-induced growth inhibition by these MFs was also tested in K562/ADM cells by means of WST-1 [2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] assay. RESULTS: All MFs (20 microM) tested increased the uptake of [3H]vincristine. 3,5,6,7,8,3',4'-heptamethoxyflavone, nobiletin, tangeretin, quercetagetin and quercetin pentamethylether showed especially potent effects. The increase in the uptake of [3H]vincristine was proportional to the number of methoxyl moieties. While substitution with a methoxyl moiety at the C3 position was the most influential, methoxyl substitution at both the C3' and C5' positions resulted in a decrease in the potentiation of uptake. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the potencies for increasing [3H]vincristine uptake and for growth inhibition assessed by WST-1 assay. CONCLUSIONS: MFs increased the uptake of [3H]vincristine into MDR cells and exhibited MDR-reversing effects. Their potencies were influenced by the number and positions of the methoxyl moieties.","['Laboratory of Drug Informatics, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1, Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-0033, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detection of JCV genome with polymerase chain reaction in his cerebrospinal fluid subsequently confirmed the diagnosis of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). He was admitted to our hospital. The serum level of soluble interleukin-2 receptor in the patient increased, and both edema and new Gd-enhanced lesions were observed in the cortex of the occipital lobe. He was treated with systemic administrations of Pirarubicin. Cyclophosphamide, and Prednisolone. as well as intrathecal injection of Methotrexate and Cytarabine. Although these treatments temporarily alleviated the symptoms of PML. the ATL spread to the liver and kidney. He died of multiple organ failure. Analysis of his JCV genes revealed that there were three types of rearrangements in the regulatory domains of the JCV genes. All three types lacked the domain B. and two had duplicate domain A. This is the first report of the simultaneous detection of three different types of rearrangements in JCV genes in a single patient. It has been reported that white-matter lesions caused by typical PML are not enhanced in Gd-MRI. However. the lesions seen in this patient were enhanced in Gd-MRI.

METHODS: The centralized pharmacy database was used to identify all patients who had received imatinib at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, during a 5-year period. The electronic medical records were subsequently reviewed to identify which of these patients had type 2 diabetes. In addition, relevant biochemical data, prior to, during, and after imatinib treatment, were abstracted from the electronic laboratory database and medical records. RESULTS: At the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, a total of 164 patients received imatinib during the period of study (1999 to 2004). Of these 164 patients, 7 had preexisting type 2 diabetes, and diabetes developed in 2 patients during treatment with imatinib. Despite 2 previous reports of improvement in glycemic control with use of imatinib in patients with type 2 diabetes, no net effect on glycemic control or diabetes therapy was noted in our study cohort. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our current study, it seems unlikely that imatinib substantially affects glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street Southwest, Rochester, Minnesota 55905, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 4.,"Although the cardioprotection afforded by the late phase of ischemic preconditioning (PC) in ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury has been well studied, it is unknown whether this beneficial effect can be attributed to inhibition of apoptosis. We hypothesized that ischemic PC affords protection by suppressing apoptosis and examined the underlying mechanisms. Myocardial infarction was produced in mice (30-min coronary occlusion). In animals preconditioned 24 h earlier with six 4-min coronary occlusion/4-min reperfusion (O/R) cycles, there was a marked decrease in apoptosis as assessed by three different parameters: hairpin-1 assay, caspase-3 activity, and immunohistochemical analysis of active caspase-3 and cleaved poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1). This protective effect was accompanied by increased expression of multiple antiapoptotic proteins that regulate both the mitochondria-mediated (Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1) and the death-receptor-mediated (c-FLIP(L) and c-FLIP(S)) pathway of apoptosis and by decreased expression of the proapoptotic protein Bad. This is the first demonstration that the late phase of ischemic PC attenuates cardiac apoptosis after ischemia/reperfusion injury and that this salubrious effect is associated with a complex genetic prosurvival program that results in modulation of several key proteins involved in both the mitochondrial and the death receptor pathways of apoptosis.","['Department of Medicine and the Institute of Molecular Cardiology, University of Louisville, 570 S.

Application of specific immunotherapy is effective in eradication of MRD and one of the immunotherapeutic strategies is induction and re-transfusion of leukemia-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). This study was aimed to investigate the possibility of ex vivo induction and generation of CD8 positive CTLs of umbilical cord blood cell origin and to explore their potential of specific anti-leukemia cytotoxicity so as to evaluate the feasibility of application of cord blood cell derived lymphocytes to specific immunotherapy. Dendritic cells (DCs) were induced and generated ex vivo from cord blood mononuclear cells (MNC) with a cytokine cocktail, and loaded with frozen and thawed U937 leukemia antigen. The matured DCs were used to stimulate T lymphocytes derived from the same cord blood cell sample into CTLs. CD8 positive CTLs were then isolated by magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS). Inverted microscopy, scanning electronic microscopy and flow cytometry were used to detect DCs and methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) cytotoxicity method was used to assay the killing activity. The results showed that DCs with typical morphology and mature function were cultured from 10 human cord blood cell samples. The cytotoxicities of CD8 positive CTLs, CD8 negative CTLs and T lymphocytes (TLs) to U937 cells were (66.36 +/- 12.43)%, (34.47 +/- 8.19)% and (15.79 +/- 4.64)% respectively under the same effector target ratio (40:1). Among them, the anti-leukemia cytotoxicity of the CD8 positive group was highest. At effctor target ratio of 40 to 1, the cytotoxicity of CD8 positive CTLs to U937 cells (66.36%) was higher than that to K562 cells (41.97%) (P < 0.05), whereas the cytotoxicity of CD8 negative CTLs to U937 cells was not significantly different from that to K562 cells (P > 0.05). It is concluded that specific CD8 positive CTLs can be generated from cord blood lymphocytes by induction of mature cord blood DCs loaded with U937 leukemia antigen. The cytotoxicity of CD8 positive CTLs against U937 cell is more potent than CD8 negative CTLs, and is strain specific.","['Centre of Oncology and Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical College, Guangzhou 510230, China. tanhuo@public.guangzhou.gd.cn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were twenty patients with hematological diseases, who received transfusion of platelet, involved in the test. APCT was determined before and after transfusion of these patients, then APCT was contrasted with corresponding CCI and PPR. The results showed that 1 hour and 24 hour APCTs were shortened obviously. APCT before transfusion was (103.7 +/- 11.3) seconds, but the 1 hour and 24 hour APCTs were shortened to (60.0 +/- 9.7) seconds and (68.5 +/- 9.8) seconds respectively (P < 0.01). According to the judging criteria of CCI and PPR (CCI and PPR values at 1 and 24 hours after transfusion are < 7500, < 5000 and < 30%, < 20% respectively, the transfusion is invalid), two patients received invalid transfusion. Their 1 and 24 hour CCIs were 7415, 2966 and 6913, 4988 respectively. Their 1 and 24 hour PPRs were 28.0%, 11.2% and 25.2%, 14.1% respectively. One patient's PPR reached the standard of invalid transfusion, but his CCI showed a valid transfusion he received. Two patients' PPR reached the standard of invalid transfusion, but their 1 hour CCI reached the standard of valid transfusion, and their 24 hour CCI reached the standard of invalid transfusion. It is concluded that APCT reflects the variations of quantity and quality of platelet simultaneously, and can evaluate precisely the efficacy of platelet transfusion.","['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Zhongda Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine, Southeast University, Nanjing 210009, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blood samples from 133 cases of leukemias were analyzed by CD45/SSC double parameters and multi-color flow cytometry in order to determine the CD36 and other leukocyte differentiation antigens. The results show that the CD36 positive rate was 21.8% (29/133) in 133 cases of leukemia, 41.9% (26/62) in 62 cases of AML (acute myeloid leukemia), and none of the 54 cases of lymphocytic leukemia was positive for this antigen. The positive rate of CD36 in M(4) (8/10), M(5) (12/12) and M(6) (3/3) was significantly higher than that in M(1) (0/9), M(2) (3/12), M(3) (0/16) (all P < 0.001). The percent of positive cells of CD36 in M(5a) was significantly higher than in M(5b) (P = 0.001). A significantly negative regression was found between CD36 and CD117 in AML (r = -0.751, P = 0.005). And a significantly positive regression was found between CD36 and CD14 in M(4) and M(5b) (r = 0.870, P = 0.011). In monocyte lineage involved leukemia (MLIL), the positive rate of CD36 (92.6%, 25/27) was significantly higher than that of CD14 (48.1%, 13/27)(P = 0.001).

Three plasmids containing cDNA fragments of the bcr1-, bcr3-form PML/RARalpha and ABL control gene were constructed respectively. The ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System using Taqman fluorogenic probes was used to quantify target gene. PML/RARalpha mRNA was detected by Q-PCR in 46 APL patients and 40 non-APL patients. The normalized quotient (NQ) of PML/RARalpha mRNA was calculated as followings: NQ = PML/RARalpha mRNA copy numbers/ABL mRNA copy numbers. Immunophenotype of acute promyelocytic leukemia was determined by four-color flow cytometry. The results showed that the coefficients of variation (CV) of inter-day assay and intra-day assay by using Q-PCR were 1.58% and 0.88% respectively. Q-PCR could detect reproducibly 5 copies of target gene per 100 ng RNA and no pseudopositive results were found. The median NQ of PML/RARalpha mRNA was 0.450 (0.084 - 1.082) in 46 APL patients.

Although the biochemical properties of the secreted form of proMMP-9 are well characterized, little is known about the function and activity of cell surface-associated proMMP-9. We purified a novel 82 kDa species of proMMP-9 from the plasma membrane of THP-1 leukaemic cells, which has substantial differences from the secreted 94 kDa proMMP-9. The 82 kDa form was not detected in the medium even upon stimulation with a phorbol ester. It is truncated by nine amino acid residues at its N-terminus, lacks O-linked oligosaccharides present in the 94 kDa proMMP-9, but retains N-linked carbohydrates. Incubation of 94 kDa proMMP-9 with MMP-3 generated the well-known 82 kDa active form, but the 82 kDa proMMP-9 was converted into an active species of 35 kDa, which was also produced by autocatalytic processing in the absence of activating enzymes. The activated 35 kDa MMP-9 efficiently degraded gelatins, native collagen type IV and fibronectin. The enzyme was less sensitive to TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1) inhibition with IC50 values of 82 nM compared with 1 nM for the 82 kDa active MMP-9. The synthetic MMP inhibitor GM6001 blocked the activity of both enzymes, with similar IC50 values below 1 nM. The 82 kDa proMMP-9 is also produced in HL-60 and NB4 leukaemic cell lines as well as ex vivo leukaemic blast cells. It is, however, absent from neutrophils and mononuclear cells isolated from peripheral blood of healthy individuals. Thus, the 82 kDa proMMP-9 expressed on the surface of malignant cells may escape inhibition by natural TIMP-1, thereby facilitating cellular invasion in vivo.","['Division of Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Biochemistry in the Surgical Department, Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, 80336 Munich, Germany. christian.ries@med.uni-muenchen.de']",,,,PMC2267301,,,,,,,,,,,

Trivalent arsenic, in the form of arsenic trioxide (As2O3; Trisenox(R)) is currently used in the treatment of refractory leukemias, but at the cost of major adverse effects. Moreover, recent studies showed that the trypanocide melarsoprol, could be more effective than arsenic trioxide on myelogenous leukaemias. We have synthesized a series of derivatives from 2-phenyl-[1,3,2]dithiarsolan-4-yl)-methanol (AsIII). Our work shows that the substitution of the aromatic ring by an iodine atom in the ortho position or by an amino-dimethoxytriazin group in the para position increases very significantly the antileukemic activity and improves the therapeutic index (IT=LD50/IC50) of these melarsoprol-derivatives molecules, as compared to arsenic trioxide. However, one of the most promising compounds seems to be arsthinol, an old drug used in the past as an amebicide.

The majority of older patients with AML probably do not receive specific treatment, and those who receive standard regimens have a median survival time of less than 1 year. This suggests that, in general, older patients should receive investigational therapy; however, factors other than age influence survival after administration of standard treatment and need to be accounted for when making treatment recommendations. In some cases where investigational therapy is unavailable, palliative care may be the best option. Like AML, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a disease of the elderly. It is divided into higher and lower risk groups. The natural history of high-risk MDS (eg, > 10% marrow blasts) bears more resemblance to that of AML than to that of an indolent disorder; accordingly, similar therapeutic considerations apply. The more benign natural history of lower risk MDS leads to consideration of reduction in transfusion needs and improvement in quality of life as primary goals of therapy. Lenalidomide, azacitidine, and decitabine, each recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, are useful in achieving these objectives.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA. ehestey@mdanderson.org']",,,,,64,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 8.,"CD30 is a member of the TNF receptor superfamily. Overexpression of CD30 on some neoplasms versus limited expression on normal tissues makes this receptor a promising target for antibody-based therapy. Radioimmunotherapy of cancer with radiolabeled antibodies has shown promise. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of an anti-CD30 antibody, HeFi-1, armed with (211)At in a leukemia (karpas299) model and with (90)Y in a lymphoma (SUDHL-1) model. Furthermore, we investigated the combination therapy of (211)At-HeFi-1 with unmodified HeFi-1 in the leukemia model. Treatment with unmodified HeFi-1 significantly prolonged the survival of the karpas299-bearing mice compared with the controls (P < 0.001). Treatment with (211)At-HeFi-1 showed greater therapeutic efficacy than that with unmodified HeFi-1 as shown by survival of the mice (P < 0.001). Combining these two agents further improved the survival of the mice compared with the groups treated with either (211)At-HeFi-1 (P < 0.05) or unmodified HeFi-1 (P < 0.001) alone. In the lymphoma model, the survival of the SUDHL-1-bearing mice was significantly prolonged by the treatment with (90)Y-HeFi-1 compared with the controls (P < 0.001). In summary, radiolabeled HeFi-1 is very promising for the treatment of CD30-expressing leukemias and lymphomas, and the combination regimen of (211)At-HeFi-1 with unmodified HeFi-1 enhanced the therapeutic efficacy.","['Metabolism Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, PET Department, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']","['N01CO12400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CO-12400/CO/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'Intramural NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1895969,,,,,,,,,,,

In an effort to reduce toxic mortality while maintaining the graft-versus-leukemia effect, allogeneic SCT has been combined with a reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen. The aim of this study was to determine the outcome of patients with LGL treated with RIC allogeneic SCT. DESIGN AND METHODS: This retrospective multicenter study included 73 patients with relapsed or refractory LGL allografted after a RIC regimen between 1998 and 2005 whose data were recorded in a French registry. RESULTS: Patients received a median of three lines of therapy prior to RIC allogeneic SCT. The most widely used conditioning regimens were fludarabine + busulfan + antithymocyte globulin (n=43) and fludarabine + total body irradiation (n=21). Prior to allografting, patients were in complete response (CR; n=21), partial response (PR; n=33) or had chemoresistant disease (n=19). The median follow-up was 37 months (range, 16 to 77 months). In patients in CR, PR and chemoresistant disease, the 3-year overall survival rates were 66%, 64% and 32%, respectively, while the 3-year event-free survival rates were 66%, 52% and 32%, respectively. The 3-year cumulative incidences of TRM were 32%, 28% and 63%, respectively. The incidence of relapse was 9.6%. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Although associated with significant TRM, RIC allogeneic SCT in advanced chemosensitive disease leads to long-term survival.","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) Pontchaillou, Rennes, France. vigouroux.st@wanadoo.fr""]",,"['French Society of Bone Marrow Graft Transplantation and Cellular Therapy', '(SFGM-TC)']",,,,,,,,['Haematologica. 2007 May;92(5):580-2.

Specifically, the presence of a fusion gene involving ABL1 and NUP214, both located at 9q34, has been reported. We sought to evaluate whether T-ALL patients with overexpression of ABL showed a peculiar gene expression pattern and were characterized by having specific rearrangements. DESIGN AND METHODS: We previously assessed the expression profile of 128 adults with ALL by oligonucleotide arrays: 33 had T-ALL. In the current study, we evaluated the expression levels of ABL1 in T-ALL cases and found three patients who had ABL1 levels comparable to those detected in BCR/ABL (+)cases and one who had a significantly higher level of ABL1 expression. In order to establish the incidence of ABL1 overexpression in T-ALL, we evaluated 17 additional patients by quantitative (Q)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. RESULTS: The three cases with ABL1 expression levels comparable to those found in BCR/ABL (+)cases had a specific signature characterized by a high expression of genes involved in regulation of transcription. The fourth case, with the highest levels of ABL, harbored the NUP214-ABL1 rearrangement, which was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Three of the four patients were refractory to induction chemotherapy. Of the 17 additional patients evaluated by Q-PCR and RT-PCR, none showed ABL1 overexpression. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Overall, overexpression of ABL1 was found in 8% of T-ALL cases. These results underline the value of microarray analyses for the identification of specific signatures associated with ABL1 overexpression, as well as rearrangements, e.g. NUP214-ABL1, in adult T-ALL.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to correlate the kinetics of MRD clearance after allogeneic transplantation with the clinical outcome of adults with ALL. DESIGN AND METHODS: MRD was evaluated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) using probes derived from fusion chimeric genes (BCR/ABL and MLL/AF4) (n=22) or rearrangements of the T-cell receptor or immunoglobulin genes (n=21). Forty-three adult patients with ALL were studied to correlate the kinetics of MRD clearance before and after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. RESULTS: At 36 months, the overall survival of patients who underwent transplantation in hematologic remission (n= 37) was 80% for those who were PCR-negative before transplantation (n= 12) compared to 49% for PCR-positive patients (n= 25)(p=0.17). For the same patients the cumulative incidence of relapse was 0% and 46%, respectively (p=0.027). Moreover, the relapse rate of patients who were PCR-negative at day +100 after transplantation was remarkably low (7%) compared to that among patients who were PCR-positive (80%, p=0.0006). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The kinetics of MRD clearance may help to identify patients at high risk of leukemia relapse after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Patients not achieving an early molecular remission after transplantation require prompt and appropriate pre-emptive treatments such as infusions of donor lymphocytes or new experimental drugs.","['Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Units of Ospedali Riuniti Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated whether peripheral blood (PB) could be an alternative source of cells for monitoring MRD in AML. DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty patients with AML were monitored for MRD after the achievement of complete remission. Using multiparametric flow cytometry we compared the levels of MRD in 50 and 48 pairs of BM and PB after induction and consolidation, respectively. RESULTS: After induction and consolidation therapy, the findings in BM and PB were significantly concordant (r=0.86 and 0.82, respectively, p<0.001 for both comparisons). The cut-off value of residual leukemic cells in PB which correlated with outcome was 1.5x10 (-4). Thirty-three of 43 (77%) patients with >1.5x10 (-4)residual leukemic cells in PB after induction had a relapse, whereas the seven patients with lower levels did not (p=0.0002). After consolidation, 38 patients had a level of MRD >1.5x10 (-4)and 31 (82%) had a relapse; nine out of the remaining ten patients, whose levels of MRD were below 1.5x10 (-4), are still relapse-free (p=0.00006). In multivariate analysis, PB MRD status at the end of consolidation was found to have a significant effect on relapse-free survival (p=0.036). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results indicate that: (i) PB evaluation can integrate BM assessment for MRD detection in patients with AML; (ii) PB MRD status at the end of consolidation therapy may provide useful prognostic information.","['Dept. of Hematology, Policlinico Tor Vergata and Ospedale S.Eugenio, Rome, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, elderly patients can rarely benefit from standard myeloablative allo-SCT because of an unacceptable rate of procedure-related toxicities. This point is critical when considering AML patients in first complete remission. The development of the so-called reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens appears to decrease allo-SCT-related toxicities, and has emerged as an attractive modality in AML patients not eligible for standard allo-SCT. Such RIC regimens aim primarily to provide the immune graft-versus-leukemia effect while causing little toxicity. Of note, treatment-related toxicity appears to be lower with RIC regimens as compared to standard myeloablative regimens. Nevertheless, toxicity might represent only one aspect of the problem, since AML encompasses a group of chemosensitive diseases, raising concerns that significant reduction of the intensity of the preparative regimen may have a negative impact on long-term leukemic control. Furthermore, no prospective studies have been reported thus far establishing RIC allo-SCT as the preferred option in AML. Investigators are currently faced with a dilemma on how to optimize the potential role of RIC allo-SCT in AML patients, while delivering minimal myeloablation and maximizing allogeneic immunotherapy. The aim of this review is to analyze the available research evidence in this field.","['Unite de Transplantation et de Therapie Cellulaire, Institut Paoli-Calmettes, Marseille Cedex 09, France.']",,,,,60,,,,,,,,,,

Many findings have revealed a complex scenario of NPM functions and interactions, pointing to proliferative and growth-suppressive roles of this molecule. The gene NPM1 that encodes for nucleophosmin (NPM1) is translocated or mutated in various lymphomas and leukemias, forming fusion proteins (NPM-ALK, NPM-RARalpha, NPM-MLF1) or NPM mutant products. Here, we review the structure and functions of NPM, as well as the biological, clinical and pathological features of human hematologic malignancies with NPM1 gene alterations. NPM-ALK indentifies a new category of T/Null lymphomas with distinctive molecular and clinico-pathological features, that is going to be included as a novel disease entity (ALK+ anaplastic large cell lymphoma) in the new WHO classification of lymphoid neoplasms. NPM1 mutations occur specifically in about 30% of adult de novo AML and cause aberrant cytoplasmic expression of NPM (hence the term NPMc+ AML). NPMc+ AML associates with normal karyotpe, and shows wide morphological spectrum, multilineage involvement, a unique gene expression signature, a high frequency of FLT3-internal tandem duplications, and distinctive clinical and prognostic features. The availability of specific antibodies and molecular techniques for the detection of NPM1 gene alterations has an enormous impact in the biological study diagnosis, prognostic stratification, and monitoring of minimal residual disease of various lymphomas and leukemias. The discovery of NPM1 gene alterations also represents the rationale basis for development of molecular targeted drugs.","['Section of Haematology and Immunology, University of Perugia, IBit Foundation, Perugia, Italy. faliniem@unipg.it']",,,,,166,,,,,,,,,,

CXCL12 synergizes with cytokines that stimulate myeloid cells, but its interaction with cytokines affecting lymphoid cells has not been examined. We investigated whether interleukin (IL)-7 and IL-3 interact with CXCL12 to regulate ALL proliferation. DESIGN AND METHODS: The survival of ALL cells in serum-free cultures, with or without stromal support and cytokines, was assessed by flow cytometry, and proliferation by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Signaling mechanisms were assessed by western blotting of phosphorylated forms of signaling molecules and by the use of specific inhibitors. RESULTS: CXCL12, IL-3, and IL-7 had only marginal effects on ALL cell survival under serum-free conditions. However, these molecules individually induced significant proliferative responses in stromal cultures of 11 cases of ALL. The combination of CXCL12 with IL-7 or IL-3 produced a variety of responses, with clear synergistic or additive interactions observed in four cases. Synergistic proliferation in response to CXCL12 plus IL-7 was associated with enhanced phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK-1/2 and p38, and AKT, and was partially inhibited by pretreatment of cells with inhibitors for p38 MAPK and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, implicating these pathways in the proliferation in response to IL-7 plus CXCL12. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate a complex interaction between signaling from the CXCR4 receptor on ALL cells with those initiated by the cytokines IL-7 and IL-3, suggesting that CXCL12 may facilitate ALL proliferation by enhancing cytokine-signaling pathways in responsive cases.","['Westmead Institute for Cancer Research, Westmead Millennium Institute, University of Sydney, Westmead, NSW, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The proportion of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells in the peripheral blood of three groups of people (the patients with ALL before therapy, the patients with ALL who achieved partial remission (PR) or complete remission (CR) and the healthy donors) was evaluated by flow cytometry. The level of Foxp3 mRNA expression of each group was examined by FQ-RT-PCR. Furthermore mononuclear cells isolated from the peripheral blood of the healthy donors were added to laboratory serum of ALL and control serum of healthy donors respectively. Each group was divided into sub-groups according to various serum doses. After culture for 72 h, the cells of all the groups were harvested separately and further tested for the expression of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells by flow cytometry. The FQ-RT-PCR method was used to examine the expression of Foxp3 mRNA expression. RESULTS: The percentage of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells and Foxp3 in the patients with ALL after chemotherapy was significantly higher than that of the healthy donors and the patients with ALL without chemotherapy. Although the proportion of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells in the patients with ALL without chemotherapy was almost the same with that in the healthy donors, the level of Foxp3 mRNA expression in the former was higher. Moreover, the proportion of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells and the level of Foxp3 mRNA expression in experimental group were statistically higher than those in control group. The expression of Foxp3 mRNA in control group did not vary with the serum dosage. CONCLUSION: The proportion of CD4(+) CD25(+) Foxp3+Tregs in the peripheral blood of the patients with ALL with or without chemotherapy is significantly higher than that of healthy donors. The serum derived from the patients with ALL can convert CD4(+) CD25(-) T cells to CD4(+) CD25(+) Tregs, which might be one of the important reasons for immunosuppression in ALL.","['Department of Hematology, Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Changzhou 213000, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously described a VEGF signaling pathway that generates apoptosis resistance in CLL B cells. We found induction of significantly more apoptosis in CLL B cells by co-culture with an anti-VEGF antibody. To increase the efficacy of these agents in CLL therapy we have focused on the use of gold nanoparticles (GNP). Gold nanoparticles were chosen based on their biocompatibility, very high surface area, ease of characterization and surface functionalization. We attached VEGF antibody (AbVF) to the gold nanoparticles and determined their ability to kill CLL B cells. Gold nanoparticles and their nanoconjugates were characterized using UV-Visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). All the patient samples studied (N = 7) responded to the gold-AbVF treatment with a dose dependent apoptosis of CLL B cells. The induction of apoptosis with gold-AbVF was significantly higher than the CLL cells exposed to only AbVF or GNP. The gold-AbVF treated cells showed significant down regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins and exhibited PARP cleavage. Gold-AbVF treated and GNP treated cells showed internalization of the nanoparticles in early and late endosomes and in multivesicular bodies.

We have identified 38 orthologues of the human genes in MinDRs in zebrafish cDNA and syntenic regions for the human deletions in the zebrafish genome. One region on chromosome 9 in the zebrafish genome is of potential interest. Within chromosome 9, five genes and two microRNAs were identified with shared synteny to the MinDRs in B-CLL (two genes to human chromosome 11, three to human chromosome 13 and two chromosome 13 microRNAs). The critical region on zebrafish chromosome 9 maps to the MinDR for both human chromosomes, suggesting a common ancestry for B-CLL tumour suppressor genes. Target-selected mutagenesis to identify zebrafish mutants with knock-outs of genes in this region will allow analysis of their in vivo potential for lymphoproliferation and may define causative genes for B-CLL within human chromosomes 11q and 13q. Our study provides an explanation for involvement of both 11q and 13q in B-CLL and the potential to develop animal models for this common lymphoproliferative disorder.","[""Centre for Haematology, Institute of Cell and Molecular Science, Barts & The London, Queen Mary's School of Medicine, 4 Newark Street, London, UK.""]",['P40 RR 12546/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both condensin I and II have common structural maintenance of chromosomes subunits, named hCAP-C and hCAP-E. Pyothorax-associated lymphoma (PAL) is a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma developing in the pleural cavity of patients with long-standing pyothorax. Mutations of hCAP-C and hCAP-E were investigated in 24 leukemia-lymphoma cell lines including eight PAL cell lines, and their influences in chromosome morphology were evaluated. Heterozygous point mutations within hCAP-C were found in two PAL cell lines and corresponding tumor samples (OPL-3 and OPL-7). Deletion of exon 24 within hCAP-E and a point mutation at the donor splice site of intron 24 were detected in OPL-5 and original tumor samples. OPL-5 showed an extensive reduction in expression of not only hCAP-E but also hCAP-C proteins. OPL-5 occasionally showed the chromosome bridge in anaphase and telophase, indicating that segregation is not accurate. OPL-7 showed reduced hCAP-C protein expression, abnormality in chromosome length and width, and abnormal aggregates of hCAP-C protein. These findings indicated that condensin gene alteration might play a role in genome instability, which accelerates the accumulation of other gene alterations in PAL.","['Department of Pathology, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A recent study concluded that CD64 is sensitive and specific for distinguishing AMLs with a monocytic component (ie, AML M4 and AML M5) from other AML subtypes. However, in that study, the intensity of CD64 was not well defined and the number of non-M4/non-M5 AMLs was small. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the usefulness of CD64 by flow cytometric immunophenotyping in distinguishing AMLs with monocytic differentiation from other AML subtypes. DESIGN: Sixty-four AMLs subclassified based on the French-American-British and World Health Organization classifications on pretreatment bone marrows were retrieved from our files (7 M0s, 11 M1s, 17 M2s, 7 M3s, 9 M4s, 7 M5s, 4 M6s, and 2 M7s). A standard panel of markers, including CD2, CD3, CD5, CD7, CD10, CD11b, CD13, CD14, CD15, CD19, CD20, CD33, CD34, CD45, CD56, CD64, CD117, and HLA-DR, were analyzed by flow cytometric immunophenotyping in all AMLs (52 bone marrow samples; 12 peripheral blood samples). RESULTS: CD64 was expressed in AML subtypes M0 to M5 in varying intensities: heterogeneously expressed in 1 of 7 M0s; dimly expressed in 3 of 11 M1s; dimly and moderately expressed in 6 and 2 of 17 M2s, respectively; dimly and moderately expressed in 5 and 1 of 7 M3s, respectively; dimly expressed in 4 of 9 M4s; and heterogeneously, moderately, and strongly expressed in 1, 3, and 3 of 7 M5s, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Strong CD64 expression distinguishes AML M5; however, heterogeneous, dim, or moderate expression in itself does not distinguish M0 through M4 subtypes from M5 with dim to moderate CD64 expression. However, any CD64 expression associated with strong CD15 expression distinguishes AML M4 or M5, from other AML subtypes.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of North Carolina, CB# 7525, Chapel Hill, NC 27599-7525, USA. cdunphy@unch.unc.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (AIIA) are beneficial for the prevention of atherosclerosis and diabetic nephropathy suggesting that angiotensin II (Ang II) promotes the development of these diseases. It has recently been reported that Ang II exerts proinflammatory actions in vivo and in vitro. This study was aimed to clarify the direct effects of Ang II on monocytes/macrophages. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PMA-treated THP-1 cells, a human monocytic leukaemia cell line, were treated with Ang II (10-6 mol/L) for 24 hours with or without AIIA (CV11974). We evaluated gene expression profiles of these cells using DNA microarray system and quantified them by real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: DNA microarray revealed that in total 19 genes, including monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-2, were up-regulated by Ang II and down-regulated by AIIA. Real-time RT-PCR showed that up-regulation of MCP-2 with Ang II is blocked by the AIIA (CV11974) but not by an AT2-receptor antagonist. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that Ang II directly stimulates MCP-2 expression through AT1-receptors in activated macrophages.

However, not all cancer cells are sensitive to TRAIL. We determined whether ligation of the retinoid receptor, RXR, would sensitize cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. The leukemic cell lines KG1a (apoptosis-resistant) and ML-1 (apoptosis-sensitive) were treated with the RXR-specific retinoid bexarotene, TRAIL, or both, and apoptosis was determined. In KG1a cells, bexarotene downregulated FLIP(Long) and activated caspase-8, thereby allowing for TRAIL-triggered apoptosis. Overexpression of FLIP(Long) in ML-1 cells abrogated apoptosis. In unmodified ML-1 cells bexarotene enhanced programmed cell death via truncation of Bid and release of cytochrome C. Blockade of caspase-8 prevented enhancement in both cell lines; blockade of caspase-9 had a significant effect only in ML-1 cells. Thus, the effect of bexarotene on TRAIL-mediated programmed cell death involved proximal events of the extrinsic pathway; however, downstream signals involved the intrinsic pathway in ML-1 but not in KG1a cells.

Sustained activation of Rap1 in mouse hematopoietic stem cells causes expansion of hematopoietic progenitors, followed by a myeloproliferative disorder mimicking chronic myeloid leukemia. Moreover, these mice develop a B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder resembling chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Here, we used HEK 293 cells as a tool to examine the molecular effects of Rap1. We observed that a constitutively active Rap1 mutant localized predominantly in the nucleus. Nuclear localization of endogenous Rap1-GTP was also detected upon physiologic activation. A potential consequence of nuclear localization of Rap1-GTP is the regulation of gene expression. We used a high throughput proteomic approach to identify gene products potentially modulated by Rap1-GTP. Out of 1000 proteins examined, 64 proteins were upregulated and 66 proteins were downregulated. The differentially expressed gene products belong to cytoskeletal regulator proteins, signaling molecules, transcription factors, viability regulators, and protein transporters. This analysis provides the first fingerprint of gene product expression regulated by Rap1 and may contribute to our understanding of malignant transformation mechanisms regulated by this small GTPase.","['Transplantation Biology Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA 02129, USA.']",['AI 43552/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now screened for transforming genes in BAL blasts with the use of the focus formation assay with a retroviral cDNA expression library constructed from malignant blasts isolated from a BAL patient. Some of the retroviral inserts recovered from transformed foci were found to encode wild-type purinergic receptor P2Y, G protein coupled, 8 (P2RY8). The oncogenic potential of P2RY8 was confirmed with the in vitro focus formation assay as well as with an in vivo tumorigenicity assay in nude mice. A variety of luciferase-based reporter assays revealed that P2RY8 increased both the trans-activation activities of CREB and Elk-1 as well as the transcriptional activities of the serum response element and enhancer-promoter fragments of the c-Fos and c-Myc genes. Quantitation of P2RY8 mRNA in CD34(+) cells of bone marrow showed that P2RY8 expression is frequently increased in leukemia patients, especially in those with refractory disease. Our data thus reveal an abundant expression of P2RY8 in leukemic cells and its unexpected role in the pathogenesis of acute leukemia.","['Divisions of Functional Genomics, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anti-asparaginase antibodies were identified in 13/47 (IgM class) and 10/47 (IgG class) patients in the induction and in 19/47 (IgM class) and 20/47 (IgG class) patients in the reinduction phase of treatment.

An association between anti-asparaginase antibodies and the allergic reaction to the drug was found. Besides, the children who developed anti-asparaginase antibodies in the induction phase of treatment showed lower event-free survival as well as overall survival in comparison with children without antibodies.

Skin infiltration with B-lymphocyte CLL manifests as solitary, grouped, or generalized papules, plaques, nodules, or large tumors. Prognosis in CLL patients with LC is rather good and many authors claim that it does not significantly affect patients' survival. However, prognosis is poor in patients in whom LC shows blastic transformation (Richter's syndrome) and when leukemic infiltrations in the skin appear after the diagnosis of CLL.

Epub 2007 May 9.,"PURPOSE: Most anticancer drugs show their antiproliferative and cytotoxic activity via induction of apoptosis. In the present study we assessed the implication and role of cordycepin, a polyadenylation-specific inhibitor and a well-known chemotherapeutic drug, in apoptosis, induced by the anticancer drug etoposide. METHODS: For this purpose, a variety of leukemia and lymphoma cell lines (U937, K562, HL-60, Daudi, Molt-4) were treated with the anticancer drugs etoposide and/or cordycepin and assessed for poly(A) polymerase (PAP) activity and isoforms by the highly sensitive PAP activity assay and western blotting, respectively. Induction of apoptosis was determined by endonucleosomal DNA cleavage, DAPI staining, caspase-6 activity assay and DeltaPsi m reduction, whereas cytotoxicity and cell cycle status were assessed by Trypan blue staining, MTT assay and flow cytometry. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that PAP changes in all cell lines, in response to apoptosis induced by etoposide, in many cases even prior to hallmarks of apoptosis (endonucleosomal cleavage of DNA, DeltaPsi(m) reduction). A further elucidation to this apoptosis-polyadenylation correlation was added, by cell treatment with cordycepin, resulting in either suppression (U937, K562) or induction (HL-60) of the apoptotic process, according to the cell type. However, inhibition of polyadenylation did not influence the cell lines Daudi and Molt-4 used, where alternative apoptotic pathways are induced through cleavage of DNA into high molecular weight fragments.","['Institute of Biology, NCSR Demokritos, Aghia Paraskevi Attikis, 15310 Athens, Greece.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

[3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tet razolium] (MTS) assay is one of the commonly used colourimetric absorption assays based on the ability of dehydrogenase from viable cells to produce the brown soluble formazan detectable at 490 nm. Here we have tested the possible growth influence of iron (II) sulphate on two human cancer cell lines, the K562 chronic myelogenous leukaemia and T47D breast carcinoma cells, based on the MTS assay. We found that iron (II) sulphate possessed an inhibitory effect when added at 16- to 125-microM concentrations, but iron (II) sulphate became growth stimulatory when its concentration was further increased to 1000 microM. In addition, a dose-dependent increase in absorbance at the same wavelength was observed when we repeated the experiments without the addition of MTS and phenazine methosulfate. When we further repeated the cell growth determinations using adenosine triphosphate content assay for K562 and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay for T47D, iron (II) sulphate showed a consistent dose-dependent growth inhibitory effect. Morphological investigation after methylene blue staining clearly demonstrated that iron (II) sulphate, at a concentration of 1000 microM, is cytotoxic to T47D cells. Interestingly, a consistent increment for the absorbance at 490 nm was further observed with increased iron (II) sulphate concentration either in the presence or absence of MTS even in a cell-free environment. Thus we conclude that iron (II) sulphate is actually growth inhibitory and even cytotoxic at high concentrations towards the K562 and T47D cancer cells and the paradoxical proliferative activity of iron (II) sulphate on these two cancer cell lines using the MTS assay was solely due to the oxidation of initial pale green iron (II) to brownish iron (III) during incubation in the aqueous condition.","['Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, P.R.

In order to further explore the chemopreventive properties of crude extracts of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L), we studied its anti-proliferative property on several human cancer cell lines and its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in vitro in a mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage/monocyte cell line. Our study shows that crude ethanolic rosemary extract (RO) has differential anti-proliferative effects on human leukemia and breast carcinoma cells. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was estimated at 1/700, 1/400, 1/150 and 1/500 dilutions, for the HL60, K562, MCF7 and MDA-MB-468 cells, respectively. Non-cytotoxic concentrations of RO at 1/1000 dilution minimally induced HL60 cell differentiation into granulocyte lineage at 9.5+/-2.2% compared to 2.8+/-0.8% in the untreated control (p<0.001), and did not induce HL60 cell differentiation into monocyte/macrophage lineage. The 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-chroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox) equivalent antioxidant capacity assay showed that RO has substantial antioxidant activity with RO at 1/10 and 1/5 dilutions having 8.1 and 12.6 microM Trolox equivalents, respectively. RO at non-cytotoxic 1/2000 and 1/1000 dilutions did not affect nitric oxide (NO) production by non-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. However, at the same dilutions RO significantly reduced NO production by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated cells in a dose-dependent manner from 32.6+/-2.3 microM in the LPS-activated cells to 19.2+/-2.2 microM (p<0.01), and 7.7+/-1.2 microM (p<0.001), respectively. RT-PCR analyses showed that RAW 264.7 cells treated with 1/1000 and 1/500 dilutions for 5 h did not affect TNFalpha, IL-1beta, iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression in these cells when compared to the untreated controls, nor did the 1/1000 dilution of RO affect TNFalpha, IL-1beta, iNOS and COX-2 mRNA expression in the LPS-activated cells. At 1/500 dilution, RO significantly reduced IL-1beta (p<0.01) and COX-2 (p<0.05) mRNA expression and non-significantly reduced TNFalpha and iNOS mRNA expression in the LPS-activated cells. In view of the chemopreventive potentials, further studies are needed to explore other biological properties of this popular spice used by many cultures in the world.","[""Department of Pathology and Pediatrics, Center for Complementary Medicine Research, Child and Family Research Institute, British Columbia Children's and Women's Health Center, University of British Columbia, British Columbia V6H 3N4, Canada.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intrinsic factors related to chemical or physical cell damage can initiate apoptosis at a specific cell cycle phase; it is not clear whether cells insulted via an extrinsic pathway also die at a specific cell cycle phase, or how apoptosis is related to cell cycle progression in cells. To illustrate the kinetic changes of apoptosis during cell cycle progression, we examined both intrinsically and extrinsically induced apoptosis in MOLT-4 and Jurkat lymphocytic leukemia cells and in cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) using a recently modified annexin V and propidium iodide method, which detects cell cycle-specific apoptosis. Apoptosis predominantly occurred at a specific cell cycle phase. Leukemia cells were sensitive to induction by both intrinsic (X-rays, UV light, camptothecin, arsenic trioxide, and the traditional Chinese medicine Jinke, which is an extract of Auricularia auricula) and extrinsic factors (via Fas and TNF receptor pathways). The phase at which leukemia cells entered apoptosis depended on the nature of the insult (X-ray or UV, G1-phase; camptothecin, S-phase; arsenic, G1/S phases; Jinke, G1/S phases; and TNF or Fas ligand, G1/S phases), whereas PBLs did not exhibit such insult-dependent differences. PHA-stimulated PBLs entered apoptosis, and additional cells were recruited following additional insults. Unstimulated PBLs remained unresponsive to apoptosis, and proliferating cells became insensitive to the insults after the cell cycle checkpoint was abolished by caffeine. Confluent or starving PBLs were also unresponsive to apoptotic triggers. Thus, apoptotic cell death is a cell cycle event with most, if not all, apoptosis being initiated during a particular cell cycle phase, and changes in the cell cycle result in changes in the apoptotic pattern and schedule. The coordination of apoptosis and proliferation in cells offers a mechanism for the integration of both cell cycle and apoptotic signals.","['Cancer Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Central China University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The drs gene was originally isolated as a novel suppressor gene of v-src transformation and was shown to induce apoptosis in human cancer cells. To investigate the involvement of drs downregulation in the progression of ATLL, we examined the expression of drs in smoldering, chronic and aggressive ATLL, and found that drs expression was markedly reduced in clinically aggressive ATLL. In aggressive ATLL cell lines, expression of drs mRNA was not detected, although expression of drs mRNA was detected in T-cell lines infected with HTLV-1. A correlation between drs downregulation and expression of the Tax gene was not observed in these T-cell lines. Furthermore, introduction of drs into an ATL cell line, HUT102, by retrovirus vector suppressed the colony formation of the cells in soft agar and enhanced apoptotic cell death of the cells under low serum culture conditions. These results indicate that downregulation of drs is closely linked to the progression of ATLL, independently of Tax expression, suggesting that drs may suppress the progression of ATLL via enhancing apoptosis.","['Clinical Research Institute, Osaka National Hospital, Chuo-ku, Osaka, Osaka 540-0006, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, I describe that succinate dehydrogenase (SDH; mitochondrial complex II) subunit B gene (SDHB) is somatically mutated at a cytidine residue in normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and T-cell acute leukemia. Germ line mutations in the SDHB, SDHC or SDHD genes cause hereditary paraganglioma (PGL) tumors which show constitutive activation of homeostatic mechanisms induced by oxygen deprivation (hypoxia). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine the prevalence of a mutation identified in the SDHB mRNA, 180 samples are tested. An SDHB stop-codon mutation c.136C>T (R46X) is present in a significant fraction (average = 5.8%, range = less than 1 to 30%, n = 52) of the mRNAs obtained from PBMCs. In contrast, the R46X mutation is present in the genomic DNA of PBMCs at very low levels. Examination of the PBMC cell-type subsets identifies monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells as primary sources of the mutant transcript, although lesser contributions also come from B and T lymphocytes. Transcript sequence analyses in leukemic cell lines derived from monocyte, NK, T and B cells indicate that the mutational mechanism targeting SDHB is operational in T-cell acute leukemia. Accordingly, substantial levels (more than 3%) of the mutant SDHB transcripts are detected in five of 20 primary childhood T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) bone marrow samples, but in none of 20 B-ALL samples. In addition, distinct heterozygous SDHB missense DNA mutations are identified in Jurkat and TALL-104 cell lines which are derived from T-ALLs. CONCLUSIONS: The identification of a recurrent, inactivating stop-codon mutation in the SDHB gene in normal blood cells suggests that SDHB is targeted by a cytidine deaminase enzyme. The SDHB mutations in normal PBMCs and leukemic T cells might play a role in cellular pre-adaptation to hypoxia.","['Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States of America. baysalb@mwri.magee.edu']","['CA98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U24 CA114766/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1855983,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20070727']

Clinical studies in this setting are frequently promoted by international networks of independent researchers and are limited by practical and methodological constraints, not least the regulations recently issued by national and international institutions (EU Directive 2001/20/EC). PROCEDURE: We reviewed various methods in the design of international multicenter studies, with focus on randomized clinical trials. RESULTS: This paper reports our experience in planning and conducting international studies in childhood leukemia. We applied a decentralized study conduct based on a two-level structure, comprising a national and an international coordinating level. For the more recent trials this structure was implemented as a web-based system. This approach accommodates major legal requirements (e.g., safety reporting) and ensures Good Clinical Practice principles by implementing risk-oriented monitoring procedures. CONCLUSIONS: Setting up international non-commercial trials is increasingly complicated. Still, they are strongly needed for answering relevant questions in limited populations.","['Unit of Medical Statistics, Department of Clinical Medicine and Prevention, University of Milano-Bicocca, Via Cadore, Monza (MI), Italy. grazia.valsecchi@unimib.it']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

We investigate the clinical usefulness of this procedure in a large series of patients. METHODS: Over a 5-year period (2000-2004), ultrasound-guided core needle biopsies were performed in 102 malignant lymphomas. Five diagnostic categories were considered: large B-cell lymphomas (LBCL), small B-cell lymphomas (SBCL), Hodgkin's disease (HD), T cell lymphomas, and miscellaneous. Surgical excisional biopsy of the node was performed in 47 cases (46.1%) for diagnostic confirmation. RESULTS: The overall diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy was 88.2% (90/102). SBCL (39), LBCL (36), HD (15), T cell lymphomas (5), and miscellaneous (7) [including T cell-rich B cell (2), natural killer cell (1), Burkitt's lymphoma (1), and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the B cell type, NOS (3)] were correctly diagnosed. Three HDs, 1 natural killer cell lymphoma, 1 follicular lymphoma, and 1 LBCL were not correctly diagnosed. The core needle biopsy did not yield tumor tissue in 6 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy is effective in the diagnosis of malignant lymphomas and can be used as the first diagnostic approach in selected clinical situations.","['Department of Anatomic Pathology, Hospital de Basurto, Avda. de Montevideo 18, Bilbao, 48013 Spain.']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Feb 14.,"To date, there is scant information on in vivo induction of chromosomal damage by heavy ions found in space (i.e. 56Fe ions). For radiation-induced response to be useful for risk assessment, it must be established in in vivo systems especially in cells that are known to be at risk for health problems associated with radiation exposure (such as hematopoietic cells, the known target tissue for radiation-induced leukemia). In this study, the whole genome multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (mFISH) technique was used to examine the in vivo induction of chromosomal damage in hematopoietic tissues, i.e. bone marrow cells. These cells were collected from CBA/CaJ mice at day 7 following whole-body exposure to different doses of 1 GeV/amu 56Fe ions (0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 Gy) or (137)Cs gamma rays as the reference radiation (0, 0.5, 1.0 and 3.0 Gy, at the dose rate of 0.72 Gy/min using a GammaCell40). These radiation doses were the average total-body doses. For each radiation type, there were four mice per dose. Several types of aberrations in bone marrow cells collected from mice exposed to either type of radiation were found. These were exchanges and breaks (both chromatid- and chromosome-types). Chromosomal exchanges included translocations (Robertsonian or centric fusion, reciprocal and incomplete types), and dicentrics. No evidence of a non-random involvement of specific chromosomes in any type of aberrations observed in mice exposed to 56Fe ions or 137Cs gamma rays was found. At the radiation dose range used in our in vivo study, the majority of exchanges were simple. Complex exchanges were detected in bone marrow cells collected from mice exposed to 1 Gy of 56Fe ions or 3 Gy of 137Cs gamma rays only, but their frequencies were low. Overall, our in vivo data indicate that the frequency of complex chromosome exchanges was not significantly different between bone marrow cells collected from mice exposed to 56Fe ions or 137Cs gamma rays. Each type of radiation induced significant dose-dependent increases (ANOVA, P < 0.01) in the frequencies of chromosomal damage, including the numbers of abnormal cells. Based upon the linear-terms of dose-response curves, 56Fe ions were 1.6 (all types of exchanges), 4.3 (abnormal cells) and 4.2 (breaks, both chromatid- and chromosome-types) times more effective than 137Cs gamma rays in inducing chromosomal damage.","['Pathology Department, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY 11794-8691, USA. krithidech@notes.cc.sunysb.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BACKGROUND: PCG is a rare benign condition of the gingiva characterized by sharply demarcated erythematous and edematous gingivitis often extending to the mucogingival junction. This is considered a hypersensitive reaction. The histological appearance consists of a dense infiltration of normal plasma cells separated by collagenous stroma, usually confined to the free and attached gingiva. The lesion can be eliminated by identifying and avoiding the source of the allergen. REPORT: Three patients ages 26, 27, and 36, respectively, presented with acutely inflamed gingival and a history of recently switching to herbal toothpaste. The gingiva bled readily on probing. Blood tests and gingival biopsy were not contributory. Patients were advised to refrain from the use of herbal toothpaste, and, along with periodontal treatment, the condition underwent remission within a week to two weeks in all three cases. SUMMARY: As more and more herbal products are gaining popularity, clinicians should be aware of some of the untoward effects of these products. Since PCG mimics lesions associated with leukemia and myeloma an early diagnosis of the condition is vital.","['College of Dentistry, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. anil@graduate.hku.hk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 7.,"Cyclin D2 plays an important role in regulation of hematopoietic cell proliferation by cytokines and is implicated in oncogenesis of various hematopoietic malignancies. However, mechanisms regulating cyclin D2 stability and its expression level have remained to be known. Here, we demonstrate that interleukin-3 signaling stabilizes cyclin D2 by inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK3beta) through Janus kinase2-dependent activation of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway in hematopoietic 32Dcl3 cells. On the other hand, osmotic stress was shown to induce a rapid proteasomal degradation of cyclin D2, which was mediated by activation of p38. GSK3beta and p38 was demonstrated to phosphorylate cyclin D2 on Thr280 in vitro, while a cyclin D2 mutant with this residue substituted with Ala was found to be resistant to ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation in 32Dcl3 cells. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway or induction of osmotic stress also caused a rapid proteasomal degradation of cyclin D2 in primary leukemic or myeloma cells. These results indicate that cyclin D2 expression in normal and malignant hematopoietic cells is regulated by ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent degradation that is triggered by Thr280 phosphorylation by GSK3beta or p38, which is induced by inhibition of the PI3K pathway or by osmotic stress, respectively.","['Department of Hematology, Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 7.,"LYL1, a member of the class II basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, is aberrantly expressed in a fraction of human T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Here, we generated transgenic mice ubiquitously overexpressing LYL1 using a construct expressing full-length cDNA driven by a human elongation factor 1alpha promoter. Four independent lines exhibiting high LYL1 expression were established. Of these transgenic mice, 96% displayed loss of hair with a short kinked tail. Furthermore, 30% of them developed malignant lymphoma, with an average latent period of 352 days. In these mice, histological examination revealed tumor cell infiltration in multiple organs and immunohistochemical analysis showed that the infiltrated tumor cells were either CD3 or CD45R/B220-positive; fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis indicated that each tumor consisted either of mainly CD4, CD8 double-positive T cells or mature B cells; the clonality of LYL1-induced lymphoma was confirmed by T-cell receptor rearrangement and immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene rearrangement analyses. Mammalian two-hybrid analysis and luciferase assay suggested that excess LYL1 blocked the dimerization of E2A and thus inhibited the regulatory activity of E2A on the CD4 promoter. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction results showed that the expression of certain E2A/HEB target genes was downregulated. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that aberrant expression of LYL1 plays a role in lymphomagenesis.","['Department of Pathology and Biology of Diseases, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 7.,"The INK4A locus encodes two tumor suppressor genes, p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF), transcribed using alternative exons 1alpha or 1beta spliced onto the same exons 2 and 3. Both p16(INK4A) and p14(ARF) are capable of inhibiting the cell-cycle progression, albeit in different manner; p16(INK4A) is phosphorylation of retinoblastoma (pRB) dependent while p14(ARF) is p53-dependent. In this study, we report the discovery of a novel variant of p16(INK4A), termed p16gamma, in a primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) patient sample and a neuroblastoma cell line, which was expressed at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Cloning and sequencing of the p16gamma cDNA revealed that p16gamma was identical to p16(INK4A), except that it contained an in-frame insertion of 197 bp between exons 2 and 3. p16gamma expression was detected in the majority of p16(INK4A)-expressing primary T-ALL and B-ALL patient samples and other p16(INK4A)-expressing tumor samples, but was only barely detectable in some normal mononuclear cells and other non-tumor samples. Structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance and circular dichroism confirmed that p16gamma, like p16(INK4A), is also an ankyrin-repeat protein. Functional analysis of p16gamma revealed that p16gamma protein interacted with cyclin D-dependent kinase4 and inhibited its kinase activity. Using a luciferase reporter assay, the transfection of p16gamma repressed the E2F response, the downstream target of pRB, with an efficacy equivalent to that of p16(INK4A). Moreover p16gamma, like p16(INK4A), induced cell-cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1), and inhibited cell growth in colony formation assay.","['Genomics Research Center, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan.']","['2 P30CA23100-18/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA69472/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The protective effects of olive (Olea europaea L.) leaves were investigated by incubating human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells with olive leaf extracts (OLEs) from seven principal Tunisian olive varieties, namely, Chemchali, Chemlali, Chetoui, Gerboui, Sayali, Zalmati and Zarrazi. The results showed significant growth inhibition of HL-60 cells incubated for 48 h with a 100-fold dilution of each OLE which had been obtained by incubating 10 g of dried leaves in 100 ml of 70% ethanol for one week with subsequent ultrafiltration. DNA fragmentation was observed in the cells incubated for 19 h with a 100-fold dilution of the Chemchali, Chemlali and Zalmati extracts. The results of a nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) assay revealed NBT reduction, a differentiation marker, by the OLE-treated cells after an overnight incubation. The Gerboui extract showed the highest NBT reduction ability at more than 90%. An HPLC analysis revealed the presence of apigenin 7-glucoside in the extract, which was found in subsequent experiments to be responsible for the Gerboui extract-mediated cell differentiation.","['Laboratory of Characterization and Olive Oil Quality, Biotechnology Center, Hammam Lif, Tunisia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the antiallergic effect of CP-FA, we incubated rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells with 0.001-10.0 microg/ml of CP-FA and determined the beta-hexosaminidase release inhibition at different response stages. The intracellular calcium [Ca(2+)](i) level was also determined by using Fluo 3-AM, a calcium-specific fluorescent probe, and the cytotoxicity of CP-FA was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethythiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The results revealed that RBL-2H3 cells incubated for 48 h with 0.001-10.0 microg/ml of CP-FA did not show any decreased viability. CP-FA inhibited the beta-hexosaminidase release by IgE-sensitized, antigen-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells at the antigen-antibody binding stage and the antibody-receptor binding stage. CP-FA also inhibited histamine release from A23187 plus PMA- or compound 48/80-stimulated KU812 cells. Furthermore, there was a decrease in the intracellular [Ca(2+)](i) level in IgE-sensitized cells incubated with CP-FA and stimulated with antigen.

Epub 2007 May 7.,"It has been hypothesized that nighttime bedroom measurements of extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF EMF) may represent a more accurate reflection of exposure and have greater biologic relevance than previously used 24-/48-hour measurements. Accordingly, the authors extended a pooled analysis of case-control studies on ELF EMF exposure and risk of childhood leukemia to examine nighttime residential exposures. Data from four countries (Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States) were included in the analysis, comprising 1,842 children diagnosed with leukemia and 3,099 controls (diagnosis dates ranged from 1988 to 1996). The odds ratios for nighttime ELF EMF exposure for categories of 0.1-<0.2 microT, 0.2-<0.4 microT, and >or=0.4 microT as compared with <0.1 microT were 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.91, 1.36), 1.37 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.90), and 1.93 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.35), respectively. The fact that these estimates were similar to those derived using 24-/48-hour geometric mean values (odds ratios of 1.09, 1.20, and 1.98, respectively) indicates that the nighttime component cannot, on its own, account for the pattern observed. These results do not support the hypotheses that nighttime measures are more appropriate; hence, the observed association between ELF EMF and childhood leukemia still lacks a plausible explanation.","['Institute of Cancer Epidemiology, Danish Cancer Society, Copenhagen, Denmark. joachim@cancer.dk']",,,,,,,,,,['Am J Epidemiol. 2007 Oct 1;166(7):859; author reply 859-60.

However, there exists substantial biologic and clinical heterogeneity within these cytogenetic groups that is not fully reflected by the current classification system. To improve the molecular characterization we profiled gene expression in a large series (n = 93) of AML patients with CBF leukemia [(inv (16), n = 55; t(8;21), n = 38)]. By unsupervised hierarchical clustering we were able to define a subgroup of CBF cases (n = 35) characterized by shorter overall survival times (P = .03). While there was no obvious correlation with fusion gene transcript levels, FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain, KIT, and NRAS mutations, the newly defined inv(16)/t(8;21) subgroup was associated with elevated white blood cell counts and FLT3 internal tandem duplications (P = .011 and P = .026, respectively). Supervised analyses of gene expression suggested alternative cooperating pathways leading to transformation. In the ""favorable"" CBF leukemias, antiapoptotic mechanisms and deregulated mTOR signaling and, in the newly defined ""unfavorable"" subgroup, aberrant MAPK signaling and chemotherapy-resistance mechanisms might play a role.

At the end of induction therapy, the 5-year risk of relapse was 5% in 176 children with no detectable MRD and 44% in 108 children with detectable MRD (P < .001), with a linear association of the level of MRD and subsequent relapse. Recursive partitioning and clinical characteristics identified that the optimal cutoff level of MRD to predict outcome was 10(-3). The 5-year risk of relapse was 12% for children with MRD less than one leukemia cell per 10(3) normal cells (low MRD) but 72% for children with MRD levels greater than this level (high MRD) (P < .001) and children with high MRD had a 10.5-fold greater risk of relapse. Based upon these results we have altered our treatment regimen for children with B-lineage ALL and children with MRD levels greater than or equal to 10(-3) at the end of 4 weeks of multiagent induction chemotherapy now receive intensified treatment to attempt to decrease their risk of subsequent relapse.","['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']","['P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium'],,PMC1975844,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 7.,"AML1/RUNX1 is implicated in leukemogenesis on the basis of the AML1-ETO fusion transcript as well as somatic mutations in its DNA-binding domain. Somatic mutations in RUNX1 are preferentially detected in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) M0, myeloid malignancies with acquired trisomy 21, and certain myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases. By correlating the presence of RUNX1 mutations with cytogenetic and molecular aberration in a large cohort of AML M0 (N = 90) at diagnosis, we detected RUNX1 mutations in 46% of cases, with all trisomy 13 cases (n = 18) being affected. No mutations of NRAS or KIT were detected in the RUNX1-mutated group and FLT3 mutations were equally distributed between RUNX1-mutated and unmutated samples. Likewise, a high incidence of RUNX1 mutations (80%) was detected in cases with trisomy 13 from other French-American-British (FAB) subgroups (n = 20). As FLT3 is localized on chromosome 13, we hypothesized that RUNX1 mutations might cooperate with trisomy 13 in leukemogenesis by increasing FLT3 transcript levels. Quantitation of FLT3 transcript levels revealed a highly significant (P < .001) about 5-fold increase in AML with RUNX1 mutations and trisomy 13 compared with samples without trisomy 13. The results of the present study indicate that in the absence of FLT3 mutations, FLT3 overexpression might be a mechanism for FLT3 activation, which cooperates with RUNX1 mutations in leukemogenesis.","['Munich Leukemia Laboratory GmbH, Munich, Germany. frank.dicker@mll-online.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 7.,"The Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) encoding the oncogenic BCR-ABL1 kinase defines a subset of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with a particularly unfavorable prognosis. ALL cells are derived from B cell precursors in most cases and typically carry rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) variable (V) region genes devoid of somatic mutations. Somatic hypermutation is restricted to mature germinal center B cells and depends on activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID). Studying AID expression in 108 cases of ALL, we detected AID mRNA in 24 of 28 Ph(+) ALLs as compared with 6 of 80 Ph(-) ALLs. Forced expression of BCR-ABL1 in Ph(-) ALL cells and inhibition of the BCR-ABL1 kinase showed that aberrant expression of AID depends on BCR-ABL1 kinase activity. Consistent with aberrant AID expression in Ph(+) ALL, IGH V region genes and BCL6 were mutated in many Ph(+) but unmutated in most Ph(-) cases. In addition, AID introduced DNA single-strand breaks within the tumor suppressor gene CDKN2B in Ph(+) ALL cells, which was sensitive to BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibition and silencing of AID expression by RNA interference. These findings identify AID as a BCR-ABL1-induced mutator in Ph(+) ALL cells, which may be relevant with respect to the particularly unfavorable prognosis of this leukemia subset.","['Leukemia Research Program, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",,,,PMC2118573,,,,,,,,,,,

In adults, hematopoiesis occurs in bone marrow and is supported by the microenvironment. The tachykinin family of peptides regulates hematopoiesis. Tachykinins can be released in bone marrow as neurotransmitters from innervating fibers, and from resident bone marrow cells. The hematopoietic effects by tachykinins involve four tachykinin genes, Tac1-Tac4. The latter is the most recently discovered member and encodes hemokinin-1, endokinin A, endokinin B, and two orphan peptides, endokinin C, and endokinin D. The alteration of normal hematopoietic functions by the tachykinins may result in the development of various pathologies. For example, Tac1 is involved in myelofibrosis and in leukemia, both of which are dysfunction of hematopoietic stem cells. A comprehensive understanding of dysfunctions caused by the tachykinins requires further research since other cells, such as stromal cells and factors including cytokines, chemokines, and endopeptidases, are involved in a network in which the tachykinins have critical roles. Studies into the properties and functions of tachykinins, the biology of their receptors, and related molecules would provide insights into the development of aging disorders, hematopoiesis, other dysfunction, and may also lead to the discovery of novel and effective clinical therapies. Controversies on applications for hematopoietic stem cells in regenerative medicine are discussed. Despite these controversies, a detailed understanding on how the bone marrow microenvironment maintains pluripotency of hematopoietic stem cells would be useful to manipulate the system to acquire specialized cells for tissue repair.","['Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences-UMDNJ, Newark, NJ 07103, USA.']",,,,,88,,,,,,,,,,

The pivotal role of donor T cells in both anti-leukemic and anti-host reactivity of allogeneic stem cell grafts has been known since the first transplants for fatal leukemia were performed over 25 years ago. Growing understanding of the T cell-mediated GvL response has revealed the importance of host-type antigen-presenting cells and the capacity of adoptively transferred donor T cells in inducing anti-leukemic responses, and has led to a re-evaluation of the relative roles of the pre-transplant conditioning regimen and the allogeneic stem cell graft. Key advances in clinical practice such as reduced-intensity stem cell transplantation and donor lymphocyte infusions are now routinely applied and allow for the induction of potent antileukemic effects, while GvHD can to some extent be controlled. Other strategies to separate T cell-mediated antileukemic effects from GvHD are antigen-specific adoptive T cell-therapy and recipient lymphocyte infusion (RLI) and these are in an experimental stage. Importantly, a role for alloreactive natural killer cells in mediating GvL without GvHD has emerged in patient studies of MHC haplotype-mismatched alloHSCT. Finally, experimental studies indicate that naturally occurring regulatory T cells may differentially affect GvHD and GvL.","['Laboratory of Experimental Transplantation, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The spectral data of cerium(III) complexes were interpreted on the basis of comparison with the spectra of the free ligands. This analysis showed that in the Ce(III) complexes the ligands coordinated to the metal ion through both deprotonated hydroxyl groups. On the basis of the nu(CO) red shift observed, participation of the carbonyl groups in the coordination to the metal ion was also suggested. Cytotoxic screening by MTT assay was carried out.

This study examines anxiety, depression and quality of life (QOL) in a CLL cohort. METHODS: One hundred five patients recruited from a CLL research database were classified into two groups: ""watch and wait"" or active treatment. The patients completed a mail-in battery of depression, anxiety and QOL measures. RESULTS: There was no statistical difference between depression, anxiety and physical/mental QOL in ""watch and wait"" versus active-treatment groups. Patients < or =60 years reported more depression (P=.014) and worse emotional (P=.0001) and social QOL (P=.002). They also had more ""watch and wait"" anxiety (P=.052). Social and emotional QOL were similar in both newly diagnosed patients and those diagnosed >6 years ago, although physical QOL worsens with time (P=.05). CONCLUSION: Depression, anxiety and QOL are remarkably similar in ""watch and wait"" versus actively treated CLL, despite the latter group having, by definition, later stage disease. Patients < or =60 years are more depressed and have reduced emotional and social QOL. Younger ""watch and wait"" patients are more anxious. Patients diagnosed for more than 6 years have a worse physical QOL, but their social and emotional QOL are similar to those of newly diagnosed patients.","['Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10022, USA. levint@mskcc.org']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, urgent surgery may lead to high postoperative complications and mortality rates in these patients. The case presented here is of a 33-year-old Hispanic man with acute myelogenous leukemia who developed severe diffuse acute abdominal pain with positive signs of rebound tenderness, fever, and hypotension ten days after receiving reinduction chemotherapy. The patient was at his nadir, with a white blood cell count of 0.2 x 10(9)/L, platelet count of 20 x 10(9)/L, and hemoglobin of 7 g/dL. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen was suspicious for acute appendicitis. The patient underwent a laparoscopic appendectomy that revealed gangrenous appendicitis. No perioperative complications occurred. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 and his chemotherapy was continued as scheduled. Laparoscopic appendectomy may be considered a primary approach in neutropenic patients because it can be associated with less postoperative infection, hemorrhagic complications, and a lower mortality rate.","['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, Georgia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such changes are inherited albeit there are no alterations in the DNA sequence. Epigenetic regulation of gene expression is implemented by a wide repertoire of histone and DNA modifying enzymes including the acetyltransferases and deacetylases, the methyltransferases and kinases among others. Therefore, a regulation of these enzyme activities affords a tighter regulation of gene expression. Conversely, aberrant enzymatic activities lead to unregulated gene expression, resulting in several diseases such as RTS (loss of CBP HAT activity) and Spinal and Bulbar muscular atrophy (HATs and HMTases), apart from several forms of cancers, particularly myeloid leukemia (RAR-PML or RAR-PLZF fusion proteins resulting in the mistargeting of HDACs). Thus these enzymes have emerged as novel targets for the design of therapeutics. In this direction, several small molecule modulators (activators and inhibitors) of HATs, HDACs and HMTases are being reported in literature. This chapter introduces the different histone modifying enzymes involved in gene regulation, their connection to disease manifestation and focuses on the role of small molecule modulators in understanding enzyme function and also the design and the evolution of chromatin therapeutics","['Transcription and Disease Laboratory, Molecular Biology and Genetics Unit Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Jakkur, P O, Bangalore-560064, INDIA.']",,,,,160,,,,,,,,,,

This complex and tightly regulated process is largely regulated at the level of RNA polymerase II-mediated transcription. Within this process an important class of transcriptional regulators are the histone acetyltransferases (HATs), proteins that acetylate histones and non-histone substrates. While hyperacetylation of histones is generally associated with active genes, the effect of acetylation of nonhistone proteins varies between substrates resulting in for example alterations in (sub-nuclear) protein localization or protein stability. Given the central role of HATs in transcriptional regulation and other cellular processes, it may not be surprising that genetic alterations in the genes encoding HATs, resulting in aberrant forms of these regulatory proteins, have been linked with various human diseases, including congenital developmental disorders and various forms of cancer, including leukaemia. Here we will review mutations found in genes encoding human HATs and discuss the (putative) functional consequences on the function of these proteins. So far the lessons learned from naturally occurring mutations in humans have proven to be invaluable and recapitulating such genetic alterations in various experimental systems will extend our knowledge even further. This seems particularly relevant given the wide range of diseases in which acetyltransferases have been implicated and may help to open up new therapeutic avenues.","['Department of Metabolic and Endocrine Diseases, UMC Utrecht, Lundlaan 6, 3584 EA, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",,,,,192,,,,,,,,,,

Sequencing analysis of the entire coding region of KRAS and BRAF showed a de novo germline BRAF E501G (1502A-->G) mutation. Molecular diagnosis and careful observations should be considered in children with CFC syndrome because they have germline mutations in proto-oncogenes and might develop malignancy.","['Department of Pediatrics, Asahikawa Medical College, Asahikawa, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 1.,"Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is a persistent CD4+ T-lymphotropic retrovirus. Most HTLV-1-infected individuals remain asymptomatic, but a proportion develop adult T cell leukemia or inflammatory disease. It is not fully understood how HTLV-1 persists despite a strong immune response or what determines the risk of HTLV-1-associated diseases. Until recently, it has been difficult to quantify lymphocyte kinetics in humans in vivo. Here, we used deuterated glucose labeling to quantify in vivo lymphocyte dynamics in HTLV-1-infected individuals. We then used these results to address four questions. (i) What is the impact of HTLV-1 infection on lymphocyte dynamics? (ii) How does HTLV-1 persist? (iii) What is the extent of HTLV-1 expression in vivo? (iv) What features of lymphocyte kinetics are associated with HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis? We found that CD4+CD45RO+ and CD8+CD45RO+ T lymphocyte proliferation was elevated in HTLV-1-infected subjects compared with controls, with an extra 10(12) lymphocytes produced per year in an HTLV-1-infected subject. The in vivo proliferation rate of CD4+CD45RO+ cells also correlated with ex vivo viral expression. Finally, the inflammatory disease HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis was associated with significantly increased CD4+CD45RO+ cell proliferation. We suggest that there is persistent viral gene expression in vivo, which is necessary for the maintenance of the proviral load and determines HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis risk.","['Department of Immunology, Imperial College, London W2 1PG, United Kingdom. b.asquith@imperial.ac.uk']",['WT_/Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,PMC1861853,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 4.,"In this issue, Molecular Cancer Therapeutics inaugurates a new feature-The Cutting Edge: Spotlight on Clinical Response-whose objective is the rapid publication of breaking discoveries regarding target- or mechanism-based clinical responses in cancer. Targeted molecules are poised to alter the landscape of clinical cancer treatment. For example, because they can distinguish cancer cells from their normal counterparts, agents such as imatinib mesylate, a Bcr-Abl and Kit kinase inhibitor, can result in remarkable responses with minimal host toxicity in patients suffering from diseases characterized by abnormalities in the targeted kinases. Indeed, studies of imatinib mesylate in early-stage chronic myelogenous leukemia, whose hallmark is the aberrant Bcr-Abl, show response rates of more than 90%. Furthermore, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), a notoriously chemotherapy-refractory sarcoma, characterized by activating Kit kinase mutations, can show dramatic metabolic responses within days after initiation of treatment. With the wealth of new knowledge in this field, and numerous novel targeted molecules entering clinical trials, the above examples are likely to represent the tip of the iceberg. Indeed, in this issue, a paper by Senzer et al. documents, for the first time, successful use of adenoviral p53 therapy to treat a tumor in a patient with Li Fraumeni Syndrome, a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by the mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene. Some of the features of this response, such as the early disappearance of metabolic activity on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography scans, are reminiscent of those of GIST responses to imatinib. These findings have important implications for patients with this syndrome, who are prone to develop numerous tumors and often succumb at a young age. In addition, because mutations in p53 are one of the more common aberrations in cancer in general, identification of these mutations and exploration of this approach is warranted in patients with sporadic cancers. In summary, the era of ""molecular cancer therapeutics"" has begun. Even so, results in the laboratory and in animals often do not translate into salutary effects in patients. However, when they do, it is important that the information be made quickly available to the investigative community. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics believes that providing a forum for the rapid dissemination of cutting-edge findings of successful, albeit early, clinical research should stimulate further study and will ultimately benefit patients with cancer.","['Phase I Program, Division of Cancer Medicine, Unit 422, M.

In addition to their cholesterol-lowering effects, statins inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis of malignant cells in vitro, but their potential therapeutic roles in the treatment of malignancies remain to be defined. We examined the effects of statins on the growth and differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Atorvastatin and fluvastatin were found to be potent inducers of cell differentiation and apoptosis of the NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line. Such effects correlated with activation of the small G-proteins Rac1/Cdc42 and downstream engagement of the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase kinase pathway, whose function was found to be essential for the generation of proapoptotic responses. Importantly, different statins were found to enhance all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-dependent differentiation of APL blasts and reverse resistance to the antileukemic effects of ATRA. In addition, fluvastatin exhibited growth-inhibitory properties on primary bone marrow-derived leukemic progenitors from patients with AML and enhanced the suppressive effects of ATRA on leukemic progenitor colony formation. Altogether, these studies establish that statins exhibit potent antileukemic properties in vitro and raise the possibility that combinations of statins with ATRA may be an effective approach to overcome the development of ATRA resistance by the leukemic cells.","['Robert H.

Dormant tumor cells also show a progressive decrease of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) gene expression and a deregulation of the Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway due to methylation of the SOCS1 gene. Dormant tumor cells were more resistant to apoptosis induced by specific CTLs, but resistance decreased when SOCS1 expression was restored via demethylation or gene transfer. AG490 JAK2 inhibitor decreased the resistance of dormant tumor cells to CTLs, but MG132 proteasome inhibitor was effective only in SOCS1-transfected cells. Thus, SOCS1 regulation of the JAK/STAT pathways contributes to the resistance of tumor cells to CTL-mediated killing. Resistance of dormant tumor cells to apoptosis was also observed when induced by irradiation, cytarabine, or imatinib mesylate, but was reduced by SOCS1 gene transfer. This cross-resistance to apoptosis was induced by interleukin 3 (IL-3) overproduction by dormant tumor cells and was reversed with an anti-IL-3 antibody. Thus, tumor cells that remain dormant for long periods in the host in spite of a specific CTL immune response may deregulate their JAK/STAT pathways and develop cross-resistance to various treatments through an IL-3 autocrine loop. These data suggest possible new therapeutic targets to eradicate dormant tumor cells.","['INSERM, U837, Institut de Recherche sur le Cancer de Lille, Universite Lille, Lille, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these findings are incongruous with those using specimens derived directly from leukemia patients, in which GR alterations are rarely found. Consequently, mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance in the clinical setting remain largely unresolved. We present a novel paradigm of glucocorticoid resistance in childhood ALL, in which patient biopsies have been directly established as continuous xenografts in immune-deficient mice, without prior in vitro culture. We show that the GRs from six highly dexamethasone-resistant xenografts (in vitro IC(50) >10 micromol/L) exhibit no defects in ligand-induced nuclear translocation and binding to a consensus glucocorticoid response element (GRE). This finding contrasts with five commonly used leukemia cell lines, all of which exhibited defective GRE binding. Moreover, whereas the GRs of dexamethasone-resistant xenografts were transcriptionally active, as assessed by the ability to induce the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) gene, resistance was associated with failure to induce the bim gene, which encodes a proapoptotic BH3-only protein. Furthermore, the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, SU11657, completely reversed dexamethasone resistance in a xenograft expressing functional GR, indicating that pharmacologic reversal of glucocorticoid resistance in childhood ALL is achievable.","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In particular, an impaired regulation of the Akt/mTOR axis has been strongly implicated in mechanisms related to neoplastic transformation, through enhancement of cell proliferation and survival. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of heterogeneous hematopoietic stem cell disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and by a high risk of evolution into acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The pathogenesis of the MDS evolution into AML is still unclear, although some recent studies indicate that aberrant activation of survival signaling pathways could be involved. In this investigation, done by means of immunofluorescent staining, we report an activation of the Akt/mTOR pathway in high-risk MDS patients. Interestingly, not only mTOR was activated but also its downstream targets, 4E-binding protein 1 and p70 ribosomal S6 kinase. Treatment with the selective mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, significantly increased apoptotic cell death of CD33(+) (but not CD33(-)) cells from high-risk MDS patients. Rapamycin was ineffective in cells from healthy donors or low-risk MDS. Moreover, incubation of high-risk MDS patient CD34(+) cells with rapamycin decreased the in vitro clonogenic capability of these cells. In contrast, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, did not significantly affect the clonogenic activity of high-risk MDS cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the Akt/mTOR pathway is critical for cell survival and proliferation in high-risk MDS patients. Therefore, this signaling network could become an interesting therapeutic target for treating more advanced MDS cases.","['Cell Signaling Laboratory, Dipartimento di Scienze Anatomiche Umane e Fisiopatologia dell\'Apparato Locomotore, Sezione di Anatomia and Istituto di Ematologia ed Oncologia Medica ""L. e A.

In vitro, after treatment of 4T1 cells with 500 nmol/L CDDO-Me for 2 h, we found (a) inactivation of STAT3, (b) inactivation of Src and Akt, (c) 4-fold reduction of c-Myc mRNA levels, (d) accumulation of cells in G(2)-M cell cycle phase, (e) abrogation of invasive growth of 4T1 cells, and (f) lack of apoptosis induction. In in vivo studies, CDDO-Me completely eliminated 4T1 breast cancer growth and lung metastases induced by 4T1 cells in mice when treatment started 1 day after tumor implantation and significantly inhibited tumor growth when started after 5 days. In vivo studies also indicated that splenic mature dendritic cells were restored after CDDO-Me treatment. In summary, these data suggest that CDDO-Me may have therapeutic potential in breast cancer therapy, in part, through inactivation of STAT3.","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

Epub 2007 May 4.,"Oncogenic activation loop KIT mutations are observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and systemic mastocytosis (SM); however, unlike the KIT juxtamembrane mutants, the activation loop mutants are insensitive to imatinib mesylate. Furthermore, as prior studies primarily used heterologous cell lines, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying oncogenic KIT-induced transformation in primary cells is poorly understood. We demonstrate that expression of KITD814V in primary hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSC/Ps) and mast cell progenitors (MCps) induces constitutive KIT autophosphorylation, supports ligand-independent hyperproliferation, and promotes promiscuous cooperation with multiple cytokines. Genetic disruption of p85 alpha, the regulatory subunit of class IA lipid kinase phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K), but not of p85 beta, or genetic disruption of the hematopoietic cell-specific Rho GTPase, Rac2, normalizes KITD814V-induced ligand-independent hyperproliferation. Additionally, deficiency of p85 alpha or Rac2 corrects the promiscuous hyperproliferation observed in response to multiple cytokines in both KITD814V-expressing HSC/Ps and MCps. Treatment of KITD814V-expressing HSC/Ps with a Rac inhibitor (NC23766) or with rapamycin showed a dose-dependent suppression in ligand-independent growth. Taken together, our results identify p85 alpha and Rac2 as potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of KITD814V-bearing AML and SM.","['Department of Pediatrics, Herman B Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']","['R01 HL075816/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL077177/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082981/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1975845,,,,,,,,,,,

An 89-year-old man with AML secondary to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and a poor performance status (4) underwent treatment with methylprednisolone (mPSL) (125 mg/body), which resulted in a remarkable reduction of blast cells in the peripheral blood. Neutrophil counts were maintained or increased. Although the suppression was of short duration, mPSL was useful for disease control because it selectively reduced blast counts while maintaining the patient's performance status. In vivo and in vitro findings suggested that mPSL had direct inhibitory actions on the survival of blast cells. On the basis of this experience, we gave the same mPSL dose to other elderly patients with MDS/AML (n=5) or AML-M4 (n=1) who had a poor performance status (3 or higher) and appeared unable to tolerate standard cytotoxic chemotherapies. Selective and significant blast cell reduction was observed in 4 of the 5 patients with MDS/AML, whereas no effects were seen in the AML patient. Although our experience is limited, these findings may provide a clue to understanding the mechanisms regulating the survival of blast cells of MDS/AML and indicate that mPSL may provide a benefit to a subset of these patients.","['Internal Medicine, Matsusaka Chuo General Hospital, Mie, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used this novel method to prospectively quantify and characterize tumor-reactive NK cells in patients undergoing myeloablative or nonmyeloablative conditioning and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Degranulation of NK cells in the peripheral blood of 34 patients after HSCT (day +30, day +90) was determined by evaluating CD107a expression after coincubation of the cells with tumor targets. The percentage of degranulating NK cells was higher after nonmyeloablative conditioning than after myeloablative conditioning (P<.001), indicating a higher activation state and increased antitumor activity of NK cells after nonmyeloablative conditioning. We were able to analyze NK cell subsets separately and found that CD56bright NK cells following HSCT are functionally different from CD56bright NK cells in healthy donors, as indicated by a high percentage of degranulating NK cells in response to tumor targets in patients after HSCT. The CD107a assay is a new and feasible method to quantify and characterize tumor-reactive NK cells after HSCT. Using this method, we found that NK cells had high antitumor cytotoxic activity after nonmyeloablative conditioning, which may contribute to the effectiveness of nonmyeloablative conditioning.","['Department of Hematology, Charite, Campus Benjamin Franklin, Berlin, Germany. olaf.penack@charite.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tumor suppressor PTEN plays a pivotal role in the growth of human cancer cells. We investigated whether costimulation of PPARgamma and RAR could synergistically up-regulate PTEN in human leukemia cells and consequently potentiate the inhibition of growth and cell cycle progression of these cells. We found that overexpression of PTEN with the adenoviral vector Ad/PTEN caused growth arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle of HL-60 cells. HL-60 cells treated with either a PPARgamma ligand (ciglitazone) or a RAR ligand (all-trans retinoic acid [ATRA]) up-regulated PTEN in HL-60 cells. The 2 compounds in combination showed synergistic effects on PTEN expression at the protein and messenger RNA levels. Moreover, the combination of ciglitazone and ATRA synergistically reduced cell growth rates and cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. Our results suggest that, PPARgamma and RAR play an important role in controlling the growth of leukemia cells via the up-regulation of PTEN.","['Department of Biochemistry, Chonbuk National University Medical School, Jeonju, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We detected a nonsense mutation, C7249T (resulting in Q2417X, where X is a termination codon) in the PEST domain of NOTCH1 in an ATL patient and detected a 3-bp deletion (positions 7234-7236) that resulted in deletion of a proline codon at codon 2412 in the PEST domain of NOTCH1 in a patient with a T-NHL, peripheral T-cell lymphoma-unspecified (PTCL-u). We also analyzed the expression of NOTCH1 target genes (HES1, CCND1, and MYC), all of which were expressed in the sample of the PTCL-u patient with the NOTCH1 mutation, but found only MYC to be expressed in the sample from the ATL patient. These findings suggest that nonsense mutation in the PEST domain in the ATL case was associated with NOTCH1 signaling through a pathway different from that for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Although NOTCH1 mutation occurs infrequently in mature T-cell leukemia/lymphoma, NOTCH1 may be involved in leukemogenesis associated with various forms of T-cell leukemia/lymphoma rather than only with T-ALL.","['Department of Molecular Hematology and Oncology, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Graduate School of Medical Science, Kyoto, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The new derivatives were designed by replacing the benzene ring of the prototype 1 with both aromatic and aliphatic, monocyclic and polycyclic rings (compounds 3a-i), or by inserting a number of substituents on the methylene linker of 1 (compounds 4a-l). Compounds 3a-i and 4a-l were active at sub-micromolar level against the maize deacetylases HD1-B (class I), HD1-A (class II), and HD2. Tested at 5 microM against human HDAC1 and HDAC4, 3b, 4a, and 4j showed significant HDAC1 inhibition, whereas on HDAC4 only 4a was highly effective. On the human leukemia U937 cell line, the same compounds did not alter the cell cycle phases and failed in inducing apoptosis. However, they displayed granulocytic differentiation at 5 microM, with 3b being the most potent (76% CD11c positive cells). Tested to evaluate their effects on histone H3 and alpha-tubulin acetylation, 3b and 4a showed high H3 acetylation, whereas 4a and 4b were the most potent with alpha-tubulin as a substrate.","['Istituto Pasteur-Fondazione Cenci Bolognetti, Dipartimento di Studi Farmaceutici, Universita degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza, Piazzale A.

Purified peripheral blood neoplastic cells of B-CLL patients migrated poorly on laminins-111,-411,-511, but showed pronounced motility on laminin (LM)-332 in a high percentage of cases. B-CLL cell motility on LM-332 was mediated by the alpha3beta1 integrin and was preferentially observed in cells carrying a mutated IgV(H) gene profile. Within normal lymph nodes, LM-332 was circumscribed around blood vessels and to areas corresponding to marginal zones, where it was deposited in a pattern reminiscent of reticular fibers. Conversely, in B-CLL involved lymph nodes, a positive LM-332 reticular mesh was diffusely evident, throughout the disrupted nodal architecture. In the present study we identified LM-332 as a crucial motility-promoting factor for B-CLL lymphocytes and as a potential constituent favoring the dissemination of B-CLL lymphocytes through vascular basement membranes and possibly lymph node compartments.","['Experimental Oncology 2, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Aviano (PN), Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study the antiproliferative effects of betanin, a principle betacyanin pigment, isolated from the fruits of Opuntia ficus-indica, was evaluated on human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (K562). The results show dose and time dependent decrease in the proliferation of K562 cells treated with betanin with an IC(50) of 40 microM. Further studies involving scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed the apoptotic characteristics such as chromatin condensation, cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing. Agarose electrophoresis of genomic DNA of cells treated with betanin showed fragmentation pattern typical for apoptotic cells. Flow cytometric analysis of cells treated with 40 microM betanin showed 28.4% of cells in sub G0/G1 phase. Betanin treatment to the cells also induced the release of cytochrome c into the cytosol, poly (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage, down regulation Bcl-2, and reduction in the membrane potentials. Confocal microscopic studies on the cells treated with betanin suggest the entry of betanin into the cells. These studies thus demonstrate that betanin induces apoptosis in K562 cells through the intrinsic pathway and is mediated by the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol, and PARP cleavage. The antiproliferative effects of betanin add further value to the nutritional characteristics of the fruits of O. ficus-indica.","['School of Life Sciences, University of Hyderabad, Hyderabad 500 046, India.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 7.,"Classifiers have been widely used to select an optimal subset of feature genes from microarray data for accurate classification of cancer samples and cancer-related studies. However, the classification rules derived from most classifiers are complex and difficult to understand in biological significance. How to solve this problem is a new challenge. In this paper, a new classification model based on gene pair is proposed to address the problem. The experimental results on several microarray data demonstrate that the proposed classification model performs well in finding a large number of excellent feature gene pairs. A 100% LOOCV classification accuracy can be achieved using a single classification model based on optimal feature gene pair or combining multiple top-ranked classification models. Using the proposed method, we successfully identified important cancer-related genes that had been validated in previous biological studies while they were not discovered by the other methods.","['Department of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology, Harbin 150001, China. jieleehz@yahoo.com.cn']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 30.,"Pathways adopted by developing cancer cells for evasion of cellular surveillance mechanism deserve attention for therapeutic exploitation as well as for better prognosis. A novel mitotic kinase, PDZ-binding kinase or PBK, which is upregulated in a variety of neoplasms including hematological malignancies, has been the focus of our attention with a goal to understand its role in malignant conversion and to examine as a possible new therapeutic target in disparate types of cancer. Earlier, we reported that PBK expression was downregulated during macrophage differentiation of HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells, during doxorubicin-induced growth arrest in G2/M phase and that PBK was regulated by cell cycle-specific transcription factors E2F and CREB/ATF. Here, we demonstrate that HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells become adapted to doxorubicin-induced DNA damage checkpoint upon ectopic expression of a phosphomimetic mutant of PBK as indicated by the accumulation of polyploid cells. Aberrant entry into the mitotic phase by these cells is suggested by the appearance of a mitotic phase-specific marker, MPM-2. We propose that the effect is due to downregulation of p53 caused by direct physical interaction with PBK as detected by both a biochemical means as well as by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Together, our studies provide a plausible explanation for the role of PBK augmenting tumor cell growth following transient appearance in different types of progenitor cells in vivo as reported.","['Greenebaum Cancer Center, University of Maryland School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA. anandi@som.umaryland.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 3.,"Similar to other urban areas where food and shelter are abundant, the zoological garden of Rio de Janeiro has dealt for years with a colony of feral or semi-feral domestic cats. A survey was conducted during 2002-2004 as a follow-up to a previous study in 2001 of the cat colony to identify pathogens circulating among the population and to annually follow the status of the cats to analyze morbidity coefficients and associations among infections and infestations identified in the colony. During the 3 years of the present study, 75 cats were sampled at least once, including 44 that were caught and examined only once, 14 that were examined twice, and 17 that were examined three times. For each cat that was caught, records were kept regarding sex, age, general health, and the presence of ectoparasites. Each year, a blood sample was taken for hematologic testing, platelet count, hemoparasite detection, antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, and retrovirus detection. Blood counts were within normal range for the majority of cats tested. Feline immunodeficiency virus, fleas, and lice were detected in all years; however, incidence rates for each of these varied significantly throughout the years. Prevalence of Cytauxzoon spp., Mycoplasma spp., T. gondii infections were variable among the 3 years, although differences were not significant. Prevalence of feline leukemia virus increased significantly over the 3 years. Mycoplasma spp. and flea infestations were significantly associated, but no other associations among the pathogens were detected. Over the 3 years, the rate of new cat introductions decreased, and the pathogens showed a tendency to disseminate throughout the colony; however, there was virtually no evidence of clinically detectable disease. Therefore, it seems that stabilizing the population by a judicious control program facilitated the distribution of the pathogens throughout the colony, while the general well-being of the cats was not seriously affected.","['Fundacao RIOZOO, Parque da Quinta da Boa Vista s/n, Sao Cristovao, RJ, Brazil. fma@centroin.com.br']",,,,PMC7130795,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, selective non-prostanoid IP agonist, BMY 45778 prevents PMA induced megakaryocytopoeisis in HEL cells similarly, while prostaglandin E(2) and specific EP(3) agonist sulprostone have no effect. Thus, IP receptor is involved. Furthermore, adenylate cyclase activator forskolin and cAMP analog dibutyryl-cAMP also prevented PMA induced megakaryocytopoeisis in HEL cells.

One possible explanation for the paucity of thrombotic events in these patients may be the presence of the ecto-nucleotidase CD39/NTDPase-1 on the surface of the malignant cells in CLL. CD39 is the major promoter of platelet inhibition in vivo via its metabolism of ADP to AMP. We hypothesize that if CD39 is observed on CLL cells, then patients with CLL may be relatively protected against platelet aggregation and recruitment and that CD39 may have other effects on CLL, including modulation of the disease, via its metabolism of ATP. METHODS: Normal and malignant lymphocytes were isolated from whole blood from patients with CLL and healthy volunteers. Enzyme activity was measured via radio-TLC assay and expression via FACS. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR for CD39 splice variants and platelet function tests were performed on several samples. RESULTS: Functional assays demonstrated that ADPase and ATPase activities were much higher in CLL cells than in total lymphocytes from the normal population on a per cell basis (p-value < 0.00001). CD39 activity was elevated in stage 0-2 CLL compared to stage 3-4 (p < 0.01). FACS of lymphocytes demonstrated CD39 expression on > 90% of normal and malignant B-lymphocytes and approximately 8% of normal T-lymphocytes. RT-PCR showed increased full length CD39 and splice variant 1.5, but decreased variant 1.3 in CLL cells. Platelet function tests showed inhibition of platelet activation and recruitment to ADP by CLL cells. CONCLUSION: CD39 is expressed and active on CLL cells. Enzyme activity is higher in earlier stages of CLL and decreased enzyme activity may be associated with worsening disease. These results suggest that CD39 may play a role in the pathogenesis of malignancy and protect CLL patients from thrombotic events.","['Research Service, Veterans Affairs New York Harbor Healthcare System, New York, NY 10010, USA. dpulte1@yahoo.com']","['P01 HL046403/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS041462/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL047073/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 46403/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 HL047073/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 47073/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS 41462/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1885243,,,,,,,,,,,['NLM: Original DateCompleted: 20070813']

Viral latency is invoked by a protein known as plasma blocking factor (PBF) that is found in both bovine and human plasma. We report here on pathways that mediate latency in the presence of PBF. Reporter-gene constructs driven by the promoters of 6 retroviruses were used to measure the production of chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) in cell lines cultured with or without defibrinated bovine plasma. Plasma inhibited CAT production only in constructs containing an NFkappaB-binding element proximal to the initiation site (BLV, human immunodeficiency virus, and human T-cell leukemia virus). The promoters of Bovine immunodeficiency virus, Feline immunodeficiency virus, or Feline leukemia virus were not inhibited in the presence of bovine plasma. Using gel mobility shift assays, we demonstrated that activation of viral transcription upon stimulation with phorbol esters and ionomycin was mediated through the NFkappaB element and that this was abrogated in the presence of plasma. Furthermore, analysis of individual NFkappaB proteins in nuclear extracts of mononuclear cells or Jurkat cells showed that all 5 members of the NFkappaB family were upregulated in response to stimulation, but only p52 was significantly downregulated in the presence of bovine plasma. Thus, we infer that plasma effects are mediated through interference with either p52 translocation to the nucleus or p52 synthesis.","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario. mvandenh@uwo.ca']",,,,PMC1829189,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique based on adapter-ligation mediated allele-specific amplification (ALM-ASA) is simple, inexpensive and especially useful for multiplex single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyping. The purpose of this study was to examine the genetic markers associated with acute leukemia from multiple SNPs of MPO found in Chinese Han population. A case-control study was conducted, with 135 patients with adult acute leukemia and 187 cancer-free subjects as a control group. Nine SNPs in promoter and exons were selected that were markers related to gene function and risk of leukemia development. The multiplex PCR technique based on ALM-ASA was used to detect multiple SNP genotypes. The accuracy of ALM-ASA was tested by sequence and PCRrestriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) genotyping analysis. No polymorphisms were found at -1468T > C, -1053T > C, 958C > T, 967C > A, 1033 T > C. A marked linkage disequilibrium was found among -1816, -586, and -463 genotypes. Three haplotypes were constructed. SNP and haplotypes analysis showed the frequency of the MPO -463G > A mutant genotypes (G/A+A/A) was significantly less in cancer cases. The results of sequence and PCR-RFLP yielded results similar to ALM-ASA. Data suggest that MPO G-463A mutant genotypes may be associated with a reduced risk of acute leukemia development due to diminished activation of carcinogens. MPO G-463A variant may possess a protective genetic marker against acute leukemia in the Chinese Han population.","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Health Science, School of Public Health, Southeast University, Nanjing, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The JWA gene also produced a marked effect during chemical-induced multidirectional differentiations of primary and human myeloid leukemia cells. Recently, a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon2 of the JWA gene (454CA) was identified that may play a role in risk of bladder cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between the 454CA (NM_006407.2) in JWA exon2 variants and risk of leukemia in a hospital-based case-control study of 202 leukemia patients and 289 cancer-free controls. Results indicated that 454A allele was found to associate with significantly increased risk of leukemia, although the 454CA is a synonymous polymorphism in coding region of the JWA gene. In conclusion, the potentially functional genetic polymorphism 454CA of the JWA gene appears to contribute to the risk of multiple kinds of leukemia in a south Chinese population.","[""Department of Molecular Cell Biology and Toxicology, Jiangsu Provincial Key Laboratories of Human Functional Genomics and Applied Toxicology, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University.

Epub 2007 May 4.,"The protective effects of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) against cell killing by (137)Cs gamma-rays were investigated in XRCC4-deficient cell line M10, XRCC4-complemented M10 and the parental mouse leukemia cell line L5178Y. Cell survival was determined by the colony-forming ability. M10 cells were more sensitive to gamma-ray-induced cell death than L5178Y and complemented M10 cells. Cell survival was increased in both M10 and L5178Y in the presence of DMSO. However, estimation of the DMSO-protectable fraction revealed a smaller protectable fraction for M10 cells than for L5178Y cells, indicating that indirect effects contributed in a smaller extent to the cytotoxicity in M10 than that in L5178Y. This effect is due to XRCC4 deficiency, since transfection of XRCC4 cDNA into M10 cells restored the radioprotective effects of DMSO to the level seen in L5178Y. In M10 cells, the killing effects of high LET radiation (Auger electrons from (125)I-antipyrine, carbon ions with an LET of 166 keV microm(-1)) were similar to those of low LET radiation ((137)Cs gamma-rays, characteristic X-rays from (125)I-bovine serum albumin). We discuss that lethal lesions produced by indirect actions in L5178Y and XRCC4-complemented M10 cells may differ, at least in part, from DNA double-strand breaks repairable by non-homologous end joining.","['Tokyo Metropolitan Industrial Technology Research Institute, Komazawa Office, 2-11-1, Fukazawa, Tokyo, Japan. miyazaki.noriyuki@iri-tokyo.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used TALL-104 human leukemic CTLs as a model. Our results confirm an earlier report (Dutz, J. P., Fruman, D. A., Burakoff, S. J., and Bierer, B. E. (1993) J. Immunol. 150, 2591-2598) that immunosuppressive drugs inhibit exocytosis in CTLs stimulated either via the T cell receptor (TCR) or via TCR-independent soluble agents. Of the two recently reported alternate targets of immunosuppressive drugs (Matsuda, S., Shibasaki, F., Takehana, K., Mori, H., Nishida, E., and Koyasu, S. (2000) EMBO Rep. 1, 428-434 and Matsuda, S., and Koyasu, S. (2000) Immunopharmacology 47, 119-125), JNK is not required for lytic granule exocytosis, but we were not able to exclude a role for P38. Exocytosis could be inhibited by expressing GFP fused to a C-terminal fragment of CAIN (cabin 1), but not by expressing VIVIT-GFP. Finally, expressing either full-length or truncated constitutively active mutant calcineurin A enhanced lytic granule exocytosis. However, the mutant calcineurin was unable to support exocytosis when cells were stimulated in the absence of Ca2+ influx. Taken together, our results support the idea that activation of calcineurin is required for lytic granule exocytosis but suggest that it is not the sole Ca2+-dependent step.","['Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06268-3125.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06268-3125.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06268-3125.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06268-3125.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06268-3125.

The easily applicable staging systems described by Rai and Binet decades ago have represented one of the decisive obstacles against the proper development of clinical decision making as they correlated well with survival data in more advanced diseases, but could not differentiate progressive versus stable diseases of low stages. This might have been responsible for the development of the ""watch and wait"" clinical strategy potentially resulting in the lack of therapeutical intervention in early due time. Application of recent research data on gene expression, molecular biological, cytogenetic and phenotypic analysis of the malignancy can provide the opportunity of stratifying the disease - although with different predictive value - at the onset or early stages. All these represent a new challenge for the diagnostics and expose important aspects in the management of this work. The author reviews the theory and practice of these diagnostic approaches with special emphasis on the immunoglobulin heavy chain mutational status, expression of CD-38 and ZAP-70 markers as well as the significance of karyotyping and interphase cytogenetics. In the light of current data a putative pathogenetic scheme is outlined implying the fundamental recognition that all individual forms of this heterogeneous disease arise from similar and unique polyreactive - autoreactive B-cell clones which underlies the key role of autoimmunization in the pathogenesis of the disease.","['Pecsi Tudomanyegyetem, Altalanos Orvostudomanyi Kar, Patologiai Intezet, Pecs. titkar@pathology.pote.hu']",,,,,60,,Kronikus limfoid leukemia: autoimmun betegseg?

Accordingly, both are potential therapeutic targets in inflammatory diseases of the joints. Several LIF antagonists have been developed. They have the capacity to inhibit the biologic activities of not only LIF but also other interleukin-6 (IL-6) subfamily cytokines, including OSM. Both LIF and OSM share the same receptor, which is part of a cytokine receptor super family in which the glycoprotein 130 (gp130) subunit is a common constituent. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antagonistic potentials of two LIF mutants, LIF05 and MH35-BD. Both are mutant forms of human LIF with reduced affinity for gp130 and greater LIF receptor (LIFR) binding affinity. The results, using Ba/F3 cell proliferation assay, acute-phase protein (haptoglobin) induction analysis in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, a porcine cartilage glycosaminoglycan release assessment for proteoglycan degradation, and a collagen release assay, show that these antagonists inhibit relevant LIF, OSM, and other IL-6 subfamily cytokines in vitro albeit with differential potencies and have, therefore, therapeutic potential for treatment of RA and perhaps other diseases.","['Department of Pharmaceutical Biology, Victorian College of Pharmacy, Monash University, Parkville, Victoria 3051, Melbourne, Australia. jalal.jazayeri@vcp.monash.edu.au']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relative age-standardized ratio (RASR) is a new measure that takes ascertainment bias of registration into account. RASR is calculated from the ASR for each cancer divided by the ASR for leukemia. Leukemia was chosen as the reference because its ASR is rather constant over time in valid registries. The adjusted relative age-standardized rate (ARASR with same unit as ASR) is calculated by multiplying the RASR for a specific cancer in a particular year by the sum of ASRs of that cancer over the years for which a trend is being determined and then dividing result by the sum of RASRs of the cancer for those years. Two likely assumptions are behind use of ARASR, first, constant ASR of leukemia over time, second, if under/over-registration occurs, it happens for all cancers to the same extent (random under/over-reporting). Using the ARASR with empirical data of valid Finnish and SEER cancer registries proved that trend of ASRs for each cancer is almost equal to its ARASR. Using trends of ARASRs instead of ASRs in a registry with incomplete data collection in first years of registration demonstrated more realistic results. In conclusion, the ARASR is more accurate than the ASR for studying cancer incidence trends in registries with incomplete reporting. ARASRs in different countries or different times are comparable since they are age-standardized. Moreover, comparison between trends of ASRs and ARASRs can be used as a test for validity of registration.","['Tampere School of Public Health, FIN-33014, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland.

Children in developing countries sometimes live very close to such structures and we have registered several patients with acute leukaemias appearing in clusters. In the present study we have analyzed 60 consecutively diagnosed patients with acute leukaemias, and 59 matched controls in a provincial capital city in North-Western Iran. After provision of consent, a detailed form was filled in, and a visit to the present (or previous) residential areas of both groups was arranged. The locations of the very high voltage power lines (123, 230, 400 kilo volts), were noted in each area, if present, and their distances from the houses under study were detected. The expected intensities of the Magnetic Fields (B) were calculated having the mean intensity of the electrical current and other line characteristics, by means of relevant equations. Fourteen patients in the case group (23.5%) were living near the high voltage power lines in distances < or = 500 meters. (Mean B = 0.6 microTeslas, microT). In the control group at the same distance, the figure was 2 children (3.3%) (Mean B = 0.35 microT). Statistically, the likelihood of leukaemia was increased considerably in this distance (Odds ratio (OR) = 8.67, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.74- 58.4, P value= 0.001). On the other hand 15 pts (25 %) in the leukaemia group were experiencing Magnetic fields above 0.45 microT in comparison to 5 in the control group ( 8.5% )(OR = 3.60, 95% CI = 1.11-12.39, P = 0.01). More children in developing countries like Iran live close to very high voltage lines, and they experience relatively more harmful effects from the Magnetic Fields, in comparison with children in developed countries. Residence near very high voltage overhead power lines, in distances < or = 500 meters, and Magnetic Fields >0.45 microT, should be considered a risk factor for the pathogenesis of acute leukaemias in children.","[""The Department of Haematology/ Oncology, Children's Hospital, Tabriz Medical Sciences University, Tabriz, Iran. hpourfeizi@tbzmed.ac.ir""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to analyze the prevalence and the biologic and clinical significance of leukemic involvement in a series of patients with MCL. METHODS: Leukemic expression was assessed by conventional morphology and flow cytometry (FC) in 48 patients. In addition, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) was performed in 27 patients. RESULTS: At diagnosis, 44 patients (92%) had evidence of leukemic expression by FC, including 8 patients (17%) without morphologically apparent leukemic involvement. Moreover, a lymphocyte count > or =5 x 10(9)/L was observed in 25 cases (52%). The most frequent imbalances detected by CGH were gains of 3q, 7p, 8q, 9q, 12q, and 13q, and losses of 13q, 1p, 9p, 11q, 10p, 17p, 6q, 8p, and 9q. Using a cutoff of 5 x 10(9)/L lymphocytes, cases with lymphocytosis more frequently presented with gains of 3q (P = .02), losses of 10p (P = .05), a low response rate (P = .04), and a short survival (P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Leukemic expression at diagnosis detected by FC was found to be highly frequent in this series of patients with MCL. Although morphologically apparent leukemic expression was not associated with specific chromosomal alterations detected by CGH, a lymphocyte count > or =5 x 10(9)/L was correlated with particular genetic abnormalities and a poor outcome.","['Department of Hematology, Hospital Clinic, University of Barcelona, IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain.']",,,,,,,,['Copyright 2007 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,

Clustering of genes can exhibit functional relationships between genes; clustering of samples on the other hand is important for finding e.g. disease subtypes, relevant patient groups for stratification or related treatments. Usually this is done by first filtering the genes for high-variance under the assumption that they carry most of the information needed for separating different sample groups. If this assumption is violated, important groupings in the data might be lost. Furthermore, classical clustering methods do not facilitate the biological interpretation of the results. Therefore, we propose to methodologically integrate the clustering algorithm with prior biological information. This is different from other approaches as knowledge about classes of genes can be directly used to ease the interpretation of the results and possibly boost clustering performance. Our approach computes dendrograms that resemble decision trees with gene classes used to split the data at each node which can help to find biologically meaningful differences between the sample groups. We have tested the proposed method both on simulated and real data and conclude its usefulness as a complementary method, especially when assumptions of few differentially expressed genes along with an informative mapping of genes to different classes are met.","['Max Planck Institute for Molecular Plant Physiology, Am Muhlenberg 1, 14476 Golm, Germany. redestig@mpimp-golm.mpg.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Zap-70(high) and Zap-70(low) B-CLL samples displayed similar levels of surface death receptor TRAIL-R2, recombinant TRAIL induced cytotoxicity only in a subset of Zap-70(low) B-CLL samples while Zap-70(high) were completely resistant to TRAIL. The gene expression profiling was next analyzed in all B-CLL samples treated with either chlorambucil or recombinant TRAIL. While chlorambucil up-regulated the steady-state mRNA levels of known p53 target genes, such as PUMA, Fas/CD95 and MDM2 in all B-CLL samples examined, it significantly down-regulated survivin in Zap-70(low) but not in Zap-70(high). On the other hand, recombinant TRAIL up-regulated the expression of several cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-1alpha, IL-8), which have been involved in promoting B-CLL cell survival. In particular, TRAIL selectively up-regulated IL-1beta in Zap-70(low) B-CLL samples, while it markedly and selectively up-regulated its own mRNA and that of cyclooxigenase-2 (COX-2) in Zap-70(high). Taken together, our findings suggest that a significant expression of Zap-70 modulate the response of B-CLL to TRAIL, which might represents an initial step in the pathogenesis of B-CLL.","['Department of Morphology and Embryology, Human Anatomy Section, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy. secchier@mail.umbi.umd.edu']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

It is not clear whether these two epigenetic errors are mechanistically linked or occur independently. This study was performed to determine the relationship between DNA hypomethylation, hypermethylation and microsatellite instability in cancer. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined 61 cancer cell lines and 60 colorectal carcinomas and their adjacent tissues using LINE-1 bisulfite-PCR as a surrogate for global demethylation. Colorectal carcinomas with sporadic microsatellite instability (MSI), most of which are due to a CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP) and associated MLH1 promoter methylation, showed in average no difference in LINE-1 methylation between normal adjacent and cancer tissues. Interestingly, some tumor samples in this group showed increase in LINE-1 methylation. In contrast, MSI-showed a significant decrease in LINE-1 methylation between normal adjacent and cancer tissues (P<0.001). Microarray analysis of repetitive element methylation confirmed this observation and showed a high degree of variability in hypomethylation between samples. Additionally, unsupervised hierarchical clustering identified a group of highly hypomethylated tumors, composed mostly of tumors without microsatellite instability. We extended LINE-1 analysis to cancer cell lines from different tissues and found that 50/61 were hypomethylated compared to peripheral blood lymphocytes and normal colon mucosa. Interestingly, these cancer cell lines also exhibited a large variation in demethylation, which was tissue-specific and thus unlikely to be resultant from a stochastic process. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Global hypomethylation is partially reversed in cancers with microsatellite instability and also shows high variability in cancer, which may reflect alternative progression pathways in cancer.","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.

Epub 2007 May 3.,"Programmed cell death plays an important role in erythropoiesis under physiological and pathological conditions. In this study, we show that the Notch/RBPjkappa signaling pathway induces erythroid apoptosis in different hematopoietic tissues, including yolk sac and bone marrow as well as in murine erythroleukemia cells. In RBPjkappa(-/-) yolk sacs, erythroid cells have a decreased rate of cell death that results in increased number of Ter119(+) cells. A similar effect is observed when Notch activity is abrogated by incubation with the gamma-secretase inhibitors, DAPT or L685,458. We demonstrate that incubation with Jagged1-expressing cells has a proapoptotic effect in erythroid cells from adult bone marrow that is prevented by blocking Notch activity. Finally, we show that the sole expression of the activated Notch1 protein is sufficient to induce apoptosis in hexametilene-bisacetamide-differentiating murine erythroleukemia cells. Together these results demonstrate that Notch regulates erythroid homeostasis by inducing apoptosis.","['Centre Oncologia Molecular, IDIBELL-Institut de Recerca Oncologica, Hospitalet, Barcelona, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The analyzed groups were a t-MDS/AML patients group (n=81) and a matched control group (n=64) treated similarly, and they did not develop t-MDS/AML. We found no significant differences when the groups were compared globally. However, when analysis was carried out according to the primary neoplasia involved, a significant association was observed between the MTHFR haplotype (single nucleotide polymorphisms 677 and 1298) and the risk of developing t-MDS/AML in the breast cancer patients group (P=0.016) and cyclophosphamide-treated hematological disease group (P=0.005). Risk haplotype was different for each case, corresponding to the 677T1298A haplotype after breast cancer treatment and the 677C1298C haplotype after hematological malignancy treatment.

However, nucleic acid amplification techniques are prone to variations which limit the reliability of real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) for clinical decision making, highlighting the need for standardization of assays and reporting of minimal residual disease (MRD) data. We evaluated a lyophilized preparation of a leukemic cell line (K562) as a potential quality control reagent. This was found to be relatively stable, yielding comparable respective levels of ABL, GUS and BCR-ABL transcripts as determined by RQ-PCR before and after accelerated degradation experiments as well as following 5 years storage at -20 degrees C. Vials of freeze-dried cells were sent at ambient temperature to 22 laboratories on four continents, with RQ-PCR analyses detecting BCR-ABL transcripts at levels comparable to those observed in primary patient samples. Our results suggest that freeze-dried cells can be used as quality control reagents with a range of analytical instrumentations and could enable the development of urgently needed international standards simulating clinically relevant levels of MRD.","['1National Institute of Biological Standards and Controls, South Mimms, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesize that ALDH activity in AML might be correlated with the presence of LSC. Fifty-eight bone marrow (BM) samples were collected from AML (n=43), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=8) and normal cases (n=7). In 14 AML cases, a high SSC(lo)ALDH(br) cell population was identified (ALDH(+)AML) (median: 14.89%, range: 5.65-48.01%), with the majority of the SSC(lo)ALDH(br) cells coexpressing CD34(+). In another 29 cases, there was undetectable (n=23) or rare (< or =5%) (n=6) SSC(lo)ALDH(br) population (ALDH(-)AML). Among other clinicopathologic variables, ALDH(+)AML was significantly associated with adverse cytogenetic abnormalities. CD34(+) BM cells from ALDH(+)AML engrafted significantly better in NOD/SCID mice (ALDH(+)AML: injected bone 21.11+/-9.07%; uninjected bone 1.52+/-0.75% vs ALDH(-)AML: injected bone 1.77+/-1.66% (P=0.05); uninjected bone 0.23+/-0.23% (P=0.03)) with the engrafting cells showing molecular and cytogenetic aberrations identical to the original clones. Normal BM contained a small SSC(lo)ALDH(br) population (median: 2.92%, range: 0.92-5.79%), but none of the ALL cases showed this fraction. In conclusion, SSC(lo)ALDH(br) cells in ALDH(+)AML might denote primitive LSC and confer an inferior prognosis in patients.","['Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 3.,"Hematological changes induced by various stress stimuli are accompanied by replacement of the primary acetylcholinesterase (AChE) 3' splice variant acetylcholinesterase-S (AChE-S) with the myelopoietic acetylcholinesterase-R (AChE-R) variant. To search for putative acetylcholinesterase-S interactions with hematopoietic pathways, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen. The transcriptional co-repressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) was identified as a protein partner of the AChE-S C terminus. In erythroleukemic K562 cells, AChE-S displayed nuclear colocalization and physical interaction with CtBP. Furthermore, co-transfected AChE-S reduced the co-repressive effect of CtBP over the hematopoietic transcription factor, Ikaros. In transgenic mice, overexpressed human (h) AChE-S mRNA induced selective bone marrow upregulation of Ikaros while suppressing FOG, another transcriptional partner of CtBP. Transgenic bone marrow cells showed a correspondingly elevated potential for producing progenitor colonies, compared with controls, while peripheral blood showed increased erythrocyte counts as opposed to reduced platelets, granulocytes and T lymphocytes. AChE's 3' alternative splicing, and the corresponding changes in AChE-S/CtBP interactions, thus emerge as being actively involved in controlling hematopoiesis and the potential for modulating immune functions, supporting reports on malfunctioning immune reactions under impaired splice site selection.","['Department of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 3.,"Stromal cells are an essential component of the bone marrow microenvironment that regulate or supports tumor survival. In this study we therefore studied the role of stromal cells in lymphoma cell survival. We demonstrated that adhesion of the B-cell lymphoma cell lines SUDH-4 and 10 to bone marrow stroma inhibited mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis. This adhesion-dependent inhibition of mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis correlated with decreased activation of caspases-8 and 9, and cleavage of caspase 3 and PARP. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) analysis demonstrated significantly increased NF-kappaB binding activity in lymphoma cells adhered to stroma cells compared to lymphoma cells in suspension. This DNA binding activity could be attributed to cell adhesion-mediated proteolysis of the NF-kappaB precursor, p100 (NF-kappaB2). This resulted in the generation of active p52, which translocated to the nucleus in complex with p65 and RelB. Coculture with stromal cells also induced expression of the NF-kappaB-regulated anti-apoptotic molecules, XIAP, cIAP(1) and cIAP(2). Inhibition of NF-kappaB significantly suppressed HS-5-induced protection against apoptosis in lymphoma cell lines as well as in primary lymphoma cells. Thus, bone marrow stroma protects B-cell lymphoma cells against apoptosis, at least in part through activation of NF-kappaB dependent mechanism involving up-regulation of NF-kappaB regulated antiapoptotic proteins. Consequently, this study suggests a new approach to decrease the resistance of lymphoma to chemotherapy.","['Department of Interdisciplinary Oncology and Experimental Therapeutics Program, H.

The secondary aim was to understand how factors other than development, including the features of the disease such as its chronic nature and family involvement, can affect treatment adherence to 6-mercaptopurine.

Epub 2007 May 2.,"The CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) alpha transcription factor is indispensable for myeloid differentiation. In various myeloid leukemias, C/EBPalpha is mutated or functionally impaired due to decreased C/EBPalpha expression or phosphorylation. In order to investigate the functional consequences of decreased C/EBPalpha function in AML, we reintroduced C/EBPalpha in primary CD34(+) sorted acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells using a lentiviral approach. Self-renewal and differentiation of primary AML stem cells were studied on long-term MS5 cocultures. Activation of C/EBPalpha immediately led to a growth arrest in all AML cultures (N = 7), resulting in severely reduced expansion compared with control cultures. This growth arrest corresponded with enhanced myeloid differentiation as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis for CD14, CD15, and CD11b. Myeloid differentiation was further confirmed by the up-regulation of neutrophil elastase and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor in C/EBPalpha transduced cells. C/EBPalpha-expressing AML CD34(+) cells failed to generate second and third leukemic cobblestone areas (L-CAs) in serial replating experiments, while control cultures could be sequentially passaged for more than 4 times, indicating that reintroduction of C/EBPalpha impaired the self-renewal capacity of the leukemic CD34(+) compartment. Together, our data indicate that low C/EBPalpha levels are necessary to maintain self-renewal and the immature character of AML stem cells.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",,,['Blood. 2007 Oct 15;110(8):2818'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Additionally, 1 of the 12 patients harbored a missense mutation in the related CBL-b gene. Each c-CBL mutation involves the structurally important alpha-helix within the linker region, while the mutation in CBL-b was located in the Ub-E2 protein-binding RING finger. Short-interfering RNA knockdown of mutant c-CBL present in MOLM-13 cells was growth inhibitory.

Epub 2007 May 2.,"Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (SDS) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by bone marrow failure, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and leukemia predisposition. Mutations in the SBDS gene are identified in most patients with SDS. SBDS encodes a highly conserved protein of unknown function. Data from SBDS orthologs suggest that SBDS may play a role in ribosome biogenesis or RNA processing. Human SBDS is enriched in the nucleolus, the major cellular site of ribosome biogenesis. Here we report that SBDS nucleolar localization is dependent on active rRNA transcription. Cells from patients with SDS or Diamond-Blackfan anemia are hypersensitive to low doses of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of rRNA transcription. The addition of wild-type SBDS complements the actinomycin D hypersensitivity of SDS patient cells. SBDS migrates together with the 60S large ribosomal subunit in sucrose gradients and coprecipitates with 28S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Loss of SBDS is not associated with a discrete block in rRNA maturation or with decreased levels of the 60S ribosomal subunit. SBDS forms a protein complex with nucleophosmin, a multifunctional protein implicated in ribosome biogenesis and leukemogenesis. Our studies support the addition of SDS to the growing list of human bone marrow failure syndromes involving the ribosome.","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology, Children's Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, USA.""]","['K23 HL068632/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL079582/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 HL068632-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL079582-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1975835,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 2.,"The inability of myeloid chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis (CML-BC) progenitors to undergo neutrophil differentiation depends on suppression of C/EBPalpha expression through the translation inhibitory activity of the RNA-binding protein hnRNP-E2. Here we show that ""oncogene dosage"" is a determinant factor for suppression of differentiation in CML-BC. In fact, high levels of p210-BCR/ABL are required for enhanced hnRNP-E2 expression, which depends on phosphorylation of hnRNP-E2 serines 173, 189, and 272 and threonine 213 by the BCR/ABL-activated MAPK(ERK1/2). Serine/threonine to alanine substitution abolishes hnRNP-E2 phosphorylation and markedly decreases its stability in BCR/ABL-expressing myeloid precursors. Similarly, pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK(ERK1/2) activity decreases hnRNP-E2 binding to the 5'UTR of C/EBPalpha mRNA by impairing hnRNP-E2 phosphorylation and stability. This, in turn, restores in vitro and/or in vivo C/EBPalpha expression and G-CSF-driven neutrophilic maturation of differentiation-arrested BCR/ABL(+) cell lines, primary CML-BC(CD34+) patient cells and lineage-negative mouse bone marrow cells expressing high levels of p210-BCR/ABL. Thus, increased BCR/ABL oncogenic tyrosine kinase activity is essential for suppression of myeloid differentiation of CML-BC progenitors as it is required for sustained activation of the MAPK(ERK1/2)-hnRNP-E2-C/EBPalpha differentiation-inhibitory pathway. Furthermore, these findings suggest the inclusion of clinically relevant MAPK inhibitors in the therapy of CML-BC.","['Human Cancer Genetics Program, Department of Molecular Virology, Immunology and Medical Genetics, Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 23240, USA.']","['CA 078890/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA078890/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 095512/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 9555111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1924762,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a GVHD protective nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen of total lymphoid irradiation and antithymocyte serum (TLI/ATS) in mice that has been recently adapted to clinical studies, we show that regulatory host NKT cells prevent the expansion and tissue inflammation induced by donor T cells, but allow retention of the killing activity of donor T cells against the BCL1 B cell lymphoma. Whereas wild-type hosts given transplants from wild-type donors were protected against progressive tumor growth and lethal GVHD, NKT cell-deficient CD1d-/- and Jalpha-18-/- host mice given wild-type transplants cleared the tumor cells but died of GVHD. In contrast, wild-type hosts given transplants from CD8-/- or perforin-/- donors had progressive tumor growth without GVHD. Injection of host-type NKT cells into Jalpha-18-/- host mice conditioned with TLI/ATS markedly reduced the early expansion and colon injury induced by donor T cells. In conclusion, after TLI/ATS host conditioning and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, host NKT cells can separate the proinflammatory and tumor cytolytic functions of donor T cells.","['Division of Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305-5166, USA.']","['R01 AI-37683/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL-58250/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI037683/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 HL-57443/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 2.,"The metanephric kidney is a mesodermal organ that develops as a result of reciprocal interactions between the ureteric bud and the blastema. The generation of embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived progenitors offers potential for regenerative therapies but is often limited by development of tumor formation. Because brachyury (T) denotes mesoderm specification, a mouse ES cell line with green fluorescence protein (GFP) knocked into the functional T locus as well as lacZ in the ROSA26 locus (LacZ/T/GFP) was used in cell selection and lineage tracing. In the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor, mouse ES cells give rise to embryoid bodies that can differentiate into mesoderm. Culture conditions were optimized (4 d, 10 ng/ml Activin-A) to generate maximal numbers of renal progenitor populations identified by expression of the specific combination of renal markers cadherin-11, WT-1, Pax-2, and Wnt-4. LacZ/T/GFP+ cells were further enriched by FACS selection. Five days after injection of LacZ/T/GFP+ cells into embryonic kidney explants in organ culture, beta-galactosidase immunohistochemistry showed incorporation into blastemal cells of the nephrogenic zone. After a single injection into developing live newborn mouse kidneys, co-localization studies showed that the LacZ/T/GFP+ cells were stably integrated into proximal tubules with normal morphology and normal polarization of alkaline phosphatase and aquaporin-1 for 7 mo, without teratoma formation. It is concluded that defined differentiation of ES cells into embryoid bodies with Activin-A and selection for T expression provides a means to isolate and purify renal proximal tubular progenitor cells with the potential for safe use in regenerative therapies.","['Division of Nephrology, Department of Medicine, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, 1425 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10029, USA.']","['HL 48834/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK 62345/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AG 19366/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL 71800/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,['J Am Soc Nephrol. 2011 Nov;22(11):1958-60.

Epub 2007 May 1.,"The aberrant association of promyelocytic leukemia protein-retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML-RARalpha) with corepressor complexes is generally thought to contribute to the ability of PML-RARalpha to regulate transcription. We report here that PML-RARalpha acquires aberrant association with coactivators. We show that endogenous PML-RARalpha interacts with the histone acetyltransferases CBP, p300, and SRC-1 in a hormoneindependent manner, an association not seen for RARalpha. This hormone-independent coactivator binding activity requires an intact ligand-binding domain and the NR box of the coactivators. Confocal microscopy studies demonstrate that exogenous PML-RARalpha sequesters and colocalizes with coactivators. These observations correlate with the ability of PML-RARalpha to attenuate the transcription activation of the Notch signaling downstream effector, CBF1, and of the glucocorticoid receptor. This includes attenuation of the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ) and FLJ25390 target genes of the endogenous glucocorticoid receptor. Furthermore, treatment of NB4 cells with all-trans-retinoic acid, which promotes PML-RARalpha degradation, resulted in increased activation of GILZ. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model in which the hormone-independent association between PML-RARalpha and coactivators contributes to its ability to regulate gene expression.","['Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.', 'Research Institute of University Hospitals of Cleveland and the Comprehensive Cancer Center of Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Case Western Reserve University, University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.

Epub 2007 May 1.,"p16(ink4a) is known to be a major inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases of G1-phase. Its accumulation is associated with replicative senescence. We analyzed to what extent the number of cell doublings may participate to p16(ink4a) expression in normal and malignant lymphocytes. p16(ink4a) expression, not found in normal quiescent B or T-lymphocytes, was observed after stimulation of B-lymphocytes (72 h) and T-lymphocytes (2 weeks) before the occurrence of replicative senescence markers such as senescence-associated-beta-galactosidase activity. Afterwards, in lymphocyte long-term cultures, the increase in p16(ink4a) followed the expression of features of cell ageing. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia, the analysis of the individual differences between peripheral blood and blood compartments (34 cases) showed a decrease in cell proliferation (p<0.005), in telomerase activity (p<0.0005), and in hTERT expression (p<0.04), associated with an increase of p16(ink4a) (p<0.035) in blood leukemic cells. These results support the hypothesis that (i) an increase in p16(ink4a) expression in normal lymphocytes is linked, in part, to the number of cell doublings before the occurrence of replicative senescence and (ii) this process is maintained in leukemic cell populations of numerous patients.","[""Universite Lyon1, Equipe d'Accueil 3737, Faculte Lyon-Sud, Oullins, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Mar 30.,"Guggulsterone is a plant polyphenol traditionally used to treat obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, and osteoarthritis, possibly through an anti-inflammatory mechanism. Whether this steroid has any role in cancer is not known. In this study, we found that guggulsterone inhibits the proliferation of wide variety of human tumor cell types including leukemia, head and neck carcinoma, multiple myeloma, lung carcinoma, melanoma, breast carcinoma, and ovarian carcinoma. Guggulsterone also inhibited the proliferation of drug-resistant cancer cells (e.g., gleevac-resistant leukemia, dexamethasone-resistant multiple myeloma, and doxorubicin-resistant breast cancer cells). Guggulsterone suppressed the proliferation of cells through inhibition of DNA synthesis, producing cell cycle arrest in S-phase, and this arrest correlated with a decrease in the levels of cyclin D1 and cdc2 and a concomitant increase in the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and p27. Guggulsterone-induced apoptosis as indicated by increase in the number of Annexin V- and TUNEL-positive cells, through the downregulation of anti-apoptototic products. The apoptosis induced by guggulsterone was also indicated by the activation of caspase-8, bid cleavage, cytochrome c release, caspase-9 activation, caspase-3 activation, and PARP cleavage. The apoptotic effects of guggulsterone were preceded by activation of JNK and downregulation of Akt activity. JNK was needed for guggulsterone-induced apoptosis, inasmuch as inhibition of JNK by pharmacological inhibitors or by genetic deletion of MKK4 (activator of JNK) abolished the activity. Overall, our results indicate that guggulsterone can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis through the activation of JNK, suppression of Akt, and downregulation of antiapoptotic protein expression.","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Experimental Therapeutics, Unit 143, The University of Texas M.

However, there are problems stemming from the characteristics of both methods; especially, the long turn around time (TAT) because of the complex process in the SBH, and the low analytical sensitivity for amplicons in the PCR. Thus, to improve the PCR procedure, we investigated the application of detecting the clonal amplicons based on the different melting Temperature (T(m)) in internal melting domains corresponding to the CDR3 hypervariable region. Our new protocol is based on the combination of a LightCycler Technology with high-speed amplification, and Idaho-Technology with rapid and high-resolution melting curve analysis (MCA), designated PCR-MCA. This method can provide the results within 3 h with an analytical sensitivity of 10(-3). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity relative to the results documented with the SBH analysis were 89.2% and 100%, respectively. This indicates that the new protocol of PCR-MCA is acceptable for clinical testing; especially, PCR-MCA is relevant in terms of the rapid and sensitive detection of IgH clonality within amplicons.","['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki University Hospital, Nagasaki City, Nagasaki, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the changes of neuroendocrine and immune system in leukemia patients and their probable connection with leukemia, we studied five groups of patients including leukemia patients with normal temperature, leukemia patients with high temperature and infection (high-leukocyte count group and low leukocyte count group), general patients with fever and healthy Chinese adult blood donors as control group. We determined their blood cell counts by blood count meter, determined their arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels in blood plasma by radioimmunoassay and their cross-reacting protein (CRP), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels by immunoturbidimetry. Then we studied the difference and association among these indexes. Our results revealed a significant increase of AVP, LPS, and CRP levels in the blood of leukemia patients with normal temperature vs. normal people; Individual leukemia patients had high AVP levels although they had normal LPS and CRP levels; In the group of leukemia patients with high temperature and low leukocyte counts, the CRP level is significantly higher than some of other groups, while there was no significant increase in its AVP level. We conclude that no matter the temperature is normal or not, there were always neuroendocrine disturbance, inflammation, and inapparent infection in leukemia patient; To the leukemia patients with low leukocyte counts, the relationship between inflammation and neuroendocrine is more complicated.","[""Department of Hematology, Xijing Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients most likely to benefit are those with advanced-stage disease, multiple relapses, and short remissions; chemosensitive disease is also a prerequisite for these treatments. Autologous SCT produces high response rates in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, but these are generally of short duration. This therapy is relatively safe to administer, with little transplant-related mortality. In contrast, allogeneic SCT may be highly toxic and result in transplant-related mortality, but it has the potential to produce long-lasting responses. Prospective studies of these treatments in patients with CTCL are required. Nevertheless, selected patients could be considered for allogeneic SCT, preferably early in their disease when their performance status is still good.","['The Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom. claire.dearden@rmh.nhs.uk']",,,,,16,,,,,,,,,,

NSCs can self-renew and generate major cell types of the mammalian central nervous system throughout adulthood. NSCs exist not only in the embryo, but also in the adult brain neurogenic region: the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricle. Embryonic stem (ES) cells acquire NSC identity with a default mechanism. Under the regulations of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and fibroblast growth factors, the NSCs then become neural progenitors. Neurotrophic and differentiation factors that regulate gene expression for controlling neural cell fate and function determine the differentiation of neural progenitors in the developing mammalian brain. For clinical application of NSCs in neurodegenerative disorders and damaged neurons, there are several critical problems that remain to be resolved: 1) how to obtain enough NSCs from reliable sources for autologous transplantation; 2) how to regulate neural plasticity of different adult stem cells; 3) how to control differentiation of NSCs in the adult nervous system. In order to understand the mechanisms that control NSC differentiation and behavior, we review the ontogeny of NSCs and other stem cell plasticity of neuronal differentiation. The role of NSCs and their regulation by neurotrophic factors in CNS development are also reviewed.","['Stem Cell Research Center, National Health Research Institutes, Jhunan, Taiwan.']",,,,,232,,,,,,,,,,

It can occur without blood or bone marrow manifestations of leukemia and in this case, the diagnosis is difficult.

STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study. PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY: January 1998 to June 2005 at the Cytogenetics department, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of cytogenetic studies was carried out in patients who were diagnosed as ALL and were more than 15 years of age. Cytogenetic analysis was performed using a trypsin-Giemsa banding technique. Karyotypes were interpreted using International System for Cytogenetics Nomenclature (1995) criteria. RESULTS: The requests were received for cytogenetic analysis of bone marrow specimens in 69 patients who were diagnosed as ALL. Cytogenetic results were available in 62 patients; out of which 51 were males and 11 were females. 44 patients (70%) were found to have a normal karyotype. In 18 patients (29%), abnormal karyotype was found. CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic studies should be part of the initial work up of every patient with ALL. Larger scale studies will help refine our understanding of the less common chromosomal patterns and conduct multivariate analysis to define the relative prognostic value of karyotypic results.","['Department of Pathology, Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi. drsafoorah@hotmail.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the complications of transplantation in infants. PROCEDURE: Eligible subjects underwent HCT for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) at less than 3 years of age. Seventeen out of 33 eligible patients were evaluated, transplanted between 1981-2000. Eleven patients had AML, 11 were female. Preparative regimen included total body irradiation (TBI) for eleven. Age at HCT ranged from 0.58 to 2.97 years, and survival 3.25 to 22.33 years. Patients underwent physical and laboratory evaluation, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan, bone age X-ray, neuropsychological, and quality of life (QOL) evaluation. RESULTS: Identified abnormalities included: growth hormone deficiency (59%), hypothyroidism (35%), osteochondromas (24%), decreased bone mineral density (24%), and dyslipidemias (59%). Two patients developed a second malignancy. Neuropsychological testing revealed average intelligence quotient (IQ) with attention deficits and other weaknesses for most patients. There were no overall differences between QOL in these children when compared to population norms. CONCLUSIONS: Of the survivors evaluated, typical late effects seen after radiation exposure are common, yet most subjects were doing well without major ongoing medical issues. Dyslipidemias affect more than half of patients and may be associated with metabolic syndrome, placing patients at increased risk for early cardiovascular disease. Even in this group of patients where the majority was exposed to TBI at a very young age, most are functioning at an average or above-average level.","[""Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Children's Hospitals and Clinics, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55404, USA. joanna.perkins@children.org""]",['M01-RR00400/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc']",,,,,,,

In the current approach, these issues have been addressed by creating a stable packaging cell line for retroviral vectors pseudotyped with glycoproteins of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) based on tumor-infiltrating progenitor cells. METHODS: Tumor-infiltrating progenitor cells, which had been isolated from adult rat bone marrow (BM-TIC), were modified to stably express Gag-Pol proteins of moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV) and glycoproteins of LCMV. Packaging of a retroviral vector was measured by titration experiments on human fibroblast cells as well as on mouse and human glioma cell lines. Additionally, gene transfer was tested in a rat glioma model in vivo. RESULTS: The BM-TIC-derived packaging cell line (BM-TIPC) produced retroviral vectors with titers between 2-8 x 10(3) transducing units (TU)/ml. Extended culturing of BM-TIPC over several weeks and freezing/thawing of cells did not affect vector titers. No replication-competent retrovirus was released from BM-TIPC. In a rat glioma model, BM-TIPC infiltrated the tumors extensively and with high specificity. Moreover, BM-TIPC mediated transduction of glioma cells in vivo. CONCLUSION: This proof-of-principle study shows that primary adult progenitor cells with tumor-infiltrating capacity can be genetically modified to stably produce retroviral LCMV pseudotype vectors. These BM-TIPC may be a useful tool to enhance specificity and efficacy of gene transfer to gliomas in patients.","['University of Lund, Stem Cell Center, BMC B10, 22184 Lund, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,

Recently completed adjuvant trials have included a heterogeneous group of patients with resected stages I to IIIA NSCLC. With rare exception, the published results of these studies indicate adjuvant chemotherapy imparts a significant overall survival advantage. Subset analyses suggest survival benefit occurs primarily in patients with resected stage II or IIIA and is less likely to occur in stage I patients. This apparent lack of survival benefit in stage I patients was seemingly validated in a prospective trial conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B in which stage IB patients were randomized to observation or adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel. Survival at 5 -years was identical in the two arms of this trial. By contrast, two contemporary postoperative chemotherapy trials also conducted exclusively in stage I NSCLC patients yielded positive survival results. The divergent outcome of the prospective trials along with the negative subset analyses has created uncertainty as to the utility of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in stage I NSCLC. Herein we review the data underlying this controversy and offer a proposed algorithm to aid the clinician in selecting patients whom we believe may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. The treatment algorithm is based on currently available tumor- and host-related factors that affect prognosis.","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Princess Margaret Hospital, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both GGO-induced intracellular acidification and apoptosis as analyzed by DNA fragmentation were inhibited by phorbol myristate acetate (TPA) and O'-bis(2-aminophenyl)ethyleneglycol-N,N,N',N-tetraacetic acid tetraacetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM), an intracellular Ca(2+) chelator, but not by ethyleneglycol-bis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA).

Because of loosely scattered and hypo-/agranular mast cells, the diagnosis is sometimes very difficult. In the bone marrow, mast cell infiltration may be associated with prominent lymphoid infiltration leading to a misdiagnosis of a low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A 49-year-old woman presented with right arm and leg pain, psychiatric symptoms, and diarrhea for four years. Physical examination and laboratory investigation revealed hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, mild thrombocytosis, mild leucocytosis and lymphocytosis. In the bone marrow biopsy, there was a prominent B lymphocyte proliferation reminiscent of a low grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma/leukemia and there were some spindle cells aggregates in paratrabecular location. The consecutive bone marrow biopsies were similar to the first. The subsequent splenectomy specimen exhibited striking fibrosis. In the lymph node sections, there was marginal zone hyperplasia. Multifocal accumulations of mast cells were strongly positive with mast cell tryptase and CD117 on immunohistochemical staining, though no metachromasia was identified in Giemsa and Toluidine Blue stained aspirates and tissue sections, probably due to hypo-/agranulation of mast cells. The case was presented to emphasize the importance of the antibody to mast cell tryptase in the diagnosis of mastocytosis and to discuss problems of differential diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis.","['Department of Pathology, Celal Bayar University Faculty of Medicine, Manisa, Turkey. nalannese@hotmail.com']",,,,PMC3851621,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 May 1.,"One-hundred thirty-nine patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and hypodiploidy (fewer than 45 chromosomes) were collected from 10 different national ALL study groups and single institutions. Patients were stratified by modal chromosome number into 4 groups: 24 to 29 (N = 46); 33 to 39 (N = 26); 40 to 43 (N = 13); and 44 (N = 54) chromosomes. Nine patients were Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) positive (4 cases: 44 chromosomes; 5 cases: 40-43 chromosomes) and were not considered further. Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of the remaining 130 patients were 38.5% +/- 4.4% and 49.8% +/- 4.2% at 8 years, respectively. There were no significant differences in outcome between patients with 24 to 29, 33 to 39, or 40 to 43 chromosomes. Compared with patients with fewer than 44 chromosomes, patients with 44 chromosomes had a significantly better EFS (P = .01; 8-year estimate, 52.2% vs 30.1%) and OS (P = .017; 69% vs 37.5%). For patients with 44 chromosomes, monosomy 7, the presence of a dicentric chromosome, or both predicted a worse EFS but similar OS. Doubling of the hypodiploid clone occurred in 32 patients (24-29 chromosomes [n = 25] and 33-39 chromosomes [n = 7]) and had no prognostic implication. Children and adolescents with ALL and hypodiploidy with fewer than 44 chromosomes have a poor outcome despite contemporary therapy.","[""The University of Chicago Comer Children's Hospital, IL 60637, USA. jnachman@ped.bsd.uchicago.edu""]","['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA098543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA068484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1939895,,,,,,,,,,,

Re-induction chemotherapy was performed for relapse of ALL. Thereafter, he suffered from an episode of neutropenic fever with pneumonia. One week following control of the condition with antibiotics, a 1 x 1-cm, red, painful nodule appeared on the left thigh, which was initially suspected to be Pseudomonas infection. Parenteral ceftazidime and amikacin were administered, but persistent high fever, mild cough, and a few painful erythematous papulonodules on the face and lower extremities appeared several days later (Fig. 1). These lesions increased insidiously in diameter up to 2-5 cm with central necrosis. Hemogram showed neutropenia with a shift to the left [white blood cell (WBC) count, 2.1 x 10(9)/L; neutrophil count, 0.21 x 10(9)/L]. A skin biopsy showed heavy growth of hyaline branching septate hyphae in the deep dermis and subcutis, together with fat necrosis (Fig. 2). Invasion of molds into vessels and sweat glands was also seen. A culture from a lesion yielded Fusarium moniliforme, but no fungi were isolated from blood specimens. Only mild infiltrations on bilateral lower lung fields were detected by chest roentgenography. The skin lesions gradually healed and the fever subsided 2 weeks after the initiation of therapy with amphotericin B 30 mg and itraconazole 200 mg daily. Meanwhile, relapse of leukemia was detected by hemogram showing atypical leukocytosis (WBC count of 24,400 x 10(9)/L, with blast cells representing 78%). A course of chemotherapy with cytarabine, mitoxantrone, and VP-16 was prescribed, subsequently resulting in neutropenia (WBC count, < 0.1 x 10(9)/L; neutrophil count, 0/L) and spiking fever. Although the aforementioned antifungal therapy was continued, the centers of the originally healed lesions turned dusky red, swollen, necrotic, and ulcerative. There were more than 10 such ecthymiform lesions. After administration for 22 days, itraconazole was discontinued because of no appreciable effects. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) salvage was used, and the neutropenia gradually subsided 20 days later. In addition, the ecthymiform lesions gradually resolved. Amphotericin B was discontinued 1 week following neutrophil recovery.

Functional analysis reveals that while scl-alpha and -beta are redundant for the initiation of primitive hematopoiesis, these two isoforms exert distinct functions in the regulation of primitive erythroid differentiation and definitive hematopoietic stem cell specification. We further demonstrate that differences in the protein expression levels of scl-alpha and -beta, by regulating their protein stability, are likely to give rise to their distinct functions. Our findings suggest that hematopoietic cells at different levels of hierarchy are likely governed by a gradient of the Scl protein established through temporal and spatial patterns of expression of the different isoforms.","['Laboratory of Molecular and Developmental Immunology, Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Singapore, Singapore.']",,,,PMC1858710,,,,,,,,,,,

The genes involved mostly encode transcription factors and cell cycle specific inhibitors. The aim of this project was to study the DNA methylation pattern of c-myc, c-fos and p53 in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and in acute non-lymphocytic leukemias (ANLL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: DNA was isolated from the monocyte cell layer harvested from bone marrow or peripheral blood samples of 44 patients suffering from MDS and ANLL. Genomic DNA was digested with methylation-specific enzymes, and was electrophoresed and hybridized with probes specific for human c-myc, c-fos and p53 genes. RESULTS: In MDS, the c-myc gene in exons 2 and 3 was regionally hypomethylated, whereas exon 2 in ANLL was hypermethylated and exon 3 hypomethylated. The c-fos gene was hypomethylated in ANLL type 4 and presented aberrant hypomethylation in the different types of MDS. The p53 anti-oncogene appeared extensively hypomethylated in MDS. CONCLUSION: Aberrant DNA methylation pattern of the c-myc, c-fos and p53 tumor suppressor gene seems to be a primary event in the transformation process from myelodysplasia to acute leukemia, affecting their expression, and, consequently, altering the proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis of hemopoietic precursor cells. The p53 hypomethylation predisposes to critical mutations that enhance the transformation process of myelodysplasia to leukemia. The recognition of altered methylation of these genes in myelodysplasia may have prognostic implications and may lead to novel therapeutic modalities.","['University of Thessaly, Department of Medicine, Larissa, Greece.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective study on cancer incidence and mortality in the population living around two regions with radioecological problems was conducted. According to the expected individual annual effective doses for the population, regions with expected highest radiation risk (average effective dose > 10 mSv per year) were the villages Yana, Eleshnitza and Seslavtzi (group A), and with expected relatively high radiation risk (average effective dose > 5 mSv per year) were the town of Buhovo, and the villages Dolni Bogrov and Gorni Bogrov (group B). The ecologically clean village German was chosen as a control settlement. The incidence and mortality of gastrointestinal tract cancers, bronchus and lung cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, and myeloid leukaemia for the period 1995- 2001 were studied. RESULTS: The incidence of the gastrointestinal tract cancers in the population of German was significantly lower than those for Bulgaria and for group B. The mortality from this disease of groups A, B and Bulgaria were significantly higher than in the control settlement. Standardized mortality of lung cancer in the population of the villages with highest and relatively high radiation risk was significantly higher than in German and Bulgaria. CONCLUSION: The incidence and mortality changes of diseases studied are a consequence of the impact of many factors. Moreover, they do not characterize the impact of the radiation factor.","['Radiation Epidemiology Laboratory, National Center of Radiobiology and Radiation Protection, Sofia, Bulgaria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessment and monitoring of this side effect can be performed by endogenous evoked potential P300. The aim of the study was to show the changes of P300 potential in patients after ALL treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 36 children admitted to P300, but 3 of them were unable to perform it because of developmental delay and one child due to attention deficits. The study was performed on 32 patients with no influence on cognitive functions, aged 6 to 22 years (average 14,2), 13 girls and 19 boys, after ALL treatment finished before 0,3 to 11 years ago (average 3,2 years). The patients were divided into 3 groups, 9 children treated with New York program, 7 with older BFM program with chemio and radiotherapy of CNS, and 16 children with BFM 95 without radiotherapy. In the control group there were 20 persons aged 11-18 (average 14,1 years), consulted in the Neuropediatric Out-patient Clinic. P300 evoked potentials were performed due to IFCN recommendations. Latency, amplitude of P300 and time reaction were assessed with U Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: The children treated with older BFM programs had significant lower onset age of disease, and the age of P300 data was higher than other. Time reaction was shorter in this group. There were no significant differences between latency and amplitude of P300 in comparison to control group. Patient with NY and BFM 95 programmes had normal latency, but amplitude of P300 was significantly lower than in control group and time reaction was non-significantly longed. Patients with additional radiotherapy of CSN (NY and BFM) in the moment of assessment were older. The amplitude of P300 was significantly lower and latency similar to these parameters in control group. The statistic analyses were performed to eliminate the age influence on latency. The mean age of control group was established as 13,5 years with correction of 10ms per year to this age for each patient. There was no statistic significance in these groups even though the difference in children with radiotherapy was nearly statistical. CONCLUSION: 1. It is important to establish new, less toxic ALL treatment programs, because of significant cognitive impairment in 11% of examined children. 2. The mild modification of ALL treatment programs is necessary due to observation of decreased of P300 amplitude, what may influence education abilities.","['Klinika Neurologii Dzieciecej, Pracownia Neurofizjologii KND, Collegium Medicum Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego w Krakowie. neupedkr@cm-uj.krakow.pl']",,,,,,,Ocena czynnosci poznawczych pacjentow po zakonczonym leczeniu dzieciecej ostrej bialaczki limfoblastycznej za pomoca endogennego potencjalu wywolanego P 300.,,,,,,,,

Currently, however, there is no consensus as to what protocol is most optimal for retroviral human TCR gene transfer into primary murine T cells, most notably with respect to virus pseudo-type. METHODS: Primary murine T cells were transduced, expanded and subsequently tested for transgene expression, proliferation and antigen-specific function. To this end, murine leukemia virus (MLV) retroviruses were produced upon transfection of various packaging cells with genes encoding either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or TCRalphabeta specific for human melanoma antigen gp100(280-288) and the helper elements GAG/POL and ENV. Next to viral pseudotyping, the following parameters were studied: T cell densities; T cell activation; the amounts of IL-2 and the source of serum used to supplement medium. RESULTS: The pseudo-type of virus produced by packaging cells critically determines T cell transduction efficiencies. In fact, MLV-A and MLV-E pseudo-typed viruses derived from a co-culture of Phoenix-A and 293T cells resulted in T cell transduction efficiencies that were two-fold higher than those based on retroviruses expressing either VSV-G, GALV, MLV-A or MLV-E envelopes. In addition, T cell densities during transduction were inversely related to transduction efficiencies. Further optimization resulted in transduction efficiencies of over 90% for GFP, and 68% for both a murine and a human (i.e. murinized) TCR. Importantly, TCR-transduced T cells proliferate (i.e. showing a log increase in cell number in a few days) and show antigen-specific function. CONCLUSIONS: We set up a quick and versatile method to genetically modify primary murine T cells based on transient production of TCR-positive retroviruses, and show that retroviral gene transfer of a human TCR into primary murine T cells is critically improved by viral pseudo-typing with both MLV-A and MLV-E envelopes.","['Laboratory of Tumor Immunology, Department of Medical Oncology, Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Oncology Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First hints were found in model organisms like Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosophila melanogaster where a clear connection between ageing phenotypes and pathways that are regulated by p53, were found. Interestingly, pathways that are central to the ageing process are usually also involved in energy metabolism and are highly conserved throughout evolution. This also supports the long known empiric finding that caloric restriction has a positive impact on the life span of a wide variety of organisms. Within the last years, on the molecular level, an involvement of the insulin-like growth factor and of the histone deacetylase SRIT1 could be shown. Insight on the impact of p53 on ageing at the organismal level came from mice expressing aberrant forms of the p53 protein. Obviously, the balance of the full length p53 protein and of the shorter p44/DeltaNp53 isomer bear a strong impact on ageing. The shorter isoform regulates full length p53 and in cases where there is too much of the longer isoform, this leads to elevated apoptosis resulting in decreased tumor incidence but also in premature ageing due to exhaustion of the renewal potential. Therefore, modulating the expression of the truncated p53 isoform accordingly, might lead to increased health-span and elevated life-span.","['Cell Cycle Regulation Group, Department of Medicine I, Division: Institute of Cancer Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",,,,,113,,,,,,,,,,

The recombinant IgG1 antibody 13B8.2 was previously shown to inhibit HIV-1 replication and to abrogate the one-way mixed-lymphocyte reaction and block proliferation of CD3-stimulated peripheral blood CD4 lymphocytes from healthy donors. Before testing this recombinant anti-CD4 antibody in in vivo preclinical trials, in vitro mechanisms of action of rIgG1 13B8.2 were assessed using various CD4 T-cell lymphomas. The baculovirus-expressed rIgG1 13B8.2 antibody led to 14% to 40% proliferation inhibition of the lymphoblastic leukaemia-derived SUP-T1, the acute T lymphoma-derived CCRF-CEM and Jurkat, and the cutaneous T-Cell lymphoma-derived HUT-78 cell lines, but it did not affect the cell cycle nor induce cell apoptosis. rIgG1 antibody 13B8.2 bound the C1q fraction, leading to 9% to 17% complement-mediated lysis of the HUT-78, H9, Sup-T1, and the CCRF-CEM cell lines. No correlation was observed between cell sensitivity to rIgG1 13B8.2-triggered complement-dependent lysis and CD35-, CD46-, CD55-, and CD59-surface expression on T lymphoma cells. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, the antibody was shown to bind to FcgammaRI/CD64-transfected IIA1.6, FcgammaRII/CD32-transfected CDw32L, and FcgammaRIII/CD16-transfected Jurkat CD16 cell lines. In correlation with these findings, rIgG1 13B8.2 induced 11% to 31% antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of the CCRF-CEM, SUP-T1, A2.01 CD4, and Jurkat cell lines. These convincing results on the activity of the recombinant chimeric anti-CD4 antibody 13B8.2 have led us to perform in vivo preclinical study in a murine xenograft model of CD4 lymphomas.","['CNRS UMR 5160, Centre de Pharmacologie et Biotechnologie pour la Sante, Faculte de Pharmacie, Montpellier, France.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 30.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short 19- to 24-nt RNA molecules that have been shown to regulate the expression of other genes in a variety of eukaryotic systems. Abnormal expression of miRNAs has been observed in several human cancers, and furthermore, germ-line and somatic mutations in human miRNAs were recently identified in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thus, human miRNAs can act as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes, where mutations, deletions, or amplifications can underlie the development of certain types of leukemia. In addition, previous studies have shown that miRNA expression profiles can distinguish among human solid tumors from different organs. Because a single miRNA can simultaneously influence the expression of two or more protein-coding genes, we hypothesized that miRNAs could be candidate genes for cancer risk. Research in complex trait genetics has demonstrated that genetic background determines cancer susceptibility or resistance in various tissues, such as colon and lung, of different inbred mouse strains. We compared the genome positions of mouse tumor susceptibility loci with those of mouse miRNAs. Here, we report a statistically significant association between the chromosomal location of miRNAs and those of mouse cancer susceptibility loci that influence the development of solid tumors. Furthermore, we identified distinct patterns of flanking DNA sequences for several miRNAs located at or near susceptibility loci in inbred strains with different tumor susceptibilities. These data provide a catalog of miRNA genes in inbred strains that could represent genes involved in the development and penetrance of solid tumors.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Jefferson Medical College, Philadelphia, PA 19107, USA.']","['P01CA76259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA081534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA72027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA076259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA072027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1876564,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that imatinib-resistant leukemic cells emerge from CML stem cells that acquire BCR-ABL gene mutations even before exposure to BCR-ABL-targeted agents such as imatinib. METHODS: Lineage-negative (i.e., immature) CD34+ CD38- CML stem cell-enriched populations were isolated from five patients with chronic phase CML samples by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. To identify BCR-ABL gene mutations, complementary DNAs (cDNAs) prepared from purified CML stem cells were subjected to allele-specific amplification using primers corresponding to 16 kinase domain mutations, with normal bone marrow cells serving as negative controls. We also cloned and directly sequenced BCR-ABL cDNAs prepared from freshly isolated CML stem cells and from their progeny generated after 3-5 weeks of culture. RESULTS: In 20%-33% of cDNA preparations from freshly isolated CML stem cell-enriched populations, both allele-specific amplification and direct sequencing methods revealed mutations in sequences corresponding to the BCR-ABL kinase domain. Mutations were not observed in cDNA sequences encoding the c-ABL kinase domain that were obtained from similar types of primitive normal cells. More than 70 different BCR-ABL mutations (including frameshift mutations and premature stop codons) were identified in the progeny of cultured CML stem cells. Analysis of individual clones derived from the cultured cells demonstrated that new BCR-ABL mutations were produced. CONCLUSIONS: Primary CML stem cells display instability of the BCR-ABL fusion gene both in vivo and in vitro. Thus, patients may possess leukemic stem cells with BCR-ABL kinase mutations before initiation of BCR-ABL-targeted therapies and would likely be predisposed to develop resistance to these agents.","['Terry Fox Laboratory, British Columbia Cancer Agency, 675 West 10th Ave, Vancouver, BC, V5Z 1L3, Canada. xjiang@bccrc.ca']",,,,,,,,,,['J Natl Cancer Inst. 2007 May 2;99(9):662-3.

Epub 2007 Apr 29.,"BACKGROUND: The ageing of populations makes outcome monitoring among elderly cancer patients particularly important. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using data from the population-based Cancer Registry of Saarland, we examined age-specific trends in 5-year relative survival from 1979 to 2003 for patients with 15 common cancers in Germany. Model-based period analysis was applied to estimate 5-year relative survival for four age groups (15-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75+) in the periods 1979-1983, 1984-1988, 1989-1993, 1994-1998, and 1999-2003. RESULTS: Overall, 5-year relative survival improved steadily from 42.2% in 1979-1983 to 56.7% in 1999-2003. From the youngest to the oldest age group, 5-year relative survival increased by 14.5, 12.1, 12.5, and 8.4 percent units, respectively, after adjusting for changes in the spectrum of cancer sites, and survival significantly improved for 10, 12, 11, and 5 cancer sites, respectively. The age gradient particularly increased for cancer sites with major progress in chemotherapeutic treatment regimens, such as ovarian cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Relative survival of cancer patients increased considerably for many forms of cancer in Germany from 1979 to 2003. Increases were much less pronounced among elderly patients, leading to an increasing age gradient in prognosis.","['Division for Clinical Epidemiology and Ageing Research, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bortezomib is the first proteasome inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced MM. Currently available information regarding the role of bortezomib in PCL is scanty and derives from anecdotal, single-case reports. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective survey of unselected Italian patients with primary or secondary PCL who were treated with bortezomib outside of clinical trials. Twelve evaluable patients were recorded who had received bortezomib for 1 to 6 cycles as either a single agent or variously combined with other drugs. Three patients were treated with bortezomib as frontline therapy, and 9 patients received bortezomib after 1 to 4 lines of chemotherapy, including autologous stem cell transplantation and thalidomide. RESULTS: According to the International uniform response criteria of the International Myeloma Working Group, 5 partial responses (defined as a reduction in M-protein of >50%), 4 very good partial responses (defined as a reduction of >90% in M-protein), and 2 complete responses (defined as negative immunofixation) were achieved, for a response rate of 92%. Responses did not appear to be influenced by previous treatments or by other clinical or biologic parameters, including chromosome 13 deletion or the combination of bortezomib with other drugs. The median progression-free and overall survivals after bortezomib were 8 months and 12 months, respectively. At the time of last follow-up, 8 patients were alive 6 to 21 months after treatment with bortezomib, 4 of whom were in very good partial or complete responses. Grade 3/4 hematologic or neurologic toxicities (graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE; version 3]) were reported to occur in 9 patients and 1 patient, respectively, whereas 6 patients experienced possible or documented infections. CONCLUSIONS: Bortezomib appears to be an effective drug for PCL that could significantly improve the usually adverse clinical outcome of these patients.","['Unit of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation, CROB-Reference Cancer Center of Basilicata, Rionero in Vulture (Pz), Italy. p.musto@crob.it']",,"['GISMM Cooperative Group', 'GISL Cooperative Group', 'GIMEMA Cooperative Group']",,,,,,['(c) 2007 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 30.,"Busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BuCy) are currently the most widely used myeloablative regimen to treat malignancies with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Fludarabine has considerable efficacy in both immunosuppression and tumor cells killing with a minimal extramedullary toxicity. We evaluated the efficacy of 40 mg/m(2) fludarabine i.v. for 5 days and busulfan 4 mg/kg/day p.o. for 4 days as myeloablative conditioning regimen in 70 patients (median age 24 years) with acute leukemia or chronic phase of myelogenous leukemia. They all had human leukocyte antigen-matched sibling donors. The patients received 10 mug/kg granulocyte colony stimulating factor (GCSF), 24 h after stem cell infusion until engraftment occurred. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis included 3 mg/kg cyclosporine-A i.v. from day -2 to +6 followed by 12 mg/kg p.o. until day +60. The median time of neutrophil recovery (>0.5 x 109/l) and platelet recovery (>20 x 109/l) were 10 and 12 days, respectively. Mucositis (93%) and hepatic toxicity (16%) resolved with conservative therapy. The incidence of acute GVHD grade I-II and III-IV were 38.6 and 15.7% respectively. Overall survival and disease-free survival were 71 and 64% respectively with 17 months median follow-up for surviving patients. We conclude that FluBu may be used as a substitute for BuCy with almost the same efficacy and with a lower transplant adverse effect but to increase anti-leukemic effects, especially in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients, it needs some modifications.","['Hematology-Oncology and BMT Research Center, Medical Sciences, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although members of the Wnt and fibroblast growth factors (Fgf) families were frequently tagged, our exhaustive screening for MMTV insertion sites uncovered a new repertoire of candidate breast cancer oncogenes. We validated one of these genes, Rspo3, as an oncogene by overexpression in a p53-deficient mammary epithelial cell line. The human orthologs of the candidate oncogenes were frequently deregulated in human breast cancers and associated with several tumor parameters. Computational analysis of all MMTV-tagged genes uncovered specific gene families not previously associated with cancer and showed a significant overrepresentation of protein domains and signaling pathways mainly associated with development and growth factor signaling. Comparison of all tagged genes in MMTV and Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced malignancies showed that both viruses target mostly different genes that act predominantly in distinct pathways.","['Division of Molecular Genetics, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 29.,"Genetic abnormalities leading to infant leukemias already occur during fetal development and often involve rearrangements of the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. These rearrangements resemble the aberrations observed in therapy-related leukemias following treatment with topoisomerase II (topoII)-inhibiting agents such as etoposide. Since flavonoids are potent topoII inhibitors, we examined the role of three widely consumed dietary flavonoids (quercetin, genistein and kaempferol) on the development of MLL rearrangements in primary human CD34(+) cells. Using the neutral Comet assay, we demonstrated a dose-dependent double-strand break (DSB) formation after exposure to flavonoids. An incorrect repair of these DSBs resulted in chromosomal translocations that co-localized with those identified in infant leukemias. Most of these translocations were formed by microhomology-mediated end joining. Moreover, in all but one translocation, SINE/Alu or LINE/L1 repetitive elements were present in at least one side of the breakpoint junction. Beside MLL translocations, fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis demonstrated monosomy or trisomy of MLL in 8-10% of the quercetin-exposed CD34(+) cells. Our study demonstrates that biologically relevant concentrations of flavonoids can induce MLL abnormalities in primary hematopoietic progenitor cells. This is particularly alarming knowing that the differences in metabolism and excretion rate between mother and fetus can lead to a higher flavonoid concentration on the fetal side. Therefore, it is important to raise public awareness and set guidelines for marketing flavonoid supplements to reduce the risk of infant leukemias.","['Department of Health Risk Analysis and Toxicology, Nutrition and Toxicology Research Institute Maastricht, Maastricht University, PO Box 616, 6200 MD Maastricht, The Netherlands. s.khosrovani@grat.unimaas.nl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient developed leukemia four months after the end of the treatment; no other serious adverse events occurred during treatment and the follow-up period. A clinically relevant reduction in the annualized relapse rate ( P < 0.0001 at end of treatment and P < 0.0001 at follow-up) and improvement in the EDSS (P < 0.0001 at end of treatment and P = 0.0005 at follow-up) was found.

Systemic exposure to hydroquinone from routine topical application is no greater than that from quantities present in common foods. While murine hepatic adenomas increased, murine hepatocellular carcinomas decreased, suggesting a protective effect. Renal tumors are sex, species, and age specific and therefore do not appear relevant to humans after decades of widespread use. Murine leukemia has not been reproducible and would not be expected from small topical doses. Finally, a literature review of exogenous ochronosis and clinical studies employing hydroquinone (involving over 10,000 exposures under careful clinical supervision) reveal an incidence of exogenous ochronosis in the United States of 22 cases in more than 50 years. Therefore, the proposed ban appears to be unnecessarily extreme.","['Department of Dermatology, The Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York City, USA. TARONY@aol.com']",,,,,143,,,,,,,,,,

Arc is required for the late-phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory consolidation, and has been implicated in AMPA receptor trafficking. Since Arc's molecular function remains incompletely understood, we have determined its subcellular localization in cultured hippocampal neurons and HEK 293T cells. Fluorescence microscopy experiments revealed that both endogenous and exogenous Arc protein was primarily found in the nucleus, where it concentrated in puncta associated with promyelocytic leukemia (PML) bodies, proposed sites of transcriptional regulation. Arc co-localized and interacted with the betaIV spectrin splice variant betaSpIVSigma5, a nuclear spectrin isoform associated with PML bodies and the nuclear matrix. A small region of Arc containing the coiled-coil domain is also restricted to beta-spectrin-positive puncta, while the isolated spectrin homology domain is diffusely localized. Finally, Arc and betaSpIVSigma5 synergistically increased the number of PML bodies. These results suggest that Arc functions as a spectrin-binding protein, forming a complex that may provide a role at sites of transcriptional regulation within the nucleus.","['Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This retrospective analysis evaluates utilization of blood transfusions, risk of bleeding, and survival in 480 HSCT patients at 10 x 10(9) and 20 x 10(9) per L prophylactic trigger levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 224 patients received prophylactic PLT transfusions at 20 x 10(9) per L threshold (1997-1998, SP1); 256 patients had prophylaxis at 10 x 10(9) per L (1999-2001, SP2). Bleeding scores were assigned daily. RESULTS: A slight reduction in PLT transfusions per patient in SP2 compared with SP1 was not statistically significant (odds ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-1.33; p = 0.416), yet a significantly higher proportion of patients in SP2 had PLT counts less than or equal to 10 x 10(9) per L compared to SP1 (p < 0.001). In patients who bled, however, there was no excess exposure to low PLT counts before bleeding started. A substantial number of patients who bled received PLT transfusions above the goal before bleeding started (82.9% in SP2, 41.5% in SP1) because of medical complications that associated with increased risk of bleeding. Bleeding incidence was similar in both study periods (21.9% in SP1, 16.4% in SP2; p = 0.526). Bleeding was significantly associated with reduced survival in both study periods. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who bled were usually placed on a higher threshold before the onset of their major bleeding event and were not exposed to additional risk of bleeding from thrombocytopenia. Similarity in bleeding incidence between study periods appears to associate with adjustments to high-risk conditions and may not reflect consequences of the lower transfusion threshold.","['Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Bunting Blaustein Cancer Research Building, Baltimore, Maryland, USA. snevo@netvision.net.il']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently reported efficient transient genetic labeling of human CD34+ HPC with the truncated low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (DeltaLNGFR) for in vivo application. Here we investigate whether HPC labeling with DeltaLNGFR affects lineage-specific cell differentiation, whether DeltaLNGFR expression is maintained during lineage-specific cell differentiation and which leukemia cell line might be an appropriate cell culture model for human CD34+ HPC. Human CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells and various leukemia cell lines were characterized by immunophenotyping. Cells were transfected using nucleofection. Hematopoietic differentiation was studied by colony-forming assays. DeltaLNGFR expression was assessed using reverse transcription-PCR, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Nucleofection was efficient and did not significantly reduce hematopoietic cell differentiation. Mature myeloid cells (CD66b+) derived from human CD34+ HPC and Mutz2 cells maintained DeltaLNGFR expression at a high percentage (70 +/- 2% and 58 +/- 2%, respectively). Mutz2 cells may serve as an in vitro model for human myeloid HPC.

Arguably the most important consideration for stem cell-based therapies is the ability to precisely direct the differentiation of stem cells along a preferred cellular lineage. During development, lineage commitment is a multistep process requiring the activation and repression of sets of genes at various stages, from an ES cell identity to a tissue-specific stem cell identity and beyond. Thus, the challenge is to ensure that the pattern of genomic regulation is recapitulated during the in vitro differentiation of ES cells into stem/progenitor cells of the appropriate tissue in a robust, predictable and stable manner. To address this issue, we must understand the ontogeny of tissue-specific stem cells during normal embryogenesis and compare the ontogeny of tissue-specific stem cells in ES cell models. Here, we discuss the issue of directed differentiation of pluripotent ES cells into neural stem cells, which is fundamentally linked to two early events in the development of the mammalian nervous system: the 'decision' of the ectoderm to acquire a neural identity (neural determination) and the origin of neural stem cells within this neural-committed population of cells. A clearer understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that govern mammalian neural cell fate determination will lead to improved ES technology applications in neural regeneration.","['Department of Cell & Systems Biology, University of Toronto, ON, Canada.']",,,,,134,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of HL-60 cells with 50-400 microg/ml acetone fraction of bamboo leaf for 72 hr inhibited cell proliferation and induced a little increase in cell differentiation, as demonstrated by the MTT and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction assay. Interestingly, synergistic induction of HL-60 cell differentiation was observed when the acetone fraction of bamboo leaf was combined with either 5 nM 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) or 50 nM all-trans RA. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that combinations of 1,25-(OH)(2)D(3) and the acetone fraction of bamboo leaf stimulated differentiation predominantly to monocytes, whereas combinations of all-trans RA and the acetone fraction of bamboo leaf stimulated differentiation predominantly to granulocytes.

The prototypal human fMLP receptor 1 (FPR1) was cloned in 1990 from a differentiated HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell cDNA library. In transfected cells, FPR1 binds fMLP with high affinity and is activated by picomolar to low nanomolar concentrations of fMLP in chemotaxis and calcium ion mobilization assays. Two additional human genes, designated FPR-like 1 (FPRL1) and FPR-like 2 (FPRL2), were later isolated by low-stringency hybridization using FPR1 cDNA as a probe, and these were shown to cluster with FPR1 on chromosome 19q13.3. In avian models the fMLP effects and the possible expression of FPRs have been poorly investigated. In this study we demonstrated that stimulation with fMLP of cultured cells isolated from the 10-day chick embryo brain causes superoxide anion and nitric oxide release and protein phosphorylation at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. These effects were abrogated by pretreatment with pertussis toxin, suggesting the involvement of a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Although specific N-formyl peptide receptors have so far been demonstrated only in mammals, a specific polyclonal antihuman-FPR1 antibody proved to bind to the membrane of both neurons and glial cells isolated from the chick brain. Immunoblot analysis revealed a single band corresponding to 60 kDa ca. A BLAST search and aa sequence alignments demonstrated that a number of avian 7-transmembrane (7TM) GPCRs share some homologies with the human FPR1. Furthermore, the CXCR4 ligand, SDF-1alpha, seems to compete with the antihuman-FPR1 polyclonal antibody used in our experiments. We thus advance the hypothesis that in birds one (or more) of the expressed 7TM GPCRs, most probably chemokine receptors belonging to the CXCR4 subfamily, also may act as fMLP receptors.","['Department of Human Anatomy and Histology, University of Bari, Bari, Italy. ma.panaro@anatomia.uniba.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the nature, origin and kinetics of the anti-leukemic T-cell responses involved. METHODS: We used quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) for interferongamma mRNA production (IFN-gamma) and PR1/HLA-A*0201 tetramer staining to detect PR1-specific CD8+ T-cell activity in a donor and a patient with CML. Unbiased strand switch anchored RT-PCR was used to further characterize specific clones in PR1 sorted CD8+ T-cell populations. RESULTS: We identified PR1-specific CD8(+) T-cell clones from a donor pre-transplant, and demonstrated their transfer in the recipient's blood post-SCT using molecular tracking of Ag-specific T-cell receptors. PR1-specific CD8(+) T-cell populations were polyclonal, with a range of functional avidities for cognate Ag, and displayed predominantly effector memory phenotype early post-SCT, suggesting active stimulation in vivo. Expansion of these PR1-specific CD8(+) T-cell clones in the recipient was followed by complete remission of CML. DISCUSSION: This report represents the first direct demonstration that PR1-specific CD8(+) T-cell clones can be transferred during SCT, and supports the feasibility of pre-transplant vaccination strategies that aim to boost the number of anti-leukemic T cells in the graft.","['Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart Lung Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.

Approximately 3 years after their gene therapy, tragically, 3 of these children, all from the same trial, developed leukemia as a result of this experimental treatment. The current understanding of the mechanism behind this leukemogenesis involves three critical and cooperating factors, i.e., viral integration, oncogene activation, and the function of the therapeutic gene.

Epub 2007 Apr 27.,"The chimeric fusion protein AML1-ETO, created by the t(8;21) translocation, recruits histone deacetylase (HDAC) to AML1-dependent promoters, resulting in transcriptional repression of the target genes. We analyzed the transcriptional changes in t(8;21) Kasumi-1 AML cells in response to the HDAC inhibitors, depsipeptide (FK228) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), which induced marked growth inhibition and apoptosis. Using cDNA array, annexin A1 (ANXA1) was identified as one of the FK228-induced genes. Induction of ANXA1 mRNA was associated with histone acetylation in ANXA1 promoter and reversal of the HDAC-dependent suppression of C/EBPalpha by AML1-ETO with direct recruitment of C/EBPalpha to ANXA1 promoter. This led to increase in the N-terminal cleaved isoform of ANXA1 protein and accumulation of ANXA1 on cell membrane. Neutralization with anti-ANXA1 antibody or gene silencing with ANXA1 siRNA inhibited FK228-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the upregulation of endogenous ANXA1 promotes cell death. FK228-induced ANXA1 expression was associated with massive increase in cell attachment and engulfment of Kasumi-1 cells by human THP-1-derived macrophages, which was completely abrogated with ANXA1 knockdown via siRNA transfection or ANXA1 neutralization. These findings identify a novel mechanism of action of HDAC inhibitors, which induce the expression and externalization of ANXA1 in leukemic cells, which in turn mediates the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells by macrophages.","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neoplastic cells often show profound epigenetic alterations that contribute to tumorigenesis by altering expression of critical genes. In colorectal tumorigenesis, detailed analysis led to a hypothesis on a critical role for epigenetic changes in age-related cancer susceptibility and separately identified a distinct phenotype termed the CpG island methylator phenotype. CpG island methylator phenotype-positive colorectal cancers have significant associations with female sex, older age, proximal location, mucinous histology, KRAS and BRAF mutations, wild-type p53, and microsatellite instability. Histone modifications that affect chromatin structures are also closely implicated in tumor suppressor gene inactivation and DNA methylation and histone modifications seem to form reinforcing networks for stable gene silencing. Much of the excitement in this field relates to the possibility of therapeutic reversal of epigenetic changes by chromatin-modifying drugs. In CpG island methylator phenotype-positive colorectal cancers, DNA methylation inhibitors restore key silenced pathways in vivo (eg, mismatch repair defects), and hypomethylation can largely abolish tumorigenesis in a mouse model. Drugs that inhibit DNA methylation and histone deacetylation are in use in the clinic and should be tested in colorectal malignancy.","['Department of Leukemia, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']","['CA098006/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA105346/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,94,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 26.,"In normal hematopoiesis, proliferation is tightly linked to differentiation in ways that involve cell-cell interaction with stromal elements in the bone marrow stem cell niche. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies strongly support a role for Notch signaling in the regulation of stem cell renewal and hematopoiesis. Not surprisingly, mutations in the Notch gene have been linked to a number of types of malignancies. To better define the function of Notch in both normal and neoplastic hematopoiesis, a tetracycline-inducible system regulating expression of a ligand-independent, constitutively active form of Notch1 was introduced into murine E14Tg2a embryonic stem cells. During coculture, OP9 stromal cells induce the embryonic stem cells to differentiate first to hemangioblasts and subsequently to hematopoietic stem cells. Our studies indicate that activation of Notch signaling in flk+ hemangioblasts dramatically reduces their survival and proliferative capacity and lowers the levels of hematopoietic stem cell markers CD34 and c-Kit and the myeloid marker CD11b.

Epub 2007 Apr 26.,"We used the nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mouse model to assess the repopulation potential of subpopulations of mobilized human CD34+ peripheral blood progenitor cells (PBPC). First, PBPC were transduced with gamma-retrovirus vector RD114-MFGS-CFP, which requires cell division for successful transduction, at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 72 hours to achieve 96% cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-positive cells. Cells were sorted 12 hours after the last transduction into CFP-positive (divided cells) and CFP-negative populations. CFP-positive cells were transplanted postsort, whereas the CFP-negative cells were retransduced and injected at 120 hours. The CFP-negative sorted and retransduced cells contained markedly fewer vector copies and resulted in a 32-fold higher overall engraftment and in a 13-fold higher number of engrafted transgene positive cells. To assess cell proliferation as an underlying cause for the different engraftment levels, carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester-labeling of untransduced PBPC was performed to track the number of cell divisions. At 72 hours after initiation of culture, when 95% of all cells have divided, PBPC were sorted into nondivided and divided fractions and transplanted into NOD/SCID mice. Nondivided cells demonstrated 45-fold higher engraftment than divided cells. Late dividing PBPC in ex vivo culture retain high expression of the stem cell marker CD133, whereas rapidly proliferating cells lose CD133 in correlation to the number of cell divisions. Our studies demonstrate that late dividing progenitors transduced with gamma-retroviral vectors contribute most to NOD/SCID engraftment and transgene marking. Confining the gamma-retroviral transduction to CD133-positive cells on days 3 and 4 could greatly reduce the number of transplanted vector copies, limiting the risk of leukemia from insertional mutagenesis.

Epub 2007 Apr 26.,"BACKGROUND: Molecular-level differentiation of neoplastic cells is essential for accurate and early diagnosis, but effective molecular probes for molecular analysis and profiling of neoplastic cells are not yet available. We recently developed a cell-based SELEX (systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment) strategy to generate aptamers (designer DNA/RNA probes) as molecular probes to recognize neoplastic cells. METHODS: We tested 6 cell-SELEX-generated aptamers with equilibrium dissociation constants in the nanomolar to subnanomolar range: sgd5, selected from Toledo cells, a human diffuse large-cell lymphoma cell line (B-cell), and sgc8, sgc3, sgc4, sgd2, and sgd3 from CCRF-CEM cells, a human precursor T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cell line. Aptamers were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorophores and then used to recognize, by flow cytometric analysis, neoplastic cells in cultured hematopoietic cell lines and clinical samples. RESULTS: Aptamer sgd5 recognized only its target cells. Aptamers sgc3, sgd2, sgd3, sgc4, and sgc8, selected from a T-cell leukemia cell line, identified all of the cultured T-cell leukemia cell lines with relatively high fluorescence intensity. Aptamers sgc8, sgc3, and sgd3 showed good selectivity toward T-ALL cells and almost no binding to normal hematopoietic cells or lymphoma and myeloma cells. Selected aptamers also detected targets on the cell membranes of neoplastic cells in patient samples. CONCLUSIONS: Aptamers selected against cultured neoplastic cells can effectively be used as molecular probes for recognition of neoplastic cells in patient samples. Cell-based aptamer selection can be used to generate aptamer probes to obtain molecular signatures of neoplastic cells in patient samples.","['Department of Chemistry, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 26.,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is commonly defined as a disease of failed apoptosis of B cells and remains an incurable disease. The mechanism of resistance to apoptosis in CLL is complex and influenced by numerous factors, including nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB)-mediated expression of antiapoptotic molecules. Recent evidence indicates that glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) positively regulates NFkappaB-mediated gene transcription and cell survival. Using malignant B cells collected from patients with CLL, we find that both GSK-3beta and NFkappaB accumulate in the nucleus of CLL B cells, and pharmacologic inhibition of GSK-3 results in decreased expression of two NFkappaB target genes Bcl-2 and XIAP and a subsequent increase in CLL B-cell apoptosis ex vivo. Furthermore, we observed that inhibition of GSK-3 leads to a decrease in NFkappaB-mediated gene transcription but does not affect the nuclear accumulation of NFkappaB in CLL B cells. Last, using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that GSK-3 inhibition abrogates NFkappaB binding to its target gene promoters (XIAP, Bcl-2), in part through epigenetic modification of histones. Our results establish that inhibition of GSK-3 abrogates NFkappaB binding to its target gene promoters through an epigenetic mechanism, enhances apoptosis in CLL B cells ex vivo and identifies GSK-3 as a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of CLL.","['Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, USA.']","['CA09724/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241-05/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P50 CA102701/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 CA102701/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241-02S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA102701/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA095241/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1924475,,,,,,,,,,,

Primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells form a multicellular system, but a previous report states that Cx32 is not expressed in the bone marrow. Thus, a question arises as to why Cx molecules are not detected in the hematopoietic tissue other than in stromal cells. Based on our preliminary study, which suggested a potential impairment of hematopoiesis in Cx32-knockout (KO) mice, the objectives of the present study were to determine whether Cx32 functions in the bone marrow during steady-state hematopoiesis and to examine its possible protective roles during regeneration after chemical abrasions and during leukemogenesis after the administration of a secondary genotoxic chemical, methyl nitrosourea (MNU). As a result, the Cx32 molecule, functioning in the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment during steady-state hematopoiesis, was observed for the first time; the expressions of Cx32 at the mRNA level, as determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis, and at the protein level, determined using an anti-Cx32 antibody, were observed only in the lin(-)c-kit(+) HSC fraction, using a combination of immunobead-density gradient and immunomagnetic bead separation. Hematopoiesis was impaired in the absence of Cx32, and it was delayed during regeneration after chemical abrasion with 5-fluorouracil at 150 mg/kg body wt in Cx32-KO mice. Cx32-KO mice showed increased leukemogenicity compared with wild-type mice after MNU injection; furthermore, in a competitive assay for leukemogenicity in mice that had been lethally irradiated and repopulated with a mixed population of bone marrow cells from Cx32-KO mice and wild-type mice, the resulting leukemias originated predominantly from Cx32-KO bone marrow cells. In summary, the role of Cx32 in hematopoiesis was not previously recognized, and Cx32 was expressed only in HSCs and their progenitor cells. The results indicate that Cx32 in wild-type mice protects HSCs from chemical abrasion and leukemogenic impacts.","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Toxicology, Center for Biological Safety and Research, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 25.,"Mcl-1 is an antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family member that is highly regulated and when dysregulated contributes to cancer. The Mcl-1 protein is phosphorylated at multiple sites in response to different signaling events. Phosphorylations at Thr163 (by ERK) and Ser159 (by glycogen-synthase kinase 3beta) have recently been shown to slow and enhance, respectively, Mcl-1 protein turnover. Phosphorylation is also known to be stimulated at other, as-yet uncharacterized sites in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Using an S peptide-tagged Mcl-1 T163A mutant, Ser64 was identified as a novel Mcl-1 phosphorylation site by mass spectrometry. Immunoblotting demonstrated that phosphorylation at this site was maximal in cells in G2/M phase, was enhanced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) treatment, was blocked by inhibitors of CDK (but not ERK or glycogen-synthase kinase 3beta), and was stimulated in vitro by CDK 1, CDK2, and JNK1. The half-life of a nonphosphorylatable S64A Mcl-1 mutant was indistinguishable from that of the wild type polypeptide. In contrast, this mutant failed to protect cells from TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, whereas reconstitution with the phosphomimetic S64E Mcl-1 mutant rendered cells TRAIL-resistant. This anti-apoptotic phenotype of the S64E Mcl-1 mutant was also associated with enhanced binding to the proapoptotic proteins Bim, Noxa, and Bak. A pharmacological CDK inhibitor that reduced Ser64 phosphorylation also sensitized cells to TRAIL cytotoxicity. Collectively, these observations not only identify G2/M-associated phosphorylation at Ser64 as a critical determinant of the antiapoptotic activity of Mcl-1 but also elucidate a novel mechanism by which CDK1/2 inhibitors can enhance the effectiveness of the cytotoxic cytokine TRAIL.","['Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905; Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755.', 'Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905; Division of Oncology Research, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, Rochester, Minnesota 55905.

We have analyzed the molecular determinants of myeloma sensitivity to Apo2L/TRAIL.0 in a number of MM cell lines, the mechanisms of resistance and a possible way of overcoming it. Expression of one death receptor for Apo2L/TRAIL (DR4 or DR5) is sufficient to transduce death signals, though DR5 was more efficient when both receptors were present. Membrane expression of decoy receptors (DcR1, DcR2) and intracellular levels of c-FLIP(L), XIAP and Mcl-1 were not predictive of resistance to Apo2L/TRAIL. Inhibition of Mcl-1 degradation did not prevent Apo2L/TRAIL-induced apoptosis. In IM-9 cells, resistance was associated to a reduced caspase-8 expression. U266 cells, though expressing significant levels of DR4 and caspase-8, were nevertheless resistant to Apo2L/TRAIL. This resistance could be overcome by co-treatment with valproic acid (VPA), a histone deacetylase inhibitor. VPA caused the redistribution of DR4 to plasma membrane lipid rafts and restored DR4 signaling. Overexpression of Mcl-1 in U266 cells did not prevent Apo2L/TRAIL cytotoxicity in VPA-sensitized cells. These results, taken together, support the possible use of Apo2L/TRAIL.0 in the treatment of MM.","['Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular y Celular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transplants were divided into four groups according to the combination of group A and B KIR haplotypes in the transplant donor and recipient. Overall survival of myeloid patients varied with KIR genotype combination. Best survival was associated with the donor lacking and the recipient having group B KIR haplotypes; poorest survival was associated with the donor having and the recipient lacking group B KIR haplotypes. The latter combination was also associated with increased relapse and acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, its detrimental effects were seen only for transplants where the recipient and donor were homozygous for the C1 KIR ligand and therefore lacked the C2 ligand. Presence of the Bw4 ligand was also associated with increased acute GVHD. In contrast presence of both KIR3DL1 and its cognate Bw4 ligand was associated with decreased nonrelapse mortality. Analysis of the KIR genes individually revealed KIR2DS3 as a protective factor for chronic GVHD. The results suggest how simple assessments of KIR genotype might inform the selection of donors for hematopoietic cell transplantation.","['Department of Structural Biology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USA.']","['P01 CA049605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49605/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1937576,,,,,['NIHMS22916'],,,,,,

Here, we use lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) targeting BCR-ABL and the downstream signaling molecules SHP2, STAT5, and Gab2 to compare the efficacy and specificity of molecularly defined therapeutics with that of conventional cytotoxic drugs (cytarabine, doxorubicin, etoposide) in a conditional BCR-ABL cell culture model. IC(50) values were determined for each drug in TonB cells cultured either with interleukin-3 (IL-3) or BCR-ABL, and molecularly defined therapies were studied using lentivirally expressed shRNAs. We demonstrate that conventional anti-leukemic drugs have small or no differential effects under different cell culture conditions, whereas both imatinib and specific RNAi significantly inhibit proliferation of TonB cells in the presence of BCR-ABL but not IL-3. To study molecularly defined combination therapy, we evaluated either imatinib in TonB cells with target-specific RNAi or we used lentiviral vectors to induce combinatorial RNAi through simultaneous expression of two shRNAs. These combination therapies result in increased efficacy without loss in specificity. Interestingly, combinatorial RNAi can specifically deplete TonB cell cultures in the presence of BCR-ABL, even without targeting the oncogene itself. This model provides a tool to evaluate potential therapeutic targets and to quantify efficacy and specificity preclinically of new combination therapies in BCR-ABL-positive cells.","['Hannover Medical School, Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, and Oncology, 30625 Hannover, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rational development of drugs targeting BCR-ABL has significantly improved the treatment of CML. Imatinib (a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor) produces haematological and cytogenetic remissions across all phases of CML and is the present standard of care. Imatinib resistance occurs in a significant proportion of patients and mechanisms of resistance include BCR-ABL mutations and activation of alternate oncogenic pathways. Dasatinib is a novel, potent, multi-targeted oral kinase inhibitor. Preclinical and clinical investigations demonstrate that dasatinib effectively overcomes imatinib resistance and has further improved the treatment of CML. Dasatinib was recently approved by the FDA for use in Philadelphia-positive leukaemias in patients who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib.","['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Department of Leukaemia, Box 428, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",,,['Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2007 Jul;16(7):1135'],,64,,,,,,,,,,

But, until today, the importance of theses factors on leukemia, especially childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) has received limited attention. Therefore, this study examined the bone marrow plasma VEGF and bFGF levels in ALL patients and normal controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Bone marrow plasmas at diagnosis from 33 ALL patients (median age 5.9 years; range 1.8-13.9 years) were used for analysis. The bone marrow levels of bFGF and VEGF were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (R & D Systems) and compared with the bone marrow levels of 7 healthy control subjects (median age 11.98 years; 6 months -13.6 years). RESULTS: Average VEGF was higher in relapse ALL (N=7, 216.6 +/- 79.9pg/mL) compared to standard (N=9, 36.8 +/- 12.1pg/mL) (p=0.013) or high risk ALL (N=17, 80.0 +/- 12.2pg/mL) (p=0.023). bFGF levels were also significantly higher in relapse than standard-, or high-risk ALL patients (relapse ALL; 48.6 +/- 15.4pg/mL, standard risk ALL; 18.9 +/- 5.5pg/mL, high risk ALL; 19.0 +/- 3.5pg/mL, normal control; 18.6 +/- 4.0pg/mL) (p=0.003). Three patients with refractory relapse and death had much higher VEGF and bFGF values (VEGF; 420.0 +/- 81.6pg/ mL, bFGF; 85.6 +/- 3.2pg/mL). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the increased levels of VEGF and bFGF in bone marrow may play an important role in prognosis of childhood ALL.","['Department of Pediatrics, College of Medicine, Chung-Ang University, 224-1 Heukseok-Dong, Dongjak-Gu, Seoul, Korea.']",,,,PMC2628125,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 19-year-old male was treated in the Department of Haematology of the Medical University in Warsaw due to the AML. Conditional chemotherapy was applied, according to the BuCy 4 + ATG regimen and allogeneic haematopoietic cells transplantation from an unrelated donor. He was receiving palifermin intravenously for 3 consecutive days immediately before the initiation of conditioning therapy and after allogeneic PBSCT. On day +3 the oral mucous membrane was pale and swollen, with linea alba visible on cheeks. Superficial glossitis and viral pharyngitis were noted. Beginning with day +5/+6 proliferative gingivitis was observed. On day +9 gingival contour was altered and the gingiva covered nearly completely tooth crowns of all teeth. The gingiva were whitened, as if covered by thick epithelium. Slight gingival hyperplasia was still observed on day +24. Since day +4/+5 skin rash coexisted, spreading over hairy head skin, face, dorsum and chest. Disseminated papulopustular (acne-like) lesions were observed, some of them related to the hair follicles. Skin changes were present till day +15. CONCLUSIONS: Palifermin is an efficient pharmaceutical in mucositis prevention in patients after allogeneic PBSC transplantation. Transient complication of hyperplastic gingivitis with a concomitant skin eczema of a papulopustular nature arose.","['Department of Periodontology and Oral Diseases, Medical University of Warsaw, Poland. sluzowki@o2.pl']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the effect of this fusion in a mouse model, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone containing both human SIL and SCL genes was isolated, and loxP sites were inserted into intron 1 of both the SIL and SCL genes, corresponding to the sites at which recombination occurs in human T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia patients. This BAC clone was used to generate transgenic SILloxloxSCL mice. These transgenic mice were subsequently bred to Lck-Cre mice that express the Cre recombinase specifically in the thymus. The BAC transgene was recombined between the two loxP sites in over 50% of the thymocytes from SILloxloxSCL/Cre double-transgenic mice, bringing the SCL gene under the direct control of SIL regulatory elements. Aberrant SCL gene expression in the thymus was verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Using FACS analysis, we found that mice carrying both SILloxloxSCL and Cre transgenes have increased CD4-/CD8- thymocytes compared with transgene-negative mice. In the spleen, these transgenic mice show a marked reduction in the number of mature CD4+ or CD8+ cells. These results demonstrate that conditional activation of SCL under control of SIL regulatory elements can impair normal T-cell development.","['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Naval Medical Center, Building 8, Room 5101, 8901 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda, MD 20889-5105, USA.']",['Z01 SC010379-06/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC1854848,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 26.,"Data on secondary acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (sALL) following ALL treatment are very rare. However, the incidence might be underestimated as sALLs without a significant lineage shift might automatically be diagnosed as relapses. Examination of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements brought a new tool that can help in discrimination between relapse and sALL. We focused on the recurrences of childhood ALL to discover the real frequency of the sALL after ALL treatment. We compared clonal markers in matched presentation and recurrence samples of 366 patients treated according to the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-based protocols. We found two cases of sALL and another three, where the recurrence is suspicious of being sALL rather than relapse. Our proposal for the 'secondary ALL after ALL' diagnostic criteria is as follows: (A) No clonal relationship between diagnosis and recurrence; (B) significant immunophenotypic shift--significant cytogenetic shift--gain/loss of a fusion gene. For the sALL (A) plus at least one (B) criterion should be fulfilled. With these criteria, the estimated frequency of the sALL after ALL is according to our data 0.5-1.5% of ALL recurrences on BFM-based protocols. Finally, we propose a treatment strategy for the patients with secondary disease.","['CLIP (Childhood Leukaemia Investigation Prague), Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Charles University, 2nd Medical School, Prague, Czech Republic. jan.zuna@lfmotol.cuni.cz']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 26.,"Disruption of pathways leading to programmed cell death plays a major role in most malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). ABT-737 is a BH3 mimetic small-molecule inhibitor that binds with high affinity to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, preventing the sequestration of proapoptotic molecules and shifting the cell survival/apoptosis balance toward apoptosis induction. In this study, we show that ABT-737 is cytotoxic to MM cell lines, including those resistant to conventional therapies, and primary tumor cells. Flow cytometric analysis of intracellular levels of Bcl-2 family proteins demonstrates a clear inversion of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio leading to induction of apoptosis. Activation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was indicated by mitochondrial membrane depolarization and caspase cleavage. Additionally, several signaling pathways known to be important for MM cell survival are disrupted following treatment with ABT-737. The impact of ABT-737 on survival could not be overcome by the addition of interleukin-6, vascular endothelial growth factor or insulin-like growth factor, suggesting that ABT-737 may be effective in preventing the growth and survival signals provided by the microenvironment. These data indicate that therapies targeting apoptotic pathways may be effective in MM treatment and warrant clinical evaluation of ABT-737 and similar drugs alone or in combination with other agents in the setting of MM.","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['P50 CA100707/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Sixty-one patients were randomized to either sirolimus (n=31) or cyclosporine (n=30) after basiliximab induction and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) with steroids. Sirolimus was concentration controlled at 10-12 ng/mL for at least 6 months. RESULTS: After 5 years, sirolimus-MMF-steroids compared to cyclosporine-MMF-steroids provides similar patient survival (87.1 vs. 90%, P=0.681), acute rejection rates (12.9 vs. 23.3%, P=0.22), total cholesterol (209.1 vs. 204.3 mg/dL, P=0.973), urine protein/creatinine ratios (0.398 vs. 0.478 mg/dL, P=0.72), and overall medical and surgical morbidity (P=NS). Although unadjusted patient survival was similar, sirolimus based CNI-free patients had longer death censored graft survival (96.4 vs. 76.7%, P=0.0265), higher glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by the abbreviated Modified Diet in Renal Disease (66.7 vs. 50.7 cc/min, P=0.0075), and fewer graft losses from chronic allograft nephropathy. The Banff chronic scores at two years were strong predictors of 5-year GFR. At 5 years, there were six de novo (three solid organ, three skin) cancers in the CNI group and only two de novo (one skin, one leukemia, no solid organ) cancers in the sirolimus group (P=NS). CONCLUSIONS: This study of low to moderate risk patients demonstrates that excellent 5-year kidney transplant outcomes can be achieved without CNI drugs, when therapeutic drug monitoring of sirolimus is employed. The application of CNI drug avoidance protocols to high-risk recipients (retransplants, highly sensitized, etc.), extrarenal allograft recipients, or alternative drug regimens such as steroid or MMF elimination should be subjected to controlled trials.","['Transplant Center/Glickman Urological Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. flechns@ccf.org']",,,,,,,,,,['Nefrologia. 2008;28 Suppl 2:36-7.

These studies do not reveal anything about the nucleus or genome in nonproliferating cells, which may be relevant for the regulation of both proliferation and replicative senescence. Here, we provide an overview of what is known about the genome and nuclear structure in senescent cells. We review the evidence that nuclear structures, such as the nuclear lamina, nucleoli, the nuclear matrix, nuclear bodies (such as promyelocytic leukemia bodies), and nuclear morphology all become altered within growth-arrested or senescent cells. Specific alterations to the genome in senescent cells, as compared to young proliferating cells, are described, including aneuploidy, chromatin modifications, chromosome positioning, relocation of heterochromatin, and changes to telomeres.","['Laboratory of Nuclear and Genomic Health, Centre for Cell and Chromosome Biology, Biosciences, School of Health Sciences and Social Care, Brunel University, West London, UB8 3PH, UK.']",,,,,110,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 25.,"The inactivation of synaptic serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is largely established through the actions of the presynaptic, antidepressant-sensitive 5-HT transporter (SERT, SLC6A4). Recent studies have demonstrated post-translational regulation of SERT mediated by multiple Ser/Thr kinases, including protein kinases C and G (PKC and PKG) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), as well as the Ser/Thr phosphatase PP2A. Less well studied are specific surface receptors that target these signaling pathways to control SERT surface expression and/or catalytic rates. Using rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 cell line (RBL-2H3), we previously established that activation of A(3) adenosine receptors (A(3)AR) stimulates SERT activity via both PKG and p38 MAPK (Zhu et al., 2004a). Whether A(3)ARs regulate SERT in the central nervous system (CNS) is unknown. Here we report that the A(3)AR agonist N(6)-(3-iodobenzyl)-N-methyl-5'carbamoyladenosine (IB-MECA) rapidly (10 min) and selectively stimulates 5-HT transport in mouse midbrain, hippocampal, and cortical synaptosomes. IB-MECA-induced stimulation of 5-HT uptake is blocked by the selective A(3)AR antagonist 3-ethyl-5-benzyl-2-methyl-phenylethynyl-6-phenyl-1,4(+/-)dihydropyridine-3,5-dica rboxylate (MRS1191) and is absent from synaptosomes prepared from A(3)AR knockout mice. Kinetic analyses demonstrate that IB-MECA induces an increase of 5-HT transport V(max) with no significant change in K(m). As in RBL-2H3 cells, IB-MECA stimulation of synaptosomal 5-HT uptake can be blocked by preincubation with PKG antagonists N-[2-(methylamino)ethy]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide (H8) and DT-2 (YGRKKRRQRRRPPLRK(5)H), as well as by the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 [4-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(4-methylsulfinylphenyl)-5-(4-pyridyl)-1H-imidazole]. Chronoamperometry studies in the anesthetized rat hippocampus support a role for A(3)ARs in SERT regulation in vivo. Together, these results identify a novel, region-specific action of CNS A(3)ARs in the modulation of SERT-mediated 5-HT transport that may be relevant for the etiology and/or therapy of 5-HT-linked brain disorders.","['Department of Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN 37232, USA.']",['DA07390/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, we showed that NRG1+/- mutant mice display behavioral abnormalities that are reversed by clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug used for the treatment of schizophrenia. We now present evidence that ErbB4 (v-erb-a erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 4), the tyrosine kinase receptor for NRG1 in hippocampal neurons, interacts with two nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, Fyn and Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2). NRG1 stimulation of cells expressing ErbB4 and Fyn leads to the association of Fyn with ErbB4 and consequent activation. Furthermore, we show that NRG1 signaling, through activation of Fyn and Pyk2 kinases, stimulates phosphorylation of Y1472 on the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor (NMDAR), a key regulatory site that modulates channel properties. NR2B Y1472 is hypophosphorylated in NRG1+/- mutant mice, and this defect can be reversed by clozapine at a dose that reverses their behavioral abnormalities. We also demonstrate that short-term synaptic plasticity is altered and theta-burst long-term potentiation is impaired in NRG1+/- mutant mice, and incubation of hippocampal slices from these mice with NRG1 reversed those effects. Attenuated NRG1 signaling through ErbB4 may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia through dysfunction of NMDAR modulation. Thus, our data support the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia.","['deCODE Genetics, 101 Reykjavik, Iceland.']",,,,PMC6672983,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the xenosupport systems may run risk of cross-transfer of animal pathogens from the other animal feeder, matrix to the PGCs, then influencing later transgenic technology. In this study, chicken PGCs were identified by alkaline phosphatase, stage-specific embryonic antigen-1 and Oct-4 immunocytochemical stainings. Three different homologous somatic cell feeder layers (chicken embryonic fibroblast feeder layer, CEF; embryonic skeletal myoblast feeder layer; follicular granulosa cell feeder layer) were used to support growth and proliferation of PGCs to find a better supporting culture system. In addition, the effects of fetal calf serum (FCS), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and the combination of insulin, transferring and selenite (ITS) on PGC proliferation were compared. Results showed that CEF was the best supporter for PGC growth and proliferation, which was verified by 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine incorporation stain. FCS alone or in combination with LIF could significantly promote PGC proliferation in the presence of CEF in ITS medium. This study will contribute to providing a safer supporting system for chicken PGC amplification in vitro, and may be applied in transgenic chicken production and transplantation therapy.","['College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310029, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 24.,"Transforming Growth Factor-beta (TGFbeta) is known to be a negative regulator of G1 cyclin/cdk activity. It is not clear whether TGFbeta has any effect on G2 checkpoint kinases. We have found that TGFbeta downregulated the expression of several G2 checkpoint kinases including cdc2, cyclin B1, and cdc25c without causing cell accumulation in G2/M phases in two human leukemia cell lines. The inhibition was time-dependent with a maximal inhibition being observed by 24h for cyclin B1 and cdc2 and by 48h for cdc25c. The inhibition was not a result of G1 arrest but a direct effect of TGFbeta which downregulates their expression at mRNA level. In proliferating cells, there was a significant formation of cdc2-pRb complexes, which was decreased to 30% of control levels by 48h after initiating TGFbeta treatment. Cdc2 showed a marked kinase activity on GST-Rb protein in proliferating cells detected by in vitro kinase assay, which was downregulated in response to TGFbeta. In addition, TGFbeta caused a rapid and transient dephosphorylation of cdc2 (Tyr15) and cdc25c (Ser216) for about 2-3h before a dramatic decrease of both molecules by 48h. Taken together, our data suggest that TGFbeta has a direct inhibitory effect on G2 checkpoint kinases, which is regulated at mRNA level. The transient activation of cdc2 and cdc25c and subsequent inhibition of cdc2, cyclin B1, and cdc25c could amplify TGFbeta-induced G1 arrest and growth inhibition.","['Interdisciplinary Oncology Program, University of South Florida, H Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute, Tampa, FL 33161, USA. xthu@mail.barry.edu']",['CA082589/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 24.,"PURPOSE: Vaults are multi-subunit structures that may be involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, with the major vault protein (MVP or lung resistance-related protein [LRP]) being the main component. The MVP gene is located on chromosome 16 close to the multidrug resistance-associated protein and protein kinase c-beta genes. The role of MVP in cancer drug resistance has been demonstrated in various cell lines as well as in ovarian carcinomas and acute myeloid leukemia, but nothing is known about its possible role in radiation resistance. Our aim was to examine this in head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS AND MATERIALS: Archived biopsy material was obtained for 78 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx who received primary radiotherapy with curative intent. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect MVP expression. Locoregional failure and cancer-specific survival were estimated using cumulative incidence and Cox multivariate analyses. RESULTS: In a univariate and multivariate analysis, MVP expression was strongly associated with both locoregional failure and cancer-specific survival. After adjustment for disease site, stage, grade, anemia, smoking, alcohol, gender, and age, the estimated hazard ratio for high MVP (2/3) compared with low (0/1) was 4.98 (95% confidence interval, 2.17-11.42; p = 0.0002) for locoregional failure and 4.28 (95% confidence interval, 1.85-9.95; p = 0.001) for cancer-specific mortality. CONCLUSION: These data are the first to show that MVP may be a useful prognostic marker associated with radiotherapy resistance in a subgroup of patients with HNSCC.","['Department of Academic Radiation Oncology, The University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tested compounds exhibited concentration-dependent cytotoxic effects at low micromolar concentrations. Ten of the Mannich bases characterized by significant activity in BV-173 were further evaluated against the chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K-562 and were found to suppress the growth of these cells at relatively higher concentrations as compared to the former tumor model. Selected Mannich bases induced programmed cell death in BV-173 at a concentration of 2.5muM as evidenced by the encountered DNA-laddering.

METHODS: The bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) from 17 patients with leukemia AML-M(2)a before inductive treatment were divided into 3 groups according to the duration of CCR(1): Group A (n = 11) with the CCR(1) duration exceeding 12 months, Group B (n = 6) with the CCR(1) duration less than 6 months, and Group C, including the 3 cases of Group B with relapse. The proteins of the BMMNC were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, part of the differentially-expressed proteins were identified by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). RESULTS: 6 differentially-expressed proteins were identified between Groups A and B by MALDI-TOF-MS: tubulin-specific chaperone B, myeloperoxidase, the CH domain of human transgelin-2, glutathione S-transferase, zinc finger protein, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Three differentially-expressed proteins were identified in Group C: NAD (P) H dehydrogenase, hypothetical protein, and HES1.

METHODS: Bone marrow cells were obtained from a family with cases of familial acute myelocytic leukemia for successive 4 generations. Super SMART cDNA synthesis and suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) were performed to set up a subtractive cDNA library of specially or highly expressed genes. The white clones were screened and identified by modified differential screening technique in which the probes were labeled with digoxin/deoxyuridine 5'-triphosphate. Positive clones were sequenced and compared with the known sequences in the public databases of GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ using NCBI BLAST for homology analysis. The unknown fragments were then submitted to GenBank. RESULTS: A subtractive library of differentially expressed genes for the family with cases of familial acute myelocytic leukemia was constructed successfully. After differential screening, 28 effective sequences were confirmed to be positive differentially expressed gene fragments and were submitted to GenBank for homology analysis. Then 17 sequences were identified as a part of known genes, and the rests were verified as unknown fragments. CONCLUSION: SSH is an effective approach to isolate differentially expressed genes.

METHODS: By construction and optimization a set of specific primes (totally 82 primers), an array containing 66 parallel PCR reactions was developed. That array was used on the specimens of bone marrow or peripheral blood from 31 patients with leukemia to detect simultaneously 37 fusion genes and 4 proto-oncogene activations often occurring in patients with leukemia. Eva Green fluorescent dye method was chosen in the protocol. Relative quantification was performed by Ct analysis and the result was expressed as the ratio of the target gene versus the internal control gene (ABL). Six patients with chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML) among the 31 cases underwent prior to and after treatment so as to study the expression changes of fusion genes and/or proto-oncogene. RESULTS: The established PCR array showed high efficiency of amplification and good sensibility (232 copies/microl) in the fusion gene detected. The standard curve had a satisfying linear range (10(2) approximately 10(8) copies/microl), showing a good reproducibility. Fourteen fusion genes, including PML/RARalpha, PLZF/RARalpha, BCR/ABL, MLL/AF1, MLL/AF6, MLL/AF10, AML/Eto, CBFbeta/MYH11, TLS/ERG, TEL/AML1, MOZ/CBP, MLL/hCDCrel, LAF4/MLLT2, and FIP1L1/PDGFRalpha, and activation of all 4 proto-oncogenes were found in the 31 samples. In one patient, 5 fusion genes and activation of 2 proto-oncogenes were observed. Such results were compared with those of RT-nested PCR in 28 samples. The comparison showed that this array was a bit less sensitive than RT-nested PCR, however, without significant difference between them (P = 0.009). The expression of BCR/ABL fusion gene, WT1 gene, and EVI1 gene decreased after treatment in the 6 CML patients, which was in accordance with the clinical features. CONCLUSION: The PCR array newly-established successfully detects various leukemia related fusion genes and proto-oncogene activation. It is useful in molecule diagnosis and monitoring minimal residual disease in leukemia, and therapeutic effect monitoring.","['Daopei Hospital, Beijing 100034, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The total cellular proteins from the RA sensitive cells of the line NB4 and the RA resistant cells of the line MR2 obtained from a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) were separated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and analyzed by PDQuest v7.1 analysis software to screen the differential protein spots. Differentially expressed spots were analyzed by mass spectrometry for peptide mass finger (PMF) data and identified by Mascot software and SWISS-PROT protein database. The differentially expressed proteins were verified by Western blotting assay and semi-quantification RT-PCR. RESULTS: 2-DE patterns of APL cell lines with high-resolution and reproducibility were obtained. The average spots of the RA resistant cell line MR2 and RA sensitive cell line NB4 were 890 +/- 45 and 912 +/- 56 respectively. 57 significantly differentially expressed protein spots were screened, among which 23 protein spots were founded to be upregulated and 34 protein spots down regulated in the RA resistant cell line MR2. 25 differential protein spots were identified by mass spectrometry and 17 proteins were successfully assigned to 13 gene-reading frames, of which one was unknown function protein (FLJ00279) and the others were included in the categories of oncoprotein (DJ-1), transcription factor (MYC promoter-binding protein 1), molecule chaperone (HSP70, HSP60 and protein disulfide isomerase), metabolism protein (prohibitin, triosephosphate isomerase 1, and calreticulin), signal transduction (Rho GDP dissociation inhibitor), and cytoskeleton (ACTG1 protein, Beta 5-tubulin, and keratin 10). The results of Western blotting were similar to those of 2D-PAGE and showed differential expression of DJ-1 and calreticulin in several isoforms. Semi-quantification RT-PCR analysis showed that there was no correlation between the protein expression changes and mRNA levels of HSP70 or HSP60. Those results indicated that post-translational events might modify or shear the protein content of the specific spots. CONCLUSION: The utilization of two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry is effective in screening the all-trans RA resistance-associated proteins and could provide novel clue for study of elucidating all-trans RA resistance mechanisms.","['Department of Hematology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu 610041, China. qinhui6957@sina.com']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 26.,"Bioflavonoids are human dietary components that have been linked to the prevention of cancer in adults and the generation of specific types of leukemia in infants. While these compounds have a broad range of cellular activities, many of their genotoxic effects have been attributed to their actions as topoisomerase II poisons. However, the activities of bioflavonoids against the individual isoforms of human topoisomerase II have not been analyzed. Therefore, we characterized the activity and mechanism of action of three major classes of bioflavonoids, flavones, flavonols, and isoflavones, against human topoisomerase IIalpha and IIbeta. Genistein was the most active bioflavonoid tested and stimulated enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage approximately 10-fold. Generally, compounds were more active against topoisomerase IIbeta. DNA cleavage with both enzyme isoforms required a 5-OH and a 4'-OH and was enhanced by the presence of additional hydroxyl groups on the pendant ring. Competition DNA cleavage and topoisomerase II binding studies indicate that the 5-OH group plays an important role in mediating genistein binding, while the 4'-OH moiety contributes primarily to bioflavonoid function. Bioflavonoids do not require redox cycling for activity and function primarily by inhibiting enzyme-mediated DNA ligation. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the TOPRIM region of topoisomerase II plays a role in genistein binding. Finally, flavones, flavonols, and isoflavones with activity against purified topoisomerase IIalpha and IIbeta enhanced DNA cleavage by both isoforms in human CEM leukemia cells.

Calpain regulation is complex and activity is poorly correlated with calpain protein levels. Therefore a full understanding of calpain function requires robust methods for measuring activity. METHODS: We describe and characterize a flow cytometric method for measuring calpain activity in live cells. This method uses the BOC-LM-CMAC reagent that readily diffuses into cells where it reacts with free thiols to enhance retention. RESULTS: We show that the reagent is cleaved specifically by calpains and follows saturation kinetics. We use the assay to measure calpain activation following PDGF stimulation of rat fibroblasts. We also show that the calpain inhibitor PD150606 inhibits calpain with a K(i) of 12.5 muM and show that Mek inhibitors PD89059 and U0126 also suppress calpain activity. We also show that the assay can measure calpain activity in subpopulations of cells present in unfractionated cord blood or in HL60 human myelomonocytic leukemia cells. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that this assay is a reliable and useful method for measuring calpain activity in multiple cell types.","['Arthritis and Immune Disorder Research Centre, University Health Network, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5G 1L7.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a novel bioinformatics approach, our group recently described a novel gene fusion in PCa. This fusion involves the androgen-regulated gene TMPRSS2 and so far three members of the ETS family of transcription factors already described as rearranged in the Ewing's family of tumors. By analogy, fusion status in prostate cancer may determine clinical outcome and secondary genetic alterations as witnessed in Ewing's tumors. MATERIAL: These novel gene fusions occur in the majority of prostate cancers identified by PSA screening and are the driving mechanism for overexpression of the three members of the ETS transcription factor family, either ERG (21q22.3), ETV1 (7p21.2), or ETV4 (17q21). Considering the high incidence of prostate cancer and the high frequency of this gene fusion, the TMPRSS2-ETS gene fusion is the most common genetic aberration so far described in human malignancies. RESULTS: So far, this is the only gene rearrangement in any of the most prevalent cancers. As confirmed by other groups, we demonstrated that, within the group of ETS transcription factors, ERG is the most common fusion partner of the ETS genes with TMPRSS2. This gene fusion is considered to be an early event in PCa development. Emerging data suggest that gene fusion PCa demonstrates a distinct clinical course and thus support its use as a diagnostic test and prognostic biomarker. Also similar to the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the gene fusion in prostate cancer has potential as an important candidate for the development of targeted therapy.","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham & Women's Hospital/Harvard Medical School, 221 Longwood Avenue, EBRC 442A, Boston, MA 02115-6110, USA.""]",,,,,24,,Die TMPRSS2-ETS-Genfusion beim Prostatakarzinom.,,,,,,,,

Immune factors, such as leukemia inhibitory factor, CC chemokines, Lewis X component and secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor, appear to be involved in the protection of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants. The mainstay of reducing HIV transmission risk in infants remains the use of antiretroviral therapy.

AZD2171 is a potent and relatively selective inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor family that is orally bioavailable. This study was designed to screen for antitumor activity of AZD2171 against the in vitro and in vivo childhood cancer preclinical models of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP). PROCEDURES: AZD2171 was tested at concentrations from 0.1 nM to 1.0 microM against the in vitro panel and was tested against the in vivo tumor panels using a 6-week exposure to daily gavage administration of AZD2171 (3 or 6 mg/kg) or vehicle. RESULTS: One of 22 cell lines evaluated was sensitive to AZD2171 in vitro (maximum concentration 1 microM). Evidence of in vivo antitumor activity (primarily tumor growth delay) was observed in 78% of solid tumor xenografts (3/3 rhabdoid, 2/3 Wilms', 3/3 Ewing's, 5/5 rhabdomyosarcoma, 1/3 medulloblastoma, 2/4 glioblastoma, 5/6 neuroblastoma, 4/5 osteosarcoma). Objective responses (both complete responses) were observed in two of 32 (6%) solid tumor xenografts (a rhabdoid xenograft and an osteosarcoma xenograft). No activity was observed against 7 acute lymphoblastic leukemia models. CONCLUSIONS: AZD2171 demonstrated broad tumor growth inhibition against the PPTP's solid tumor xenografts and much less commonly induced tumor regression. This pattern of in vivo activity, combined with the disassociation of in vitro and in vivo efficacy, are consistent with AZD2171 inhibiting growth of the PPTP's solid tumor xenografts primarily through an anti-angiogenesis mechanism of action.","[""Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA. maris@chop.edu""]",['N01-CM-42216/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

For both the cumulative incidence of relapse and OS the difference in outcome between FLT3/ITDs and FLT3/TKDs was highly significant (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, impact of FLT3/TKDs on OS when including all mutant-positive patients was not significant, but patients with high-level mutations (more than 25% mutant) had a significantly improved outcome (P = .004). The novel finding that biologically distinct activating mutations of the same gene can be associated with markedly different clinical outcomes has implications for risk stratification and therapy and is significant to the understanding of chemoresistance in AML.","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free and University College Medical School, London, United Kingdom. adam.mead@ucl.ac.uk']","['G0300133/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'G84/6443/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genes that showed a significant relationship to MRD were then tested for their capacity to predict leukemic relapse in an independent cohort of 99 patients. We identified 674 probe sets that were associated with MRD on day 19 (P < .006); 40 of the identified genes predicted relapse (P < .03). Among these, 14 showed independent prognostic significance after adjustment for age, leukocyte count at diagnosis, and genetic subtype. More than half of the 40 genes and nearly all of the 14 genes were functionally related, as indicated by their roles in the regulation of cell proliferation. Underexpression of genes promoting cell proliferation was associated with resistance to chemotherapy. The biologic processes regulated by the genes we identified appear to be key determinants of the early cytoreductive response to remission induction therapy and subsequent clinical outcome in childhood ALL. Incorporation of the expression levels of these genes into existing strategies of risk classification could improve clinical management.","[""Departments of Pathology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]","['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA60419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 CA060419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1939904,,,,,,['Blood. 2008 Feb 15;111(4):2486-7; author reply 2487-8.

Low-molecular-weight heparin such as enoxaparin has become widely used in adult patients with thrombosis. The purpose of this study was to review the utilization of low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin (Lovenox), in children with cancer at our institution who had thrombosis while undergoing myelosuppressive chemotherapy. In particular we were interested in the efficacy of enoxaparin in these patients, and in whether these children were able to continue their chemotherapy without adjustment or interruption secondary to bleeding complications. We conducted a retrospective review from 1999 through April 1, 2004. Seven patients (4-17 years of age) were identified. Diagnosis included B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n=three), T-ALL, Hodgkin's disease, anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (n=one each). Six patients had a deep vein thrombus (DVT) or clot of the vena cava. One of these six patients also had a pulmonary embolus. One patient presented with manifestations of a unilateral cerebral vascular accident without evidence of DVT. Most patients were screened for known hypercoaguable abnormalities. Treatment was enoxaparin, 1-1.5 mg/kg/dose twice daily to maintain a heparin anti-Xa level of 0.5-1.5 IU/mL till clot resolution. The dose was then decreased to daily for a total of 3-6 months of therapy. All patients had resolution of their thrombosis within 1-2 months of initiation of enoxaparin, and none required delays or dose reduction of their chemotherapy regimens while on anticoagulation, though some were supported by blood and platelet transfusions. Enoxaparin was safely administered to this series of seven patients for thrombotic complications in children undergoing cancer chemotherapy.","[""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences at Arkansas Children's Hospital, 800 Marshall St. Slot 512-10, Little Rock, AR 72202, USA.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, there is an interest in the identification of novel mitotic inhibitors. Here, we report the novel discovery of the SIL gene as a regulator of mitotic entry and cell survival. The SIL gene was cloned from leukemia-associated chromosomal translocation. It encodes a cytosolic protein with an unknown function and no homology to known proteins. Previously, we observed an increased expression of SIL in multiple cancers that correlated with the expression of mitotic spindle checkpoint genes and with increased metastatic potential. Here, we show that SIL is important for the transition from the G(2) to the M phases of the cell cycle. Inducible knockdown of SIL in cancer cells in vitro delayed entrance into mitosis, decreased activation of the CDK1 (CDC2)-cyclin B complex, and induced apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. SIL is also essential for the growth of tumor explants in mice. Thus, SIL is required for mitotic entry and cancer cell survival. Because increased expression of SIL has been noted in multiple types of cancers and correlates with metastatic spread, it may be a suitable target for novel anticancer therapy.","['Chaim Sheba Cancer Research Center, Institute of Hematology, Sheba Medical Center, Tel Hashomer, Israel.']",,,['Cancer Res. 2007 Jun 15;67(12):5998'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 24.,"Up to prescribed limits, the maximum test compound concentrations used in mammalian cell genotoxicity assays in vitro are determined by cytotoxicity, unless limited by solubility in solvents or culture medium. However, 'cytotoxicity' is different in the various test systems, both in the methods used to estimate it and the levels of toxicity that must be achieved. For example, in cytogenetic assays, the acceptable level of toxicity is defined as a 'significant reduction (>50%)' in cell number, culture confluency or mitotic index (MI) (OECD 473, ICH S2A), whereas mutation tests require relative total growth or cloning efficiency (CE) to be reduced by 80-90% (OECD 476, ICH S2A). In this study using mouse lymphoma cells, it was shown that, for a variety of agents with differing modes of action, cytotoxicity varies considerably depending on the method used to estimate it. Specifically, trypan blue exclusion, MI and binucleate incidence all grossly underestimate cytotoxicity in comparison with cell growth or CE. If the performance of different test systems is to be compared, or if data from different assays are to be used for the meaningful assessment of a novel chemical entity, it is essential that similar methods to determine cytotoxicity are used for them all. The purpose of this paper is not to recommend a specific method to determine cytotoxicity, although it can be argued that any such method must quantify the proportion of cells capable of division following treatment, but rather to draw attention to the fact that apparent toxicity depends upon the method used to estimate it.","['Genetic Toxicology, Safety Assessment, AstraZeneca, R&D Alderley Park, Macclesfield, Cheshire SK10 4TG, UK.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This work investigates the possibility of using blood donations as a source of leukaemia-specific immune therapeutics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The acute promyelocytic cell line NB4 carrying the PML-RAR alpha fusion was used as a target for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) stimulated to recognize the fusion. Stimulation of CTL was by production of dendritic cells pulsed with plasmid vectors containing polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-generated sequences of PML-RAR alpha derived from NB4 cells. PCR primer design included a Kozak consensus sequence to allow correct translation of the nucleic acid into protein. Identification of specific cytotoxicity was by both Granzyme B ELISPOT and by (51)Cr-release assays. RESULTS: Specific CTL activity targeting NB4 cells can be generated from donor-derived peripheral blood mononuclear cells. However, individual donors appear to respond differently to the length of stimulatory sequence encoded in the vector. Use of an internal methionine in the PML gene, which also satisfies the Kozak rules, allows translation in vitro and, thus, might provide a suitable start site for stimulation using acute promyelocytic leukaemia-specific sequence. CONCLUSION: The work presented here suggests that blood donor derived dendritic cells can be used to stimulate leukaemia-specific CTL from the same donation ex vivo. This would enable the generation of patient-specific therapeutics from major histocompatibility (MHC)-matched allogeneic donors.

This study evaluated the efficacy of non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation in patients with advanced CLL and assessed the impact of ZAP-70 expression on the outcome. Thirty-nine sequential patients were included. All had previously been treated with fludarabine. All patients received a preparative regimen of fludarabine (30 mg/m(2)/d for 3 d), intravenous cyclophosphamide (750 mg/m(2)/d for 3 d), and high-dose rituximab. Immunohistochemical techniques on marrow biopsy samples were used to determine that ZAP-70 was expressed in 25 patients, whereas 13 other patients were ZAP-70 negative, and one was of indeterminate status. With a median follow-up time of 27 months, the estimated overall survival and current progression-free survival (CPFS) rates at 4 years were 48% and 44% respectively. Patients who were ZAP-70 positive had 56% survival, and their CPFS rate increased from 30% to 53% after a donor lymphocyte infusion. Multivariate analysis indicated that chemorefractory disease and mixed T cell chimerism at day 90, but not ZAP-70 positivity, were associated with the risk of disease progression after transplantation. These results demonstrate a potent graft-versus-leukaemia effect that can overcome the adverse prognostic effect of ZAP-70 expression.","['Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, The University of Texas M.

In sharp contrast, relapsed T-ALL continues to confer a dismal prognosis. We sought to determine if gene expression profiling could uncover a signature of outcome for children with T-ALL. Using 12 patient specimens obtained before therapy started, we examined the gene expression profile by oligonucleotide microarrays. We identified three genes, CFLAR, NOTCH2 and BTG3, whose expression at the time of diagnosis accurately distinguished the patients according to disease outcome. These genes are involved in the regulation of apoptosis and cellular proliferation. The prognostic value of the three predictive genes was assessed in an independent cohort of 25 paediatric T-ALL patients using quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Patients assigned to the adverse outcome group had a significantly higher cumulative incidence of relapse compared with patients assigned to the favourable outcome group (46% vs. 8%, P = 0.029). Five-year overall survival was also significantly worse in the patients assigned to the adverse outcome group (P = 0.0039). The independent influence of the 3-gene predictor was confirmed by multivariate analysis. Our study provides proof of principle that genome-wide expression profiling can detect novel molecular prognostic markers in paediatric T-ALL.","[""Division of Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research and Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.""]",['CA95475/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Selective mAbs to NTB-A were further tested in functional complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicty (ADCC) assays in cell lines and B lymphocytes freshly isolated from CLL patients. While lower levels of NTB-A were detected in T and natural killer (NK) cells, CDC activity was demonstrated primarily in B cells isolated from CLL patients and B lymphoma cell lines. Knockdown of NTB-A by small interfering RNA in target cells results in lower cytotoxicity, demonstrating the specificity of the mAbs. Furthermore, anti NTB-A mAbs demonstrated anti-tumour activity against CA46 human lymphoma xenografts in nude mice and against systemically disseminated Raji human lymphoma cells in severe combined immunodeficient mice.

Chemotactic responsiveness of haematopoietic stem cells is restricted to the ligand for CXCR4, stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1/CXCL12), which is constitutively secreted by marrow stromal cells. Myeloid and lymphoid leukaemia cells also express CXCR4 that induces leukaemia cell chemotaxis and migration beneath marrow stromal cells. CXCR4 expression levels have a major prognostic impact in acute myeloid leukaemia. There is growing in vitro and in vivo evidence that CXCR4 expression by leukaemia cells allows for homing and their retention within the marrow. As such, leukaemia cells appear to utilise CXCR4 to access niches that are normally restricted to progenitor cells, and thereby reside in a microenvironment that favours their growth and survival. CXCR4- and integrin-mediated contact between leukaemia cells and stromal cells protects leukaemia cells from spontaneous and chemotherapy-induced cell death and therefore may represent a mechanism to explain minimal residual disease and subsequent relapses commonly seen in the treatment of these diseases. This review summarises our current knowledge regarding the importance of CXCR4 in acute and chronic leukaemia, discusses the importance of CXCR4 detection by flow cytometry in the diagnostic workup of leukaemia patients, and introduces the potential role of CXCR4-targeting compounds for the treatment of leukaemia patients.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77230-1402, USA. jaburger@mdanderson.org']",,,,,93,,,,,,,,,,

Epidemiologic studies regarding ELF-EMF-exposure have focused primarily on leukaemia development due to residential sources in children and adults, and from occupational exposure in adults, but also on other kinds of cancer. Genotoxic investigations of EMF have shown contradictory results, a biological mechanism is still lacking that can explain the link between cancer development and ELF-EMF-exposure. Recent laboratory research has attempted to show general biological effects, and such that could be related to cancer development and/or promotion. Metabolic processes which generate oxidants and antioxidants can be influenced by environmental factors, such as ELF-EMF. Increased ELF-EMF exposure can modify the activity of the organism by reactive oxygen species leading to oxidative stress. It is well established that free radicals can interact with DNA resulting in single strand breaks. DNA damage could become a site of mutation, a key step to carcinogenesis. Furthermore, different cell types react differently to the same stimulus, because of their cell type specific redox status. The modulation of cellular redox balance by the enhancement of oxidative intermediates, or the inhibition or reduction of antioxidants, is discussed in this review. An additional aspect of free radicals is their function to influence other illnesses such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. On the other hand, modulation of antioxidants by ELF-EMF can lower the intracellular defence activity promoting the development of DNA damage. It has also been demonstrated that low levels of reactive oxygen species trigger intracellular signals that involve the transcription of genes and leading to responses including cell proliferation and apoptosis. In this review, a general overview is given about oxidative stress, as well as experimental studies are reviewed as they are related to changes in oxidant and antioxidant content after ELF-EMF exposure inducing different biological effects. Finally, we conclude from our review that modulations on the oxidant and antioxidant level through ELF-EMF exposure can play a causal role in cancer development.","['Division of Environmental Physiology, Department of Cell Biology and Biosystems Technology, University of Rostock, D-18059 Rostock, Germany. myrtill.simko@uni-rostock.de']",,,,,191,,,,,,,,,,

The present study evaluated the frequency of such an occurrence. METHODS: In the period October 1979-June 2002, 215 cases of malignant pleural mesothelioma were diagnosed at the Hospital of Monfalcone, Italy. All the cases of the above series, examined at necropsy (169), were included in the study. Occupational histories had been obtained from the patients or from their relatives by personal or telephone interviews. In 132 cases, asbestos bodies were isolated after chemical digestion of lung samples. The thoracic cavities were examined for pleural plaques. RESULTS: Additional malignancies were observed in 32 cases (18.9%). Multiple tumors were synchronous in 22 cases, metachronous in 8 cases, and synchronous and metachronous in 2. Four different tumors were found in 2 cases, 3 malignancies were detected in 6 patients, and 2 malignancies in the remaining 24. The most frequent additional malignancies were prostate adenocarcinoma (7 cases), non-Hodgkin lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (5 cases), bladder carcinoma (4 cases), kidney carcinoma (4 cases), large bowel carcinoma (4 cases), and liver cell carcinoma (4 cases). All the patients had histories of exposure to asbestos, mostly in shipbuilding. Lung asbestos body burdens ranged between 60 and 230,000 per gram of dried tissue. Pleural plaques were found in 26 cases. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast with other series of the literature, in the present cases the co-existence of mesothelioma and other malignancies appeared as a relatively frequent event. The lack of a control group does not allow definite conclusions about the meaning of the occurrence. However, the co-existence of certain tumors with asbestos-related mesothelioma suggests that mesothelioma and associated malignancies might share some etiologic factors (asbestos and others).","['Center for the Study of Environmental Cancer, Italian League against Cancer, Monfalcone, Gorizia, Italy. legatumoril@interfree.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively studied a cohort of 59 patients with median follow-up time 50.6 months (range: 27-80 months) at a single institution in Taiwan. Patients with ALL were classified in risk groups at diagnosis. TPOG-ALL-93 protocols and TPOG-ALL-2002 protocols were used. Both protocols were for multicenter studies in Taiwan and contained protocols for standard-risk (SR), high-risk (HR), and very-high-risk (VHR) patients. In this study, we used TIT alone for CNSP. In all ALL patients, methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine were given at age-dependent doses. RESULTS: As of October 2006, patients had a 3-year event-free survival and an overall survival 89.4 +/- 4.1% (S.E.) and 93.1 +/- 3.3%, respectively. Under TIT no patients had complications such as seizure, encephalitis, or infection, and no morbidities like those caused by cranial irradiation. In this study, we used TIT alone for CNSP and had no CNS relapse. CONCLUSIONS: In the context of effective systemic therapy, TIT alone appears to be effective CNSP for most patients with ALL.","['Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms of cyclin A1 action are incompletely understood. Here, we show that cyclin A1 functions are mediated by the retinoblastoma and the Ku70 pathway. High levels of cyclin A1 and the associated CDK2 kinase activity were associated with increasing levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma in vivo. UV irradiation induced a switch of the CDK2 towards cyclin A1, with accordance to changes in CDK2 kinase activity. The C-terminus of cyclin A1 directly interacted with Ku70, and DNA binding activity of Ku70 was modulated by cyclin A1/CDK2 and phosphatase treatment. Cyclin A1-deficiency induced by shRNA increased apoptosis that is induced by DNA damage and death receptor ligands. Taken together, these analyses demonstrate that cyclin A1 exerts antiapoptotic functions by interacting with retinoblastoma and Ku proteins in leukemia cells.","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene plays a key role in the self-renewal of stem cells. Leukemic cells lacking Bmi-1 underwent proliferation arrest and showed signs of differentiation and apoptosis. These findings led to the proposal of Bmi-1 as a potential target for therapeutic intervention in cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of Bmi-1 in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Using qRT-PCR, we demonstrated a significantly increased level of Bmi-1 transcript in CML cells. Using array analysis, we determined the deregulation of several genes after Bmi-1 silencing. Proapoptotic genes BAD and TRADD, and CASP8, p16-INK4, BRCA2, Notch4 and Wnt-8B were elevated. PLK1, SOD1, E2F-3, two retinoblastoma binding proteins (RBQ1 and RBBP4) and HDGF were reduced after Bmi-1 inhibition. Additionally, we tested the impact of Bmi-1 siRNA on CML cell growth; however, there was no apparent change after Bmi-1 suppression. Despite the fact that Bmi-1 deregulation occurs in CML and its expression is connected to several oncogenic processes, Bmi-1 seems to play a secondary role in CML transformation.","['Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Department of Molecular Genetics, Prague, Unemocnice 1, 128 20 Prague 2, Czech Republic. michaela.merkerova@uhkt.cz']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genetic polymorphisms in the folate metabolic pathway may contribute to the susceptibility to childhood ALL because they affect the DNA synthesis, methylation and repair. We analysed common genetic polymorphisms of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), thymidylate synthase (TS), methionine synthase (MS) and methionine synthase reductase (MTRR) in 68 children with ALL and 258 healthy controls to investigate their influence on the risk for ALL. No significant differences in frequencies of separate polymorphisms were observed between both groups. Combined MTHFR 677CT/TT and MS 2756AG/GG genotypes showed a nonsignificant tendency to reduce the risk for ALL 2.24-fold (CI: 0.191 - 1.037, P: 0.061).

However, no significant changes in Cdc2 and survivin levels and G2 arrest were observed. Cell death and growth inhibition were dependent neither on XIAP, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X(L) levels nor on caspase-8. M4N did not promote cell differentiation in HL-60 cells. Interestingly, significant inhibition of AKT phosphorylation was observed in M4N treated OCI-AML3 cells. Collectively, our data showed that M4N inhibited cell growth and induced cell death in both leukemic cell lines and AML patient sample via a mechanism not mediated by Cdc2 and survivin inhibition and suggested that the extrinsic and the mitochondrial apoptotic pathways are not essential.","['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']","['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, since the number of new drugs far exceeds the number of clinical trials that can be conducted because of the availability of eligible patients, there is an urgent need to utilize reliable preclinical models for the prioritization of the most promising potential therapies for those clinical trials. The most widely used preclinical models for the acute leukemias are human tumor xenografts established in immune-deficient mice, and genetically engineered mouse strains. This review summarizes the recent developments and considerations in the use of xenograft models of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute promyelocytic leukemia for the preclinical testing of new therapies.","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.""]",,,,,92,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated to what extent IO inhibits the growth of normal human lymphocytes. We defined various experimental conditions of peripheral blood lymphocyte treatment: IO introduced (i) on unstimulated lymphocytes, (ii) or on stimulated lymphocytes at the time of phytohemagglutinin stimulation (L1 protocol), (iii) 48 h after the beginning of stimulation (L2 protocol), and (iv) after nocodazole synchronization of stimulated lymphocytes. IO induces a concentration dependent cytotoxic effect yielding a characteristic sub-G1 peak in normal stimulated lymphocytes. Cell death was partly due to necrosis and apoptosis. Normal unstimulated lymphocytes remained insensitive to the cytotoxic effect of 10 microM IO treatment. A cell cycle inhibition was observed after IO treatment, stronger for the L1 than for the L2 protocol, without induction of polyploidy after Nocodazole synchronization. These cellular consequences were associated with a decrease in CDK activity, and with CDK and cyclin gene expression modifications. The inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation by IO indicates that indirubin derivatives may be potent immunosuppressive agents.","[""University Lyon1 Equipe d'Accueil 3737, Faculte, Lyon-Sud, Oullins, France.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, in hematological cancers such as leukemias and lymphomas, the role of angiogenesis has been under intense scrutiny. However, the molecular singularities of leukemia, namely its cellular origin, have suggested a putative role for angiogenesis in these tumors may have distinct features. We and others have shown acute leukemia cells use angiogenic growth factor signaling pathways, namely those activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in autocrine and paracrine fashion. Autocrine and paracrine VEGF stimulation of subsets of leukemias results in cell proliferation, increased survival and migration. This review discusses recent advances in the field of leukemia angiogenesis, focusing on the role of VEGF and its receptors, acting in a paracrine or autocrine manner. We also briefly describe some of the novel anti-angiogenic compounds, namely VEGF blockers, and suggest their use to treat subsets of hematological malignancies may have clinical benefit.","['Angiogenesis Laboratory, CIPM/Instituto Portugues de Oncologia, Lisbon, Portugal.']",,,,,72,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed 11 cases of PRCA from a series of 42 patients undergoing major ABO-incompatible allo-HSCT from April 1997 to December 2005. Eleven out of the 42 patients developed PRCA (26.1%). All the 11 cases of PRCA were in blood group O recipients of grafts from blood group A donor (n = 9) or blood group B donor (n = 2). The following factors were associated with an increased risk of PRCA: (1) blood group O recipient; (2) blood group A donor; and (3) blood group O/A in recipient/donor pair. Only blood group O/A in recipient/donor pair was identified as being significantly associated with the occurrence of PRCA by multivariate analysis. Six patients who received donor-type plasma exchange did not develop PRCA and among them 5 cases were the blood group O recipients. Eight patients obtained spontaneous remission and in the remaining 3 patients 2 with long-lasting PRCA were successfully treated with plasma exchange with donor-type plasma replacement and the other one who was also complicated by EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disorder (EBV-PTLD) responded rapidly to anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody and achieved complete resolution of clinical finding and symptom of both EBV-PTLD and PRCA. We conclude that blood group A/O in donor/recipient pair is identified as being significantly associated with the occurrence of PRCA by multivariate analysis. Donor-type plasma exchange and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody is an effective approach for the treatment of PRCA. PRCA could be prevented by plasma exchange prior to transplantation.","[""Department of Hematology, First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They included 37 cases who attained a true remission and 26 complicated by failure of remission, early relapse or death.

Cases aged < 5 years; male sex with organomegaly had better remission although statistically insignificant. Initially low HB < 8 gm/dl, high WBCs and platelet counts >50.000/mm(3) also showed better but non-significant remission rates.

Here, we have analyzed at greater depth the 4-HPR-triggered molecular events, demonstrating that 4-HPR induces an early (15 min) increase in ceramide levels by sphingomyelin hydrolysis and later (from 1 h) by de novo synthesis. Using specific inhibitors of both pathways, we demonstrate that ceramide accumulation is responsible for early ROS generation, which act as apoptotic signalling intermediates leading to conformational activation of Bak and Bax, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim), mitochondrial membrane permeabilization (MMP) and cell death. Enforced expression of Bcl-2 has no effect on 4-HPR-induced oxidative stress, but notably prevents mitochondrial alterations and apoptosis, indicating that Bcl-2 functions by regulating events downstream of ROS generation. In conclusion, our study delineates for the fist time the sequence and timing of the principal events induced by 4-HPR in leukemia cells and points to the potential use of modulators of ceramide metabolism as enhancers in 4-HPR-based therapies.","['Department of Cell Biology and Histology, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, University of the Basque Country, Barrio Sarriena s/n, Leioa, Bizkaia, Spain.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was aimed at answering the question whether the labile iron pool (LIP) may contribute to the oxidation of H(2)DCF in cellular systems. The membrane-permeable lipophilic iron chelator salicylaldehyde isonicotinoyl hydrazone (SIH) was found to inhibit oxidation of the probe by H(2)O(2) dependent on ferrous ions but not by peroxidase or superoxide dismutase in defined in vitro systems. When applied to cells, the probe inhibited considerably oxidation of H(2)DCF in V79 Chinese hamster fibroblasts and two murine lymphoma L5178Y(LY) sublines (LY-R, LY-S) differing in LIP level, the extent of inhibition being greater in the LY-R line of higher LIP level.

The production of nitric oxide (NO) was paralleled by the increase of the mRNA and protein level of the inducible form of the nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). ROS and RNS enhancement, process concomitant to the failure of mitochondrial trans-membrane potential (DeltaPsi), was necessary for the induction of apoptosis as demonstrated by the protection against sorbitol-mediated toxicity observed after treatment with ROS scavengers or NOS inhibitors. The synergistic action of ROS and RNS was finally demonstrated by pre-treatment with rosmarinic acid that, by powerfully buffering both these species, prevents impairment of DeltaPsi and cell death.

Today, CsA is still indicated to prevent rejection following solid organ transplantations, prevent and treat graft-vs-host disease following bone marrow transplants, and has also been used in the treatment of autoimmune disease such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and nephrotic syndrome (Canadian Pharmacists Association, 2006).

This suggests the existence of a hierarchy of AML progenitor cells. CD33 is a myeloid marker absent on normal hematopoietic stem cells but expressed in about 75% of AML patients, and has been used for BM purging strategies and Ab-targeted therapies. These CD33 Ab therapies benefit only a minority of AML patients, suggesting that AML stem cells are heterogeneous in their CD33 expression. METHODS: In order to evaluate this question, we determined expression levels of CD34 and CD33 on AML progenitors with long-term in vitro proliferative ability and NOD/SCID engrafting ability. RESULTS: The CD34(+) CD33(-) subfraction contained the majority of progenitors detected in vitro and most often engrafted the mice. This proliferation was leukemic from the CD34(+) AML patients, however from the CD34(-) AML patients only normal progenitors were detected in this fraction in some cases. DISCUSSION: These data suggest that most leukemic progenitors of CD34(+) patients do not express CD33. In contrast, CD34(-) AML primitive leukemic progenitors may be CD33(+).

However, obtaining lymphocytes and subsequent expansion is labor intensive, making it impractical for broad clinical application. Allogeneic transplantation may have anti-melanoma efficacy because of a graft vs. tumor effect. The disappointing tumor control observed post-transplant suggests that adoptive immunotherapy using melanoma-reactive cells will be essential for sustained responses. METHODS: Melanoma cell lines were grown from two patients with advanced disease. High-level CD80 and CD86 expression was obtained in the tumor lines using a retroviral vector for gene transfer. Transduced melanoma and controls were cultured with mononuclear cells from HLA-identical sibling donors. RESULTS: Expression of CD80 and CD86, particularly the former, promoted marked expansion of lymphocytes from HLA-matched sibling donors. Proliferation of up to 300-fold after 4 weeks of culture was observed. Lymphocytes from cultures stimulated with CD80 demonstrated cytotoxicity against recipient-untransfected melanoma (45-75% specific lysis at an E:T ratio of 50:1). Although expanded lymphocytes were predominantly CD4(+), cytotoxicity was greatest in the numerically smaller CD8(+) subpopulation. Both CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells secreted IFN-gamma (but not IL-4) on exposure to untransduced stimulator melanoma cells. DISCUSSION: Our strategy generates a large number of melanoma-reactive lymphocytes from HLA-identical siblings using a 4-week culture strategy. Lymphocytes expanded in this way offer an alternative to tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for allogeneic cellular immunotherapy after stem cell transplantation in young patients.","['Leukaemia Research Laboratory, Westmead Hospital, University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia. david_gottlieb@wmi.usyd.edu.au']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The etiology of childhood leukemia remains largely unknown. Cytogenetic abnormalities determine disease subtypes, prognosis, clinical presentation, and course and may help in discovering etiological factors. Epidemiologic investigations of leukemia are complicated by many factors, including the rarity of the disease, necessitating careful study design. Two emerging areas of interest in leukemia etiology are birth weight and diet. High birth weight has been associated with increased risk of childhood leukemia. The biological mechanism behind this association may involve insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), which is associated with high birth weight. IGF-I may act by increasing the absolute number of stem cells available for transformation, stimulating the growth of cells that are already transformed, or a combination of effects. Diet has been linked with leukemia. Maternal dietary DNA topoisomerase II (DNAt2) inhibitor intake is associated with infant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with the MLL gene translocation.

Because of the oral bioavailability of 6-MP is low and highly variable, the aim of this study was to develop a new parenteral formulation that can prolong the biological half-life of the drug, improve its therapeutic efficacy, and its associated reduce side effects. Conventional and stealth 6-MP liposomes were prepared by a thin film hydration technique followed by a high-pressure homogenization process and characterized for percent entrapment efficiency (%EE), particle size, and stability in human plasma. Pharmacokinetic, tissue distribution, and biochemical analysis were performed after intravenous (IV) administration of all formulations of 6-MP on rats. The conventional liposomes were found less stable than stealth liposomes in human plasma at 37 degrees C. Stealth liposomes exhibited high peak plasma concentration (C(max)), and long circulating capacity in blood and biological half-life. The uptake of stealth liposomes by the liver and spleen and accumulation in the kidney were significantly less than that of conventional liposomes and the free drug. Serum urea, creatinine, GOT (Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase), and GPT (Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase) increased significantly in rats given an IV injection of conventional liposomes and the free drug, but not in those administered with the same dose of stealth liposomes. Stealth liposomes may help to increase therapeutic efficacy of 6-MP and to reduce total amount of dose as well as frequency of the dose. It also may reduce the possibility of the risk of toxicity to the liver and kidney generally associated with free 6-MP.","['Drug Delivery Research Laboratory, Pharmacy Department, The M. S.

Epub 2007 Apr 24.,"OBJECTIVE: There has been only one report available that focuses on the treatment with imatinib mesylate of two individual persons with aggressive fibromatosis. The authors concluded that after long-term treatment, for 9 and 11 months, with imatinib mesylate, both patients demonstrated radiographic and clinical responses. The novel therapy should be considered as salvage in patients with aggressive fibromatosis expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alfa, beta (PDGFR-alfa, PDGFR-beta), and/or c-kit, whose tumors are uncontrollable by the standard management. On the other hand, the number of kinases blocked by imatinib mesylate is notching up, for instance the tyrosine kinase, which is associated with macrophage-colony stimulating factor receptor (M-CSFR). METHODS: The patient was suffering from aggressive fibromatosis after prior therapy including surgery (R2), radiotherapy, and systemic treatment with combination of tamoxifen and sulindac. The tumor specimen was immunostained for PDGFR-beta and c-kit (CD117), and PDGFR-alfa and cytokines platelet-derived growth factor-alfa and beta were not assessed. The tests for both assessed molecules revealed negative results. In spite of this, the patient underwent a unique treatment with imatinib mesylate at the dose of 400 mg orally once daily for 3 years and 2 months. RESULTS: After three months of the therapy, radiographic (met criteria of SD but small decrease of the tumor was noted) and clinical responses were recorded for the first time. The same was seen after 6 and 13 months of therapy continuation with imatinib mesylate. Currently, the patient is treated with imatinib mesylate (400 mg orally once daily) without any toxicity effects. The last MRI revealed readily a smaller tumor (35 x 20 mm) after such a therapy lasted more than 3 years. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with imatinib mesylate has been a well-accepted therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). There have been established four kinases (p210(bcr/abl), c-kit, PDGFR-alfa, PDGFR-beta) suggested as the target for imatinib mesylate. Other potential targets will be discovered as it has lately been determined that M-CSFR kinase activity was blocked by imatinib mesylate. The salvage therapy for aggressive fibromatosis with imatinib mesylate seems to be an attractive opportunity for patients with the advanced disease, whose prior therapy failed.","['Department of Oncology, Military Institute of Medicine, 128 Szaserow Street, 00-909 Warsaw, Poland. gabrielwcislo@yahoo.pl']",,,,,48,,,,,['J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2009 Feb;135(2):325-6.

Epub 2007 Apr 24.,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel low dose chemotherapy as a remission induction regimen for elderly de novo AML patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy. METHOD: Fifty consecutive patients, aged 60 to 85, with untreated de novo AML were enrolled. Patients with poor PS or defined non-hematological complications were given continuous drip infusion of low dose cytarabine (Ara-C), 20 mg/body and etoposide (VP-16), 50 mg/body for 10 days (AV group). Patients without those comorbidities were given intensive induction therapy (S group). After achieving complete remission (CR), S group patients and those with improved PS in AV group received consolidation chemotherapy with intensive regimen (S-S or AV-S group), and other patients received AV regimen repeatedly (AV-AV group). RESULTS: Eighteen (64%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.47-0.82) of 28 patients in AV group and 16 (73%; 95% CI, 0.54-0.91) of 22 patients in S group achieved CR, respectively. The 1-year OS rates of the patients in the AV-AV group (n = 9), AV-S group (n = 9), and S-S group (n = 16) were 22, 81, and 78%, respectively. Although the sample size was small, no significant difference was observed for the 1-year OS rate between the AV-S and S-S groups. Regimen related death were 4 patients in S group, while no patient in AV group. CONCLUSION: Therapeutic strategy consisting of remission induction using AV regimen and consolidation using intensive regimen after improving PS is beneficial in the management of elderly AML patients who have difficulty in tolerating for intensive induction chemotherapy.","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Gifu University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-1 Yanagido, Gifu 501-1194, Japan. htsuru@gifu-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify whether its prosurvival members function by sequestering their Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3)-only ligands or their multidomain relatives Bak and Bax, we analyzed whether four prosurvival proteins differing in their ability to bind specific BH3 peptides or Bak could protect isolated mitochondria. Most BH3 peptides could induce temperature-dependent cytochrome c release, but permeabilization was prevented by Bcl-x(L), Bcl-w, Mcl-1, or BHRF1. However, their protection correlated with the ability to bind Bak rather than the added BH3 peptide and could be overcome only by BH3 peptides that bind directly to the appropriate prosurvival member. Mitochondria protected by both Bcl-x(L)-like and Mcl-1 proteins were disrupted only by BH3 peptides that engage both. BH3-only reagents freed Bak from Bcl-x(L) and Mcl-1 in mitochondrial and cell lysates. The findings support a model for the control of apoptosis in which certain prosurvival proteins sequester Bak/Bax, and BH3-only proteins must neutralize all protective prosurvival proteins to allow Bak/Bax to induce mitochondrial disruption.","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Victoria 3050, Australia.']","['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom', 'R01 CA080188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA80188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2064136,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 23.,"The C-Myb transcription factor is essential for hematopoiesis, including in the T-cell lineage. The C-Myb locus is a common site of retroviral insertional mutagenesis, however no recurrent genomic involvement has been reported in human malignancies. Here, we identified 2 types of genomic alterations involving the C-MYB locus at 6q23 in human T-cell acute leukemia (T-ALL). First, we found a reciprocal translocation, t(6;7)(q23;q34), that juxtaposed the TCRB and C-MYB loci (n = 6 cases). Second, a genome-wide copy-number analysis by array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH) identified short somatic duplications that include C-MYB (MYB(dup), n = 13 cases of 84 T-ALL, 15%). Expression analysis, including allele-specific approaches, showed stronger C-MYB expression in the MYB-rearranged cases compared with other T-ALLs, and a dramatically skewed C-MYB allele expression in the TCRB-MYB cases, which suggests that a translocation-driven deregulated expression may overcome a cellular attempt to down-regulate C-MYB. Strikingly, profiling of the T-ALLs by clinical, genomic, and large-scale gene expression analyses shows that the TCRB-MYB translocation defines a new T-ALL subtype associated with a very young age for T-cell leukemia (median, 2.2 years) and with a proliferation/mitosis expression signature. By contrast, the MYB(dup) alteration was associated with the previously defined T-ALL subtypes.","[""Genome Rearrangements and Cancer Group, Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale U728 and Institut Universitaire d'Hematologie, Paris 7 University, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.""]",['R01 CA101859/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 23.,"Astrocytes play important roles in brain development and injury response. Transcription factors STAT3 and Smad1, activated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), respectively, form a complex with the coactivator p300 to synergistically induce astrocytes from neuroepithelial cells (NECs) (K. Nakashima, M. Yanagisawa, H. Arakawa, N. Kimura, T. Hisatsune, M. Kawabata, K. Miyazono, and T. Taga, Science 284:479-482, 1999). However, the mechanisms that govern astrogliogenesis during the determination of the fate of neural stem cells remain elusive. Here we found that LIF induces expression of BMP2 via STAT3 activation and leads to the consequent activation of Smad1 to efficiently promote astrogliogenic differentiation of NECs. The BMP antagonist Noggin abrogated LIF-induced Smad1 activation and astrogliogenesis by inhibiting BMPs produced by NECs. NECs deficient in suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3), a negative regulator of STAT3, readily differentiated into astrocytes upon activation by LIF not only due to sustained activation of STAT3 but also because of the consequent activation of Smad1. Our study suggests a novel LIF-triggered positive regulatory loop that enhances astrogliogenesis.","['Department of Cell Fate Modulation, Institute of Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Kumamoto University, 2-2-1 Honjo, Kumamoto 860-0811, Japan.']",,,,PMC1951480,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 23.,"BACKGROUND: Xeno-grafting of testicular tissue may allow viable gamete maturation. This would be beneficial for prepubertal cancer patients in that it may allow restoration of fertility without the risk of a cancer relapse. However it is unknown whether cancer cells in the testicular graft can transmit the malignancy into the host animal and also if gametes can be retrieved from testicular grafts that are contaminated with malignant cells. METHODS: Rat T-cell leukemia was employed as the source of leukemic lymphoblasts and testicular tissue. This was injected i.p. (lymphoblasts) or grafted s.c. (fresh or cryopreserved testicular tissue) into the back skin of intact nude mice. To simulate clinical autografting, testicular tissue was also transplanted into healthy piebald variegated (PVG) rats. RESULTS: 50-70% of the mice, receiving 200 or 6000 leukemic lymphoblasts, developed terminal leukemia. All mice, grafted with either fresh or cryopreserved testicular tissue from leukemic donor, developed generalized leukemia and/or local tumors. All syngenic PVG rats, treated in the same manner, died of generalized leukemia. In all of the retrieved leukemic grafts, rat spermatogenesis was destroyed and only leukemic infiltration was detected. CONCLUSIONS: Grafting testicular tissue contaminated with leukemic cells led to tumor growth at the injection site without potential to differentiate germline stem cells into gametes. Xenografting could provide a novel functional strategy for simultaneous detection of malignant cell contamination and spermatogonial potential in testicular xenografts collected for fertility preservation.","[""Department of Women and Child Health, Astrid Lindgren Children's Hospital, Pediatric Endocrinology Unit, Q2:08, Karolinska Institute and University Hospital, SE-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. mi.hou@ki.se""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The complex karyotype (three or more numerical/structural cytogenetic changes; 29 patients) was found to occur more frequently among the elderly than a noncomplex adverse karyotype (19 patients; median age, 71 vs. 48; P = 0.005). The patients' performance status was the sole independent factor determining the complete remission rate among patients receiving standard induction chemotherapy. On survival analysis, two factors independently predicted a longer overall survival: noncomplex karyotypes [vs. complex karyotypes, hazard ratio (HR) 0.434, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.189-0.994, P = 0.048] and achievement of complete remission [(CR) vs. CR not reached, HR 0.170, 95% CI 0.051-0.572, P = 0.004)]. In conclusion, among AML patients with adverse cytogenetics, complex chromosomal aberrations occurred more frequently among the elderly and predicted a poor outcome. These patients should be considered as a unique entity and be separated from those with a noncomplex adverse cytogenetic change. Exploring the underlying mechanisms of leukemogenesis could improve the therapeutic outcome for this group of patients.","['Division of Hematology Oncology, department of Medicine, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, No. 6, Sec.

In this study, we describe two cases of AML in which FISH analysis showed a high-level 11q23 amplification, to confirm if this overexpression may be accompanied by partial tandem duplication of the MLL gene (MLL-PTD). Both patients showed complex karyotype and an unfavorable clinical course.

Of the 132 patients investigated without PC-ID+, 61 (46%) showed chromosomal abnormalities, compared with 45 of 49 of evaluable cases (92%) with PC-ID+.

Of these, translocations t(4;14) constituted 9% and t(11;14), 20%.

In the mouse, there are at least 14 IFN-alpha genes and 3 IFN-alpha pseudogenes, the most recently identified of which are murine interferon-alpha 12 (MuIFN-alpha12), MuIFN-alpha13 and MuIFN-alpha14. To further study the biological activities of MuIFN-alpha12, we have produced a recombinant MuIFN-alpha12 (rMuIFN-alpha12) protein using COS-1 cells. rMuIFN-alpha12 was found to inhibit the growth of murine myeloid leukemia JCS cells. Flow cytofluorometric analysis with propidium iodide staining showed that the growth inhibitory activity of rMuIFN-alpha12 may be caused by the induction of apoptosis. Flow cytofluorometric analysis also revealed that rMuIFN-alpha12 was able to up-regulate the expression of MHC-I on both JCS cells and primary macrophages. Functional studies indicated that a MuIFN-alpha12 transgene could induce an anti-viral state in L929 cells against Influenza A virus. Moreover, expression of MuIFN-alpha12 was not detectable by RT-PCR in untreated, Influenza A virus infected, polyI:polyC induced L929 cells, or in a wide range of normal murine tissues. Taken together, this data shows that MuIFN-alpha12 is a protein with all the biological traits of a type I IFN.","['Department of Biology, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong. bchlawrence@alumni.cuhk.net']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: Although the molecular defect has been defined in some cases, little is known about the impact and clinical correlates of eosinophilia. METHODS: In a cohort of 63 patients with SM, we identified 9 with permanent eosinophilia (>1500/microL). According to the World Health Organization classification, 2 had indolent SM, 1 had smoldering SM, 2 had SM with associated chronic eosinophilic leukemia (SM-CEL), and 4 had aggressive SM. RESULTS: SM-eo was found to be associated with a significantly reduced probability of overall and event-free survival compared with SM without eosinophilia (P < .05). In the 2 patients with SM-CEL, a CHIC2 deletion was found. By contrast, no KIT mutation at codon 816 was detectable in these patients. In the other patients with SM-eo, KIT D816V was demonstrable. The 2 patients with SM-CEL had cardiomyopathy, whereas other organ systems remained largely unaffected. By contrast, in all other patients with SM-eo, organopathy, if recorded, affected the bone marrow, liver, or/and skeletal system, but not the heart, even when eosinophilia persisted for many years. CONCLUSIONS: The biochemical basis of eosinophilia in SM is variable and predictive for the type of organopathy. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In SM eosinophilia is of prognostic significance but is not a final diagnosis and is not invariably associated with cardiomyopathy. The latter might be restricted to cases with an associated primary eosinophilic disorder (SM-CEL).","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was undertaken to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance by comparing differential gene expression in blasts from patients with resistant relapsing AML and chemosensitive AML. RESULTS: About 20 genes were identified as preferentially expressed in blasts pooled from patients with resistant disease, as compared to chemosensitive AML blasts, based on differential gene expression screening. Half of these genes encoded proteins related to protein translation, of these a novel protein related to the ribosomal stalk protein P0. Other upregulated mRNAs coded for cytochrome C oxidase III, the transcription factors ERF-2/TIS11d, and the p75 and p52 splice variants of Lens Epithelial Derived Growth Factor (LEDGF). Analysis of blasts from single patients disclosed that LEDGF/p75 was the most consistently upregulated mRNA in resistant AML. Transfection experiments demonstrated that LEDGF/p75 and p52b antagonized daunorubicin-induced and cAMP-induced apoptosis in an AML cell line. Also HEK-293 cells were protected against daunorubicin by LEDGF/p75 and p52b, whereas LEDGF/p52 splice variants lacking exon 6 had proapoptotic effects. Interestingly, full length LEDGF/p75 protected against truncated pro-apoptotic LEDGF/p75. CONCLUSION: Our results provide evidence for an association between the overexpression of genes encoding survival proteins like LEDGF/p75 and chemo-resistance in acute myelogenous leukemia. LEDGF/p75 has previously not been shown to protect against chemotherapy, and is a potential drug target in AML.","['Department of Molecular Biology, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway. david.huang@gades.uib.no']",,,,PMC1876472,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 19.,"Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts maintain their pluripotency through a complex interplay of different signaling pathways and transcription factors including Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF), homeo-domain protein Nanog and POU-domain-containing transcription factor Oct3/4. LIF can maintain the self-renewal of mouse ESCs by activating the Jak/Stat3 pathway; however, it is dispensable for human ESCs. Nanog, a homeo-domain transcription factor alone is sufficient for sustaining the self-renewal of ESCs. Overexpression of Nanog by heterologous promoters can maintain self-renewal of human and mouse ESCs in the absence of LIF/Stat3 pathway. The mechanisms that control the expression of Nanog, however, remain poorly understood. In this report we demonstrate that retinol, the alcohol form of Vitamin A, can suppress the differentiation of ESCs by up-regulating the expression of Nanog. Retinol is mainly associated with differentiation through its active metabolite retinoic acid during early development of the embryo. The activation of Nanog by retinol is not mediated via retinoic acid signaling and appears to be independent of previously described LIF/Stat3, bone morphogenic proteins, Wnt/beta-catenin, and Oct3/4-Sox2 pathways. These studies therefore, reveal a previously unknown function of retinol and offer a model system to define alternate regulatory pathways that control the self-renewal of ESCs as well as to identify upstream ""master"" regulatory factors that are responsible for maintaining the integrity of stem cells.","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differential display identified HAS2 as a LIF-induced gene and its product, HA, modulated osteoblast differentiation similarly to LIF. Our data suggest that LIF arrests osteoblast differentiation by altering HA content of the extracellular matrix. INTRODUCTION: Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) elicits both anabolic and catabolic effects on bone. We previously showed in the fetal rat calvaria (RC) cell system that LIF inhibits osteoblast differentiation at the late osteoprogenitor/early osteoblast stage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To uncover potential molecular mediators of this inhibitory activity, we used a positive-negative genome-wide differential display screen to identify LIF-induced changes in the developing osteoblast transcriptome. RESULTS: Although LIF signaling is active throughout the RC cell proliferation-differentiation sequence, only a relatively small number of genes, in several different functional clusters, are modulated by LIF specifically during the LIF-sensitive inhibitory time window. Based on their known and predicted functions, most of the LIF-regulated genes identified are plausible candidates to be involved in the LIF-induced arrest of osteoprogenitor differentiation. To test this hypothesis, we further analyzed the function of one of the genes identified, hyaluronan synthase 2 (HAS2), in the LIF-induced inhibition. Synthesis of hyaluronan (HA), the product of HAS enzymatic activity, was stimulated by LIF and mimicked the HAS2 expression profile, with highest expression in early/proliferative and late/maturing cultures and lowest levels in intermediate/late osteoprogenitor-early osteoblast cultures. Exogenously added high molecular weight HA, the product of HAS2, dose-dependently inhibited osteoblast differentiation, with pulse-treatment effective in the same differentiation stage-specific inhibitory window as seen with LIF. In addition, however, pulse treatment with HA in early cultures slightly increased bone nodule formation. Treatment with hyaluronidase, on the other hand, stimulated bone nodule formation in early cultures but caused a small dose-dependent inhibition of osteoblast differentiation in the LIF- and HA-sensitive late time window. CONCLUSIONS: Together the data suggest that osteoblast differentiation is acutely sensitive to HA levels and that LIF inhibits osteoblast development at least in part by stimulating high molecular weight HA synthesis through HAS2.","['Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto.

Besides, our observations also indicate that the aggregation of the leukemia cells occured when CdS nanoparticles were introduced into the relative target system together with doxorubicin, suggesting that the specific association of CdS nanoparticles with biologically active molecules on the surface of leukemia K562 cells may change some biorecognition or signal transfer pathway among cancer cells.

Median age was 22 years (1-59), and 62% of the patients were in relapse at transplant. Patient-donor human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity of three antigens was 37% in the graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) and 29% in the rejection directions. All patients received a partially T cell-depleted graft using T10B9 (n = 46) or OKT3 (n = 107). Five years LFS and overall survival (OS) of patients with increased gammadelta compared to those with normal/decreased numbers were 54.4 vs 19.1%; P < 0.0003, and 70.8 vs 19.6% P < 0.0001, respectively, with no difference in GvHD (P = 0.96). In a Cox multivariate analysis, normal/decreased gammadelta (hazard ratio (HR) 4.26, P = 0.0002) and sex mismatch (HR 1.45 P=0.049) were associated with inferior LFS.

DNA viruses such as genetically engineered adenoviral vectors have widely been used to deliver either a prodrug-activating enzyme or express wild-type p53 selectively in tumour cells in ex vivo purging protocols. In addition, conditionally replicating adenoviruses that selectively replicate in tumour cells and herpes simplex virus type 1 are other DNA viruses that have been tested as ex vivo purging agents under laboratory conditions. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and reovirus are naturally occurring RNA viruses that appear to hold promise as purging agents under ex vivo and in vivo settings. Preclinical data demonstrate reovirus's purging potential against breast, monocytic and myeloma cell lines as well as patient-derived tumours of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and small lymphocytic lymphoma. In addition, VSV has shown effective killing of leukaemic cell lines and multiple myeloma patient specimens. Given the increasing interest in the utilization of viruses as purging agents, the following review provides a timely summary of the potential and the challenges of oncolytic viruses as purging modalities during ASCT.","['Department of Medicine, Tom Baker Cancer Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.']",,,,,89,,,,,,,,,,

We reviewed all reported serious adverse events of cardiac adverse events occurring in patients on clinical trials involving imatinib. Among 1276 patients enrolled, 22 (1.7%) were identified as having symptoms that could be attributed to systolic heart failure. The median age was 70 years (range, 49 to 83 years). The median time from start of imatinib therapy was 162 days (range, 2-2045 days). At the time these events were reported, 8 (0.6%) were considered possibly or probably related to imatinib. A total of 18 patients had previous medical conditions predisposing to cardiac failure: congestive heart failure (CHF; 6 [27%] patients), diabetes mellitus (6 [27%] patients), hypertension (10 [45%] patients), coronary artery disease (CAD; 8 [36%] patients), arrhythmia (3 [14%] patients), and cardiomyopathy (1 [5%] patient). Of the 22 patients, 11 continued imatinib therapy with dose adjustments and management for the CHF symptoms without further complications. Imatinib therapy as a causal factor of CHF is uncommon, mainly seen in elderly patients with preexisting cardiac conditions. Patients with previous cardiac history should be monitored closely and treated aggressively with standard medical therapy, including diuretics, if they develop symptoms suggestive of heart failure.","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas, M.

T-helper 1 (Th(1)) cytokines are decreased but T-helper 2 (Th(2)) cytokines are not affected by zinc deficiency in humans. This shift of Th(1) to Th(2) function results in cell-mediated immune dysfunction. Because IL-2 production (Th(1) cytokine) is decreased, this leads to decreased activities of natural-killer cell and T cytolytic cells, which are involved in killing viruses, bacteria, and tumor cells. In humans, zinc deficiency may decrease the generation of new CD4+ T cells from the thymus. In cell culture studies (HUT-78, a Th(0) human malignant lymphoblastoid cell line), as a result of zinc deficiency, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, phosphorylation of IkappaB, and binding of NF-kappaB to DNA are decreased and this results in decreased Th(1) cytokine production. In another study, zinc supplementation to humans decreased the gene expression and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased oxidative stress markers. In HL-60 cells (a human pro-myelocytic leukemia cell line), zinc deficiency increased the levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8 cytokines and mRNA. In these cells, zinc induced A20, a zinc finger protein that inhibited NF-kappaB activation via tumor necrosis factor receptor associated factor pathway, and this decreased gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress markers. We conclude that zinc has an important role in cell-mediated immune functions and also functions as antiinflammatory and antioxidant agent.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Hematology, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan 48201, USA. prasada@karmanos.org']",['R01 A150698-04/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,36,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 20.,"Transcriptional activation of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is mediated by the viral oncoprotein Tax, which utilizes cellular transcriptional machinery to perform this function. The viral promoter carries three cyclic AMP-response elements (CREs), which are recognized by the cellular transcription factor cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB). Tax binds to GC-rich sequences that immediately flank the CREs. The coactivator CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 binds to this promoter-bound ternary complex, which promotes the initiation of HTLV-1 transcription. Protein kinase A phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133 facilitates transcription from cellular CREs by recruiting CBP/p300 via its KIX domain. However, it remains controversial whether CREB phosphorylation plays a role in Tax transactivation. In this study, we biochemically characterized the quaternary complex formed by Tax, CREB, KIX, and the viral CRE by examining the individual molecular interactions that contribute to Tax stabilization in the complex. Our data show KIX, Ser(133)-phosphorylated CREB, and vCRE DNA are all required for stable Tax incorporation into the complex in vitro. Consonant with a fundamental role for CREB phosphorylation in Tax recruitment to the complex, we found that CREB is highly phosphorylated in a panel of HTLV-1-infected human T-cell lines. Significantly, we show that Tax is directly responsible for promoting elevated levels of CREB phosphorylation. Together, these data support a model in which Tax promotes CREB phosphorylation in vivo to ensure availability for Tax transactivation. Because pCREB has been implicated in leukemogenesis, enhancement of CREB phosphorylation by the virus may play a role in the etiology of adult T-cell leukemia.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Colorado State University, Fort Collins, Colorado 80523-1870, USA.']","['R01 CA055035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55035/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055035-14S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA55035-S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA055035-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate incidence and survival rates of French adolescents and young adults with cancer. All cases of cancer occuring over a 20-year period (1978-1997) in the cohort of patients aged 15 to 24, were obtained from nine population-based registries (10 % of the French population). Basal cell carcinomas of the skin were excluded. 1161 and 1884 cases were recorded in adolescents and young adults, respectively. Overall incidence rates (IR) were 161.4/10(6) in adolescents aged 15-19 years (M/F ratio = 1.3), and 252.6/10(6) in young adults aged 20-24 years (M/F ratio : 1.2). During the 1978-97 period, the IRs appeared stable over the years, +0.4 % [CI95 % = -2.3 ; +3.1] (p = 0.79) for adolescents and +1.7 % [CI95 % = -4.0 ; +7.3] (p = 0.57) for young adults. Five-year overall survival rates were 69.1 % [CI95 % = 66.4-71.8] for adolescents and 74.5 % [CI95 % = 72.3-76.7] for young adults. The 5-year survival rate for patients 15-24 years improved from 62.0 % (CI95 % = 57.5-66.5) in 1978-82 to 80.2 % (IC95 % = 77.7-82.8) in 1993-97.

Since only in a subset of these cases biallelic inactivation of ATM was observed, we sought to identify other disease-associated genes within 11q22-q23 by analysing NPAT (cell-cycle regulation), CUL5 (ubiquitin-dependent apoptosis regulation) and PPP2R1B (component of the cell-cycle and apoptosis regulating PP2A) for point mutations and their expression in B-CLL by single-strand conformation polymorphism/sequence analysis of the transcripts and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Though none of the genes were affected by deleterious mutations, we observed a significant down-regulation of NPAT in B-CLL versus CD19+ B cells and of CUL5 in 11q deletion versus non-deletion B-CLL samples and measured reduced PPP2R1B transcript levels in a subset of B-CLL cases. Alternative splicing of PPP2R1B transcripts (skipping of exons 2/3, 3, 9) was associated with a reduced activity of protein phosphatase 2A. Together, these results implicate deregulation of the cell-cycle and apoptosis regulators NPAT, CUL5 and PPP2R1B and a role for these genes in the pathogenesis of B-CLL.","['Division of Molecular Genetics, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany. c.schaffner@dkfz.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Mar 15.,"Galpha12 and Galpha13 transduce signals from G protein-coupled receptors to RhoA through RhoGEFs containing an RGS homology (RH) domain, such as p115 RhoGEF or leukemia-associated RhoGEF (LARG). The RH domain of p115 RhoGEF or LARG binds with high affinity to active forms of Galpha12 and Galpha13 and confers specific GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity, with faster GAP responses detected in Galpha13 than in Galpha12. At the same time, Galpha13, but not Galpha12, directly stimulates the RhoGEF activity of p115 RhoGEF or nonphosphorylated LARG in reconstitution assays. In order to better understand the molecular mechanism by which Galpha13 regulates RhoGEF activity through interaction with RH-RhoGEFs, we sought to identify the region(s) of Galpha13 involved in either the GAP response or RhoGEF activation. For this purpose, we generated chimeras between Galpha12 and Galpha13 subunits and characterized their biochemical activities. In both cell-based and reconstitution assays of RhoA activation, we found that replacing the carboxyl-terminal region of Galpha12 (residues 267-379) with that of Galpha13 (residues 264-377) conferred gain-of-function to the resulting chimeric subunit, Galpha12C13. The inverse chimera, Galpha13C12, exhibited basal RhoA activation which was similar to Galpha12. In contrast to GEF assays, GAP assays showed that Galpha12C13 or Galpha13C12 chimeras responded to the GAP activity of p115 RhoGEF or LARG in a manner similar to Galpha12 or Galpha13, respectively. We conclude from these results that the carboxyl-terminal region of Galpha13 (residues 264-377) is essential for its RhoGEF stimulating activity, whereas the amino-terminal alpha helical and switch regions of Galpha12 and Galpha13 are responsible for their differential GAP responses to the RH domain.","['Department of Pharmacology (M/C 868), University of Illinois College of Medicine, 835 South Wolcott Ave., Chicago, IL 60612, USA.']","['GM61454/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS41441/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The high-density oligonucleotide microarrays of both Agilent Technologies (based on two-color detection) and Applied Biosystems (based on single-color detection) were evaluated. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) at different stages of target preparations. Poly(A) RNA versus total RNA target hybridizations exhibited slightly lower correlation coefficients than did self versus self hybridizations (i.e., poly(A) RNA targets vs. poly(A) RNA targets or total RNA targets vs. total RNA targets). Only a small fraction of all transcripts appeared to be significantly over- or underrepresented when total RNA targets or poly(A) RNA targets from the same biological sample were compared. Therefore, the conclusion is that poly(A) affinity purification from total RNA can be omitted during target preparation for routine mRNA expression analysis using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays. Among consistently overrepresented transcripts in total RNA targets were histone mRNAs known to lack poly(A) tails. Therefore, structurally exceptional RNA species can be identified by comparing targets derived from either poly(A) RNA or total RNA using microarray hybridization.","['Computational Biology Unit, Bergen Center for Computational Science, University of Bergen, N-5008 Bergen, Norway.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, none has proven to be superior. Fractionation of the irradiation results in less toxic side-effects, but the total dose has to be increased to obtain similar immunosuppressive effects. Data from randomized trials indicate that among patients with myeloid leukaemia, busulfan in combination with cyclophosphamide results in similar outcome, while a regimen containing total body irradiation is probably still the best for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Busulfan treatment can be optimized by targeted steady-state concentration or with the use of intravenous preparations. Intensified regimens decrease the relapse incidence, but because of a higher mortality from transplant-related causes survival is unchanged. Reduced-intensity conditioning can reduce transplant-related mortality and offer otherwise ineligible patients a potentially curative treatment. Long-term results are unknown.","['Centre for Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation and Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, M54, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, SE-141 86 Stockholm, Sweden. johan.aschan@karolinska.se']",,,,,79,,,,,,,,,,

As it is closely related to the major therapeutic principle, graft-versus-leukaemia (GvL) effect, risk assessment has to balance both risks depending on the pre-transplant status. This is clearly demonstrated when comparing the two major strategies for prevention of GvHD. While the majority of approaches aiming at T-cell depletion show efficacy in reducing acute and chronic GvHD and transplant-related mortality, T-cell depletion also affects graft-versus-leukaemia effects and thus results in a higher relapse rate. Thus, standard prophylaxis relying on calcineurin inhibitors frequently results in at least equivalent or even superior long-term disease-free survival, and the risk of relapse has to be considered when selecting regimens for prevention of GvHD. In addition to this general dilemma, drug-specific side-effects and risks have to be considered when selecting regimens for GvHD prevention and treatment.","['Department of Haematology/Oncology, University of Regensburg, Medical Centre, Franz-Josef Strauss Allee 11, 93042 Regensburg, Germany. ernst.holler@klinik.uni-regensburg.de']",,,,,95,,,,,,,,,,

However, two other sources of progenitor cells, peripheral blood (PB) and umbilical cord (UC), are being increasingly used. The type of graft is one of the most important factors in determining the speed and robustness of the reconstitution after the transplant of monocytes, T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, NK cells, and dendritic cells. This fact is of especial relevance since the most important reactions after allogeneic transplants - e.g. graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), graft-versus-leukaemia effect (GvL), achievement of full donor chimerism, and fight against infections - are strongly influenced by a rapid and robust reconstitution of these cells.

In large retrospective registry studies of several thousands of patients with aplastic anemia, chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), acute myelocytic leukemia (AML), and multiple myeloma, chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) was more frequent and transplant-related mortality (TRM) higher in males with a female donor (F-->M) than in other donor-recipient sex combinations.

Because HLA gene products provoke host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host alloimmune responses, HLA matching serves a critical preventive role in lowering risks of graft failure and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). At the same time, graft-versus-leukemia effects associated with HLA mismatching may provide an immunological means to lower the recurrence of post-transplant disease in high-risk patients. The definition of a suitable allogeneic donor is ever changing, shaped not only by current typing technology for the known HLA genes but also by the specific transplant procedure. Increased safety of alternative donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been achieved in part through advances in the field of immunogenetics. Increased availability of HCT through the use of HLA-mismatched related and unrelated donors is feasible with a more complete understanding of permissible HLA mismatches and the role of NK-KIR genes in transplantation.","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, 1959 Northeast Pacific, Seattle, WA 98195, USA. epetersd@fhcrc.org']","['CA18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI033484-17/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100019-10/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI069197/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI33484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI033484/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA100019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U01 AI069197-05S1/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI069197/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA018029-33S1/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA100019/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC3680359,106,,,,['NIHMS28837'],,,,,,

We compared outcomes for 105 patients aged 16 to 59 years undergoing URD transplants for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who were reported to the Australasian Bone Marrow Transplant Recipient Registry between 1992 and 2002, and a strictly selected matching set of 105 HLA-matched sibling donor (MSD) transplants. There was no significant difference between URD and MSD controls in the distributions of time from diagnosis to transplant, donor-recipient sex match, prior therapies, donor age, or performance status. The median follow-up of live URD patients was 4.4 years and for live MSD controls was 6.3 years. There were 18 good risk (complete remission [CR]1) and 87 poor risk (>CR1) recipients in both URD and sibling groups. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) was not significantly different for good-risk URD and sibling donor recipients (62% versus 40%, P = .2), or poor-risk URD and sibling recipients (21% versus 25%, P = .2). In a stratified multivariate Cox regression model, the independent adverse risk factors for DFS were recipient cytomegalovirus positivity (P = .01) and the interaction of URD and earlier year of transplant (P = .006). Both neutrophil and platelet engraftment were significantly more rapid in the sibling group, but transplant-related mortality at 100 days was not significantly different. There was no difference in the cumulative incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease grade II or above at 100 days. Relapse occurred in 28% of good risk URD subjects and 16% of siblings (P = .3), and in poor risk subjects 39% and 29%, respectively (P = .2). Based on this data, URD allografts should be considered in AML patients without a matched sibling donor. This study provides a rationale for a larger prospective study of risk factors in allogeneic transplantation for AML and a guide on the subset of patients who may most benefit from an unrelated donor allograft in AML.","[""Haematology Department, St. Vincent's Hospital, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia. jmoore@stvincents.com.au""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a trial using Campath 1 H pre- and post-HSCT in an attempt to decrease the incidence of GVHD without increasing the risk of infection or relapse. Patients were retrospectively compared to a population of patients who received antithymocyte globulin (ATG) pre- and post-HSCT. Twenty-seven patients were evaluated for this study. Fourteen patients received Campath 1H and 13 patients received ATG. Demographics of patients who received Campath 1H consisted of 9 males and 5 females, with a median age of 13 years (3-17.8 years). Thirteen patients received unrelated bone marrow and 1 patient received unrelated PBSC. Demographics of patients receiving ATG consisted of 9 males, 4 females with a median age of 7.4 years (21 months-19 years). Twelve patients received unrelated bone marrow and 1 patient received unrelated PBSC. Diagnoses were similar between the 2 groups. Patients who received Campath1H received a total dose of 52 mg/m(2) pre-HSCT and 20 mg/m(2) post-HSCT. Patients who received ATG received a total dose of 60 mg/kg pre-HSCT and 100 mg/kg post-HSCT. GVHD prophylaxis and supportive care measures were similar in both groups, including aggressive antimicrobial therapy. There was a significant difference in the incidence of severe (grade III and grade IV) GVHD between the 2 groups (Campath [0 of 14] versus ATG [6 of 13], P = .006). Among the patients who were transplanted for leukemia, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of relapse (Campath [2 of 14] versus ATG [4 of 9], P = 0.16). The 100-day survival between the 2 groups was not significantly different. Patients receiving Campath 1H had the presence of CD3(+) T cells (>30 cells/mL) in their peripheral blood later than in those who received ATG (64.5 days [Campath 1H] versus 27days [ATG], P = .001). The median time to the development of a normal PHA response occurred later in the Campath 1H arm (283 days[(Campath 1H] versus 88 days [ATG], P = .0001). The median time to an antigen specific response also occurred later in those receiving Campath 1H (365 days [Campath 1H] versus 150 days [ATG], P = .004). There was no significant difference between the 2 groups in terms of fungal or viral infections. Campath 1H is effective in decreasing the incidence of GVHD without increasing the risk of relapse. Although there is a significant delay in immune reconstitution, there was no increase in infectious complications or relapse in recipients of Campath 1H. Further studies are warranted to assess if a lack of difference in infection rates are still demonstrated in larger cohorts.","['Department of Pediatrics, Keck School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California, USA.']",['M01 RR00043/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Feb 22.,"The role of allogeneic transplantation in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia in first complete remission (AML-CR1) is controversial. Aiming to preserve a graft-versus-leukemia effect, but minimize morbidity and mortality from conditioning-related toxicity and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), we conducted a prospective multicenter study of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) as preparation for peripheral blood stem cell sibling allografts in patients with intermediate or poor risk AML-CR1. Conditioning consisted of fludarabine 125 mg/m(2) and cyclophosphamide 120 mg/kg. Thirty-four patients were transplanted with a median age of 45 years; 85% had intermediate risk cytogenetics. Early toxicity was minimal. The overall incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was low (21%), but the 3 patients (9%) who developed grade IV GVHD died. Donor T cell chimerism was rapid and generally complete, but complete myeloid chimerism was delayed. Thirteen patients (38%) relapsed, 12 within a year of transplant. The estimated disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival at 2 years was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI] 39%-71%) and 68% (95% CI 50%-81%), respectively. The incidence of extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was low (24% of surviving patients at 12 months) and most survivors had an excellent performance status. These observations justify a prospective comparison of RIC versus myeloablative conditioning allografts for AML-CR1.","['Department of Clinical Haematology and Bone Marrow Transplant Service, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. andrew.grigg@mh.org.au']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Feb 15.,"Donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) are frequently required following reduced intensity conditioned (RIC) allografts to convert mixed chimerism (MC) to full donor chimerism (FDC). The rationale is to break tolerance and maximize the graft-versus-leukemia responses. We analyzed the impact of chimerism in 125 recipients of RIC (Alemtuzumab containing) transplants. Four patterns of chimerism were seen: (1) always 100% donor chimerism (54%), (2) persisting MC (22%), (3) MC with subsequent development of FDC (18%), (4) lost donor chimerism (6%). Forty-five (36%) patients received DLI. Chimerism patterns and pre-DLI lymphocyte counts (pDLI[Ly]) were significantly associated with DLI responsiveness. Complete disease responses were seen in 6 of 17 (35%) group A patients, 9 of 10 (90%) group C patients, and 0 of 6 group B patients (P = .027), supporting reports that chimerism response is a surrogate marker for disease response. In those with MC, pDLI(Ly) were significantly lower in DLI responsive than nonresponsive patients (P = .044). At 2 years, group C patients had a significant survival advantage (P = .009) compared to all other groups. In conclusion, the chimerism pattern was the best indicator of improved survival in this cohort (ie, MC later converting to FDC). In those with MC, response to DLI therapy was associated with a low lymphocyte count pre-DLI.","['Department of Haematology, Nottingham City Hospital Campus, Nottingham University Hospitals, Nottingham UK. bshaw@doctors.org.uk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the study was to examine its anti-proliferative and apoptotic effect on other malignant cell lines. Cells of the following lines were incubated with 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0microM of lycopene: human colon carcinoma (HuCC), B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (EHEB), human erythroleukemia (K562) and Raji, a prototype of Burkitt lymphoma cell line. The results showed that lycopene exerted a significant dose-dependent effect on the proliferation capacity of K562, Raji and HuCC lines, whereas this effect was observed in EHEB cells only with the highest dose used in the study. Increased apoptotic rate was found after incubation of HuCC cells with 2.0 and 4.0microM of lycopene and in Raji cells following incubation with 2.0microM. The findings point out that the anti-proliferative effect of lycopene on tumor cells and its effect on the apoptotic rate depends on its dosage and on the type of the malignant cells.","['Department of Medicine C, Rabin Medical Center-Golda Campus (Hasharon), Petah-Tiqva, and the Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Israel.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This necessitates that safer compounds, especially those derived from natural sources must be critically examined for chemoprevention. A spice common to India and the surrounding regions, is turmeric, derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa. Pre-clinical studies in a variety of cancer cell lines including breast, cervical, colon, gastric, hepatic, leukemia, oral epithelial, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate have consistently shown that curcumin possesses anti-cancer activity in vitro and in pre-clinical animal models. The robust activity of curcumin in colorectal cancer has led to five phase I clinical trials being completed showing the safety and tolerability of curcumin in colorectal cancer patients. To date clinical trials have not identified a maximum tolerated dose of curcumin in humans with clinical trials using doses up to 8000mg per day. The success of these trials has led to the development of phase II trials that are currently enrolling patients. Overwhelming in vitro evidence and completed clinical trials suggests that curcumin may prove to be useful for the chemoprevention of colon cancer in humans. This review will focus on describing the pre-clinical and clinical evidence of curcumin as a chemopreventive compound in colorectal cancer.","['University of Wisconsin, School of Pharmacy, 777 Highland Avenue, Madison, WI 53705-2222, USA. jjjohnson6@wisc.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Mar 13.,"Human myelogenous leukemia K562 cells were induced to undergo megakaryocytic differentiation by long-term treatment with phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The protein level of nucleophosmin/B23 (NPM/B23), a nucleolar protein, was substantially decreased upon TPA treatment. In this study, we found that the proteasome inhibitors blocked the decrease of NPM/B23 protein in response to TPA, suggesting the proteasomes were involved in the downregulation of NPM/B23 upon megakaryocytic differentiation. To investigate the signaling pathway in the downregulation of NPM/B23 during early TPA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells, K562 cells were treated with TPA in the presence of the PKC isozyme-selective inhibitors, GF109203X and Go 6976, or MEK1 inhibitor, PD98059. The decrease of NPM/B23 protein in the TPA-treated K562 cells was blocked by GF109203X but not by Go 6976, suggesting the involvement of novel PKCs in the downregulation of NPM/B23 during TPA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells. The application of MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 upon TPA treatment blocked the TPA-induced decrease of NPM/B23 protein and aborted the megakaryocytic differentiation but not to break through the cell growth arrest. Unlike NPM/B23, the degradation of nucleolin in the TPA-treated K562 cells could not be blocked by PD98059 while the TPA-induced megakaryocytic differentiation was abrogated.

Epub 2007 Mar 24.,"The salvage of deoxyribonucleosides in the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, which has an extremely A+T-rich genome, was investigated. All native deoxyribonucleosides were phosphorylated by D. discoideum cell extracts and we subcloned three deoxyribonucleoside kinase (dNK) encoding genes. D. discoideum thymidine kinase was similar to the human thymidine kinase 1 and was specific for thymidine with a K(m) of 5.1 microM. The other two cloned kinases were phylogenetically closer to bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases than to the eukaryotic enzymes. D. discoideum deoxyadenosine kinase (DddAK) had a K(m) for deoxyadenosine of 22.7 microM and a k(cat) of 3.7 s(-1) and could not efficiently phosphorylate any other native deoxyribonucleoside. D. discoideum deoxyguanosine kinase was also a purine-specific kinase and phosphorylated significantly only deoxyguanosine, with a K(m) of 1.4 microM and a k(cat) of 3 s(-1). The two purine-specific deoxyribonucleoside kinases could represent ancient enzymes present in the common ancestor of bacteria and eukaryotes but remaining only in a few eukaryote lineages. The narrow substrate specificity of the D. discoideum dNKs reflects the biased genome composition and we attempted to explain the strict preference of DddAK for deoxyadenosine by modeling the active center with different substrates. Apart from its native substrate, deoxyadenosine, DddAK efficiently phosphorylated fludarabine. Hence, DddAK could be used in the enzymatic production of fludarabine monophosphate, a drug used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['BioCentrum-DTU, Technical University of Denmark, Lyngby, Denmark. msandrini@aki.ku.dk <msandrini@aki.ku.dk>']",,,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/AY192983', 'GENBANK/AY192984', 'GENBANK/AY669384']",,,,

We show here that in IMR-32 neuronal cells endogenously expressing the receptor subunits for LIF and CNTF, CNTFR, but not gp130 or LIFR, is found in detergent-resistant lipid rafts. In addition, stimulation of these cells with CNTF resulted in a rapid translocation of a portion of gp130 and LIFR into detergent-resistant lipid rafts while an equivalent stimulation with LIF did not. Disruption of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion of cell membranes blocked the CNTF-induced translocation of LIFR and gp130. Interestingly, while cholesterol-depletion did not inhibit signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 phosphorylation by either CNTF or LIF stimulation, it strongly inhibited both CNTF- and LIF-mediated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 and Akt. LIF and CNTF generally appear to have redundant effects in cells responsive to both cytokines. Intriguingly, the data presented here suggest a possible mechanism whereby CNTF or other cytokines that signal through CNTFR could generate signals distinct from those elicited by cytokines such as LIF which utilize a LIFR/gp130 heterodimer, via association with or exclusion from lipid rafts.","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195-7750, USA.']","['GM07270/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS30410/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead, we suggest a central chi-square distribution as a better approximation to the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic. Furthermore, not only to estimate the optimal value of the unknown parameter on the scale of cluster but also to adjust for multiple testing due to repeating the procedure by changing the parameter value, we propose the minimum of the profile p-value of the test statistic for the parameter as an integrated test statistic. We also provide a statistic to estimate the areas or cases which make large contributions to significant clustering. The proposed methods are illustrated with a data set concerning the locations of cases of childhood leukemia and lymphoma and another on early medieval grave site locations consisting of affected and nonaffected grave sites.","['Department of Technology Assessment and Biostatistics, National Institute of Public Health, 3-6 Minami 2 chome, Wako, Saitama 351-0197, Japan. tango@niph.go.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retrospective analysis of 72 transplanted myeloma patients was carried out to determine the frequency and clinical significance of the appearance of abnormal proteins bands (APB) distinct from the original paraprotein. APB presence was observed in 31 patients (43%) already after the first autotransplant, the median interval from transplant was 2 months (range, 1 to 6 months). The most frequent occurrence of APB was observed after allogeneic transplantation. In the group of patients with APB presence more patients achieved complete remission (32.2% versus 17.1%), statistically significant differences were also established when we compared the percentage of surviving patients and overall survival, to the present date, among both groups of patients (p=0.03). All relapsed patients with previous isotype class switching had disease characterized by the same type of paraprotein as that detected at diagnosis.

The results of antiproliferative studies showed that antiproliferative potential of flavonoids tested decreased in the order: isorhamnetin > kaempferol > myricetin > rutin, while their antioxidant properties decreased in the order: rutin > myricetin > kaempferol > isorhamnetin. Combinational treatment of isorhamnetin, kaempferol and myricetin with AraC led to synergism in their antiproliferative activities (CIs < 1). Rutin exhibited antagonism with AraC (CIs > 1). Apoptotic DNA fragmentation and flow cytometry analyses revealed that synergism in antiproliferative activities of compounds tested might be due to potentiation of AraC-induced apoptosis. In conclusion, our results clearly indicate that isorhamnetin, kaempferol and myricetin despite their antioxidant properties might be used to increase the sensitivity of leukemia cells to AraC treatment.","['Department of Genetics, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 19.,"PURPOSE: Claims data may be a suitable source studying associations between drugs and cancer. However, linkage between cancer registry and claims data including pharmacy-dispensing information is not always available. We examined the accuracy of claims-based definitions of incident cancers and their date of diagnosis. METHODS: Four claims-based definitions were developed to identify incident leukemia, lymphoma, lung, colorectal, stomach, and breast cancer. We identified a cohort of subjects aged >or=65 (1997-2000) from Pennsylvania Medicare and drug benefit program data linked with the state cancer registry. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of the claims-based definitions using registry as the gold standard. We further assessed the agreement between diagnosis dates from two data sources. RESULTS: All definitions had very high specificity (>or=98%), while sensitivity varied between 40% and 90%. Test characteristics did not vary systematically by age groups. The date of first diagnosis according to Medicare data tended to be later than the date recorded in the registry data except for breast cancer. The differences in dates of first diagnosis were within 14 days for 75% to 88% of the cases. Bias due to outcome misclassification of our claims-based definition of cancer was minimal in our example of a cohort study. CONCLUSIONS: Claims data can identify incident hematologic malignancies and solid tumors with very high specificity with sufficient agreement in the date of first diagnosis. The impact of bias due to outcome misclassification and thus the usefulness of claims-based cancer definitions as cancer outcome markers in etiologic studies need to be assessed for each study setting.","[""Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics, Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. ssetoguchi@partners.org""]","['2-R01-HS10881/HS/AHRQ HHS/United States', 'R01-AG021950/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AG023178/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 20.,"IL-21, the most recently discovered member of the IL-2 cytokine family, is an attractive subject for research due to its involvement in experimental models of autoimmunity, its ability to down-regulate IgE production, and its anti-tumor properties. Its interest for cancer immunotherapy stems from its physiological immune-enhancing functions. These include regulation of T, B and NK cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, and effector functions. IL-21's functional activities partially overlap those of IL-2. Both cytokines display similar structural features and use the common gamma-chain receptor and its downstream signaling pathways. Besides its activities on normal lymphoid cells, IL-21 is an in vitro growth factor for myeloma and acute-T cell leukemia cells, whereas it induces the apoptosis of B-CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia) cells. These findings indicate that the IL-21/IL-21R system exerts opposite functions in different lymphoid neoplasias, and suggest its employment in B-CLL therapy. Since IL-2, but not IL-21, is specifically required for the development of regulatory T (Treg) cell immune-suppressive functions, IL-21 may be a new tool for cancer immunotherapy. It is, in fact, a powerful anti-tumor agent in a variety of murine experimental tumor models through its activation of specific or innate immune responses against neoplastic cells. The preliminary data from phase-I clinical studies suggest that the use of IL-21 is feasible and may result in immune-enhancing effects.","[""Dipartimento di Oncologia e Neuroscienze, Sezione di Patologia Chirurgica, Ce.S.I.

ATL is a highly aggressive neoplastic disease of CD4 positive T lymphocyte, which is featured by the pleomorphic tumor cells with hypersegmented nuclei, called "" flower cell"". HTLV-I increases its copy number by clonal proliferation of the host cells, not by replication of the virus. Therefore, HTLV-I eventually induces ATL. Tax, encoded by HTLV-I pX region, has been recognized as a protein that plays a central role of the transformation of HTLV-I-infected cells by its pleiotropic actions. However, fresh ATL cells frequently lose Tax protein expression by several mechanisms. Recently, HBZ was identified in the complementary strand of HTLV-I and it is suggested that HBZ is a critical gene in leukemogenesis. Furthermore, there is a long latency period before onset of ATL, indicating the multistep mechanisms of leukemogenesis. Therefore, it is suggested that multiple factors, such as viral proteins, genetic and epigenetic changes of host genome, and immune status of the hosts, could be implicated in leukemogenesis of ATL.","['Laboratory of Human Tumor Viruses Department of Viral Oncology Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University. jyasunag@virus1.virus.kyoto-u.ac.jp']",,,,,73,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 19.,"We investigated the expression of Tie-2 in primary blasts from 111 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) to evaluate a possible linkage between the expression of this receptor and the immunophenotypic and biologic properties of leukemic blasts. Tie-2 was expressed at moderate and high levels in 39 and 23 of 111 AMLs, respectively. The analysis of the immunophenotype clearly showed that Tie-2 expression in AML was associated with monocytic features. Interestingly, Tie-2 expression on AML blasts was associated with concomitant expression of other receptors for endothelial growth factors, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGF-R1), -R2, and -R3. Tie-2(+) AMLs were characterized by high blast cell counts at diagnosis, a high frequency of Flt3 mutations, and increased Flt3 expression. The survival of Tie-2(+) AMLs is sustained through an autocrine pattern involving Angiopoietin-1 and Tie-2, as suggested by experiments showing induction of apoptosis in Tie-2(+) AMLs by agents preventing the binding of angiopoietins to Tie-2. Finally, the in vitro growth of Tie-2(+) AMLs in endothelial culture medium supplemented with VEGF and angiopoietins resulted in their partial endothelial differentiation. These observations suggest that Tie-2(+) AMLs pertain to a mixed monocytic/endothelial lineage, derived from the malignant transformation of the normal counterpart represented by monocytic cells expressing endothelial markers. The autocrine angiopoietin/Tie-2 axis may represent a promising therapeutic target to improve the outcome of patients with monocytic AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review boards of all participating institutions approved this study and waived the requirement for informed consent. CT scans were retrospectively reviewed in eight patients (seven men, one woman; age range, 23-71 years; mean age, 46 years) with pathologically proved granulocytic sarcoma of the small and/or large bowel. CT findings were evaluated with regard to the sites, morphologic characteristics, and contrast material enhancement patterns of the lesions, along with other ancillary findings (ie, peritoneal and mesenteric infiltration, ascites, lymphadenopathy, bowel perforation, and obstruction). RESULTS: Eight patients had a total of 13 lesions in the bowel (of which eight were pathologically proved), involving the duodenum (n=1), jejunum (n=2), ileum (n=5), sigmoid colon (n=1), and rectum (n=4); multifocal bowel lesions were noted in four patients. The lesion varied in shape, with wall thickening alone in three of 13 lesions, an intraluminal polypoid mass in four, an exophytic mass in one, and a combination of findings in five. Contrast material enhancement, relative to the back musculature, showed isoattenuation in seven lesions, hyperattenuation in four, and hypoattenuation in two. Five of eight patients had multiple peritoneal masses with diffuse mesenteric or peritoneal infiltration. Ascites was present in six of eight patients; lymphadenopathy (especially in the mesentery), in five; bowel perforation, in two; and bowel obstruction, in one. CONCLUSION: Granulocytic sarcoma of the bowel is characterized by variability in shape and contrast enhancement and has a high predilection for mesenteric and peritoneal spread.","['Department of Radiology and Research Institute of Radiology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Asan Medical Center, 388-1 Pungnap-2 Dong, Songpa-gu, Seoul 138-736, Korea.']",,,,,,,,"['(c) RSNA, 2007.']",,['Radiology. 2008 Feb;246(2):651; author reply 651.

Epub 2007 Apr 19.,"In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), mutational activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) Flt3 is frequently involved in leukemic transformation. However, little is known about a possible role of highly expressed wild-type Flt3 in AML. The proto-oncogene c-Cbl is an important regulator of RTK signaling, acting through its ubiquitin ligase activity and as a platform for several signaling adaptor molecules. Here, we analyzed the role of c-Cbl in Flt3 signal transduction and myeloid transformation. C-Cbl physically interacted with Flt3 and was tyrosine phosphorylated in the presence of Flt3-ligand (FL). Overexpression of a dominant-negative form of c-Cbl (Cbl-70Z) inhibited FL-induced Flt3 ubiquitylation and internalization, indicating involvement of c-Cbl in Flt3 signaling. DNA sequencing of AML bone marrow revealed a case with a c-Cbl point mutation (Cbl-R420Q). Cbl-R420Q inhibited Flt3 internalization and ubiquitylation. Coexpression of Cbl-R420Q or Cbl-70Z with Flt3 induced cytokine-independent growth and survival of 32Dcl3 cells in the absence of FL. Also, the mutant Cbl proteins altered the amplitude and duration of Flt3-dependent signaling events. Our results indicate an important role of Cbl proteins in Flt3 signal modulation. Also, the data suggest a novel mechanism of leukemic transformation in AML by mutational inactivation of negative RTK regulators.","['Department of Medicine, Hematology and Oncology, and Interdisciplinary Center for Clinical Research, University Hospital Munster, Albert-Schweitzer-Strasse 33, 48129 Munster, Germany.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interaction between CD40 and its ligand (CD40L), expressed on activated T lymphocytes, is critical for B cell survival. Here, we demonstrate that CD40 signals B cell survival in part via transcriptional activation of the RelB NF-kappaB subunit. CD40L treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells induced levels of relB mRNA. Similarly, CD40L-mediated rescue of WEHI 231 B lymphoma cells from apoptosis induced upon B cell receptor (surface IgM) engagement led to increased relB mRNA levels. Recently, we characterized a new de novo synthesis pathway for the RelB NF-kappaB subunit, induced by the cytomegalovirus IE1 protein, in which binding of p50/p65 NF-kappaB and c-Jun/Fra-2 AP-1 complexes to the relB promoter works in synergy to potently activate transcription (Wang, X., and Sonenshein, G. E. (2005) J. Virol. 79, 95-105). CD40L treatment of WEHI 231 cells caused induction of AP-1 family members Fra-2, c-Jun, JunD, and JunB. Cotransfection of Fra-2 with the Jun AP-1 subunits and p50/c-Rel NF-kappaB led to synergistic activation of the relB promoter. Ectopic expression of relB or RelB knockdown using small interfering RNA demonstrated the important role of this subunit in control of WEHI 231 cell survival and implicated activation of the anti-apoptotic factors Survivin and manganese superoxide dismutase. Thus, CD40 engagement of transformed B cells activates relB gene transcription via a process we have termed the de novo RelB synthesis pathway, which protects these cells from apoptosis.","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Boston University Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02118, USA.']","['R01 AI40181/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA36355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we examined the underlying mechanisms in VPA-mediated activities in AML cells. VPA not only inhibited the growth of HL-60, U937 and NB4 cells by causing cell-cycle arrest at G(0)/G(1) phase and apoptosis, but also induced morphologic and phenotypic changes. VPA markedly increased p21WAF1, and downregulated c-Myc expression at transcriptional levels. Ectopic expression of wildtype c-Myc and T58A mutant significantly inhibited VPA-mediated growth inhibition. As with results from cell line studies, VPA also downregulated c-Myc levels, and induced apoptosis and myeloid differentiation of primary AML cells, leading to decreased colony-forming ability. Given the role of c-Myc in leukemogenesis, our study suggests that VPA might be a potential therapeutic agent for AML.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Wanfang Hospital-Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the last 5 years, a total of 688 patients requiring HSCT underwent HLA testing in our department to identify a matched donor from their families. The sibship size ranged from 1 to > or =5 in all disease categories, except thalassemia major where the majority of patients had only 1 sibling. Family genotype analysis revealed that 39.3% of the total number of patients had an HLA-matched sibling and that families with sibship size of > or =4 had a higher probability (68.8%) compared with those with sibship size of < or =3 (29.7%). Because the Indian population is characterized by the presence of novel HLA alleles and unique haplotypes (HLA-A*0211, B*2707, A*26-B*08-DRB1*03), patients with rare HLA alleles have much less probability of finding an unrelated optimally matched donor than those with common HLA phenotypes. Smaller family size and unique HLA profile are limitations that can be overcome by developing unrelated volunteer marrow donor registries.

There are more than 230,000 available units today. The ideal UCB graft is a unit that is matched in five or six of six HLA. A, B (low-resolution) and DRB1 (high-resolution) alleles and which has over 2.5 x 107 nucleated cells/kg body weight (BW). Four of six matched units are also used specially if the cell dose gives more than 3 x 10(7) nucleated cells/kg BW. Our unrelated donor UCB transplant program was started in 1996 searching international cord blood banks (Netcord, New York) for patients with a definitive or potential indication for stem cell transplantation who lacked a matched family donor. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From 1995 to 1996, a search was initiated for 87 patients with malignant (n = 56, 37 acute leukemia) and nonmalignant conditions (16 congenital diseases, 14 aplastic anemia). Patient data along with low-resolution A, B, and DR typing were sent to the New York Blood Center, along with a blood sample for high-resolution DRB1 typing. Parallel searches were done in the Netcord database among UCB units with reported high-resolution DRB1 typing. Forty-eight searches were done between 1995 and 2000 (31 with high resolution) and 39 were done between 2000 and 2005 (33 with high resolution). UCB units were considered adequate if they had more than 2.7 x 10(7) cells/kg BW. RESULTS: During the first period, four patients (13%) matched five of six high-resolution unit and 21 (67%) a four of six match. During the second period, 15 patients (46%) found a five of six match and 16 (48%) a four of six match (P = .012). CONCLUSION: Nearly half of our patients find an optimal matched UCB unit for transplantation in international banks. The creation of a local UCB bank in our country is supported by these data.","['Department of Pediatrics, Catholic University of Chile, Santiago, Chile.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: From April 1997 to December 2005, 134 patients (75 male, 59 female; median age 25 years old) were transplanted in our bone marrow transplantation unit. All patients were conditioned with BU-CY2 or busulfan-based regimen and scheduled to receive a continuous injection of heparin at a dose of 100 IUxkg-1xd-1. The patients were divided into different groups: 87 patients received related donor transplantation and 47 patients unrelated donor transplantation; 40 patients had abnormal liver function prior to transplantation and the remaining 94 patients normal liver function; 68 patients received heparin from day -7 to day +21 post HSCT and the other 66 patients from day -7 to day +14. RESULTS: All 134 patients had sustained engraftment. The median time for neutrophils to reach 0.5 x 10(9)/L and for platelets to reach 20x10(9)/L were 12 days (range 9-28) and 20 days (range 6-65), respectively. The disease-free survival at day +100 for leukemia patients was 82.2% (97/118). None of 134 patients developed VOD (0%), including 10 patients with class 3 thalassemia major. The incidence and severity of clinical bleeding events in 15 patients monitored with prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time is comparable with those not monitored. CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that low dose heparin alone is effective and safe for the prophylaxis of VOD following allo-HSCT conditioned with BU-CY regimen. Shortening the duration of administering heparin from -7 d to +21 d to -7 d to +14 d does not affect the effectiveness of low dose heparin to prevent VOD.","['Department of Hematology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we describe the incidence of cancer in children, residing in ten Mexican jurisdictions, who were treated by the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS). METHODS: New cases of childhood cancer, which were registered prospectively in nine principal Medical Centers of IMSS during the periods 1998-2000 (five jurisdictions) and 1996-2002 (five jurisdictions), were analyzed. Personnel were specifically trained to register, capture, and encode information. For each of these jurisdictions, the frequency, average annual age-standardized incidence (AAS) and average annual incidence per period by sex and, age, were calculated (rates per 1,000,000 children/years). RESULTS: In total 2,615 new cases of cancer were registered, with the male/female ratio generally >1, but in some tumors there were more cases in females (retinoblastoma, germ cells tumors). The principal groups of neoplasms in seven jurisdictions were leukemias, central nervous system tumors (CNS tumors), and lymphomas, and the combined frequency for these three groups was 62.6 to 77.2%. Most frequently found (five jurisdictions) was the North American-European pattern (leukemias-CNS tumors-lymphomas). Eight jurisdictions had AAS within the range reported in the world literature. The highest incidence was found for children underless than five year of age. In eight jurisdictions, leukemia had high incidence (>50). The AAS of lymphomas was between 1.9 to 28.6. Chiapas and Guerrero had the highest AAS of CNS tumors (31.9 and 30.3, respectively). The frequency and incidence of neuroblastoma was low. Chiapas had the highest incidence of retinoblastoma (21.8). Germ-cell tumors had high incidence. CONCLUSION: The North American-European pattern of cancers was the principal one found; the overall incidence was within the range reported worldwide. In general but particularly in two jurisdictions (Yucatan and Chiapas), it will be necessary to carry out studies concerning the causes of cancer in children. Due to the little that is known about the incidence of cancer in Mexican children, it will be necessary to develop a national program to establish a cancer registry for the whole of the country.","['Registro de Cancer en Ninos, Unidad de Investigacion Medica en Epidemiologia Clinica, Hospital de Pediatria, Centro Medico Nacional Siglo XXI, Ciudad de Mexico, Mexico. afajardo@servidor.unam.mx']",,,,PMC1865556,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of KIR ligand effects in 1770 patients undergoing myeloablative T-replete hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) from HLA-matched or mismatched unrelated donors showed that lack of KIR ligand in patients for inhibitory KIR was associated with lower hazards of relapse in leukemia patients with in HLA-mismatched transplants [hazard ratio (HR): 0.061; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.43-0.85; P-value = 0.004]. Absence of HLA-C group 2 or HLA-Bw4 KIR ligands were each associated with lower hazards of relapse (HR: 0.47; 95% CI: 0.28-0.79; P-value = 0.004; HR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.33-0.97; P-value = 0.04, respectively). Based on these analyses, recipient homozygosity for HLA-B or -C epitopes that define KIR ligands is likely to be a predictive factor for leukemia relapse following myeloablative HCT from unrelated donors.

Recent in vitro studies showed that the anticoagulant effects of low-molecular-weight heparin were profoundly affected by endogenous AT levels in children undergoing ALL therapy. METHODS: A total of 112 consecutively recruited children with newly diagnosed ALL treated according to BFM 95/2000 protocols were enrolled in this trial. This prospective cohort study was carried out to determine the influence of combined low molecular weight heparin-prophylaxis (enoxaparin 1 mg/kg/ per day) and AT supplementation versus AT alone (noncontemporaneous control group) on the incidence of symptomatic TE during a follow-up of 240 days. RESULTS: To maintain AT plasma levels above 50%, nearly 60% of all children needed at least one, most children two or three AT supplementations during induction therapy. 12.7% of the children that did receive only AT-prophylaxis (n = 71) (95% CI = 6.0-22.7) developed objectively confirmed symptomatic TE, as compared with no TE in children after combined prophylaxis (n = 41) (95% CI = 0.0-8.6, P < 0.05). Thromboses were located in the sinovenous system in the brain (n = 3), the lower deep veins (n = 3), the upper deep veins (n = 2) and in an upper deep vein combined with pulmonary embolism (n = 1). CONCLUSION: Prophylaxis with enoxaparin was safe and effective in preventing TE. Although our data are encouraging, the in vivo efficacy of combined enoxaparin and AT prophylaxis to prevent symptomatic venous TE in children with ALL should be evaluated in a prospective randomized clinical trial.","['Department of Pediatrics, Innsbruck Medical University, Austria. bernhard.meister@i-med.ac.at']",,,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

The gp130 receptor, which is shared by the interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines, showed specific upregulation by TNF. TNF treatment (5 ng/ml for 30 min to 24 h) increased gp130 at both the levels of transcription and protein expression. The stability of gp130 protein was mediated by NFkappaB activity, as the inhibitors quinazoline and MG132 not only blocked the increase induced by 6 h of TNF treatment, but also reduced its basal level of expression. By contrast, the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine and the extracellular regulated kinase inhibitor U0126 showed no effect. Despite the increase of gp130, TNF caused a significant reduction in the cell binding and endocytosis of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), another proinflammatory cytokine that binds to the gp130 co-receptor and its unique gp190 receptor. This is consistent with our previous findings that TNF reduces gp190 expression and Stat3 activation. Thus, TNF stimulation results in decreased responsiveness of RBE4 cells to LIF, indicating complex regulatory interactions of cytokines at the BBB.","['Pennington Biomedical Research Center, Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70808, USA.']","['NS46528/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'DK54880/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS046528/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 NS045751/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS45751/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,"['(c) 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,

In this study, we established a new M-CSF-mediated differentiation-inducing system, and examined how the level and duration of the activation of ERK preceded M-CSF-mediated differentiation. TF-1-fms human leukemia cells rapidly proliferated in response to M-CSF. However, in the presence of a phorbol ester, TPA, TF-1-fms cells definitely switched their responsiveness to M-CSF from proliferation to differentiation, as evidenced by a more drastic morphological change and the appearance of cells with a higher level of phagocytic activity. In TF-1-fms cells expressing HIV-1 Nef protein in a conditionally active-manner, both M-CSF-mediated proliferation and M-CSF/TPA-mediated differentiation were inhibited by the activation of Nef. The Nef-active cells showed perturbed patterns of ERK activation. Under the proliferation-inducing conditions (TPA-free), parental or Nef-inactive cells showed modest ERK activation following M-CSF stimulation, whereas Nef-active cells showed an earlier and transient ERK activation, despite a decrease in their proliferation rate. Under the differentiation-inducing conditions, parental or Nef-inactive cells showed increased and prolonged ERK activation following M-CSF stimulation, whereas Nef-active cells showed transient ERK activation. These results supported the idea that the increased and prolonged ERK activation led to M-CSF-mediated macrophage differentiation but not to proliferation.","['Division of Hematopoiesis, Center for AIDS Research, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, epidemiologic findings on obesity in relation to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma have been inconsistent. We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize the epidemiologic evidence on the association between excess body weight and risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Relevant studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (1966 to February 2007) and the reference lists of retrieved publications. We included cohort and case-control studies that reported relative risk (RR) estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of body mass index (BMI) with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma incidence or mortality. A random-effects model was used to combine results from individual studies. Sixteen studies (10 cohorts and 6 case-control studies), with 21,720 cases, met the inclusion criteria. Compared to individuals of normal weight (BMI < 25.0 kg/m(2)), the summary RRs of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.14) for overweight individuals (BMI between 25 and 30 kg/m(2)) and 1.20 (95% CI, 1.07-1.34) for those who were obese (BMI >/=>/=>/=>/= 30.0 kg/m(2)). Meta-analysis stratified by histologic subtypes showed that obesity was associated with a statistically significant increased risk of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (RR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.18-1.66; n = 6 studies) but not of follicular lymphoma (RR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.82-1.47; n = 6 studies) or small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukemia (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.76-1.20; n = 3 studies). These findings indicate that excess body weight is associated with an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, especially of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.","['Division of Nutritional Epidemiology, The National Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden. susanna.larsson@ki.se']",,,,,40,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 18.,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analyses of published studies examining the association between myeloid leukemias (ML) and occupational pesticide exposure. METHODS: Studies were identified from a MEDLINE search through 31 May 2006 and from the reference lists of identified publications. Studies were summarized and evaluated for publication bias. Relative risk estimates for ML were extracted from 17 cohort and 16 case-control studies published between 1979 and 2005. Fixed- or random-effect meta-analysis models were used depending on the presence of heterogeneity between studies. Separate analyses were conducted after stratification for study design, occupational group, ML subtype or gender. RESULTS: The overall meta-rate ratio estimate (meta-RR) for the cohort studies was 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.99-1.48). Substantial heterogeneity existed among cohort studies (p=1.064 x 10(-5)), mainly reflecting the varying occupational categories examined. The meta-RR was 6.32 (95% CI: 1.90-21.01) for manufacturing workers and 2.14 (95% CI: 1.39-3.31) for pesticide applicators. After stratification of cohort studies by specific ML subtype, an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was found (meta-RR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.02-2.34). No significant heterogeneity was detected among case-control studies and an increased risk of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was found among men (meta-RR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.03-1.88) and farmers or agricultural workers (meta-RR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.06-1.79). CONCLUSION: The strongest evidence of an increased risk of ML comes from manufacturing workers and pesticide applicators. Further studies will be needed to correlate reliable exposure data within these specific occupational groups with well-defined subtypes of leukemia to refine this assessment.","['Unite de Toxicologie Industrielle et Medecine du travail, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Avenue E.

Epub 2007 Apr 19.,"The production of mature, differentiated myeloid cells is regulated by the action of hematopoietic cytokines on progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Cytokines drive the process of myeloid differentiation by binding to specific cell-surface receptors in a stage- and lineage-specific manner. Following the binding of a cytokine to its cognate receptor, intracellular signal-transduction pathways become activated that facilitate the myeloid differentiation process. These intracellular signaling pathways may promote myelopoiesis by stimulating expansion of a progenitor pool, supporting cellular survival during the differentiation process, or by directly driving the phenotypic changes associated with differentiation. Ultimately, pathways that drive the differentiation process converge on myeloid transcription factors, including PU.1 and the C/EBP family, that are critical for differentiation to proceed. While much is known about the cytokines, cytokine receptors and transcription factors that regulate myeloid differentiation, less is known about the precise roles that specific signaling mediators play in promoting myeloid differentiation. Recently, however, the application of novel pharmacologic inhibitors, siRNA strategies, and transgenic and knockout models has begun to shed light on the involvement and function of signaling pathways in normal myeloid differentiation. This review will discuss the roles that key signaling pathways and mediators play in myeloid differentiation.","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, Pittsburgh, PA 15213, USA. mirandam@upmc.edu']",['R01 CA108904/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,269,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 19.,"Gross cytogenetic anomalies are traditionally being used as diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic markers in the clinical management of cancer, including childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Recently, it has become increasingly clear that genetic lesions driving tumorigenesis frequently occur at the submicroscopic level and, consequently, escape standard cytogenetic observations. Therefore, we profiled the genomes of 40 childhood ALLs at high resolution. We detected multiple de novo genetic lesions, including gross aneuploidies and segmental gains and losses, some of which were subtle and affected single genes. Many of these lesions involved recurrent (partially) overlapping deletions and duplications, containing various established leukemia-associated genes, such as ETV6, RUNX1 and MLL. Importantly, the most frequently affected genes were those controlling G1/S cell cycle progression (e.g. CDKN2A, CDKN1B and RB1), followed by genes associated with B-cell development. The latter group includes microdeletions of the B-lineage transcription factors PAX5, EBF, E2-2 and IKZF1 (Ikaros), as well as genes with other established roles in B-cell development, that is RAG1 and RAG2, FYN, PBEF1 or CBP/PAG. The fact that we frequently encountered multiple lesions affecting genes involved in cell cycle regulation and B-cell differentiation strongly suggests that both these processes need to be targeted independently and simultaneously to trigger ALL development.","['1Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen Centre for Molecular Life Sciences, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 18.,"The authors examined the relation between birth weight, intrauterine growth, and risk of childhood leukemia using population-based linked health data from Western Australia. A cohort of 576,593 infants born in 1980-2004 were followed from birth to diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 243) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n = 36) before their 15th birthday, death, or the end of follow-up (December 31, 2005). Data were analyzed using Cox regression. Risk of ALL was positively associated with the proportion of optimal birth weight--a measure of the appropriateness of fetal growth--particularly among children younger than 5 years; the hazard ratio for a 1-standard-deviation increase in proportion of optimal birth weight was 1.25 (95% confidence interval: 1.07, 1.47). Among children younger than 5 years not classified as having high birth weight (defined as >3,500 g, >3,800 g, and >4,000 g), a 1-unit increase in proportion of optimal birth weight was associated with an approximately 40% increase in ALL risk. This suggests that accelerated growth, rather than high birth weight per se, is involved in the etiology of ALL. These findings are consistent with a role for insulin-like growth factor I in the causal pathway. Findings for AML were inconclusive, probably because of small numbers.","['Telethon Institute for Child Health Research, Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, Western Australia. lizm@ichr.uwa.edu.au']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined clinical and imaging risk factors predicting clinical joint outcomes of femoral head osteonecrosis in pediatric patients with leukemia or lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively medical records and magnetic resonance imaging scans of 80 patients with osteonecrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis. Logistic regression was used to examine relationships between risk factors and outcomes of joint surface collapse and arthroplasty. We used Kaplan-Meier survival curves to display the time to joint surface collapse and arthroplasty based on selected predictors. RESULTS: Median time between primary diagnosis and diagnosis of osteonecrosis of the hip was 1.7 years (range, 0.1 to 17.5 years). Twenty-three patients (29%) underwent arthroplasty in 36 hips at a mean of 1.3 years (range, 0.5 to 8.6 years) after diagnosis of osteonecrosis. Median age at time of first arthroplasty was 20.1 years (range, 15.1 to 35.4 years). Joint outcome of osteonecrosis was predicted solely by lesion size at diagnosis of osteonecrosis. The worst prognosis was associated with lesions occupying more than 30% of the femoral head volume; 80% of hips with these lesions collapsed within 2 years of diagnosis and 50% required arthroplasty. CONCLUSION: Lesion size of osteonecrosis is the best predictor of clinical joint outcome of hip osteonecrosis in survivors of pediatric hematologic malignancy. Lesions occupying more than 30% of the femoral head have high likelihood of joint deterioration necessitating arthroplasty at a young age.","[""Department of Radiological Sciences, Division of Diagnostic Imaging and Biostatistics, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105-2794, USA.""]","['P30-CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA600419/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-seven consecutive patients with childhood ALL were studied prospectively by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lower extremities at the end of the treatment. RESULTS: Twenty-three (24%) of the 97 patients had ON. Seven of the patients (30%) were symptomatic, and three patients (13%) required surgical interventions. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that high body mass index (BMI; P = .04), female sex (P = .01), older age at diagnosis (P < .001), and higher cumulative dexamethasone dose (P = .03) were independent risk factors for radiographic ON. The cumulative prednisone dose did not differ significantly between the patients with and without ON. The incidence of radiographic ON decreased significantly, from 36% to 7%, when the duration of dexamethasone exposure during the delayed-intensification phase was shortened from 3 to 4 weeks to 2 weeks with a taper (P = .001). CONCLUSION: ON as determined by MRI was found to be a common complication in children and adolescents after treatment with the Nordic ALL protocols. Revision of the ALL protocols by shortening the single exposure to dexamethasone has diminished the risk for ON remarkably. High BMI was identified as a new significant risk factor for ON.","['Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland. rsalonen@paju.oulu.fi']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously identified the immune-suppressive molecule CD200 as up-regulated on primary B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells and demonstrated negative immune regulation by B-CLL and other tumor cells overexpressing CD200 in vitro. In this study we developed a novel animal model that incorporates human immune cells and human tumor cells to address the effects of CD200 overexpression on tumor cells in vivo and to assess the effect of targeting Abs in the presence of human immune cells. Although human mononuclear cells prevented tumor growth when tumor cells did not express CD200, tumor-expressed CD200 inhibited the ability of lymphocytes to eradicate tumor cells. Anti-CD200 Ab administration to mice bearing CD200-expressing tumors resulted in nearly complete tumor growth inhibition even in the context of established receptor-ligand interactions. Evaluation of an anti-CD200 Ab with abrogated effector function provided evidence that blocking of the receptor-ligand interaction was sufficient for control of CD200-mediated immune modulation and tumor growth inhibition in this model. Our data indicate that CD200 expression by tumor cells suppresses antitumor responses and suggest that anti-CD200 treatment might be therapeutically beneficial for treating CD200-expressing cancers.","['Alexion Antibody Technologies, San Diego, CA 92121, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 18.,"Human T cell leukemia virus type 1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) is characterized by the generation of an intense CTL cell response directed against the viral transactivator protein Tax. In addition, patients diagnosed with HAM/TSP exhibit rapid activation and maturation of dendritic cells (DC), likely contributing to the robust, Tax-specific CTL response. In this study, extracellular Tax has been shown to induce maturation and functional alterations in human monocyte-derived DC, critical observations being confirmed in freshly isolated myeloid DC. Tax was shown to promote the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines involved in the DC activation process in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, Tax induced the expression of DC activation (CD40, CD80, and CD86) and maturation (CD83) markers and enhanced the T cell proliferation capability of DC. Heat inactivation of Tax resulted in abrogation of these effects, indicating a requirement for the native structure of Tax, which was found to bind efficiently to the DC membrane and was internalized within a few hours, suggesting that extracellular Tax may possess an intracellular mechanism of action subsequent to entry. Finally, inhibitors of cellular signaling pathways, NF-kappaB, protein kinase, tyrosine kinase, and phospholipase C, were shown to inhibit Tax-mediated DC activation. This is the first study reporting the immunomodulatory effects of extracellular Tax in the DC compartment. These results suggest that DC, once exposed to Tax by uptake from the extracellular environment, can undergo activation, providing constant antigen presentation and costimulation to T cells, leading to the intense T cell proliferation and inflammatory responses underlying HAM/TSP.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Drexel University College of Medicine, 2900 Queen Lane, Philadelphia, PA 19129, USA.']","['R01 DA019808-03/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA054559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA015014-04/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA15014/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA015014/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA015014-05/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA019808/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'DA19808/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DA019808-04/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2712352,,,,,['NIHMS105300'],,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 18.,"Ligand-mediated activation of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) receptor is important for normal proliferation of primitive hematopoietic cells. FLT3 expression in the bone marrow is restricted to CD34(+) cells and a subset of dendritic precursors. FLT3, as a member of the type III RTK subfamily, is closely related to c-kit, c-FMS, and PDGFalpha/beta and is an unspecific target of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib. Activating mutations of FLT3 play an important role in leukemogenesis and their presence is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Targeting the mutation by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of FLT3 is a promising therapeutic option in the treatment of AML patients. CEP-701 (Lestaurtinib), an indocarbazole derivate, is an FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In this study, we investigated the effect of FLT3 kinase inhibition on normal hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in vitro. FLT3 inhibition in normal CD34(+) cells resulted in a dose-dependent inhibitory effect in cell expansion. In contrast, progenitor cell function remained nearly unaffected. Blocking the FLT3 ligand by a neutralizing antibody partially restored the effects of FLT3 inhibition. These findings might explain hematotoxicity of tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib.","['University of Tubingen, Medical Center, Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, Otfried-Muller-Strasse 10, 72076 Tubingen, Germany. katja.weisel@med.uni-tuebingen.de']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 18.,"Nucleoporin 98 (NUP98) is a component of the nuclear pore complex that facilitates mRNA export from the nucleus. It is mapped to 11p15.5 and is fused to a number of distinct partners, including nine members of the homeobox family as a consequence of leukemia-associated chromosomal translocations. NUP98-HOXA9 is associated with the t(7;11)(p15;p15) translocation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome, and blastic crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia. Expression of NUP98-HOXA9 in murine bone marrow resulted in a myeloproliferative disease progressing to AML by 7-8 months. Transduction of NUP98 fusion genes into human CD34(+) cells confers a proliferative advantage in long-term cytokine-stimulated and stromal cocultures and in NOD-SCID engrafted mice, associated with a five- to eight-fold increase in hematopoietic stem cells. NUP98-HOXA9 expression inhibited erythroid and myeloid differentiation but enhanced serial progenitor replating. NUP98-HOXA9 upregulated a number of homeobox genes of the A and B cluster as well as MEIS1 and Pim-1, and downmodulated globin genes and C/EBPalpha. The HOXA9 component of the NUP98-HOXA9 fusion protein was protected from cullin-4A-mediated ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-dependent degradation. In NUP98-HOX-transduced CD34(+) cells and cells from AML patients with t(7;11)(p15;p15) NUP98 was no longer associated with the nuclear pore complex but formed intranuclear aggregation bodies. Analysis of NUP98 allelic expression in AML and myelodysplastic syndrome showed loss of heterozygosity observed in 29% of the former and 8% of the latter. This was associated with poor prognosis.","['Moore Laboratory, Cell Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. m-moore@ski.mskcc.org']","['CA 92792/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA118085/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,103,,,,,,,,,,

However, the application of such vectors is at a comparatively early stage and the effects which virus strain, transgene cassette position, and target cell can exert on vector spread kinetics, genomic stability, and transgene expression levels remain to be fully elucidated. Thus, in this study a panel of vectors allowing the investigation of different design features on an otherwise genetically identical background were analyzed with respect to these readout parameters in cultures of both murine and human cells and in preformed tumors in nude mice. The obtained data revealed that (i) Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MLV)-based vectors spread with faster kinetics, drive higher levels of transgene expression, and are more stable than equivalent Akv-MLV-based vectors; (ii) vectors containing the transgene cassette directly downstream of the envelope gene are genomically more stable than those containing it within the 3'-long terminal repeat U3 region; and (iii) the genomic stability of both strains seems to be cell line dependent.","['Research Institute for Virology and Biomedicine, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.']",,,,PMC1933297,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Only four studies were found that have examined the effects of stimulant medication on the cognitive toxicities of childhood survivors of cancer during the late-effects period and only two of these investigations were controlled clinical trials. Findings suggest efficacy of the stimulants on parent and teacher ratings of attention and putative tasks of attention and executive functioning.

Traditionally these high-risk patients were treated as inpatients. Our center recently implemented a selective ambulatory management policy for AML patients undergoing chemotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted to assess the occurrence of septicemia in AML patients treated over a 5 years period with curative intent chemotherapy. This review encompasses a change in policy from primarily inpatient care to selective outpatient management coupled with prophylactic antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: A total of 294 patients, receiving 623 cycles of chemotherapy were identified. A significant decrease in septicemia was observed from the inpatient to outpatient cohort (22% to 13% P < 0.05), which correlated with the shift towards outpatient treatment of consolidation cycles. A shift from Gram-negative to Gram-positive organisms as the cause of septicemia was also detected in the outpatient cohort, likely due to the introduction of ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. No significant emerging resistance and no septicemia-related mortality were noted in the outpatient cohort. CONCLUSION: The observed decrease in the incidence of septicemia in the ambulatory cohort adds supportive evidence to the feasibility of selective outpatient management of AML patients with respect to infectious complications.","['Department of Immunology and Microbiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FOXO1A expression was assessed by conventional and quantitative RT-PCR, Northern and Western blotting. RESULTS: Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) data indicated that after normalization to ACTB mRNA levels, canonical FOXO1A mRNA expression in the PER-453 cell line was 124-fold higher than the average level of five other CNS-PNET cell lines tested, 24-fold higher than the level in whole fetal brain, and 3.5-fold higher than the level in fetal brain germinal matrix cells. No mutations within the FOXO1A open reading frame or gross rearrangements of the FOXO1A locus were detected. However, a single nucleotide change within the proximal promoter and several nucleotide changes within the 3'-UTR were identified. In addition, two novel FOXO1A transcripts were isolated that differ from the canonical transcript by alternative splicing within the 3'-UTR. CONCLUSION: The CNS-PNET cell line, PER-453, expresses FOXO1A at very high levels relative to most normal and cancer cells from a broad range of tissues. The FOXO1A open reading frame is wild type in the PER-453 cell line and the abnormally high FOXO1A mRNA expression is not due to mutations affecting the 5'-UTR or proximal promoter. Over expression of FOXO1A may be the result of PER-453 specific epimutations or imbalances in regulatory factors acting at the promoter and/or 3'-UTR.","[""Division of Children's Leukemia and Cancer Research, Telethon Institute for Child Health Research and Centre for Child Health Research, University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia. peterd@ichr.uwa.edu.au""]",,,,PMC1878494,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 17.,"Opalin is a transmembrane protein detected specifically in mammalian oligodendrocytes. Opalin homologs are found only in mammals and not in the genome sequences of other animal classes. We first determined the nucleotide sequences of Opalin orthologs and their flanking regions derived from four prosimians, a group of primitive primates. A global comparison revealed that an evolutionarily conserved region exists in the first intron of Opalin. When the conserved domain was assayed for its enhancer activity in transgenic mice, oligodendrocyte-directed expression was observed. In an oligodendroglial cell line, Oli-neu, the conserved domain showed oligodendrocyte-directed expression. The conserved domain is composed of eight subdomains, some of which contain binding sites for Myt1 and cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). Deletion analysis and cotransfection experiments revealed that the subdomains have critical roles in Opalin gene expression. Over-expression of Myt1, treatment of the cell with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and cAMP analog (CREB activator) enhanced the expression of endogenous Opalin in Oli-neu cells and activated the oligodendrocyte enhancer. These results suggest that LIF, cAMP signaling cascades and Myt1 play significant roles in the differentiation of oligodendrocytes through their action on the Opalin oligodendrocyte enhancer.","['Laboratory for Comparative Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanLaboratory for Molecular Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanSequence Technology Team, RIKEN Genomic Science Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Comparative Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanLaboratory for Molecular Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanSequence Technology Team, RIKEN Genomic Science Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Comparative Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanLaboratory for Molecular Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanSequence Technology Team, RIKEN Genomic Science Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Comparative Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanLaboratory for Molecular Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanSequence Technology Team, RIKEN Genomic Science Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Comparative Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanLaboratory for Molecular Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanSequence Technology Team, RIKEN Genomic Science Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Laboratory for Comparative Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanLaboratory for Molecular Neurogenesis, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako-shi, Saitama, JapanSequence Technology Team, RIKEN Genomic Science Center, Yokohama, Japan.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/j.1471-4159.2007.04583.x [doi],,

Epub 2007 Apr 19.,"Leukemia is the most common cancer affecting children. A steroid possessing a methylpiperazine nucleus was recently reported to inhibit the proliferation of HL-60 leukemia cells. To speed up the development of this promising potential new drug, we generated libraries of analogues using parallel solid-phase organic synthesis (SPOS). A 6-step sequence of reactions, starting from dihydrotestosterone, afforded a steroidal 2,3alpha-epoxide, which was selectively opened to give, after N-Fmoc protection, a diol with suitable stereochemistry. The difference of reactivity between 3alpha-OH and 17beta-OH was then used to allow the regioselective coupling of 17beta-OH to chloro-activated butyldiethylsilane polystyrene. We next generated three libraries of 2beta-piperazinyl-5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol N-derivatives with 1, 2, or 3 levels of molecular diversity in acceptable yields and purities for our biological screening assay. Several members of these libraries were more potent than the lead compound, especially five members with a proline as the first level of diversity and a cyclohexylcarbonyl, methylbutyryl, cyclohexylacetyl, cyclopentylpropionyl, or hexanoyl as the second level of diversity. They efficiently inhibited HL-60 cell proliferation with IC50 values of 0.58, 0.66, 1.78, 1.98, and 2.57 microM, respectively. The present work demonstrates the potential of our SPOS approach for the optimization of a new class of cytotoxic agents.","['Medicinal Chemistry Division, Oncology and Molecular Endocrinology Research Center, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec (CHUQ) and Universite Laval, Quebec G1V 4G2, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 19.,"Development of multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer frequently involves overexpression of the MDR1 gene product P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a drug transporter which severely impedes the efficacy of chemotherapy. Because intensive efforts to identify therapeutics that reverse MDR by inhibiting the drug transport activity of P-gp have not yet met with success, we have focused on the alternative strategy of targeting MDR1 promoter activation to knockdown P-gp expression in cancer cells. We recently identified RNA helicase A (RHA) inhibition as a rational strategy to downregulate P-gp in leukemia cells by showing that RHA RNAi knockdown abrogated P-gp expression in MDR variants of human leukemia HL-60 cells. In that report, we also demonstrated that RHA activated the MDR1 promoter in the MDR variant cells but not in the drug-sensitive counterpart. This led us to hypothesize that P-gp induction by RHA required cooperation with another factor present only in the MDR variants. Here, we identify the RHA cooperating factor as DNA-PK catalytic subunit (cs), and we show that DNA-PKcs resides with RHA at the MDR1 promoter in a multiprotein complex. Furthermore, targeted DNA-PKcs inhibition abrogated P-gp expression in the MDR variant cells. We demonstrate that constitutive multisite RHA phosphorylation producing retarded migration in SDS-PAGE is catalyzed by DNA-PKcs in the MDR variants, and does not occur in the parental cells, which are DNA-PKcs deficient. The indispensable role played by DNA-PK in P-gp overexpression in MDR leukemia cells in this report identifies targeted DNA-PK inhibition as a rational strategy to reverse drug resistance in cancer.","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology and Indiana University Cancer Center, 1044 West Walnut Street, Indianapolis, Indiana 46202, USA.']","['CA080734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA101743/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA90878/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients had clinical features of fever, abdominal pain, and elevations of C-reactive protein. However, the typical peritoneal signs were blunted and developed transiently in two cases. All patients were diagnosed as having appendicitis with abdominal computed tomography scan (CT), and proceeded to appendectomy. With perioperative support utilizing antibiotics, antifungal agents, blood components, and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, surgical intervention was successfully performed, and all patients were able to undergo chemotherapy courses shortly after surgery. Histological examinations of the appendectomy specimens showed infiltration of most of the lymphoid cells and a few neutrophils in the wall of the appendix. Enhanced CT was useful in diagnosing appendicitis, which needs to be considered in cases presenting with clinical symptoms such as described here. Because of a high mortality rate after appendix perforation, immediate surgical intervention with sufficient perioperative support should be performed.","['Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University Hospital.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients with CML now receive imatinib, which produces complete cytogenetic response in more than 80% of patients. About 10% of patients who initially respond to imatinib subsequently develop resistance. Mechanisms of imatinib resistance in CML include amplification, mutations, and additional chromosomal aberration. To date, more than 30 mutations have been identified in imatinib-resistant CML. Dasatinib and AMN107, second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors, are highly effective therapies for patients with CML experiencing imatinib resistance and mutation and offer new options for patients who do not achieve an optimal response to imatinib therapy. Studies found that dasatinib and AMN107 form tighter bonds, overcoming imatinib resistance and producing complete hematologic and cytogenetic remissions. Long-term observations are needed to determine the effectiveness of the treatment. Primary care providers need to follow patients receiving first- or second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors because unforeseen toxicity may surface, requiring accurate assessment, evaluation, and management.

METHODS: HL-60 cells were cultured with calcium ionophore A23187 (45-720 ng/mL) or plus rhIFN-gamma (1000 U/mL) for 20-96 hours. The morphologic features of cells were observed under inverted microscope and scanning electron microscope, when the cell phenotypes of HL-60 treated with A23187 were determined by flow cytometry. The proliferation of allogeneic human T cells was tested by mixed lymphocyte reaction (Allo-MLR). RESULTS: After treated with A23187 (180 ng/mL) or plus rhIFN-gamma (1000 U/mL) for 20 hours, some of HL-60 cells were found to have the dendritic appearance on cell surface; and the CD83 as a characteristic marker of mature DCs, co-stimulating molecules CD80 and CD86 got an up-regulated expression. When HL-60 cells were cultured with A23187 for 48 hours, the expression of CD83 began going down. A large number of cells with typical dendritic appearance were observed after cultured with A23187 for 72 hours, and the expressions of CD80 and CD86 were up-regulated continuously. Allo-MLR revealed that DCs derived from HL-60 cells treated with A23187 or plus rhIFN-gamma could stimulate the proliferation of allogeneic human T cells. CONCLUSION: The calcium ionophore A23187 can induce the HL-60 cells into mature DCs. This study suggests that calcium mobilization for cell differentiation may be an alternative way to rapidly acquire DCs.","['Department of Pediatrics, West China Second Hospital, Sichuang University, Chengdu 610041, China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their cytotoxic activity was further studied herein using a well-characterized human tumour cell-line panel containing ten cell lines, as well as in 58 primary tumour cell samples from a variety of diagnoses. The indole-pyran analogues of SDX-101 were in general considerably more active in both cancer cell lines and primary tumour samples. Low cross-reactivity with standard agents was observed, indicating a unique mechanism of action. No apparent influence on efficacy was observed via classical mechanisms of multidrug-resistance. SDX-101 and SDX-309 showed higher relative activity in haematological compared to solid tumour samples, while SDX-308 had pronounced solid-tumour activity. High SDX-308 cytotoxic efficacy was observed in non-small cell lung cancer, renal cancer and ovarian cancer samples, and also in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In conclusion, the indole-pyran analogues showed a favourable pharmacological profile and represent a potentially important new class of drugs for cancer treatment.","['Uppsala University Hospital, 751 85 Uppsala, Sweden.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We analyzed the distribution of vector integrants in pigtailed macaque and baboon repopulating cells for the two most commonly used retroviral vector systems, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based lentiviral vectors and murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based gammaretroviral vectors, to help define their relative genotoxicity. All animals had polyclonal engraftment with no apparent adverse effects from transplantation with gene-modified cells. In all, 380 MLV and 235 HIV unique vector integration sites were analyzed and had distinct distribution patterns in relation to genes and CpG islands as observed in previous in vitro studies. Both vector types were found more frequently in and near proto-oncogenes in repopulating cells than in a random dataset. Analysis of functional classes of genes with integrants within 100 kilobases (kb) of their transcription start sites showed an over-representation of genes involved in growth or survival near both lentiviral and gammaretroviral integrants. Microarray analysis showed that both gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors were found close to genes with high expression levels in primitive cells enriched for hematopoietic stem cells. These data help define the relative risk of insertional mutagenesis with MLV-, HIV-, and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-based vectors in a highly relevant primate model.","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, USA.']","['HL66947/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 AI27757/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI061839/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI63959/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK071657/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL53750/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56456/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular mechanisms underlying the development of disease are largely undefined. Human CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells were used to investigate the role of FIP1L1-PDGFRA in modulating lineage development. FIP1L1-PDGFRA induced both proliferation and differentiation of eosinophils, neutrophils, and erythrocytes in the absence of cytokines, which could be inhibited by imatinib. Whereas expression of FIP1L1-PDGFRA in hematopoietic stem cells and common myeloid progenitors induced the formation of multiple myeloid lineages, expression in granulocyte-macrophage progenitors induced only the development of eosinophils, neutrophils, and myeloblasts. Deletion of amino acids 30 to 233 in the FIP1L1 gene [FIP1L1(1-29)-PDGFRA] gave rise to an intermediate phenotype, exhibiting a dramatic reduction in the number of erythrocytes. FIP1L1-PDGFRA and FIP1L1(1-29)-PDGFRA both induced the activation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in myeloid progenitors, whereas signal transducers and activators of transcription 5 (STAT5) and protein kinase B/c-akt were only activated by FIP1L1-PDGFRA. Dominant-negative STAT5 partially inhibited FIP1L1-PDGFRA-induced colony formation, whereas combined inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase and ERK1/2 significantly reversed FIP1L1-PDGFRA-induced colony formation.

Epub 2007 Apr 17.,"CD37 is a lineage-specific B-cell antigen that to date has been neglected as an attractive therapeutic target. To exploit this, novel CD37-specific small modular immunopharmaceuticals (CD37-SMIP) that include variable regions linked to modified human IgG(1) hinge, CH(2), and CH(3) domains were designed. The lead CD37-SMIP molecule induces potent apoptosis in the presence of a cross-linker, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against B-cell leukemia/lymphoma cell lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells superior to therapeutic antibodies used in these diseases. The CD37-SMIP-dependent ADCC function in vitro was mediated by natural killer (NK) cells but not naive or activated monocytes. Significant in vivo therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in a SCID mouse xenograft leukemia/lymphoma model. Depletion of NK cells in this mouse model resulted in diminished efficacy further supported the in vivo importance of NK cells in SMIP therapy. These findings provide strong justification for CD37 as a therapeutic target and introduce small modular immunopharmaceuticals as a novel class of targeted therapies for B-cell malignancies.","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA.']","['P01 CA095426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA95426/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1988922,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 17.,"Frameshift mutations in exon 12 of the nucleophosmin gene (NPM1) result in aberrant cytoplasmic localization of the NPM protein (NPMc(+)) and occur in 25% to 35% of adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In adults with AML, NPMc(+) has been associated with normal karyotype, FLT3/ITD mutations, high remission induction rates, and improved survival (particularly in patients lacking FLT3/ITD). NPMc(+) has not been well characterized in childhood AML. This study examines the incidence and clinical significance of NPMc(+) in 295 children with newly diagnosed AML treated on a large cooperative group clinical trial (POG-9421). We find that NPMc(+) is relatively uncommon in childhood AML (23 of 295 patients, 8%); and is significantly associated with FLT3/ITD mutations (P = .046), female sex (P = .029), older age (P = .047), and normal cytogenetics (P < .001). There is a favorable impact of NPMc(+) on survival in children lacking FLT3/ITD (5-year EFS, 69% vs 35%; hazard ratio, 0.39; P = .051), which is similar in magnitude to the favorable impact of t(8;21) and inv(16). We conclude that NPMc(+) is relatively rare in childhood AML, particularly in younger children. NPMc(+) does not abrogate the negative prognostic influence of FLT3/ITD mutations, but may contribute to risk stratification in children who lack FLT3/ITD mutations by identifying a group with superior prognosis.","['Department of Oncology, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, Baltimore, MD, USA. pbrown2@jhmi.edu']","['K23 CA111728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K23 CA 111728/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1924773,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 16.,"Approximately 17% of the human genome is comprised of long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1, L1) non-LTR retrotransposons. L1 retrotransposition is known to be the cause of several genetic diseases, such as hemophilia A, Duchene muscular dystrophy, and so on. The L1 retroelements are also able to cause colon cancer, suggesting that L1 transposition could occur not only in germ cells, but also in somatic cells if innate immunity would not function appropriately. The mechanisms of L1 transposition restriction in the normal cells, however, are not fully defined. We here show that antiretroviral innate proteins, human APOBEC3 (hA3) family members, from hA3A to hA3H, differentially reduce the level of L1 retrotransposition that does not correlate either with antiviral activity against Vif-deficient HIV-1 and murine leukemia virus, or with patterns of subcellular localization. Importantly, hA3G protein inhibits L1 retrotransposition, in striking contrast to the recent reports. Inhibitory effect of hA3 family members on L1 transposition might not be due to deaminase activity, but due to novel mechanism(s). Thus, we conclude that all hA3 proteins act to differentially suppress uncontrolled transposition of L1 elements.","['Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Tokyo 162-8640, Japan.']",,,,PMC1888823,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: In 62% of cases, non-mutated IgH gene was found, the heavy chain family usage was different in mutated and non-mutated cases. The CD38 expression demonstrated 78% concordance with the mutation status, the ZAP-70 expression failed to show any correlation. Cytogenetic abnormalities were seen in 76% of cases, the most frequent were del(13q) (57%), trisomy 12 (15%), del(11q) (12%) and del(17p) (6%). 95% of cases with del(11q) harbored non-mutated, 74% of cases with del(13q) as the sole anomaly demonstrated mutated IgH genes.

Patients were included in the study if the diagnosis of aspergillosis was confirmed by either biopsy, autopsy, aspergillus antigen determination and/or neuroradiological and clinical response to specific treatment. Four patients had single or multiple abscesses presenting as ring-enhancing lesions on T1-weighted images, hypointensity of the ring on T2-weighted MR images and low to high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging. Four patients had single or multiple infarctions affecting all compartments of the brain with hyperintensities on T2-weighted images in three of four patients, irregular parenchymal contrast enhancement in all patients and hemorrhagic transformation of the infarcted parenchyma in one patient. Diffusion-weighted images were positive in all ischemic areas. One patient with paranasal sinusitis developed a mycotic aneurysm of the internal carotid artery.

The successful identification of a range of leukaemia specific antigens (LSA) in recent years has stimulated efforts to induce leukaemia specific T cell responses to these antigens with peptide vaccines. An ideal LSA should be restricted in its expression to leukaemia including progenitor cells, intrinsically connected with the leukaemic phenotype, and capable of inducing strong cytotoxic T cell responses to the leukaemia. Peptides from three well-characterized LSA, the breakpoint cluster region-abelson (BCR-ABL) fusion protein of chronic myelogenous leukaemia, proteinase-3 and Wilms tumour 1 protein, serve as the basis for several clinical trials using peptide and adjuvants to treat patients with a variety of myeloid malignancies. Preliminary results from these studies indicate that these peptides induce immune responses which can translate into clinical responses which include complete remissions from leukaemia. These promising early results point the way to optimizing the administration of peptide vaccines and suggest ways of combining vaccination with allogeneic stem cell transplantation to boost GVL effects.","['Stem Cell Allotransplantation Section, Hematology Branch, National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-1202, USA. barrettj@nhlbi.nih.gov']",,,,PMC1868869,113,,,,,,,,,,

HLA class-I (A,B) and class-II (DRB1, DQB1) allele and haplotype frequencies in 56 ATL patients, 59 HAM/TSP patients and 190 population-based, asymptomatic HTLV-I-infected carriers were compared by logistic regression overall (score test) and with odds ratios (ORs) for common types (prevalence >50% of asymptomatic carriers) and by prevalence quartile. HTLV-I proviral load between asymptomatic carriers with common versus uncommon types was compared by t-test. ATL differed from asymptomatic carriers in overall DQB1 allele and class-I haplotype frequencies (p </=</= 0.04). ATL risk was increased significantly with common HLA-B (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.19-4.25) and DRB1 (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.13-3.40) alleles.

Asymptomatic carriers with common HLA-B alleles had marginally higher HTLV-I proviral load (p = 0.057). HAM/TSP risk did not differ consistently with common HLA types. Thus, ATL risk, but not HAM/TSP risk, was increased with higher prevalence HLA-B alleles.

The possible effects of two different zeolites on the morphology and viability of chronic myelogeneous leukemia and swiss albino fibroblast culture cells were also investigated. It was determined that when different types of zeolites were kept in the SBF for up to 14 days, their crystal structures were not affected. Observable amounts of Si were detected in the SBF samples after their treatment with all the zeolites investigated. Another variation in the chemical composition of SBF, worth to mention, was the increase of about 10% in its K content after the treatment carried out by using clinoptilolite. The zeolites KA and silicalite, which allowed the lowest and highest amount of silicon transfer into the SBF, respectively, were observed not to have any significant biological effect on the two different cell generations investigated under the conditions used in this study.","['Department of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, Special Cevre Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been suggested that the alkylating action is responsible for the therapeutic effects of nitrosoureas, and that the carbamoylation activity leads to toxicity effects. In order to reduce systemic toxicity and improve specificity and distribution for cancer therapy, 2-haloethyl nitrosourea has been esterified with modified steroids, which are used as biological platforms for transporting the alkylating agent to the tumor site in a specific manner. The cytogenetic and antineoplastic effect were studied of seven newly synthesized esters of N,N-bis(2-chloroethyl)alanyl carboxyl derivatives with a modified steroidal nucleus (compounds 1-7). As a very sensitive indicator of genotoxicity the Sister Chromatid Exchange (SCE) assay was used and as a valuable marker of cytostatic activity the cell Proliferation Rate Index (PRI) in cultures of normal human lymphocytes was used.

Previous studies have shown that SFN is effective in preventing carcinogenesis induced by carcinogens in rodents. Recently it was found that SFN could also inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in several tumor cell lines. In the present study, the possible cell-cycle specificity of SFN-mediated apoptosis was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cells were synchronized by thymidine block. Analysis of the cell-cycle and apoptosis induction was performed using flow cytometry. RESULTS: Flow cytometric assessment of the extent of apoptosis in cells synchronized by thymidine block revealed that cells were most sensitive to SFN in the G -phase, less sensitive in the G2/M-phase and least sensitive during the S-phase. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that cell vulnerability to SFN-mediated apoptosis is subject to regulation by cell-cycle-dependent mechanisms.","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Bologna, Via Irnerio 48, 40126 Bologna, Italy. carmela.fimognari@unibo.it']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gleevec represents a new direction in the development of target-focused chemotherapeutic agents in cancer. Gleevec inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr-Abl, which is responsible for leukemic cell survival. We have previously shown that PBT-3 (racemic anti-10(R/S)-hydroxy-11, 12-cyclopropyl-eicosa-5Z, 8Z, 14Z-trienoic acid methyl ester) and PBT-4 (racemic syn- 10(R/S)-hydroxy- 11,12-cyclopropyleicosa-5Z 8Z, 14Z-trienoic acid methyl ester), stable analogs of the hepoxilins, caused apoptosis of the human leukemic K562 cell line in vitro and in vivo. We also showed that PBTs inhibited the growth of tumours derived from the inoculation of immunodeficient mice with K562 cells and that the effect of PBTs was synergistic with that of Gleevec. We now show that the effect of PBT-3 and of PBT-4 is independent of that of Gleevec, demonstrating that Gleevec-resistant K562 cells retain their responsiveness to PBT treatment, resulting in apoptosis. These findings provide important information suggesting that the two compounds, PBT and Gleevec, can be used together in the treatment of leukemia. The PBTs may provide a new platform for the development of apoptotic drugs in cancer.","['Programme in Physiology and Experimental Medicine, Research Institute, The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specific drugs and conditions can trigger the apoptotic response via one of the three known pathways. What is less clear is how these three pathways can interact synergistically or antagonistically to influence a common convergence step leading to the programmed cell death. In this report we present data to show that fenretinide (a synthetic retinoid) potentiates the apoptotic effects of parthenolide (a drug that inhibits the activation of NF-kappa B) and BAY 11-7085 (an inhibitor of I-kappa B-alpha kinase). This potentiation of apoptosis by fenretinide is seen in the p53-deficient, deoxyadenosine-resistant L1210 cells, but not in the parental L1210 cells that express a mutant p53. These effects are seen at a concentration of fenretinide that have little effect by itself. These data strongly suggest that fenretinide activates or inhibits some step or pathway that interacts with the inhibition of NF-kappa B activation required for the apoptotic response. Since parthenolide, BAY 11-7085 and fenretinide are well known drugs in clinical trials, an understanding of the nature of the interactions between or among the apoptotic pathways could lead to the design of better clinical protocols using these drugs that will promote apoptosis in tumor cells.","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, Greenville, NC 27834, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The overlap with Stuve-Wiedemann syndrome (SWS) is striking, but the two conditions differ in that congenital lower limb bowing is absent in Crisponi syndrome, whereas it is a cardinal feature of SWS. We report here the exclusion of the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor gene in Crisponi syndrome and the identification of homozygote or compound heterozygote cytokine receptor-like factor 1 (CRLF1) mutations in four children from three unrelated families. The four mutations were located in the immunoglobulin-like and type III fibronectin domains, and three of them predicted premature termination of translation. Using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, we found a significant decrease in CRLF1 mRNA expression in patient fibroblasts, which is suggestive of a mutation-mediated decay of the abnormal transcript. CRLF1 forms a heterodimer complex with cardiotrophin-like cytokine factor 1, and this heterodimer competes with ciliary neurotrophic factor for binding to the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor (CNTFR) complex. The identification of CRLF1 mutations in Crisponi syndrome supports the key role of the CNTFR pathway in the function of the autonomic nervous system.","['Department of Genetics and INSERM U781, Universite Paris-Descartes, Paris, France.']",,,,PMC1852726,,,,,,,"['OMIM/601378', 'RefSeq/NM_002310', 'RefSeq/NM_004750', 'RefSeq/NM_013246', 'RefSeq/NP_002301', 'RefSeq/NP_004741', 'RefSeq/NP_037378', 'RefSeq/NP_671693', 'RefSeq/NP_786943']",,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 14.,"Silymarin is a polyphenolic flavonoid that has a strong antioxidant activity and exhibits anti-carcinogenic, anti-inflammatory, and cytoprotective effects. Although its hepatoprotective effect has been well documented, the effect of silymarin on T cells is largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of the silymarin on the proliferation and cell cycle progression of Jurkat cells, a human peripheral blood leukemia T cell line. Cells were incubated with various concentrations of silymarin for 24-72 h and examined for cell growth and proliferation using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) and DNA 5-bromo 2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) colorimetric assays. Cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry was also performed using propidium iodide staining. Results of the study revealed that silymarin increased proliferation of Jurkat cells at 50-400 microM concentrations with 24 h exposure, confirmed by both MTT and BrdU assays. However, Jurkat incubation with silymarin at higher concentrations of 400 microM for 48 h and 200-400 microM for 72 h caused inhibition of DNA synthesis, cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and significant cell death. Results of the present study also revealed a similarity of cell growth patterns between Jurkat, U937 and RPMI 8866 cells. In conclusion, this study demonstrated an in vitro growth stimulatory effect of silymarin on leukemia cells with monocyte, T and B cell origin that has not been previously reported for either solid tumors or other leukemia cells, suggesting a possible specific stimulatory effect of silymarin on the key cells of the immune system.","['Department of Immunology, Medical School, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, 71345-1798 Shiraz, Iran.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was to investigate the growth arrest of K562 cells and its molecular mechanisms, which the drugs induced by TCS and the possible functional interaction of TCS with imatinib (STI571) to K562 cells. METHODS: Trypan blue exclusive staining was used to access the cell growth inhibition; western blot was used to evaluate the p210(Bcr-Abl), phosphorylated tyrosine kinase (PTK), and some signaling molecules involving in cell proliferation and apoptosis in K562 cells. RESULTS: TCS and imatinib inhibited K562 cells at a time- and dose-dependent manners, respectively; TCS down-regulated p210(Bcr-Abl) at a time- and dose-dependent manners; TCS synergistically enhanced imatinib-induced K562 cell growth arrest and down-regulation of p210(Bcr-Abl), PTK activities, procaspase-3, Hsp90,NF-kappaB and PKC.

We evaluated the clinical spectrum of pneumococcal disease and vaccine-breakthrough infections in HSCT recipients at our cancer center in a retrospective analysis of all consecutive episodes of S. pneumoniae infection from 1989 through 2005. During the study period, 7888 patients underwent HSCT at our center; we identified 47 HSCT recipients with 54 S. pneumoniae infections. The overall incidence of S. pneumoniae infection was 7 per 1000 HSCTs. The incidence was higher in recipients of allogeneic grafts than in recipients of autologous grafts (9 vs. 5 per 1000 HSCTs, respectively; p <or= 0.012). Thirty-two of the 47 patients (68%) had leukemia or lymphoma; 24 patients (51%) had a malignancy that was in complete remission. Seventeen patients (36%) had graft-versus-host disease, which was chronic in 16. The 54 episodes of S. pneumoniae infection occurred 433 +/- 669 days after HSCT; 5 patients (11%) had multiple episodes. Four episodes of S. pneumoniae infection occurred within 100 days following transplantation (45 +/- 49 d); 2 of these were during the pre-engraftment period and 3 were nosocomial infections. All 50 late post-transplant episodes (93%), which occurred 473 +/- 671 days following transplantation, were community-acquired infections (p < 0.00016). Thirty-three episodes (61%) presented as bacteremic pneumonia, 10 (19%) as pneumonia, and 8 (15%) as uncomplicated S. pneumoniae bacteremia alone. Logistic regression analysis showed that patients receiving systemic corticosteroids had increased risk for bacteremic pneumonia (odds ratio [OR], 11.7; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.371-99.280; p <or= 0.025). Patients with lymphoma (OR, 6.101; 95% CI, 1.106-33.640; p <or= 0.04) were more likely to develop pneumonia alone. In 27 episodes (93%) among 29 in which S. pneumoniae susceptibility testing was performed, the patients received concordant antimicrobials. Among the 6 patients (13%) who died of S. pneumoniae infection, 4 had S. pneumoniae bacteremic pneumonia and only 1 had chronic GVHD. Admission to a critical care unit at the onset of infection (OR, 15.5; 95% CI, 2.116-113.541; p <or= 0.007) and each unit increase in APACHE II score increase the probability of death (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.181-3.054; p <or= 0.008). All 5 (11%) patients who developed vaccine-breakthrough S. pneumoniae infection (546 +/- 732 d following vaccination) had pneumonia, and in 4 patients concurrent bacteremia also occurred. A serious S. pneumoniae infection in HSCT recipients occurred more commonly in patients with lymphoma and patients receiving high-dose systemic corticosteroid therapy. It is noteworthy that there were no cases of extrapulmonary organ infection in HSCT recipients who presented with S. pneumoniae infection at our institution.","['From Department of Infectious Diseases, Infection Control, and Employee Health (SY, GR, KVR, IIR, AS); and Department of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (REC), M.

Epub 2007 Apr 16.,"OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological studies have reported associations between childhood cancer and either parental or child exposure to pesticides. Reviews have been published in 1997, 1998 and 2006 where the evidence was found suggestive but not conclusive. The present review is an extended update of the latter one. METHODS: The PubMed database was searched to identify published studies on this topic issued between 1998 and 2006. RESULTS: Thirty-six new studies have been identified for this review. Some cohort studies and the majority of the case-control studies suggest an increased risk for the cancer types studied, associated with exposure to pesticides in at least one of a large variety of exposure categories. However, the evidence is conflicting with regard to cancer types as well as to causative factors across studies. The major shortcomings concern exposure assessment, where, e. g., ""farming"" is treated equal to ""exposure to pesticides"", disregarding other possible exposures, e.g., to biological or infectious agents, and hitherto unidentified lifestyle factors. Also, many exposure categories used, mainly in case-control studies, lack chemical or toxicological plausibility. In most studies exposures were categorized as ""ever vs. never"", with little regard of exposure intensity or duration. CONCLUSIONS: The available literature does not allow firm conclusions with regard to pesticides and any type of childhood cancer. But even if the reported associations were true, exposure to pesticides could not explain the vast majority of childhood cancer cases. Investing in the acquisition and critical review of exposure information appears to be the crucial step for causal assessment in future research. However, focusing on the presence of pesticides, and not asking the question why they were used, might mask relevant associations to other causative agents.","['Occupational Medicine and Health Protection Department, BASF AG, Ludwigshafen, Germany. michael.nasterlack@basf.com']",,,,,51,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 16.,"Sampling and analyzing new families with inherited blood disorders are major steps contributing to the identification of gene(s) responsible for normal and pathologic hematopoiesis. Familial occurrences of hematological disorders alone, or as part of a syndromic disease, have been reported, and for some the underlying genetic mutation has been identified. Here we describe a new autosomal dominant inherited phenotype of thrombocytopenia and red cell macrocytosis in a four-generation pedigree. Interestingly, in the youngest generation, a 2-year-old boy presenting with these familial features has developed acute lymphoblastic leukemia characterized by a t(12;21) translocation. Tri-lineage involvement of platelets, red cells and white cells may suggest a genetic defect in an early multiliear progenitor or a stem cell. Functional assays in EBV-transformed cell lines revealed a defect in cell proliferation and tubulin dynamics. Two candidate genes, RUNX1 and FOG1, were sequenced but no pathogenic mutation was found. Identification of the underlying genetic defect(s) in this family may help in understanding the complex process of hematopoiesis.","['Division of Molecular Medicine, The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, during acute infection blood proviral and viral RNA loads of cats with progressive and regressive infection are not significantly different. Thus, not the overall loads but rather those of specific leukocyte subsets may influence the infection outcome. By combining fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) with sensitive real-time TaqMan PCR and reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR, we established in the present study the methods to determine FeLV proviral and viral RNA loads in specific leukocyte subsets. In addition, they were applied to analyze long-term persistently FeLV-infected (p27-positive) and FeLV exposed but nonantigenemic (p27-negative), nonviremic cats. In the latter animals, CD4(+) and B lymphocytes exhibited the highest proviral loads, whereas in p27-positive cats, all leukocyte subsets showed similar high loads. In p27-positive cats, monocytes and granulocytes bore the highest viral RNA loads, whereas only one p27-negative cat was positive for viral RNA in T lymphocytes. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate FeLV proviral and viral RNA loads in leukocyte subsets of FeLV exposed cats. The herein described methods are important prerequisites to gain a deeper insight into the pathogenesis of FeLV infection.","['Clinical Laboratory, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Weaker associations were calculated when ABCB1 1236T-2677T-3435T haplotype homozygotes were tested against the remaining part of the population (OR=2.3, p=0.09). During the reinduction phase of therapy, the occurrence of severe leukocytopenia was similar among ABCB1 genotype groups. The frequency of any toxicities were not shown to differ according to the ABCG2 421C>A genotype. Our data suggest that the ABCB1 3435T>C genotype is associated with the infectious complications of the applied chemotherapy regimen.","['Department of Genetics, Cell- and Immunobiology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, Trk signaling promotes raised free intracellular zinc, mediating neuronal death after extracellular application of zinc. Thus, regulators of Trk signaling provide attractive targets for future treatment of zinc-associated neurological diseases, including stroke, epilepsy and brain trauma.","['The Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Queensland 4072, Australia.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present article summarizes the available data on the quality of cancer death certification in Spain. A short description of the temporal distribution of the proportion of deaths due to ill-defined tumors in Spain -an indirect indicator of the quality of cancer death certification- is also provided. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified from electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, IME and IBECS) and from manual searches of the references contained in the articles retrieved. Quality data on death certificates for all tumors and for each specific cancer location were summarized, and all main cancer sites were classified according to their pooled accuracy indicators. Trends for the percentage of deaths due to ill-defined tumors and conditions were studied for the period from 1980 to 2002. RESULTS: In Spain, deaths from cancer as a whole and leading cancer sites (lung, colon-rectum, prostate, stomach, pancreas, female breast, uterus, brain, leukemia, lymphomas and myeloma) were well-certified. However, other frequent locations, such as the larynx, esophagus and liver were overcertified, while deaths from bladder, kidney and ovarian cancer were undercertified. The percentage of deaths due to ill-defined tumors and causes was regularly higher in females and decreased in both sexes during the study period. However, the recent introduction of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 has reversed this trend. CONCLUSIONS: Spanish death certificates can be considered as accurate and useful to estimate the burden of cancer, though certification of some frequent sites should be improved. The possible effect of the introduction of the ICD-10 requires careful surveillance.","['Area de Epidemiologia Ambiental y Cancer, Centro Nacional de Epidemiologia, Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Madrid, Espana. bperez@isciii.es']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to BCR-ABL-dependent mechanisms, BCR-ABL-independent mechanisms have been proposed. Here we established and characterized novel CML cell lines, an imatinib-sensitive cell line, MYL, and an imatinib-resistant subline, MYL-R. Treatment with imatinib inhibited phosphorylation of BCR-ABL and CrkL in both MYL and MYL-R, even though imatinib-induced apoptosis was preferentially observed in MYL than MYL-R, indicating that the resistance is based on a BCR-ABL-independent mechanism. MYL-R showed elevated expressions of Lyn mRNA, Lyn protein, phosphorylated Lyn, and phosphorylated STAT5. Silencing of Lyn by short-interfering RNA (siRNA) in MYL-R, but not in MYL, induced significant growth-inhibition, increased caspase-3 activity, and induced partial recovery from imatinib-resistance. Expression of Bcl-2, previously reported to be associated with Lyn-mediated resistance, was not elevated in MYL-R. Expression of Bim, which plays an important role in imatinib-induced cell-killing, was not suppressed in MYL-R. These results imply that diverse mechanisms of resistance exist among cell types. Treatment of MYL-R cells with various reagents known to have anti-leukemic activity revealed that zoledronic acid and the farnesyl transferase inhibitor (SCH 66336) showed strong synergism with imatinib; interferon alpha, PP2, CGP76030, and FK228 (depsipeptide) showed synergism; whereas soluble TRAIL and As2O3 showed additivity or antagonism, and 17-AAG and radicicol showed antagonism. Treatment with either PP2 or zoledronic acid induced greater growth-reduction in MYL-R than MYL. Taken together, Lyn may play an important role in imatinib-resistance in MYL-R.

TRAIL could be one of the reagents for therapeutic use in combination with imatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Here we examined serum-soluble TRAIL (sTRAIL) levels in CML patients either before or during therapies with IFNalpha or imatinib. In untreated CML patients, serum sTRAIL was detectable and the levels were substantially comparable with those in healthy donors. sTRAIL levels significantly increased in patients during IFNalpha therapy, but not at all in patients during imatinib therapy. TRAIL mRNA expressions in neutrophils in CML patients undergoing IFNalpha therapy was significantly elevated when compared with those in patients prior to therapy. TRAIL mRNA expressions were also detectable in CD34-positive cells in bone marrow, and the levels increased in patients during IFNalpha therapy. In vitro IFNalpha stimulation of CML neutrophils increased intracellular TRAIL rather than cell-surface TRAIL, and the secretion of sTRAIL in the culture supernatant was observed. This sTRAIL secretion was augmented with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation only in IFNalpha-primed neutrophils, whereas LPS alone had no effect. Taken together, in vivo IFNalpha treatment provokes the release of sTRAIL when administered systematically in CML patients. The main source of the IFNalpha-induced serum sTRAIL may be neutrophils in CML, and sTRAIL may be one of the mechanisms of the anti-proliferative action of IFNalpha on CML. These findings give another rationale for the use of IFNalpha or recombinant sTRAIL in CML, and also implicate the potential importance of neutrophils in tumor immunosurveillance.","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Division of Clinical and Experimental Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan. dtanaka@hiroshima-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In general, 48% of men suffer unexplained infertility. During a long time, the masculine reproductive tract and the immune system have been studied as different and independent systems. However, in the last two decades a particular interest has arisen in the interaction of both systems on masculine infertility, in particular in the evaluation of antisperm antibodies as a common cause of infertility. Also, the inflammation due to genital or systemic infections can cause alterations in the testicular function. The recognition of intratesticular antigens provokes the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes. Then, the immune system induces a cellular response, by cytokines secretion, activation of complement and T lymphocytes activation. In this review the components and the immune system response mechanism, the organization of the testicle as a reproductive organ and the mediators of the immunologic response will be examined: interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, leukaemia Inhibitory factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, the molecule FasL (CD95L) and Fas (CD95), macrophage migration-inhibitory factor, mononuclear phagocyte colony stimulating factor, Granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor, as well as stem cell factor, interferon, transforming growth factor B and activins.","['1Laboratorio de Investigaciones Fisiopatologicas, Departamento de Bioanalisis Clinico, Universidad de Los Andes, Merida, Venezuela. giovanny@ula.ve']",,,,,136,,Regulacion inmuno-testicular y citocinas.,,,,,,,,

However, an increase in grampositive bacteremia and the emergence of resistant colonizing bacteria have consistently been noticed. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones on the incidence of bacteremia and mortality in a hospital with high fluorquinolone resistance in Mexico City. PATIENTS: We conducted a retrospective and comparative study of patients with acute mieloid (AML) and hybrid (HL) leukemia who received or not prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones and who were attended from January 2000 to December 2003. We reviewed all pertinent clinical and laboratory data of the hematologic malignancies and the febrile episodes. RESULTS: A total of 108 febrile episodes of severe neutropenia occurred in 69 patients, with an incidence of 6.5 events/1000 day-patient with neutropenia. The median age was 35 +/- 18.3 years and 58% were men; 51 patients had AML (71.8%) and 20 (28.1%) HL. Prophylaxis had been given since the beginning of granulocytopenia in 46 (42.6%) febrile episodes (group 1), where as in 62 no prophylaxis was given (group 2). Of the 46 episodes with prophylaxis, 27 received ciprofloxacin 500 mg qd p.o. and 19, ciprofloxacin 500 mg qd po plus fluconazol 100 mg qd po. The median duration of prophylaxis was 8.5 days (range 1-90 days). Twenty-nine bacteremias (26.8%) were documented, with an incidence of 16.4 bacteremias/1000 day-patient with neutropenia, 12 (26%) in group 1 and 17 (27.5%) in group 2. Bacteremia was most frequently caused by gram negative organisms (18/29), being Escherichia coli (14) the most commonly isolated pathogen, with 7 episodes in each group. Eight (29.6%) of the 21 isolates in which fluoroquinolone susceptibility was tested were ciprofloxacin resistant, 3 in group 1 and 5 in group 2 (p = 0.58). Median survival of patients was 38 days in group 1 and 40 days in group 2. (p = 0.2); mortality was similar in both groups, 34% and 27%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a hospital with a high prevalence of fluoroquinolone-resistance, prophylaxis in patients with acute leukemia and severe neutropenia did not prevent febrile episodes and did not have any impact on mortality. However, there was no increase in infections caused by resistant bacteria.","['Departamento de Infectologia, Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran, Mexico, DF.']",,,,,,,"Utilidad de la profilaxis con fluoroquinolonas durante la neutropenia grave inducida por quimioterapia en pacientes con leucemia aguda, en un hospital de referencia de la Ciudad de Mexico con alta prevalencia de resistencia a fluoroquinolonas.",,,,,,,,

The development of imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeted against the causative Bcr-Abl oncoprotein in CML, has resulted in hematologic and cytogenetic remissions in all phases of CML. A significant proportion of patients are resistant to imatinib or develop resistance during treatment. This is often a result of mutated forms of the Bcr-Abl oncoprotein to which imatinib is unable to bind. Several strategies have been developed to overcome the problem of imatinib resistance, including high-dose imatinib, novel targeted agents, and combination treatments. Novel agents include dasatinib, a potent TKI that inhibits several critical oncogenic proteins and which has recently been approved for patients with CML who are resistant or intolerant to imatinib; and nilotinib, a potent selective Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor currently in clinical development. Other agents in development include SKI-606 and INNO-406. Stem cell transplantation remains a useful option, although it is not generally used as first-line treatment.

The specific extra chromosomes are not random; extra copies of some chromosomes occur more frequently than those of others. We examined the extra chromosomes present in high hyperdiploid ALL to determine if there were a relation of the specific extra chromosomes and modal number (MN) and if the extra chromosomes present could differentiate high hyperdiploid from near-triploid and near-tetraploid cases. Karyotypes of 2,339 children with ALL and high hyperdiploidy at diagnosis showed a distinct nonrandom sequential pattern of gain for each chromosome as MN increased, with four groups of gain: chromosomes 21, X, 14, 6, 18, 4, 17, and 10 at MN 51-54; chromosomes 8, 5, 11, and 12 at MN 57-60; chromosomes 2, 3, 9,16, and 22 at MN 63-67; chromosomes 1, 7 13, 15, 19, and 20 at MN 68-79, and Y only at MN >or=80. Chromosomes gained at lower MN were retained as the MN increased. High hyperdiploid pediatric ALL results from a single abnormal mitotic division. Our results suggest that the abnormal mitosis involves specific chromosomes dependent on the number of chromosomes aberrantly distributed, raising provocative questions regarding the mitotic mechanism. The patterns of frequencies of tetrasomy of specific chromosomes differs from that of trisomies with the exception of chromosome 21, which is tetrasomic in a high frequency of cases at all MN. These results are consistent with different origins of high hyperdiploidy, near-trisomy, and near-tetrasomy.","['Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA. nyla.heerema@osumc.edu']","['CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 98543/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 12.,"Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor family and regulate the proliferation and differentiation of multiple different cell types, including promyelocytic leukemia cells. Here we describe a biochemical/functional interaction between the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMKs) and RARs that modulates the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells. We observe that CaMKIIgamma is the CaMK that is predominantly expressed in myeloid cells. CaMKII inhibits RAR transcriptional activity, and this enzyme directly interacts with RAR through a CaMKII LxxLL binding motif. CaMKIIgamma phosphorylates RARalpha both in vitro and in vivo, and this phosphorylation inhibits RARalpha activity by enhancing its interaction with transcriptional corepressors. In myeloid cell lines, CaMKIIgamma localizes to RAR target sites within myeloid gene promoters but dissociates from the promoter upon retinoic acid-induced myeloid cell differentiation. KN62, a pharmacological inhibitor of the CaMKs, enhances the terminal differentiation of myeloid leukemia cell lines, and this is associated with a reduction in activated (autophosphorylated) CaMKII in the terminally differentiating cells. These observations reveal a significant cross-talk between Ca(2+) and retinoic acid signaling pathways that regulates the differentiation of myeloid leukemia cells, and they suggest that CaMKIIgamma may provide a new therapeutic target for the treatment of certain human myeloid leukemias.","['Human Biology Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Avenue N., Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']","['P50 HL054881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA118971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 54881/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 118971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1847537,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anticancer activity of PMQ was studied towards human HL-60 leukemia cells. Antiproliferative activity of PMQ was determined by direct counting of cells using trypan blue staining technique. Apoptosis and cell cycle profile changes were analysed using internucleosomal DNA fragmentation assay and flow cytometry. Activation of caspases and changes in glutathione level were monitored using colorimetric or luminiscent methods. RESULTS: PMQ induced concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in leukemia cells, with IC(50) of 10.8 +/- 0.9 microM. DNA flow cytometry analysis and DNA ladder formation assay indicated that PMQ actively induced apoptosis of cells accompanied by a block of cells in G(2)/M phase and a marked loss of cells in G(0)/G(1) and S phases. Additionally, the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were increased significantly and a markedly increased level of oxidized glutahione was observed. Inhibition of glutahione synthesis using buthionine sulfoximine sensitized leukemia cells to PMQ, confirming the involvement of ROS in PMQ-induced apoptosis. CONCLUSION: The results of this study clearly demonstrate that PMQ is a promising anticancer drug showing cytostatic and apoptotic effects toward HL-60 leukemia cells mainly through mitochondrial/caspase-9 dependent pathway.","['Cancer Research Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 833 91 Bratislava, Slovakia. exoncip@savba.sk']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other causes including involvement of leukemia, toxic encephalopathies induced by chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and vascular lesions must be diagnosed differentially for advanced treatment or follow-up. While ultimate diagnosis rests on the collection of cerebrospinal fluid, it is not enough for essential diagnosis. Imaging techniques such as head MRI are powerful tools for diagnosis of intracranial organic lesions, especially in this setting involving leukemia, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) by JC virus infection and treatment-related disseminated necrotizing leukoencephalopathy.

Epub 2007 Apr 12.,"Nbs1, a member of the Mre11-RAD50-Nbs1 complex, is phosphorylated by ATM, the product of the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene and a member of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related family of serine-threonine kinases, in response to DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) to regulate DNA damage checkpoints. Here we show that BCR/ABL stimulated Nbs1 expression by induction of c-Myc-dependent transactivation and protection from caspase-dependent degradation. BCR/ABL-related fusion tyrosine kinases (FTKs) such as TEL/JAK2, TEL/PDGFbetaR, TEL/ABL, TEL/TRKC, BCR/FGFR1, and NPM/ALK as well as interleukin 3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and stem cell factor (SCF) also stimulated Nbs1 expression. Enhanced ATM kinase-dependent phosphorylation of Nbs1 on serine 343 (S343) in response to genotoxic treatment was detected in leukemia cells expressing BCR/ABL and other FTKs in comparison to normal counterparts stimulated with IL-3, GM-CSF, and SCF. Expression of Nbs1-S343A mutant disrupted the intra-S-phase checkpoint, decreased homologous recombinational repair (HRR) activity, down-regulated XIAP expression, and sensitized BCR/ABL-positive cells to cytotoxic drugs. Interestingly, inhibition of Nbs1 phosphorylation by S343A mutant enhanced the antileukemia effect of the combination of imatinib and genotoxic agent.","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Temple University, Philadelphia, PA 19140, USA.']","['R01 CA089052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87015/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA89052/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1924483,,,,,,,,,,,

We show that CD56 expression on AML cells correlates with an abnormal expression pattern of runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1) isoforms. Whereas full-length p48 RUNX1 (p48) up-regulated CD56 in AML cells, 3 previously unknown shorter RUNX1 isoforms, p38a, p30, and p24, suppressed CD56 expression. Both p48 and CD56 induced nuclear translocation of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB and increased bcl2L12 expression, and inhibition of this pathway by small inhibitory RNA-mediated p48 knock down or NF-kappaB blockade substantially increased apoptosis in CD56(+) AML cell lines.

Preclinical data indicate that dasatinib is 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl, and that dasatinib is active against 18 of 19 Bcr-Abl mutations known to cause imatinib resistance. Phase I clinical data show that dasatinib is well tolerated and highly effective for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/imatinib-intolerant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the molecular mechanism of action of dasatinib is not fully understood. In this study, we confirm that dasatinib inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of SFKs, including Src, Hck, and Lyn, in K562 human CML cells. Significantly, downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) signaling is also blocked by dasatinib as shown by decreases in levels of phosphorylated Stat5 and Stat5 DNA-binding activities. In addition, dasatinib down-regulates expression of Stat5 target genes, including Bcl-x, Mcl-1, and cyclin D1. Consistent with these results, blockade of Stat5 signaling by dasatinib is accompanied by inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Surprisingly, Stat5 DNA-binding activities are enhanced with increasing cell density, which is associated with resistance to apoptosis by dasatinib. Our findings indicate that inhibition of Stat5 signaling downstream of Bcr-Abl/SFKs contributes to the action of dasatinib, and, conversely, that increasing cell density up-regulates Stat5 activation and confers resistance to dasatinib. Moreover, the level of phosphorylated Stat5 in CML cells represents a mechanistically relevant biomarker for monitoring inhibition of Bcr-Abl signaling by dasatinib in CML patients using convenient immunocytochemical assays.","['Molecular Medicine, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 East Duarte Road, Duarte, CA 91010, USA.']","['CA55652/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA82533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, groundbreaking therapeutic discoveries have been made for extremely uncommon malignancies such as hairy cell leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, seminoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, (del)5q myelodysplastic syndrome, and acute promyelocytic leukemia. In contrast, progress in the most common and most intensively studied tumors - lung, breast, prostate, and colon cancer - has been slow and incremental. We hypothesize that the reason for this phenomenon is that the pathophysiologic basis for a tumor being rare is one and the same as the reason that it may ultimately be so treatable. That is, if a cancer can be derived only via a single aberrant molecular genetic aberration, then it should be both rare and easily targeted by a molecular cancer therapeutic approach. If, on the other hand, many distinct pathways can lead to the development of a specific tumor type, it should occur much more commonly and be significantly more difficult to treat. The corollary to our hypothesis is the prediction that new therapies will continue to show their most salutary effects in rare cancers. Furthermore, only by stratifying the common tumors, especially when using targeted agents, into the molecular subsets of diseases that compose them are we likely to achieve a substantial effect in these disorders.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objectives of this study were to detect the presence of LIF receptor (LIFR) and glycoprotein 130 (gp 130) in the human Fallopian tube, endometrium and preimplantation embryo and to study the effect of mifepristone on the expression of LIFR and gp130 in the Fallopian tube. Twenty-two healthy fertile women received a single dose of 200 mg mifepristone or placebo immediately after ovulation (LH + 2). Biopsies were obtained from the Fallopian tubes during laparoscopic sterilization once between days LH + 4 and LH + 6 and from endometrium once between days LH + 6 and LH + 8. Preimplantation embryos were received from couples undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the presence of LIFR and gp130 in the Fallopian tube, endometrium and preimplantation embryo. Real-time PCR was used to study LIFR and gp130 expression in the Fallopian tube and endometrium. LIFR and gp130 were localized in the Fallopian tube, preimplantation embryo and endometrium. LIFR was more abundant in the Fallopian tube than in the endometrium. In the blastocyst, the staining of gp130 was mainly localized in the inner cell mass, whereas LIFR was expressed in all cells. The presence of LIFR and gp130 in the Fallopian tube and preimplantation embryo indicates a role for LIF in communication between the embryo and the Fallopian tube. Mifepristone did not affect the expression of LIFR and gp130 in the Fallopian tube, nor in the endometrium suggesting that progesterone might not be directly involved in the regulation of LIFR or gp130.","['Department of Woman and Child Health, Division of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, S-171 76 Stockholm, Sweden. kjell.wanggren@karolinska.se']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 12.,"HoxA10 is a homeodomain transcription factor that is frequently overexpressed in human acute myeloid leukemia. In murine bone marrow transplantation studies, HoxA10 overexpression induces a myeloproliferative disorder with accumulation of mature phagocytes in the peripheral blood and tissues. Over time, differentiation block develops in these animals, resulting in acute myeloid leukemia. In immature myeloid cells, HoxA10 represses transcription of some genes that confer the mature phagocyte phenotype. Therefore, overexpressed HoxA10 blocks differentiation by repressing myeloid-specific gene transcription in differentiating myeloid cells. In contrast, target genes involved in myeloproliferation due to HoxA10 overexpression have not been identified. To identify such genes, we screened a CpG island microarray with HoxA10 co-immunoprecipitating chromatin. We identified the DUSP4 gene, which encodes mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 2 (Mkp2), as a HoxA10 target gene. We analyzed the DUSP4 5'-flank and identified two proximal-promoter cis elements that are activated by HoxA10. We find that DUSP4 transcription and Mkp2 expression decrease during normal myelopoiesis. However, this down-regulation is impaired in myeloid cells overexpressing HoxA10. In hematopoietic cells, c-Jun N-terminal kinases (Jnk) are the preferred substrates for Mkp2. Therefore, Mkp2 inhibits apoptosis by dephosphorylating (inactivating) Jnk. Consistent with this, HoxA10 overexpression decreases apoptosis in differentiating myeloid cells. Therefore, our studies identify a mechanism by which overexpressed HoxA10 contributes to inappropriate cell survival during myelopoiesis.","['Fineberg School of Medicine and the Robert H.

Overexpression of myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) gene could inhibit irradiation-and drug-induced apoptosis in several lymphoma cell lines. This study was to detect the expression of Mcl-1 in T-NHL of various subtypes, and explore its correlation to clinicopathologic features and prognosis of T-NHL. METHODS: The expression of Mcl-1 protein in 72 specimens of T-NHL was detected by immunohistochemistry. The clinical features, treatments, and outcomes of the T-NHL patients were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The weak positive rates of Mcl-1 were 44.4% in precursor T lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LBL), 0% in anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma (ALCL), and 18.9% in other peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTL); the positive rates were 0%, 100%, and 49.1%, respectively (P<0.001). Weak diffuse cytoplasmic staining of Mcl-1 was detected in T-LBL, and strong cytoplasmic staining with perinuclear accentuation was detected in ALCL. The overall survival time was significantly longer in the PTL patients with high Mcl-1 expression than in the PTL patients with weak/negative Mcl-1 expression (>32 months vs. 15 months, P=0.007), and longer in the T-LBL patients without Mcl-1 expression than in the T-LBL patients with weak Mcl-1 expression (21 months vs. 7 months, P=0.58). CONCLUSIONS: The intensities of Mcl-1 expression in T-NHL of various histological subtypes are different. It is specifically highly expressed in ALCL. High expression of Mcl-1 is correlated to better prognosis of PTL.","['State Key Laboratory for Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, P. R. China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotyping will make diagnosis more precise through analyzing the origin and differentiation status of tumor, which is necessary for treatment and prognosis prediction. This study was to analyze the immunophenotypic characteristics of lymphocytic leukemia and NHL with bone marrow involvement using flow cytometry (FCM). METHODS: Bone marrow specimens from 112 patients with lymphocytic leukemia or NHL with bone marrow involvement were detected by FCM using antibodies of T, B and myeloid cell series. Using CD45/SSC gating strategy, the samples were analyzed with 5 parameters (FSC, SSC, McAb1-FITC, McAb2-PE, CD45-cytochrome). RESULTS: In 45 cases of precursor B lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (B-ALL/LBL), the antigens were mainly CD19, CD10, TdT, CD34, HLA-DR, and CD20. In 32 cases of precursor T lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL/LBL), the antigens were mainly CD7, CD5, cytoplasmic (Cy)CD3, TdT, CD34, surface CD3 (sCD3), and HLA-DR. Of the 77 cases of precursor ALL/LBL, 28(36.4%) expressed myeloid-associated antigens, such as CD13 and CD33; 9 (20.0%) cases of B-ALL/LBL coexpressed CD20 and CD34; 28(87.5%) cases of T-ALL/LBL coexpressed cyCD3 and TdT. Among the 35 cases of mature B-cell malignancies, 17 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) mainly expressed CD19, CD20, CD5, HLA-DR, with coexpression of CD19 and CD5; 4 cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) mainly expressed CD19, CD20, CD10, and HLA-DR; 3 cases of Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) mainly expressed CD19, CD10, CD20, and sIgM; 1 case of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) expressed CD5, CD19, CD20, and HLA-DR. Among the 10 mature T-cell malignancies, 5 cases of unspecialied peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) mainly expressed sCD3, CD5 and CD7, CD4 or CD8; 1 case of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) expressed sCD3 and HLA-DR; 4 cases of NK/T-cell malignancies expressed CD56 and HLA-DR, CD4 or CD8 or CD7. Mature lymphoid system malignancies didn't express early antigens, such as CD34 and TdT, but expressed myeloid-associated antigens, especially CD13 and CD33. CONCLUSION: Multiparameter FCM can not only provide data of cell lineage and differentiation status but also detect phenotypic aberrancies, which is helpful for minimal residual disease detecting.","['State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510060, P.

Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) has been gradually used as an alternative to bone marrow transplantation (BMT). This study was to observe the efficacy of allogeneic PBSCT (allo-PBSCT) or autologous PBSCT (auto-PBSCT) on malignant hematologic diseases. METHODS: From Jul. 2003 to May 2006, 53 patients with malignant hematologic diseases underwent PBSCT in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University. PBSCs were mobilized with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or chemotherapy combined with G-CSF. Auto-PBSCT group received infusion of CD34+ cells at a median of 3.0x10(6) cells/kg; allo-PBSCT group received infusion of CD34+ cells at a median of 6.2x106 cells/kg. MAC regimen was used in auto-PBSCT group as conditioning regimen; amended BU/CY regimen was used in allo-PBSCT group. Methotrexate (MTX) combined with cyclosporine A (CsA) and MMF was used for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) was used in 1 patient with 1 mismatched locus in allo-PBSCT group. RESULTS: The median time for neutrophils to reach 0.5x10(9)/L and platelets to reach 20x10(9)/L were 13 days and 19 days in auto-PBSCT group, 12 days and 15 days in allo-PBSCT group. In allo-PBSCT group, grade I-III acute GVHD occurred in 31.4% cases, and chronic GVHD developed in 71.4% cases. The relapse rate was 38.9% in auto-PBSCT group and 5.7% in allo-PBSCT group. The 700-day disease-free survival rate (DFS) was 57.9% in auto-PBSCT group, and 69.5% in allo-PBSCT group. CONCLUSIONS: PBSCT can provide rapid hematopoietic reconstitution. It is a better choice for the cure of malignant hematologic diseases.","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan, 450052, P. R.

Leukemia is the most common pediatric malignancy. Recent studies have suggested that DADS can induce apoptosis in human leukemia cells, but its mechanisms remain unclear. This study was to investigate the biological effects of DADS on the apoptosis of human leukemia cell line HL-60, and explore its molecular mechanisms. METHODS: After treatment of DADS, cell apoptosis was verified by flow cytometry with Annexin V/PI staining, DNA agarose gel electrophoresis, transmission electron microscopy. The expression profile of apoptosis-associated genes in HL-60 cells, with or without 4-hour treatment of DADS (60 micromol/L), was identified by gene array. The up-regulated Fas-L gene and down-regulated Bag-1 gene were confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: When treated with 15, 30, 60, 120 micromol/L DADS for 24 h, HL-60 cells presented obvious subdiploid peaks. When treated with 60 micromol/L DADS for 4, 8, 12, 24 h, early apoptotic cells were greatly increased. When treated with 60 micromol/L DADS for 24 h, DNA extracted from HL-60 cells displayed a characteristic ladder pattern on agarose gel electrophoresis; typical morphologic apoptotic changes were observed under electron microscope, including cell shrinkage, nuclear condensation, and formation of apoptotic bodies; the differential expression of 8 apoptosis-associated genes were found with gene array. The expression of Fas-L and Bag-1 detected by RT-PCR were consistent with those detected by gene array.

RESULTS: ELISA revealed that LTC4 and -D4, but not -E4, enhanced TNF-alpha-induced MMP-9 production in THP-1 cells and peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes/macrophages. Real-time polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that LTC4 and -D4, but not -E4, increased MMP-9 mRNA expression induced by TNF-alpha in THP-1 cells. Moreover, we demonstrated that pranlukast completely inhibited the enhancement of TNF-alpha-induced MMP-9 production by LTC4 and -D4 in THP-1 cells and peripheral blood CD14+ monocytes/macrophages. CONCLUSION: LTC4 and -D4 enhanced the TNF-alpha-induced MMP-9 production via binding the cysLT1 receptor in human monocytes/macrophages. Pranlukast inhibited the enhancements by LTC4 and D4.","['Department of Pediatrics, Yamaguchi University School of Medicine, Yamaguchi, Japan. ichiyama@yamaguchi-u.ac.jp']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, several intrinsic limitations have been uncounted during the clinical use of these oxazaphosphorines, including substantial pharmacokinetic variability, resistance and severe host toxicity. To circumvent these problems, new oxazaphosphorines derivatives have been designed and evaluated with an attempt to improve the selectivity and response with reduced host toxicity. These include mafosfamide (NSC 345842), glufosfamide (D19575, beta-D-glucosylisophosphoramide mustard), S-(-)-bromofosfamide (CBM-11), NSC 612567 (aldophosphamide perhydrothiazine) and NSC 613060 (aldophosphamide thiazolidine). Mafosfamide is an oxazaphosphorine analog that is a chemically stable 4-thioethane sulfonic acid salt of 4-hydroxy-CPA. Glufosfamide is IFO derivative in which the isophosphoramide mustard, the alkylating metabolite of IFO, is glycosidically linked to a beta-D-glucose molecule. Phase II studies of glufosfamide in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), and recurrent glioblastoma multiform (GBM) have recently completed and Phase III trials are ongoing, while Phase I studies of intrathecal mafosfamide have recently completed for the treatment of meningeal malignancy secondary to leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumors. S-(-)-bromofosfamide is a bromine-substituted IFO analog being evaluated in a few Phase I clinical trials. The synthesis and development of novel oxazaphosphorine analogs with favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties still constitutes a great challenge for medicinal chemists and cancer pharmacologists.","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Australian Institute of Chinese Medicine, Carlingford, New South Wales, Australia.']",,,,,183,,,,,,,,,,

The development of drug resistance is the limiting factor in the therapy of AML. Different problems of drug resistance in childhood AML, with emphasis to age and in comparison to adult AML are presented. In vitro and in vivo aspects are discussed, together with mechanisms of resistance to cytostatic drugs, focused on clinical relevance of cellular drug resistance profile and its prognostic value. Possibilities of modulation and circumvention of drug resistance are reviewed, with stress on new drugs being tested. Taking into account both children and adults, it seems that age is adversely related to therapy outcome in AML, and the percentage of patients with favorable cytogenetics decreases with age; however, age is positively correlated with multi-drug resistance and the proportion of patients with unfavorable cytogenetics. AML is considered a stem cell disease. BCRP, PGP and MRP's are preferentially expressed in leukemic stem cells, making this disease drug resistant. Cellular drug resistance in AML cells seems to be similar throughout all other age groups, however the higher the age, the worse the outcome. In childhood AML, no drug is more effective in comparison to ALL, and cellular drug resistance is partially related to chromosomal abnormalities. Pediatric AML is equally resistant as adult AML. Pediatric and adult AML, respectively, are possibly equally drug resistant on initial diagnosis and at relapse. In contrast to ALL, the prognostic value of in vitro drug resistance in childhood AML has not been well documented yet.","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Bydgoszcz, Poland. jstyczynski@cm.umk.pl']",,,,,165,,,,,,,,,,

Imatinib (IM) has a favorable toxicity profile but limited antileukemic activity in advanced Ph+ALL. Imatinib in combination with intensive chemotherapy has yielded promising results as front-line therapy, but its value as monotherapy in newly diagnosed Ph+ALL is not known. METHODS: Patients with de novo Ph+ALL were randomly assigned to induction therapy with either imatinib (Ind(IM)) or multiagent, age-adapted chemotherapy (Ind(chemo)). Imatinib was subsequently coadministered with consolidation chemotherapy. RESULTS: In all, 55 patients (median age, 68 years) were enrolled. The overall CR rate was 96.3% in patients randomly assigned to Ind(IM) and 50% in patients allocated to Ind(chemo) (P = .0001). Nine patients (34.6%) were refractory and 2 patients died during Ind(chemo); none failed imatinib induction. Severe adverse events were significantly more frequent during Ind(chemo) (90% vs 39%; P = .005). The estimated overall survival (OS) of all patients was 42% +/- 8% at 24 months, with no significant difference between the 2 cohorts. Median disease-free survival was significantly longer in the 43% of patients (21 of 49 evaluable) in whom BCR-ABL transcripts became undetectable (18.3 months vs 7.2 months; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: In elderly patients with de novo Ph+ALL, imatinib induction results in a significantly higher CR rate and lower toxicity than induction chemotherapy. With subsequent combined imatinib and chemotherapy consolidation, this initial benefit does not translate into improved survival compared with chemotherapy induction.","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Frankfurt, Germany. ottmann@em.uni-frankfurt.de']",,['GMALL Study Group'],,,,,,['(c) 2007 American Cancer Society'],,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 11.,"PURPOSE: Dasatinib (BMS-354825), a potent oral multi-targeted kinase inhibitor against SRC and BCR-ABL, has recently been approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in imatinib-acquired resistance and intolerance. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of dasatinib in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey. Possible mechanisms contributing to the incomplete oral bioavailability of dasatinib in animals were investigated. METHODS: Metabolic stability of dasatinib was measured after incubation with liver microsomes (either NADPH- or UDPGA-fortified) and isolated hepatocytes obtained from mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. In all cases, substrate depletion over time was measured, and appropriate scaling factors were used to predict in vivo clearance. Pharmacokinetics of dasatinib were determined in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys after administration of single intravenous or oral doses. In addition, the routes of excretion were investigated after administration of dasatinib to bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats. Absorption and first-pass metabolism were evaluated as possible reasons for the incomplete oral bioavailability using various in vitro and in vivo models like Caco-2 cells, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) knockout mice, and intra-portal dosing in rats. RESULTS: In vivo systemic plasma clearance values of dasatinib were 62, 26, 25, and 34 ml/min/kg in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. Scaling of in vitro hepatocyte and liver microsomal data gave reasonably good predictions of in vivo clearances across all species. Percent distribution in blood cells ranged from 43% in mouse to 57% in dog. Dasatinib showed high volumes of distribution (>3 l/kg) and high serum protein binding values (>90%) in all four species tested. Oral bioavailability of dasatinib ranged from 14% in the mouse to 34% in the dog. In rats, bioavailability after an intraportal dose was comparable to that after intra-arterial administration. In BDC rats, less than 15% of an intravenous dose was excreted unchanged in urine, bile, and the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that dasatinib is cleared primarily via metabolism. Dasatinib has high intrinsic permeability in Caco-2 cells, however, the efflux ratio was approximately two-fold indicating that it may be a substrate for an intestinal efflux transporter. However, in vivo studies in P-gp knockout mice versus wild-type mice showed no difference in the amount of dasatinib remaining unabsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that P-gp may not be responsible for the incomplete bioavailability. CONCLUSIONS: Dasatinib shows intermediate clearance in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, and distributes extensively in those species. Oxidative metabolism appears to be the predominant clearance pathway. The incomplete oral bioavailability may be due to both incomplete absorption and high first-pass metabolism. However, the efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein does not appear to be limiting oral absorption.","['Department of Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Sciences, Genentech, 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar to the situation seen with human pre-T LBL, the SCL/LMO1 leukemias displayed an expression profile consistent with mature, late cortical thymocytes, whereas the NHD13 leukemias displayed an expression profile more consistent with immature thymocytes. We evaluated two of the most differentially regulated genes as potential therapeutic targets. Cfl1 was specifically overexpressed in SCL-LMO1 tumors; inactivation of Cfl1 using okadaic acid resulted in suppression of leukemic cell growth. Overexpression of Ccl8 was a consistent finding in all three transgenic lines, and an antagonist for the Ccl8 receptor-induced death of leukemic cell lines, suggesting a novel therapeutic approach.","['Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Navy8/Rm5105, 8901 Wisconsin Avenue, Bethesda, MD 20889-5105, USA.']",['Z01 SC010378-06/Intramural NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC2063467,,,,,['NIHMS25096'],,,,,,

It is currently assumed that B-cell lymphomas correlate to normal B-cell differentiation stages, but the precise correlation of several B-cell lymphomas to these two pathways remains controversial. In the present report, we describe the junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C), currently identified at the cell-cell border of endothelial cells, as a new B-cell marker with a tightly regulated expression during B-cell differentiation. Expression of JAM-C in tonsils allows distinction between two CD27+ B-cell subpopulations: JAM-C- GC B cells and JAM-C+ non-germinal B cells. The expression of JAM-C in different B-cell lymphomas reveals a disease-specific pattern and allows a clear distinction between JAM-C- lymphoproliferative syndromes (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, mantle cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma) and JAM-C+ ones (hairy cell leukemia, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma). Therefore, we propose JAM-C as a new identification tool in B-cell lymphoma diagnosis.","['Department of Pathology and Immunology, University Medical Center, Geneva, Switzerland.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 12.,"More than 30 years ago it was discovered that permeability glycoprotein (P-gp) can cause drug resistance. Over the following decades numerous studies showed that high expression of P-gp is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia in adults and that it causes multidrug resistance via ATP-dependent drug efflux. It was hoped that an inhibition of P-gp could sensitize resistant leukemic cells to chemotherapy and thus improve treatment results. Today we know that the family of ATP-binding cassette transporters (ABC transporters) comprises 48 different proteins. Some of them seem to be able to cause drug resistance as well as P-gp. This review focuses on emerging data on the clinical relevance of other ABC transporters, such as BCRP, MRP3, and ABCA3. When Heracles fought the ancient Hydra, he had to fight all the heads at ones but only one head was vital for the beast. Can we block all the relevant ABC transporters at once? Is there one transporter that is more important than the others?","[""Pediatrics, University Children's Hospital, Ulm, Germany. Daniel@Steinba.ch""]",,,,,64,,,,,,,,,,

Potentially, the transition from a pluripotent state to lineage commitment also includes epigenetic instructions. The histone 3 lysine 4 methyltransferase Mll2/Wbp7 is essential for embryonic development. Here, we used embryonic stem (ES) cell lines deficient for Mll2 to examine its function more accurately. Mll2-/- ES cells are viable and retain pluripotency, but they display cell proliferation defects due to an enhanced rate of apoptosis. Apoptosis was not relieved by caspase inhibition and correlated with decreased Bcl2 expression. Concordantly, Mll2 binds to the Bcl2 gene and H3K4me(3) levels are reduced at the binding site when Mll2 is absent. In vitro differentiation showed delays along representative pathways for all three germ layers. Although ectodermal delays were severe and mesodermal delays persisted at about three days, endodermal differentiation seemed to recover and overshoot, concomitant with prolonged Oct4 gene expression. Hence, Mll2 is not required for ES cell self-renewal or the complex changes in gene expression involved in lineage commitment, but it contributes to the coordination and timing of early differentiation decisions.","['Genomics Group, BioInnovations Zentrum, Technische Universitat Dresden, 01307 Dresden, Germany.']",,,,PMC1877088,,,,,,,,,,,

Epub 2007 Apr 10.,"Different proteins ensure the fine control of iron metabolism at the level of various tissues. Among these proteins, it was discovered a second transferrin receptor (TfR2), that seems to play a key role in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Its mutations are responsible for type 3 hemochromatosis (Type 3 HH). Although TfR2 expression in normal tissues was restricted at the level of liver and intestine, we observed that TfR2 was frequently expressed in tumor cell lines. Particularly frequent was its expression in ovarian cancer, colon cancer and glioblastoma cell lines; less frequent was its expression in leukemic and melanoma cell lines. Interestingly, in these tumor cell lines, TfR2 expression was inversely related to that of receptor 1 for transferrin (TfR1). Experiments of in vitro iron loading or iron deprivation provided evidence that TfR2 is modulated in cancer cell lines according to cellular iron levels following two different mechanisms: (i) in some cells, iron loading caused a downmodulation of total TfR2 levels; (ii) in other cell types, iron loading caused a downmodulation of membrane-bound TfR2, without affecting the levels of total cellular TfR2 content. Iron deprivation caused in both conditions an opposite effect compared to iron loading. These observations suggest that TfR2 expression may be altered in human cancers and warrant further studies in primary tumors. Furthermore, our studies indicate that, at least in tumor cells, TfR2 expression is modulated by iron through different biochemical mechanisms, whose molecular basis remains to be determined.","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Molecular Medicine, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Viale Regina Elena 299, 00161 Rome, Italy.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we have used indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy to describe various forms of a novel nuclear PML compartment associated with nucleoli that is found under growth-permitting conditions in human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and skin fibroblasts but not in several immortal cell lines with defects in the p53 and pRb pathways. In addition, we found that shut-off of rRNA synthesis induced by actinomycin D causes PML translocation to the surface of segregated nucleoli. This translocation is dynamic and reversible, following changes in nucleolar activity. Intriguingly, treatment causing premature senescence restores PML binding to nucleoli-derived structures and to the surface of segregated nucleoli in HeLa cells.

Epub 2007 Feb 27.,"The minor histocompatibility antigen HA-1H is a potential immunotherapeutic molecule. It can be used as a target for graft versus leukaemia reactions to eliminate residual HA-1H expressing leukaemic cells in patients following haemopoietic stem cell transplantation, whereby HA-1H primed donor cells can be transferred into a patient via adoptive immunotherapy. However, thus far only synthetic peptides corresponding to a HLA-A *0201 restricted HA-1H epitope have been used to generate HA-1H specific T cells. We are the first laboratory to clone, express and purify a region of HA-1H using an Escherichia coli expression system. The recombinant HA-1H protein was purified under denaturing conditions and the affinity purification tag removed using thrombin to remove non-specific amino acids. The 92 amino acid recombinant protein was characterised by mass spectrometry. Our rationale is that by using a recombinant HA-1H protein rather than peptide, HA-1H specific T cells may be generated from presentation of multiple HA-1H epitopes complexed in different HLA molecules. A multi-epitope approach may have wider applicability and maybe more effective at leukaemia control. The recombinant HA-1H protein may also be used as a research tool to identify novel CD4(+) helper T cell and CD8(+) cytotoxic T cell epitopes.","['Immunotherapy Research Group, Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Alfred Hospital, Melbourne, Australia. t.etto@alfred.org.au']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development of scaleable downstream processes allowing purification under mild conditions and yielding viral preparations with high titer, potency and purity is critical for the success of clinical trials and subsequent clinical use of this technology. METHODS: A purification process for murine leukaemia virus (MLV)-derived vector supernatants was developed based on membrane separation and anion-exchange chromatography (AEXc). Initial clarification of the vector stocks was performed using 0.45 microm membranes followed by concentration with 500 kDa molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membranes; further purification was performed by AEXc using a tentacle matrix bearing DEAE functional ligands. Finally, concentration/diafiltration was performed by 500 kDa MWCO membranes. To validate final product quality the process was scaled up 16-fold. RESULTS: Optimization of microfiltration membrane pore size and ultrafiltration transmembrane pressure allowed the recovery of nearly 100% infectious particles. Further purification of the RVs by AEXc resulted in high removal of protein contaminants while maintaining high recoveries of infectious vectors (77+/-11%). Up-scaling of the process resulted in high titer vector preparations, 3.2x10(8) infectious particles (IP)/ml (85-fold concentration), with an overall recovery reaching 26%. The process yielded vectors with transduction efficiencies higher than the starting material and more than 99% pure, relative to protein contamination. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of membrane separation and AEXc processes results in a feasible and scaleable purification strategy for MLV-derived vectors, allowing the removal of inhibitory contaminants thus yielding pure vectors with increased transduction efficiencies.","['ITQB/IBET, Av. da Republica (EAN), P-2781-901 Oeiras, Portugal.']",,,,,,,,"['Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,

The characterization of these chromosomal alterations was crucial to the discovery of the genes implicated in leukemogenesis, as the chromosomal breakpoints indicated their genomic localization. In addition, these molecular defects may serve as targets for diagnostic essays and can have a major prognostic value. Finally, the characterization of the deregulated cellular pathways potentially identifies targets for therapeutic intervention. In this paper we summarize our efforts to expand the current knowledge of the diagnostic, prognostic or biological significance of selected chromosomal aberrations identified in M-FISH studies. First, we illustrated the power of M-FISH in dissecting complex chromosomal aberrations in myeloid neoplasms. MLL amplification was defined as a clinical entity characterized by adverse prognosis and within the multitude and variety of chromosomal rearrangements a pattern of a limited number of cytogenetic subclasses was discerned. In leukemias characterized by 11q23 amplification, we described the amplicon and confirmed MLL, in addition to DDX6, as a principal amplification target. Molecular characterization of a large series of unselected sporadic and recurrent 3q26 rearranged leukemias confirmed the decisive role of ectopic EVI1 expression in these malignancies. We contributed to an extensive analysis of the phenotypical and prognostic features of T-ALL characterized by HOX11L2 expression and identified HOX11L2 overexpression as one of the most frequent genetic defects in childhood T-ALL, associated with intermediate prognosis. Finally, we designed and validated diagnostic tools for the detection of the t(9;14) (p13;q34) resulting in PAX5 overexpression and convincingly associated the presence of this rearrangement to high-grade morphology and karyotype complexity. In conclusion, the series of investigations presented here clearly illustrate the benefits of M-FISH as molecular tool for the dissection and characterization of complex and cryptic rearrangements. The subsequent reports demonstrate the utility of molecular cytogenetics and expression analyses to the clinical management of patients diagnosed with hematological malignancies.","['Centrum voor Medische Genetica, Faculteit Geneeskunde en Gezondheidswetenschappen, U.

Previous studies have been small, mostly investigated cancer mortality, and suggested increased risks for brain, bladder, testicular, prostate, thyroid and colo-rectal cancers, leukemia, and melanoma. METHODS: Records of all male cancers registered in California during 1988-2003 were obtained. Firefighters were identified from occupation and industry text fields. Logistic regression analysis used other cancers as controls. RESULTS: Of the 804,000 eligible records, 3,659 had firefighting as their occupation. Firefighting was associated with testicular cancer (odds ratio = 1.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.18-2.02), melanoma (1.50, 1.33-1.70), brain cancer (1.35, 1.06-1.72), esophageal cancer (1.48, 1.14-1.91), and prostate cancer (1.22, 1.12-1.33). CONCLUSIONS: Use of other-cancer controls and lack of an occupational history may have biased relative risks towards the null. However, this study, which contained more firefighter cancers than any previous epidemiologic study, produced evidence supporting some prior hypotheses.","['Division of Environmental Health Sciences, School of Public Health, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720-7360, USA. m_bates@berkeley.edu']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, SCT is also complicated by a high risk for treatment-related morbidity and mortality. The antileukemic effect of SCT is based on the radio-/chemotherapy applied for conditioning, as well as on the allogeneic immune reaction, mediated by immunocompetent donor cells, the graft-versus-leukemia effect. The latter effect is of particular importance in the context of reduced-intensity conditioning regimens, that have enabled us to offer allogeneic SCT to a by far bigger part of patients suffering from AML. The indication for allogeneic SCT is based on the patient's individual risk profile. Biological and clinical characteristics of the leukemia contribute to this risk profile, as do extraleukemic conditions such as age and comorbidity. Allogeneic SCT represents the standard of care for all patients with AML < 65 years of age, who are beyond first complete remission (CR) or who have failed to respond to induction chemotherapy. In first CR, allogeneic SCT is a standard for patients with unfavorable karyotype disease or other risk factors, whereas for patients without specific risk factors it is just an option, in particular within clinical trials. In patients with a favorable leukemic karyotype, allogeneic SCT is usually not performed in first CR. Future developments in the field include transplant strategies specifically designed for biological AML subgroups, as well as the integration of new drugs into transplant regimens.","['Einheit fur Stammzelltransplantation, II, Medizinische Klinik, Klinikum Augsburg, Augsburg.

This results in a replacement of healthy hematopoiesis and in pancytopenia with corresponding symptoms (anemia, thrombo- and granulocytopenia). Diagnosis can reliably be confirmed by bone marrow aspiration, which also allows risk stratification by cytogenetic and molecular analysis. Therapy of AML that should preferentially be performed in clinical studies comprises induction therapy for achievement of complete cytomorphological remission (CR) and postremission strategies consisting of consolidation and maintenance therapy for eradication of residual blasts. The backbone of polychemotherapy is cytarabine and anthracyclines. Different regimens exist that achieve CR rates of 60-80%. As a consequence, pancytopenias up to 6 weeks will be experienced, that will lead to specific problems such as infections by atypical pathogens. To date, induction therapy will be performed independently of the individual risk constellation (with the exception of acute promyelocytic leukemia); however, postremission therapy is highly dependent on individual risk stratification. Besides conventional strategies, allogeneic stem cell transplantation has to be considered in certain risk groups depending on the availability of a matched donor.

As a consequence, immature leukemic cells that have the ability to divide and proliferate, but lack normal differentiation mechanisms, accumulate in the bone marrow. This, in turn, leads to a severe impairment of normal hematopoiesis.

Epub 2007 Apr 11.,"The effect of valproic acid (VA) on protein expression in human T-lymphocytic leukemia cells MOLT-4 was studied. VA is an inhibitor of histonedeacetylases and has a potential use as antitumor agent in leukemia treatment. The authors in this work prove that 4 h long incubation with 2 mmol/l VA causes phosphorylation of histone H2A.X and its colocalization with 53BP1 in nuclear foci. Their co-localization is typical for DSB signaling machinery. These foci were detected in cells after 4 h exposure without increase of Annexin V positive apoptotic cells. Slight increase in apoptosis (Annexin V positivity) after 24 h is accompanied by more intensive increase in phosphorylation of H2A.X and also by formation of nuclear foci containing gammaH2A.X and 53BP1. Treatment of cells with 2 mmol/l VA resulted in induction of apoptosis affecting about 30% of cells after incubation for 72 h. The changes in protein expression were examined after cell incubation with 2 mmol/l VA for 4 h. Proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and quantified using image evaluation system. Those exhibiting significant VA-induced abundance alterations were identified by mass spectrometry. Changes in expression of 22 proteins were detected, of which 15 proteins were down-regulated. Proteomic analysis resulted in successful identification of three proteins involving alfa-tubulin 3, tubulin-specific chaperone and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucloprotein F. Expression of seven proteins was up-regulated, including heterogeneous nuclear ribonucloprotein A/B. Identified proteins are related to microtubular system and hnRNP family. Suppression of microtubular proteins and changes of balance among hnRNPs can contribute to proliferation arrest and apoptosis induction.","['Department of Radiobiology and Department of Molecular Pathology, School of Military Health Sciences Hradec Kralove, University of Defense Brno, Trebesska 1575, 500 01, Hradec Kralove, Czech Republic. vavrova@pmfhk.cz']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OBJECTIVE: To determine if rib anomalies are present in pediatric malignancies in the United States. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Scoliosis surgeons view radiographs of the entire spine, counting the number of ribs. A European study noted that rib anomalies were more common in certain malignancies. We wished to determine if this is also true in the United States. If so, the potential for screening, early detection of malignancy, and a better understanding of tumor biology is possible. METHODS: A retrospective review of 218 children with malignancy and a control group of 200 children with polytrauma or suspected child abuse was performed. Chest radiographs were reviewed to determine the number of ribs, and the presence of rib anomalies. 24 ribs was considered normal, <24 or >24 was considered abnormal. P < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: The average age was 6.8 +/- 5.5 years and number of ribs was 23.8 +/- 0.6. Rib number was normal in 86.8%. There were significant differences between the malignancy and control groups in age (control, 5.7 +/- 5.1 years; malignancy, 7.8 +/- 5.7 years, P = 0.00007), rib number (control, 23.9 +/- 0.5; malignancy, 23.7 +/- 0.7, P = 0.001), and normal/abnormal rib counts (control, 92% normal; malignancy, 82% normal, P = 0.003). In the malignant group, 50% had a lymphoproliferative malignancy, 33% a solid tumor, and 17.0% a neural tumor. Neural malignancies had a higher incidence of rib abnormalities compared with lymphoproliferative or solid malignancies (P = 0.01). Relative to the control group, those with a neural and lymphoproliferative malignancy were 6.23 (95% CI, 2.7-14.5) and 2.0 (95% CI, 1.0-4.1) times more likely to have an abnormal rib count. CONCLUSIONS: Homeobox genes, important in vertebral and rib sequencing, are abnormally expressed in many different malignancies. This association is a question of great interest. What is the potential for rib number being used as a predictor of childhood malignancy? Can these findings be expanded to adults? These questions require further research. The association noted in this study is interesting but should not yet be used to alarm parents regarding an increased risk of malignancy in their children.","[""James Whitcomb Riley Children's Hospital, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. rloder@iupui.edu""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N-(2-ethoxyethyl)gambogamide (NG-18), a derivative of GA, also efficiently inhibits proliferation of cultured human tumor cells. The inhibition effect of NG-18 is associated with its ability to induce apoptosis. In the present study, NG-18 markedly induced leukemia HL-60 cells apoptosis, and the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways were activated almost at the same time. NG-18-induced tumor cell apoptosis was associated with up-regulation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax, and downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. The NG-18-induced apoptosis was blocked completely by a pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, indicating that caspases were functionally and actively involved in this process. The specific inhibition of caspase-8 activity using Z-IETD-FMK significantly blocked NG-18-induced apoptosis. In contrast, inhibition of other initiator caspases, caspase-2 or -9, using Z-VDVAD-FMK or Z-LEHD-FMK respectively had no effect on NG-18-induced apoptosis. Altogether, our data demonstrated that NG-18-induced apoptosis was dependent on caspases and caspase-8 acted as a key executor in the event.","['College of Chemistry and Life, Zhejiang Normal University, Jinhua Zhejiang, PR China.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No difference was observed between PI3K (+) and PI3K (-) groups concerning age, sex, white blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, bone marrow blast cells, French-American-British (FAB) classification, cytogenetics, RAS or nucleophosmin (NPM) mutations.

Positive cat sera recognized patterns of polypeptides in WB, including L. infantum-specific antigenic fractions. There was no association with retroviruses. Leishmania-specific antibodies are prevalent in cats living in ecoregions around the Northwestern Mediterranean basin; thus, leishmaniasis must be included in the differential diagnosis of diseases in cats living in these ecoregions.

Epub 2007 Apr 10.,"The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of retroviruses contain structured replication motifs that impose barriers to efficient ribosome scanning. Two RNA structural motifs that facilitate efficient translation initiation despite a complex 5' UTR are internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and 5' proximal post-transcriptional control element (PCE). Here, stringent RNA and protein analyses determined the 5' UTR of spleen necrosis virus (SNV), reticuloendotheliosis virus A (REV-A) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) exhibit PCE activity, but not IRES activity. Assessment of SNV translation initiation in the natural context of the provirus determined that SNV is reliant on a cap-dependent initiation mechanism. Experiments with siRNAs identified that REV-A and HTLV-1 PCE modulate post-transcriptional gene expression through interaction with host RNA helicase A (RHA). Analysis of hybrid SNV/HTLV-1 proviruses determined SNV PCE facilitates Rex/Rex responsive element-independent Gag production and interaction with RHA is necessary. Ribosomal profile analyses determined that RHA is necessary for polysome association of HTLV-1 gag and provide direct evidence that RHA is necessary for efficient HTLV-1 replication. We conclude that PCE/RHA is an important translation regulatory axis of multiple lymphotropic retroviruses. We speculate divergent retroviruses have evolved a convergent RNA-protein interaction to modulate translation of their highly structured mRNA.","['Center for Retrovirus Research, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210-1093, USA.']","['P01 CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA016058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA16058/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA100730/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC1885656,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 91 patients participated. GVD was administered on days 1 and 8 every 21 days at doses of G 1000 mg/m(2), V 20 mg/m(2), and D 15 mg/m(2) for transplant-naive patients, and G 800 mg/m(2), V 15 mg/m(2), and D 10 mg/m(2) for post-transplant patients. RESULTS: The dose-limiting toxicity was mucositis for the transplant-naive patients and febrile neutropenia for post-transplant patients. The overall response rate (RR) for all patients was 70% [95% confidence interval (CI) 59.8, 79.7], with 19% complete remissions. The 4-year event-free and overall survival rates in transplant-naive patients treated with GVD followed by autologous transplant were 52% (95% CI 0.34, 0.68) and 70% (95% CI 0.49, 0.84), and in the patients in whom prior transplant failed, these were 10% (95% CI 0.03, 0.22) and 34% (95% CI 0.17, 0.52), respectively.

There are clearly linked single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of the glutathione S-transferase A1 gene (i.e., GSTA1*A, -567T, -69C and -52G; GSTA1*B, -567G, -69T and -52A). We assessed whether the clinical outcomes, including acute graft-vs.-host disease, of 61 patients with hematological malignancies, following HLA-matched sibling allogeneic stem cell transplantation using busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning are altered by glutathione S-transferase A1 genotypes. Globally, grade II-IV acute graft-vs.-host disease developed in 13 patients (21%). Grade II-IV acute graft-vs.-host disease developed in 15.2% of 46 patients with GSTA1*A/*A diplotype and in 40.0% of 15 patients with GSTA1*A/*B or GSTA1*B/*B diplotype (p = 0.04). Moreover, this relationship between GSTA1*A/*A diplotypes and lower incidence of acute graft-vs.-host disease was independent of the age, gender, stem cell source, and disease status. The incidences of acute skin graft-vs.-host disease were 7% (3/46) in patients with GSTA1*A/*A and 27% (4/15) in patients without GSTA1*A/*A (p = 0.009, univariate; p = 0.01, multivariate). Acute hepatic graft-vs.-host disease developed in 6 (13%) of 46 patients with the GSTA1*A/*A diplotype and in 4 (27%) of 15 patients without this diplotype (p = 0.09, univariate; p = 0.12, multivariate). Ten patients (16%) developed hepatic veno-occlusive disease. No significant difference was found in the incidence of hepatic veno-occlusive disease between patients with and without the GSTA1*A/*A diplotype (19.6% vs. 6.7%; p = 0.24). We conclude that the GSTA1*A/*A diplotype is an independent protective factor against acute graft-vs.-host disease, especially for skin graft-vs.-host disease, and probably for hepatic graft-vs.-host disease, in patients using busulfan/cyclophosphamide conditioning. The identification of glutathione S-transferase A1 genotypes prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation could allow conditioning regimens and graft-vs.-host disease prophylaxis to be modified to improve outcome.","['Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This descriptive study covered the whole of the articles indexed in ""Medline"" between 2000 and 2003. We retained the medical papers whose author's address was a Tunisian health structure of either medical care or education with the first and / or the last author was a Tunisian doctor. The social relevance of the publications was measured by the agreement level of their content, studies through the ""Major Essential Key Words"" with the death causes and the morbidity global charge components, made by the World Health Organisation in its ""report about the health in the world"" in 2003. A ""Major Essential Key Word"" is a word chosen among the word's list ""MeSH Major Topic"" proposed by the bibliographic notice of Medline's database to summarize the essential topic of the article. RESULTS: The 1248 articles eligible to this study, have been indexed in ""Medline"" by ""MeSH Major Topic"" words using 3471 indexation lines. Among the ""Top 20"" list of the ""Major Essential Key Words"" only 9 themes were concordant with the community health needs, including four in relation with the epidemiologic ""pre transition"" epidemiology (tuberculosis, pregnancy complications, lung diseases, anemia) and five in connection with the epidemiologic ""post transition"" epidemiology (diabetes mellitus, breast neoplasms, leukemia, cardiovascular diseases, multiple myeloma). CONCLUSION: What emerges from this study is that medical research in Tunisia isn't concordant enough with the country epidemiologic priorities and public health national programs . The social relevance should be the principal selection criterion in the public financing of the research projects.","['Faculte de Medecine Ibn El Jazzar -de Sousse, Tunisie.']",,,,,,,"Profil bibliometrique des publications medicales tunisiennes indexees dans ""Medline"" de 2000 a 2003 partie 2 : pertinence sociale.",,,,,,,,

The alternative approach of basing them on the health status of the embryos themselves has been blocked by the lack of scientific information about the potential of the early embryo to transmit agents of infectious disease. Consequently, most research into infectious disease transmission by embryos has had the objective of assessing the potential of the embryo to transmit infectious disease, at the stage of development at which it is transferred commercially, with the thought in mind that, for some diseases, it may be possible in the future to focus on the embryo rather than the donor when drawing up health requirements for import permits. Results from experiments involving the bovine leukemia virus, bluetongue virus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus, foot and mouth disease virus and Brucella abortus are encouraging to the point where, with the exception of foot and mouth disease virus, they could and should be put to the test in field studies. Research on several other bovine pathogens is underway, but the studies are not sufficiently advanced for a judgement to be made on the potential of embryos to transmit them.
