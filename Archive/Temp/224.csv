These models were used to study the therapeutic effect of rat-anti-human CD52 (Campath-1G) or CD45 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on systemically disseminated tumor cells and on tumor cells present in solid tumor masses. Both mAbs were effective in inhibiting growth of systemically disseminated malignant cells. When treatment with anti-CD52 or anti-CD45 mAbs at a dose of 30 micrograms/mouse/d for 4 days was started 24 hours after intravenous inoculation of human DoHH2 or BEVA cells, a 3-log kill of tumor cells was observed as measured by prolonged survival. After treatment, surviving animals injected with high numbers of BEVA cells showed tumor masses in liver, kidney, and mesenteric lymph nodes. In contrast to nontreated animals, however, only low numbers of malignant cells were found in peripheral blood, and bone marrow was free of tumor cells. Similarly, after mAb treatment of mice inoculated subcutaneously (sc) with DoHH2 cells, no tumor cells could be found in the bone marrow, and few DoHH2 cells could be detected in the peripheral blood, spleen, liver, kidney, or lung. In contrast, tumor cells present in subcutaneous tumors and axillary lymph nodes were relatively unaffected by mAb therapy. The presence of rat immunoglobulin (Ig) could be demonstrated on surviving tumor cells. The presence of murine macrophages in areas in these tumors that were depleted of DoHH2 cells suggested that the mAb-mediated antitumor effect observed in the Scid mouse model is mediated by cellular mechanisms. Apparently these mechanisms were not sufficient to eliminate the fast-growing tumor cells present in the protected sites. Our results indicate that treatment with anti-CD52 or anti-CD45 mAbs potentially may be useful as adjuvant immunotherapy for systemically disseminated B cell lymphoma.","['de Kroon, J F', 'de Paus, R A', 'Kluin-Nelemans, H C', 'Kluin, P M', 'van Bergen, C A', 'Munro, A J', 'Hale, G', 'Willemze, R', 'Falkenburg, J H']","['de Kroon JF', 'de Paus RA', 'Kluin-Nelemans HC', 'Kluin PM', 'van Bergen CA', 'Munro AJ', 'Hale G', 'Willemze R', 'Falkenburg JH']","['Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Department of Hematology, Leiden University Hospital, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD52 Antigen)', '0 (CD52 protein, human)', '0 (Cd52 protein, rat)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', 'EC 3.1.3.48 (Leukocyte Common Antigens)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'CD52 Antigen', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukocyte Common Antigens/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Rats', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Jul;24(8):919-26.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two new parameters were extracted from the cell-cycle profiles: the nucleic acid index of S phase (NI) and the coefficient of variations in the RNA at S phase (SVC). DNA/RNA dot plots of cell lines revealed four characteristic profiles of the cell cycle, defined with the calculated NI and SCV. These were type 0 (small NI, large SCV), type I (small NI, small SCV), type II (large NI, small SCV), and type III (large NI, large SCV). Type O included four stem cell lines: one t(1;19) leukemia, two Ph1+ acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and one biphenotypic crisis of chronic granulocytic leukemia (CGL). Type I included five ALL cell lines: three T-ALL and two common B-ALL. Type II contained 10 myeloid cell lines: five AML and five myeloid crisis of CGL. Type III contained three relatively immature lymphoma cell lines: two Burkitt's lymphoma and one follicular center lymphoma. Calculated NI/SCV (%) were as follows: type 0, 2.27 +/- 0.19/16.7 +/- 3.7; type I, 2.20 +/- 0.30/11.1 +/- 0.7; type II, 3.64 +/- 0.52/11.8 +/- 1.0; and type III, 3.60 +/- 0.53/17.5 +/- 1.9.

We have investigated whether SLE is in any way associated with exogenous HTLV-I. Using enzyme immunoassay (EIA), we found no seroreactivity against HTLV-I antigens in any of 24 SLE patients under investigation. Using a radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA), there was also no expression of retroviral tax-protein demonstrable in 24 individuals with SLE. DNA preparations of peripheral blood cells, as well as isolated CD4- and CD8-positive cells, were examined for HTLV-I sequences (pol-, env-, gag-, LTR- and tax-region) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We were unable to demonstrate any specific HTLV-I PCR products in SLE specimens. Our data suggest that exogenous HTLV-I is not involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem disease of unknown cause characterized by B-cell hyperactivity with hypergammaglobulinaemia and the formation of pathogenic autoantibodies. Patients may also show altered suppressor/helper T-cell ratios. Abnormalities in T-cell function include T-cell lymphopenia, expression of activation antigens and alteration of responses to mitogens and lymphokines. Human retroviruses are known to cause immune aberrations, such as diminished T-cell function and polyclonal B-cell stimulation, which are observed in patients with leukaemias, lymphomas and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Human T-cell lymphotropic/leukaemia (HTLV-I) is aetiologically linked with adult virus type I T-cell leukaemia (ATL) and tropical spastic paraparesis. A common feature of the HTLV family is an LTR encoded protein (tax protein, p40tax) which triggers viral protein production in the early stages of a retroviral infection. Detection of p40tax may indicate transcriptional activity of a provirus. Several investigators have examined the possible involvement of HTLV-I in SLE and have produced conflicting results, especially so far as seroreactivity against HTLV-I antigens is concerned. The discovery of HTLV-I like particles in murine lupus might also indicate an important role of exogenous viruses in SLE. Olsen and colleagues describe a high seropositivity to anti-HTLV-I- and anti-HTLV-III antibodies and evidence of viral replication in patients with SLE. Lin et al. also demonstrated anti-HTLV-I antibodies in SLE patients. However, other authors failed to detect anti-HTLV-I antibodies, proviral structures or viral transcripts in SLE. We investigated whether or not there are any indications of the presence of the exogenous retrovirus, HTLV-I, in patients with SLE, at immunological and genetic levels. We found neither immunological nor molecular biological evidence for the existence of HTLV-I in SLE patients. There were some weak suggestions of the presence of possibly endogenous retroviral sequences.","['Lipka, K', 'Tebbe, B', 'Finckh, U', 'Rolfs, A']","['Lipka K', 'Tebbe B', 'Finckh U', 'Rolfs A']","['Neurochemical Research Laboratory, Free University of Berlin.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Dermatol,Clinical and experimental dermatology,7606847,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Cells/virology', 'DNA', 'Female', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*virology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Radioimmunoprecipitation Assay', 'Viral Proteins/blood']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Dermatol. 1996 Jan;21(1):38-42.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA encoding the engineered aequorins have been inserted into a replication deficient adenovirus (Ad) type 5 E1-vector, under control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) major immediate early promoter. The Ad vector provides a simple and efficient method to express the photoproteins in a wide variety of mammalian cell types. Efficient targeting of the photoproteins to the appropriate cellular compartment was established immunocytochemically in COS7 cells, where it was expressed in up to 100% of the target population. Levels of expression could be controlled by virus dose and chemical agents which affect the activity of the CMV promoter. In HeLa cells expressing nuclear targeted aequorin or cytosolic aequorin, ATP or histamine induced immediate biphasic elevations of both nuclear and cytosolic [Ca2+]; subsequent challenge with agonist evoked similar responses. In addition to epithelial type adherent cell lines (COS7 and HeLa), aequorin expression was also readily detected in non-adherent cells of myeloid lineage (K562 and HL60) and non-adherent primary cells polymorphonuclear leucocytes (neutrophils).

The aim of the study was an effort to decrease the incidence of relapses in patients transplanted for chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) by different conditioning regimens. METHODS AND RESULTS: 28 patients with CML who underwent allogeneic bone marrow transplantation with grafts depleted of 98% of lymphocytes were divided into two groups according to the conditioning regimen used. Patients in group 1 were conditioned without anthracyclines, and patients in group 2 were conditioned with the addition of anthracyclines. Bone marrow samples taken 6 and 12 months after BMT, and annually thereafter, were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for residual disease. Median time of bone marrow sampling and medium number of samples analyzed did not differ significantly between two groups of patients. In group 1, consisting of 11 patients, 40% of samples were negative, and in group 2 with 17 patients, PCR was negative in 79% of samples.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with t(15;17), RAR alpha, and 17qter probes and with chromosome 1, 15, and 17 paints demonstrated that the der(17) consisted of a complex rearrangement with duplication of both RAR alpha and PML, insertion of chromosome 1 sequences, and double insertion of chromosome 15 sequences.

The patient reported here, a 71-year-old man, presented with tetrasomy 8 as the sole chromosome abnormality associated with an acute nonlymphocytic leukemia of the M2 type. He failed to respond to chemotherapy and died one year after diagnosis. Following conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with a centromeric probe specific for chromosome 8, tetrasomy 8 was detected in 61% of the metaphases analyzed and trisomy 8 in 39%. FISH analysis of interphase nuclei confirmed the existence of tetrasomic (35%) and trisomic cells (56%) and revealed a number of cells with two chromosomes 8 (8%). This normal population may represent lymphocytes or myeloid cells that escaped conventional analysis due to their inability to divide or to the small number of metaphases available. The relatively higher proportion of tetrasomic cells in metaphase compared with interphase may be attributed to a proliferative advantage of tetrasomic cells in vitro or to the longer duration of their cell cycle. The simultaneous presence of trisomic and tetrasomic cells confirms the hypothesis of a clonal relationship between trisomy 8 and tetrasomy 8. Our case brings further evidence to the specificity of tetrasomy 8 to myeloid disorders and to the association of this chromosome abnormality with a relatively poor prognosis. However, new patients must be studied to further delineate this cytogenetic entity.","['Muhlematter, D', 'Castagne, C', 'Bruzzese, O', 'Clement, F', 'Schmidt, P M', 'Bellomo, M J']","['Muhlematter D', 'Castagne C', 'Bruzzese O', 'Clement F', 'Schmidt PM', 'Bellomo MJ']","['Division Autonome de Genetique Medicale, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois CHUV, Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['Aged', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Metaphase']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 Jul 1;89(1):44-8. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(95)00343-6.,,"['0165460895003436 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(95)00343-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify the signal transduction mechanisms of chemokine-induced actin response, undifferentiated human leukemia cells (HL-60 cells) constitutively expressing G alpha 16-, G alpha i2- and G alpha i3-proteins were chosen for reconstitution studies. Expression of recombinant receptors after transfection of the cells with the cDNA of IL-8R alpha and beta was confirmed by binding studies with radiolabeled ligands. IL-8R alpha bound IL-8 with high affinity (Kd approximately 1 nM) and GRO alpha with low affinity (Kd approximately 1 microM), whereas IL-8R beta bound both IL-8 and GRO alpha with high affinity (Kd approximately 1nM). Flow cytometric actin measurements indicated that high affinity ligand-receptor interactions in both receptor transfectants displayed inducible responses. Pretreatment of transfectants with pertussis toxin caused ADP-ribosylation of G-proteins and blocked chemokine-induced polymerization, indicating involvement of G alpha i2- or G alpha i3-proteins, but not G alpha 16-proteins in this response.","['Norgauer, J', 'Metzner, B', 'Czech, W', 'Schraufstatter, I']","['Norgauer J', 'Metzner B', 'Czech W', 'Schraufstatter I']","['Department of Dermatology, University of Freiburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Inflamm Res,Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

Patients at highest risk appear to be those with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Blast cell aggregation and thrombus formation in the microvasculature most commonly involves the central nervous system and the pulmonary circulation. We describe a child with AML and renal venous thrombosis (RVT), a previously unreported complication of hyperleukocytosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A 17-month-old boy had a white blood cell count of 103 X 10(9) cells/L and RVT (hematuria, arterial systolic hypertension, unilateral nephromegaly, poor renal venous blood flow) at diagnosis of acute myelomonocytic leukemia (AML, FAB M4). CONCLUSION: This case emphasizes the danger of hyperleukocytosis in AML and demonstrates that there may be other organ system dysfunction in addition to the well-described central nervous system and pulmonary complications. Renal venous thrombosis should be considered in the patient with leukemic hyperleukocytosis, hematuria, arterial hypertension, and appropriate radiographic findings. Aggressive cytoreductive measures should be pursued in such cases.","['Murray, J C', 'Dorfman, S R', 'Brandt, M L', 'Dreyer, Z E']","['Murray JC', 'Dorfman SR', 'Brandt ML', 'Dreyer ZE']","[""Section of Hematology-Oncology, Texas Children's Cancer Center, Houston, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Atrophy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukocytosis/*complications', 'Male', '*Renal Veins', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Thrombosis/*complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed', 'Ultrasonography, Doppler']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1996 Aug;18(3):327-30. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199608000-00022.,,['10.1097/00043426-199608000-00022 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because of this, the entity is often misdiagnosed. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two boys with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) who presented with muscle pain, shortly after receiving induction chemotherapy, were evaluated. RESULTS: Presenting physical examination and laboratory findings were unremarkable except for extremity pain and tenderness. These symptoms were initially attributed to a neurotoxic side effect of vincristine. As the children's symptoms progressed, muscle abscess formation was finally delineated by gallium and computed tomography scans, and the diagnosis of pyomyositis was made. In both cases, the invading organism was Staphylococcus aureus. Both children responded well to incision and drainage of the abscesses and antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: Four cases of pyomyositis occurring in ALL patients shortly after induction chemotherapy have now been described. We feel that when children from this population present with muscle pain, pyomyositis should be part of the differential diagnosis. With early medical and surgical intervention, morbidity and mortality can be avoided.","['Corden, T E', 'Morgan, E R']","['Corden TE', 'Morgan ER']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Strong Children's Medical Center, Rochester, New York 14642-8667, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,9505928,"['0 (Penicillins)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'UH95VD7V76 (Oxacillin)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Abscess/etiology/*therapy', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/*therapy', 'Child', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Therapy, Combination/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Muscular Diseases/etiology/*therapy', 'Oxacillin/*therapeutic use', 'Pain', 'Penicillins/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Staphylococcal Infections/drug therapy/etiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1996 Aug;18(3):323-6. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199608000-00021.,,['10.1097/00043426-199608000-00021 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, overdose is a well reported complication of this therapy. We report a fatal event secondary to intrathecal leucovorin. PATIENTS, METHODS, AND RESULTS: An 11-year-old boy with a 6-month history of treatment of acute lymphocytic leukemia received an ""overdose"" of 20 mg of intrathecal methotrexate. He was treated with intrathecal leucovorin and subsequently experienced severe neurotoxicity and died. This was attributed to the use of intrathecal leucovorin, the first such case reported in the medical literature. CONCLUSION: A review of the literature indicates that a careful definition of overdose needs to be applied in cases of intrathecal methotrexate: those <100 mg need less intervention, >500 mg will not respond to any intervention, and the middle group, 100-500 mg, can be treated with a variety of approaches, which are outlined. The standard treatment includes the use of ventriculolumbar washout, CSF exchange, or intravenous pharmacotherapy with leucovorin. Recently, the use of carboxypeptidase has been under investigation. All clinicians who administer intrathecal medications should be aware of these complications and the appropriate treatments of them (including rescue).

We show that treatment of pluripotent ES cells with retinoic acid (RA) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) induce differentiation of these cells into highly enriched populations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) expressing neurons and skeletal myoblasts, respectively. For neuronal differentiation, RA alone is sufficient to induce ES cells to differentiate into neuronal cells that show properties of postmitotic neurons both in vitro and in vivo. In vivo function of RA-induced neuronal cells was demonstrated by transplantation into the quinolinic acid lesioned striatum of rats (a rat model for Huntington's disease), where cells integrated and survived for up to 6 wk. The response of embryonic stem cells to DMSO to form muscle was less dramatic than that observed for RA. DMSO-induced ES cells formed mixed populations of muscle cells composed of cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle instead of homogeneous populations of a single muscle cell type. To determine whether the response of ES cells to DMSO induction could be further controlled, ES cells were stably transfected with a gene coding for the muscle-specific regulatory factor, MyoD. When induced with DMSO, ES cells constitutively expressing high levels of MyoD differentiated exclusively into skeletal myoblasts (no cardiac or smooth muscle cells) that fused to form myotubes capable of spontaneous contraction.

The incidence of isolated laryngeal candidiasis (ILC) is low, although it may be underestimated. We describe 2 patients with ILC confirmed during autopsy: a 45-years-old male with pulmonary fibrosis and a 4-years-old girl with acute myeloblastic leukemia. Hoarseness and dysphagia are the most common symptoms of ILC. The most effective diagnostic technique is laryngoscopy with specimen culture and/or histopathology. Specimens usually show whitish plaques on the larynx. Most ILC patients have some associated disease and/or predisposing factors, with frequent antibiotic treatment prior to the advent of candidiasis. Intravenous amphotericin B provides the most effective therapy, although other antimycotics are also useful. Early diagnosis and initiation of therapy curtail the disease and can prevent systemic dissemination.","['Alba, D', 'Perna, C', 'Molina, F', 'Ortega, L', 'Varquez, J J']","['Alba D', 'Perna C', 'Molina F', 'Ortega L', 'Varquez JJ']","['Departamentos de Medicina Interna, Hospital La Paz, Madrid.']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Arch Bronconeumol,Archivos de bronconeumologia,0354720,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amphotericin B/therapeutic use', 'Antifungal Agents/therapeutic use', '*Candidiasis/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Laryngeal Diseases/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Laryngoscopy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Bronconeumol. 1996 Apr;32(4):205-8. doi: 10.1016/s0300-2896(15)30789-4.,,"['S0300-2896(15)30789-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0300-2896(15)30789-4 [doi]']",,,Candidiasis laringea aislada.

The production of LTC4 and LTB4 stimulated by the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 was measured in RBL-1 cells by high-performance liquid chromatography. Honokiol inhibited the production of LTC4 and LTB4 stimulated by A23187 in RBL-1 cells. Honokiol did not inhibit either phospholipase A2 activity, measured by the release of 3H-arachidonic acid (AA), or LTC4 synthase and LTA4 hydrolase activities, measured with LTA4-free acid as substrate. The synthesis of LTC4 and LTB4 from AA in RBL-1 cell lysates in the presence of Ca2+ was inhibited by honokiol. These results indicate that honokiol blocks LT synthesis by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase activity. Honokiol also inhibited immunoglobulin E-mediated production of these LTs in RBL-2H3 cells, which was measured by a specific radioimmunoassay (RIA). These results suggest that honokiol may exhibit antiallergic actions by inhibiting LT synthesis in immediate-type hyperreactivity.","['Hamasaki, Y', 'Muro, E', 'Miyanji, S', 'Yamamoto, S', 'Kobayashi, I', 'Sato, R', 'Zaitu, M', 'Matsuo, M', 'Ichimaru, T', 'Tasaki, H', 'Miyazaki, S']","['Hamasaki Y', 'Muro E', 'Miyanji S', 'Yamamoto S', 'Kobayashi I', 'Sato R', 'Zaitu M', 'Matsuo M', 'Ichimaru T', 'Tasaki H', 'Miyazaki S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Saga Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Int Arch Allergy Immunol,International archives of allergy and immunology,9211652,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Leukotriene Antagonists)', '0 (Leukotrienes)', '0 (Lignans)', '11513CCO0N (honokiol)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/enzymology/*metabolism', '*Leukotriene Antagonists', 'Leukotrienes/*biosynthesis', '*Lignans', 'Rats', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int Arch Allergy Immunol. 1996 Jul;110(3):278-81. doi: 10.1159/000237299.,,['10.1159/000237299 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of structural DNA sequences encoding MHC class II proteins was performed by Southern blot with DNA isolated from both the original LB tumour and LBC cell line, digested with EcoRI, BamHI and HindIII and hybridised with specific probes for I-A alpha d and I-A beta d chains. Similar patterns were obtained for LB, LBC and normal BALB/c lymphocytes. In vitro treatment with IFN-gamma (20 - 1000 IU ml-1) failed to induce the expression of MHC class II antigens in LBC cell line. LBC cells were tri-transfected by a liposome-mediated protocol with I-A alpha d, I-A beta d genes and pSV2neo. Cells were selected for growth in medium containing Geneticin (G418). Surviving transfectants were cloned and three I-A+ clones were obtained after 20 days (LBCT cells). Syngeneic mice inoculated with 1.0 x 10(3) LBCT (I-A+) cells failed to develop a tumour, whereas the DT50 of mice injected with 1.0 x 10(6) LBCT cells was three times the value for mice injected with LBC cells (I-A-). Furthermore, specific CTL response against tumour cells was significantly enhanced upon priming with irradiated LBC-transfected cells (27 +/- 2%) compared with irradiated LBC cells (15 +/- 1.5%) in a 4 h 51Cr-release assay. It is suggested that neoexpression of MHC class II molecules enhances anti-tumour response by transforming tumour cells into professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which may be used to improve tumour-specific immunity in the autologous host.","['Mongini, C', 'Sanchez Lockhart, M', 'Waldner, C I', 'Alvarez, E M', 'Gravisaco, M J', 'Roig, M I', 'Hajos, S E']","['Mongini C', 'Sanchez Lockhart M', 'Waldner CI', 'Alvarez EM', 'Gravisaco MJ', 'Roig MI', 'Hajos SE']","['Catedra de Immunologia, Facultad de Farmacia y Bioquimica, Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/biosynthesis/*genetics/*immunology', '*Immunotherapy', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacology', 'Interferon-beta/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Jul;74(2):258-63. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.348.,,['10.1038/bjc.1996.348 [doi]'],,,,PMC2074574,,,,,,,,,,,

Two temporally separate peaks of concomitant resistance were detected during tumour development. The first one was exhibited only by small immunogenic tumours; it was tumour specific and mediated by classical immunological T-cell-dependent mechanisms. The second peak was shared by both immunogenic and non-immunogenic large tumours; it was non-specific, thymus independent and correlated with the activity of a serum factor (neither antibody nor complement) that inhibited the in vitro proliferation of tumour cells. This factor was eluted from a Sephadex G-15 column at fractions corresponding to a molecular weight of approximately 1000 Da and it was recovered from a high-performance liquid chromatography column in one peak presenting maximum absorption at 215 and 266 nm. The data presented in this paper suggest for the first time, to our knowledge, that in spite of the differences between immunogenic and non-immunogenic tumours, a common serum-mediated mechanism seems to underlie the concomitant resistance induced by both types of tumours at late stages of tumour development.","['Franco, M', 'Bustuoabad, O D', 'di Gianni, P D', 'Goldman, A', 'Pasqualini, C D', 'Ruggiero, R A']","['Franco M', 'Bustuoabad OD', 'di Gianni PD', 'Goldman A', 'Pasqualini CD', 'Ruggiero RA']","['Division Medicina Experimental, Academia Nacional de Medicina, Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/blood/immunology/therapy', 'Animals', 'Antibody Formation/immunology', 'Female', 'Fibrosarcoma/blood/immunology/therapy', 'Immunity, Cellular/immunology', 'Immunity, Innate', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Mammary Neoplasms, Experimental/blood/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*blood/*immunology/therapy', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1996 Jul;74(2):178-86. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1996.335.,,['10.1038/bjc.1996.335 [doi]'],,,,PMC2074564,,,,,,,,,,,

These results show that DMBA induces a specific N-ras mutation soon after one DMBA injection and that this mutation is probably the first event in DMBA leukemogenesis.","['Osaka, M', 'Matsuo, S', 'Koh, T', 'Sugiyama, T']","['Osaka M', 'Matsuo S', 'Koh T', 'Sugiyama T']","['Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)']",IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Genes, ras', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Point Mutation', 'Preleukemia/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Time Factors']",1996/07/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 1996 Jul;16(3):126-31. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1098-2744(199607)16:3<126::AID-MC2>3.0.CO;2-F.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1098-2744(199607)16:3<126::AID-MC2>3.0.CO;2-F [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1098-2744(199607)16:3<126::AID-MC2>3.0.CO;2-F [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, the most likely cause of cochleovestibular lesions in the chronic phase of the chronic myeloid leukemia seems to be disturbed microvascular perfusion and vascular occlusion. CASE REPORT: A 45-year old patient with a chronic myeloid leukemia presented with the sudden onset of profound deafness in his right ear combined with a total loss of vestibular function on the same side. The hemoglobin count was 10.5 g/dl; the white blood cell count 448 x 10(9)/I; the platelet count 71 x 10(9)/I. All of the plasmatic coagulation factors were in the normal range. The patient was treated with cytostatic drugs and responded well (rapid cytoreduction), but the deafness persisted. DISCUSSION: Cochleovestibular lesions in the chronic phase of the chronic myeloid leukemia are very rare. The most likely cause in the case described above seems to be increased blood viscosity due to the high white cell count and alterations in the leukocyte rheology (leukostasis syndrome). CONCLUSION: In patients with leukemia and acute cochleovestibular lesions in contrast to other patients with sudden deafness and/or sudden loss of peripheral vestibular function, a combination of chemotherapy and leukopheresis capable of rapid cytoreduction is necessary, whereas a conventional hemorrheologic therapy seems to be insufficient.","['Woldag, K', 'Schwarzer, A']","['Woldag K', 'Schwarzer A']",['Klinik und Poliklinik fur Hals-Nasen-Ohren-Heilkunde der Universitat Leipzig.'],['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Laryngorhinootologie,Laryngo- rhino- otologie,8912371,,IM,"['Cerebrovascular Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Ear, Inner/*blood supply', 'Hearing Loss, Sudden/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Meniere Disease/etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Tinnitus/etiology', 'Vestibular Function Tests']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Laryngorhinootologie. 1996 Apr;75(4):247-9. doi: 10.1055/s-2007-997570.,,['10.1055/s-2007-997570 [doi]'],,,Chronische myeloische Leukamie--eine seltene Ursache fur den Labyrinthapoplex.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon analysis of cytotoxicity results from the sixty tumor cell lines used in this screen, the COMPARE program predicted that NSC 665564 was likely to have the same mechanism of inhibition as brequinar, a known potent inhibitor of DHO-DH. We validated this prediction experimentally using MOLT-4 lymphoblast and found the IC50 of brequinar (0.5 microM) and NSC 665564 (0.3 microM) were comparable and that this induced cytotoxicity was reversed by either uridine or cytidine. The enzyme target of NSC 665564 was shown to be identical to that of brequinar when incubation with each drug followed by a 1 h pulse with [14C] sodium bicarbonate resulted in cellular accumulation of [14C]N-carbamyl-L-aspartic acid and [14C]L-dihydroorotic acid, with concurrent marked depletion of CTP and UTP. The Ki's for NSC 665564 and brequinar were 0.14 and 0.24 microM, respectively, when partially purified MOLT-4 mitochondria (the site of DHO-DH) were used. These results show that mechanistic predictions obtained using correlations from the COMPARE algorithm are independent of structure since the structure of NSC 665564 is dissimilar to that of other established DHO-DH inhibitors.","['Cleaveland, E S', 'Zaharevitz, D W', 'Kelley, J A', 'Paull, K', 'Cooney, D A', 'Ford, H Jr']","['Cleaveland ES', 'Zaharevitz DW', 'Kelley JA', 'Paull K', 'Cooney DA', 'Ford H Jr']","['Laboratory of Medicinal Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biphenyl Compounds)', '0 (Carbolines)', '0 (Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (NSC 665564)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '155-54-4 (4,5-dihydroorotic acid)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '5XL19F49H6 (brequinar)', '61H4T033E5 (Orotic Acid)', '8MDF5V39QO (Sodium Bicarbonate)', 'EC 1.- (Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.3.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors)', 'O3Y2KY16L1 (ureidosuccinic acid)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Aspartic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Biphenyl Compounds/*toxicity', 'Breast Neoplasms', 'Carbolines/*toxicity', 'Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Dihydroorotate Dehydrogenase', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Lung Neoplasms', 'Male', 'Melanoma', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Orotic Acid/analogs & derivatives/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms', 'Oxidoreductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', '*Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors', 'Prostatic Neoplasms', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Sodium Bicarbonate/metabolism', 'Software', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/25 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/06/25 00:00'],"['1996/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Jun 25;223(3):654-9. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.0950.,,"['S0006291X9690950X [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.0950 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the explanations for the tissue destruction is that HTLV-I infects cells in the CNS, or HTLV-I-infected CD4+ T lymphocytes enter the CNS, and this drives local expansion of virus-specific CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which along with cytokines cause the pathological changes. Because both in the circulation and in the cerebrospinal fluid, CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes are primarily reactive to the product of the HTLV-I tax gene, we sought evidence of expression of this gene within cells in the inflammatory lesions. After using double-label in situ hybridization techniques, we now report definitive localization of HTLV-I tax gene expression in CD4+ T lymphocytes in areas of inflammation and white matter destruction.

These results imply the potential value of HSV-TK gene transduction followed by GCV treatment in killing multidrug-resistant tumor cells.","['Takenaga, K', 'Tagawa, M', 'Sakiyama, S']","['Takenaga K', 'Tagawa M', 'Sakiyama S']","['Division of Chemotherapy, Chiba Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Ganciclovir/*therapeutic use', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Simplexvirus/*enzymology', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Vincristine/therapeutic use']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1996 Mar-Apr;16(2):681-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DISCUSSION: The frequency of these rare complications is probably underestimated because of the rapid unfavourable outcome of metastatic malignant melanoma. We were unable to determine whether dacarbazine, fotemustine or their combination was incriminated in this complication.

National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group.,183-90,"OBJECTIVE: To determine whether augmented quinolone-based antibacterial prophylaxis in neutropenic patients with cancer reduces infections caused by gram-positive cocci and preserves the protective effect against aerobic gram-negative bacilli. DESIGN: Open, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial. SETTING: Centers participating in the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group. PATIENTS: 111 eligible and evaluable patients hospitalized for severe neutropenia (neutrophil count < 0.5 x 10(9)/L lasting at least 14 days) who were receiving cytotoxic therapy for acute leukemia or bone marrow autografting. INTERVENTION: One of three oral antibacterial prophylactic regimens (norfloxacin, 400 mg every 12 hours; ofloxacin, 400 mg every 12 hours; or ofloxacin, 400 mg, plus rifampin, 300 mg every 12 hours) beginning with cytotoxic therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Incidence and cause of suspected or proven infection. RESULTS: Microbiologically documented overall infection rates for norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ofloxacin plus rifampin were 47%, 24%, and 9%, respectively (P < 0.001). Corresponding rates were 24%, 13%, and 3%, respectively for staphylococcal bacteremia (P = 0.03) and, 21%, 3%, and 3%, respectively for streptococcal bacteremia (P < 0.01). The pattern of bacteremia suggested that rifampin played a role in suppressing staphylococcal infection. Both ofloxacin alone and ofloxacin plus rifampin had a clinically significant antistreptococcal effect. Aerobic gram-negative rods were cleared from rectal surveillance cultures in all patients after a median of 5.5 days and caused infection in only one patient (0.9%). The reductions in the number of microbiologically documented infections among ofloxacin recipients and ofloxacin plus rifampin recipients were offset by concomitant increases in the number of unexplained fevers (24% of norfloxacin recipients, 53% of ofloxacin recipients, and 49% of ofloxacin plus rifampin recipients; P = 0.02). No statistically significant difference was found among the treatment arms with respect to the overall incidence of febrile neutropenic episodes as defined for this trial (79% for the norfloxacin group, 82% for the ofloxacin group, and 77% for the ofloxacin plus rifampin group). CONCLUSIONS: Quinolone-based antibacterial chemoprophylaxis protected patients from aerobic gram-negative bacillary infections. Augmentation of the gram-positive activity reduced the incidence of gram-positive infections but did not influence the overall incidence of febrile neutropenic episodes.","['Bow, E J', 'Mandell, L A', 'Louie, T J', 'Feld, R', 'Palmer, M', 'Zee, B', 'Pater, J']","['Bow EJ', 'Mandell LA', 'Louie TJ', 'Feld R', 'Palmer M', 'Zee B', 'Pater J']","['Health Sciences Centre, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'A4P49JAZ9H (Ofloxacin)', 'N0F8P22L1P (Norfloxacin)', 'VJT6J7R4TR (Rifampin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anti-Infective Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bacteremia/microbiology/*prevention & control', 'Colony Count, Microbial', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Norfloxacin/therapeutic use', 'Ofloxacin/therapeutic use', 'Rifampin/therapeutic use', 'Staphylococcal Infections/prevention & control', 'Streptococcal Infections/prevention & control', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/08/01 00:00,1996/08/01 00:01,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1996 Aug 1;125(3):183-90. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-125-3-199608010-00004.,,['10.7326/0003-4819-125-3-199608010-00004 [doi]'],,"['Ann Intern Med. 1997 May 15;126(10):830; author reply 831.

We conclude that high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation in not too heavily pretreated patients is a safe procedure irrespective of the source of stem cells.","['Geisler, C H', 'Simonsen, A C', 'Mortensen, B T', 'Christensen, L D', 'Ersboll, J K', 'Andersen, N S', 'Dickmeiss, E', 'Hansen, M M']","['Geisler CH', 'Simonsen AC', 'Mortensen BT', 'Christensen LD', 'Ersboll JK', 'Andersen NS', 'Dickmeiss E', 'Hansen MM']","['Finsencentret, haematologisk afdeling L, Rigshospitalet, Kobenhavn.']",['dan'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Ugeskr Laeger,Ugeskrift for laeger,0141730,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Hodgkin Disease/mortality/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/04/29 00:00,1996/04/29 00:01,['1996/04/29 00:00'],"['1996/04/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/29 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ugeskr Laeger. 1996 Apr 29;158(18):2546-51.,,,,,Autolog stamcelletransplantation.

Its molecular consequence is the genesis of a fusion gene BCR-ABL between the 5' sequences of the BCR gene (chromosome 22) and the 3' end of the ABL gene (chromosome 9). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using specific DNA probes provides a useful tool for the detection of t(9;22) and BCR-ABL rearrangement. We report our results using the FISH technique for t(9;22) assessment in the hematopoietic cells of patients with Ph-positive CML. The DNA libraries pBS 9 and pBS 22 containing multiple sequences derived from chromosomes 9 and 22 have been used to identify t(9;22) in metaphase cells. The cos bcr-51 and cos abl-18 probes that hybridize to unique sequences specific to the BCR and ABL genes have the ability to detect the BCR-ABL rearrangement in metaphase cells as well as in interphase nuclei. FISH is a sensitive and specific technique that represents a valuable complement to conventional cytogenetics. The BCR-ABL rearrangement can be detected in metaphase spreads of insufficient quality or from interphase nuclei in the case of terminally differentiated cells or of cells which do not divide in vitro. When the efficiency of hybridization and detection is good, a large number of cells can be analyzed. This is of major significance in assessment of response to treatment and definition of a cytogenetic remission. However, interphase cytogenetics may be difficult due to variations in signal resolution and background level. The FISH technique can also be used to detect the BCR-ABL rearrangement in cases of Ph negative BCR-ABL positive CML.","['Martinet, D', 'Muhlematter, D', 'Jotterand Bellomo, M']","['Martinet D', 'Muhlematter D', 'Jotterand Bellomo M']","['Division autonome de genetique medicale, Centre hospitalier universitaire vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Schweiz Med Wochenschr,Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift,0404401,"['0 (DNA Probes)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Color', 'DNA Probes', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/05/18 00:00,1996/05/18 00:01,['1996/05/18 00:00'],"['1996/05/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/18 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Schweiz Med Wochenschr. 1996 May 18;126(20):855-63.,30,,,,Application de la technique d'hybridation in situ fluorescente (FISH) au diagnostic de la translocation de Philadelphie dans la leucemie myeloide chronique.,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A nested case-referent study was carried out on 19 myeloid leukemia patients, of which 12 showed clonal chromosome aberrations, and 57 referents ascertained within the Danish reinforced plastics industry and similar industries with no styrene exposure. RESULTS: A 2.5-fold increased risk for myeloid leukemia with clonal chromosome aberrations (95% confidence interval 0.2-25.0) was found among workers of companies with styrene exposure. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that styrene may cause leukemia through a clastogenic effect. But similar findings could also have been found if the exposure was associated with a specific subtype of leukemia prone to develop the chromosome aberrations in question. Due to the few observations and the lack of detailed exposure data, additional studies are needed to corroborate or refute the present suggestive findings.","['Kolstad, H A', 'Pedersen, B', 'Olsen, J', 'Lynge, E', 'Jensen, G', 'Lisse, I', 'Philip, P', 'Pedersen, N T']","['Kolstad HA', 'Pedersen B', 'Olsen J', 'Lynge E', 'Jensen G', 'Lisse I', 'Philip P', 'Pedersen NT']","['University of Aarhus, Institute of Epidemiology and Social Medicine, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,['0 (Styrenes)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Case-Control Studies', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Denmark/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*chemically induced/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Styrenes/*adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 1996 Feb;22(1):58-61. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.110.,,"['110 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.110 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A cohort was established through linkage between agricultural censuses in 1969-1989 and the Central Population Register, which identifies farm holders and their spouses. Available census information on the activity of the farm provided the exposure indicators. Incident cancer in 1969-1991 was identified in the Cancer Register. In an analysis for standardized incidence ratios (SIR), the cohort was compared with the total rural population of Norway. Associations with exposure indicators were investigated in a Poisson regression analysis. RESULTS: In the follow-up of 136,463 men for 1.5 million person-years and 109,641 women for 0.6 million person-years, 3333 and 2145 cancer cases were identified, respectively. The subset defined as farmers had an SIR of 77 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 73-81] for the men and 92 (95% CI 85-99) for the women, with particularly low SIR values for lung cancer and other sites linked to life-style. The several positive associations found confirmed the a priori hypothesis of an association between dairy farming and acute leukemia among men [rate ratio 1.76, 95% CI 1.02-3.05]. Multiple myeloma was associated with pesticide indicators for both genders, mainly for subjects cultivating potatoes. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis of a relationship between acute leukemia and animal contact and between multiple myeloma and pesticides in potato cultivation. Other exposure associations, especially for cancer among women, warrant further investigation.","['Kristensen, P', 'Andersen, A', 'Irgens, L M', 'Laake, P', 'Bye, A S']","['Kristensen P', 'Andersen A', 'Irgens LM', 'Laake P', 'Bye AS']","['National Institute of Occupational Health, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Finland,Scand J Work Environ Health,"Scandinavian journal of work, environment & health",7511540,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Agriculture/*statistics & numerical data', 'Animal Husbandry', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Life Style', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology', 'Norway/epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposure/analysis', 'Pesticides/adverse effects', 'Poisson Distribution', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Work Environ Health. 1996 Feb;22(1):14-26. doi: 10.5271/sjweh.104.,,"['104 [pii]', '10.5271/sjweh.104 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides the particular etiological aspects in the newborn, neutropenia in a child may be acquired, part of a more complex genetic disease, or an isolated inborn disorder. Primary acquired neutropenia, also called benign chronic neutropenia, is the most frequent cause of chronic neutropenia in children. Infantile agranulocytosis is the main primary congenital neutropenia. Its underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Prevention of repeated infections is the main issue in the management of such patients. This implies careful individual assessment for each patient. Management includes first prophylactic antibiotherapy using trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and secondly hematological growth factors (mainly G-CSF). Long-term G-CSF therapy results in a rise in the absolute neutrophil count, a reduction in the rate of infection and an improvement in the patient's quality of life. Severe side effects, including osteoporosis, vasculitis, myelodysplasia or leukemia have been occasionally reported in certain subsets of patients.

The identity of the cell lines with the original tumor clone was established by immunoglobulin gene rearrangement analysis. Both HBL-4 and HBL-6 carry a monoclonal EBV infection and do not contain HIV. In addition, HBL-6 harbors DNA sequences of the recently identified Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), now formally called human herpesvirus 8 (HHV8). Finally, HBL-4, but not HBL-6, harbors a rearranged c-MYC allele, while the BCL-6 gene displayed a germline configurations in both cell lines.

We studied the reproducibility of such results using as targets low numbers of cells from chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients and CML cell lines in quintuplicate two-step RT/PCR designed to amplify BCR-ABL sequences. When one K562 or KYO1 cell was diluted in 10(3) non-CML HL60 cells, an amplification product was obtained in each test; at greater dilutions BCR-ABL transcripts were detected erratically. Titration of cDNA synthesised from 5 x 10(7) cells from four CML patients showed that whereas positive BCR-ABL sequences could be amplified in some tests starting with as little as a 1 in 10(7) dilution of cDNA template (corresponding to 5-10 cells), the dilution threshold for reproducible amplification was around 1 to 5 in 10(5) (100-500 cells). Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that reactions from 1 in 10(7) diluted cDNA contained less than 10 BCR-ABL transcripts as the starting template. The stochastic nature of the amplification from such small numbers of transcripts was illustrated by results of 10 replicate PCR tests on cDNA from a patient expressing both b3a2 and b2a2 transcripts: dilutions of cDNA up to 1 in 10(5) yielded dual transcript amplification in all 10 tests, but the 1 in 10(7) cDNA dilution resulted in b3a2 and b2a2 products in three tests, b3a2 only in three, b2a2 only in one and no amplification in three tests.

Detection of the PML/RARalpha fusion gene in APL blasts is critical to start promptly the specific therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). APL lacking this genetic lesion have been reported as being ATRA resistant. Reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been extensively used to detect the PML/RARalpha cDNA. The reported PML/RARalpha amplification techniques are laborious and time consuming, and include conventional RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and a two-round (nested) PCR. We hereby describe a few variations of the commonly adopted RNA extraction and PML/RARalpha RT-PCR protocols which allow a molecular diagnosis of APL to be carried out in less than 5 h. Processing of small volumes of leukemic cell lysate (0.5 ml) in a microfuge allows extraction of good quality RNA in 1 h. After reverse transcription to obtain cDNA, a 'hot start' PCR procedure was adopted which enabled us to amplify clearly visible and specific products after a single (not nested) amplification round. The PML/RARalpha fusion gene was detected in the blasts of six consecutive APL at diagnosis, and an APL-tailored protocol including ATRA was started in each case within 6 h of admission. On repeated experiments, the assay proved highly specific and sensitive for the rapid detection of all PML/RARalpha transcript types. Our data should encourage the use of this rapid procedure for the diagnosis of both typical APL and, particularly, less typical cases awaiting urgent therapeutic intervention.","['Diverio, D', 'Riccioni, R', 'Pistilli, A', 'Buffolino, S', 'Avvisati, G', 'Mandelli, F', 'Lo Coco, F']","['Diverio D', 'Riccioni R', 'Pistilli A', 'Buffolino S', 'Avvisati G', 'Mandelli F', 'Lo Coco F']","['Hematology, Department of Human Biopathology, University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10(7):1214-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied three B-NHL cell lines (DoHH2, VAL and ROS 50) and show that concurrent activation of BCL2 and MYC may follow translocation of both oncogenes to the same IGH allele. Conventional cytogenetics of DoHH2 suggested the presence of a t(14;18)(q32;q21) translocation. However, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies using whole chromosome paints, alpha satellite probes and flow-sorted chromosomes as probes revealed an unexpected complexity of rearrangements involving chromosomes 8, 14 and 18, namely t(8;14;18)(q24;q32;q21). DNA blot and previous PCR analysis confirmed the juxtaposition of BCL2 major breakpoint region (mbr) with IGJH6, but also demonstrated a rearrangement within the first exon of MYC. The centromeric (5') MYC rearranged fragment comigrated with the BCL2-JH6 rearranged fragment in BamHI, EcoRI and Bg/II restriction digests. The der(8)t(8;14;18) therefore comprised 5' MYC (exon I)-Sgamma4-JH6-BCL2 mbr. Similar rearrangements were observed in both ROS 50 and VAL cell lines which contained two and three copies of the der(8)t(8;14;18) respectively. Quantitative flow cytometry for BCL2 and MYC expression showed abundant expression of both proteins in all three lines. These data indicate the der(14)t(14;18)(q32;q21) may itself be the target for any second translocation. The presence of the intact BCL2-JH fusion gene on the der(8)t(8;14;18) allowed concurrent activation of both BCL2 and MYC with no loss of immunoglobulin expression.","['Dyer, M J', 'Lillington, D M', 'Bastard, C', 'Tilly, H', 'Lens, D', 'Heward, J M', 'Stranks, G', 'Morilla, R', 'Monrad, S', 'Guglielmi, P', 'Kluin-Nelemans, J C', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Young, B D', 'Catovsky, D']","['Dyer MJ', 'Lillington DM', 'Bastard C', 'Tilly H', 'Lens D', 'Heward JM', 'Stranks G', 'Morilla R', 'Monrad S', 'Guglielmi P', 'Kluin-Nelemans JC', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Young BD', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Alleles', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10(7):1198-208.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the role of direct antigen stimulation in MALT lymphomagenesis and its relationship with the pathogenesis of distinct pathological lesions, which represent different stages of the tumour progression, we cloned and sequenced the rearranged immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain gene in three low-grade (two from the lung, one from the stomach) and one high-grade (from the stomach) cases. In the low-grade gastric case, we studied the Ig sequence in primary as well as its disseminated and recurrent tumours. In the high-grade gastric case, we analysed the Ig sequence in tumour cell populations microdissected from the residual diffuse low-grade lesions, diffuse high-grade areas from follicles colonized by high-grade blasts. Compared with the published germline sequences, the heavy chain variable (VH) genes of three MALT lymphomas, in which the putative germline was identified, contained frequent somatic mutations, showing a much higher ratio of replacement/silent mutations in the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) than the framework regions (FRs). Ongoing mutation as indicated by intraclonal variation of the Ig sequence clearly existed in low-grade tumour including its dissemination and recurrence, but was not evident in high-grade tumour cell populations including those microdissected from independent colonized follicles. In addition, the germlines of VH genes used by the three MALT lymphomas are frequently found in autoreactive antibodies. Our results suggest that MALT lymphoma derives from postgerminal centre memory B cells, possibly autoreactive B cell clones, and that direct antigen stimulation may play an important role in the clonal expansion of low-grade MALT lymphoma.","['Du, M', 'Diss, T C', 'Xu, C', 'Peng, H', 'Isaacson, P G', 'Pan, L']","['Du M', 'Diss TC', 'Xu C', 'Peng H', 'Isaacson PG', 'Pan L']","['Department of Histopathology, University College London Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone/*genetics/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10(7):1190-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By virtue of their different pH optima in the reaction buffer, two different topo II activities were found with activity optima at pH 7.9 and at pH 8.9 under high stringency conditions. The activities could be identified as topo II beta activity (pH 7.9) and topo II alpha activity (pH 8.9) by their different sensitivities to topo II alpha inhibitors, dephosphorylation experiments and immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies. Seventy-two bone marrow or blood samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemias have been examined and their in vitro sensitivities to anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxines correlated to the activities of topo II alpha and topo II beta. Although the topo II alpha activity could be directly inhibited by incubation of the cells with the mentioned drugs, no correlation between the topo II alpha activity and the sensitivity of the cells could be found. In contrast, the topo II beta activity which was not substantially inhibited by the drugs inversely correlated with the sensitivity of the cells. These findings were statistically significant for idarubicin (P= 0.017) and daunorubicin (P = 0.006). Vice versa, resistant cells (IC50 > median) had a higher topo II beta activity. Clinical relevance might be indicated by the finding that cells from patients that relapsed after initial treatment with anthracyclin-containing regiments had a significantly higher topo II alpha/beta activity ratio (P=0.0276). Obviously, the sensitivity of AML cells is substantially influenced by the activity of the resistant topo II (topo II beta) which gives evidence that the remaining topo II activity after treatment helps the cell to survive the DNA repair phase.","['Gieseler, F', 'Glasmacher, A', 'Kampfe, D', 'Wandt, H', 'Nuessler, V', 'Valsamas, S', 'Kunze, J', 'Wilms, K']","['Gieseler F', 'Glasmacher A', 'Kampfe D', 'Wandt H', 'Nuessler V', 'Valsamas S', 'Kunze J', 'Wilms K']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, Medical School, University of Wuerzberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (TOP2B protein, human)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Blast Crisis/*enzymology/pathology', '*DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology/pathology', 'Poly-ADP-Ribose Binding Proteins', 'Prognosis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10(7):1177-80.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All samples were strongly positive for MHC class I and 84% for class II antigen. B7-1, B7-2 and ICAM-1 were expressed in 5%, 22% and 16% of the total cases, respectively. Especially in 54 AML samples, B7-1 was only expressed in one case, while B7-2 was detected in as many as 15 cases (28%). We have also examined 13 human myelo/monocytic cell lines for the expression of class II and costimulatory molecules and found that significant expression of costimulatory molecules was induced in human leukemic cells by some suitable drugs, among which interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) was the most potent inducer. Our results indicate that when the B7-mediated immuno-gene therapy was applied to human leukemias, especially to AML, B7-1 was rather preferable to B7-2 in that the latter was more widely expressed on human leukemic cells. Furthermore, since gene-transfer systems occasionally accompany serious problems, it should be taken into account that costimulatory molecules on human myelo/monocytic leukemic cells could be induced ex vivo without the introduction of exogenous genes.","['Hirano, N', 'Takahashi, T', 'Takahashi, T', 'Ohtake, S', 'Hirashima, K', 'Emi, N', 'Saito, K', 'Hirano, M', 'Shinohara, K', 'Takeuchi, M', 'Taketazu, F', 'Tsunoda, S', 'Ogura, M', 'Omine, M', 'Saito, T', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Ueda, R', 'Hirai, H']","['Hirano N', 'Takahashi T', 'Takahashi T', 'Ohtake S', 'Hirashima K', 'Emi N', 'Saito K', 'Hirano M', 'Shinohara K', 'Takeuchi M', 'Taketazu F', 'Tsunoda S', 'Ogura M', 'Omine M', 'Saito T', 'Yazaki Y', 'Ueda R', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (B7-1 Antigen)', '0 (B7-2 Antigen)', '0 (CD86 protein, human)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'B7-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'B7-2 Antigen', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10(7):1168-76.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because adult chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) has many features in common with JCML, we treated 10 cases of advanced adult CMML with ATRA (45 mg/m2/day). Five of them were also tested in vitro. After two patients had a rapid increase in WBC counts and clinical signs reminiscent of the 'ATRA syndrome' seen in acute promyelocytic leukemia, with fatal outcome in one of them, it was decided to add hydroxyurea (HY) to ATRA to patients with high WBC at inclusion or during ATRA treatment, and no more cases of ATRA syndrome were seen. Overall, six patients received ATRA + HY and four ATRA alone. Four patients had a minor but significant response with reduction of transfusion requirement (two cases) or increase in platelet counts (two cases). Apart from the ATRA syndrome, no other side-effect of ATRA was seen. Bone marrow mononuclear cells showed spontaneous growth of CFU-C in methylcellulose in the five patients tested in vitro, with a predominance of CFU-M. ATRA (10(-7) M) inhibited CFU-M growth in all cases, but increased CFU-G growth in one patient who developed the ATRA syndrome. No differentiation of bone marrow myeloid cells after short-term liquid culture with ATRA was observed. A decrease of CFU-C growth was observed in the four patients reevaluated during follow-up. In some cases of CMML, ATRA can improve anemia or thrombocytopenia but not other parameters. Furthermore, it can also induce hyperleukocytosis and ATRA syndrome in some patients, requiring the rapid addition of cytoreductive agents such as HY.","['Cambier, N', 'Wattel, E', 'Menot, M L', 'Guerci, A', 'Chomienne, C', 'Fenaux, P']","['Cambier N', 'Wattel E', 'Menot ML', 'Guerci A', 'Chomienne C', 'Fenaux P']","['Laboratorie de Biologie Cellulaire Hematologique, Hopital St Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytosis/chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pilot Projects', 'Platelet Count/drug effects', 'Syndrome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/pathology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10(7):1164-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although preincubation with bryostatin 1 (10 nM) for 24 h significantly increased DNA fragmentation and apoptosis in cells subsequently treated with 10 microM Ara-C for 6 h, this effect was not enhanced by co-administration of AS101 (1.5 microM). However, while exposure of cells to AS101 or bryostatin 1 alone for 72 h was ineffective in inducing cellular maturation, combined treatment resulted in the induction of differentiated features in a subset of cells, manifested by an increase in cell adherence, CD11b expression, cytoplasmic granularity and cell spreading. In addition, cells exposed to the combination of AS101 and bryostatin 1, in contrast to cells incubated with these agents individually, displayed a significant decline in the S-phase and a corresponding increase in the G0/G1 cell populations. These events were accompanied by an increase in protein expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 (WAF1/CIP1/MDA6), and a decline in expression of the c-myc protein. AS101 failed to increase intracellular free Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) in HL-60 cells, or reverse the profound PKC down-regulation induced by bryostatin 1. Whereas treatment of cells with 1.5 microM AS101 or 10 nM bryostatin 1 for 24 h exerted minimal growth inhibitory effects, combined exposure to these agents reduced colony formation by over 70%. Finally, although addition of AS101 did not potentiate apoptosis induced by the bryostatin 1/Ara-C combination, it did lead to a further reduction in clonogenicity. Together, these findings demonstrate that AS101 partially restores the ability of bryostatin 1 to trigger a differentiation program in an otherwise unresponsive HL-60 cell line, possibly by facilitating bryostatin 1-mediated G1 arrest. They also indicate that AS101 potentiates the antiproliferative effects of bryostatin 1 administered alone or in combination with Ara-C through a mechanism other than, or in addition to, induction of apoptosis.","['Rao, A S', 'Freemerman, A J', 'Jarvis, W D', 'Chelliah, J', 'Bear, H D', 'Mikkelsen, R', 'Grant, S']","['Rao AS', 'Freemerman AJ', 'Jarvis WD', 'Chelliah J', 'Bear HD', 'Mikkelsen R', 'Grant S']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Ethylenes)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Macrophage-1 Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)', ""708681952A (ammonium trichloro(dioxoethylene-O,O'-)tellurate)"", 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bryostatins', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Ethylenes/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Macrophage-1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10(7):1150-8.,,,"['CA09564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA63753/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 CA66990/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we have reported that the radical scavenger N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) protects cultured clonogenic AML blast cells from the lethal affects of Ara-C if given before the drug. This observation provides indirect evidence that toxic reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) are generated in AML blast cells following Ara-C-induced damage to DNA. In the present paper we present evidence in support of this hypothesis. Using flow cytometry and multiple fluorescent probes for live cell function, we have mapped a sequence of discrete stages that occur during Ara-C cytotoxicity. An early event was the increased generation of ROI. Initially this oxidative stress was countered by an increase in the cellular content of reduced glutathione (GSH), but cells then underwent an abrupt transition to a state characterized by low GSH and very high ROI generation indicative of collapse of cellular redox balance. Next, the capacity to maintain low intracellular ionized calcium was lost, probably due to lipid peroxidation at membrane sites of calcium regulation. Finally, surface membrane integrity was lost. Concurrent measurements of clonogenic cell survival insured the relevance of these flow cytometry measurements to the stem cell population. We used OCI/AML-2 cells transfected with bcl-2 to look for the place in this sequence where bcl-2 protein protects cells against apoptosis; bcl-2 transfectants showed an increase in ROI generation similar to controls, but were able to maintain GSH levels in the face of this oxidative stress. We conclude that oxidative stress plays a major role in Ara-C toxicity, and that bcl-2 protein protects cells by maintaining cellular redox balance in a reducing state. These studies complement previous work showing how regulators of AML growth affect the sensitivity of blast cells to Ara-C by changing the concentration or stability of bcl-2 protein.","['Hedley, D W', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Hedley DW', 'McCulloch EA']","['The Ontario Cancer Institute/Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blast Crisis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lipid Peroxidation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10(7):1143-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined transcript diversity in 10 AML patients with t(8;21) in remission of their disease following chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation. Specific transcripts detected at presentation in six patients were similarly expressed during remission and at relapse in two patients; thus expression of transcript diversity was unaffected by the disease phase.

WT1 was strongly expressed in normal CD34+ bone marrow (BM) stem cells but only weakly or not expressed in normal mature blood cells. This suggests that WT1 gene expression is associated with immature cells, which have high proliferative capacities. Previous studies of WT1 gene regulation showed that GATA-1 may regulate WT1 expression. To understand the relationship between WT1 and GATA-1 expression in leukemia, we examined the expression pattern of GATA-1 in the cells described above. Overall, AML samples expressed significant amounts of both WT1 and GATA-1. However, AML samples with 16q22 abnormalities, presumably interrupting the core binding factor (CBF) beta gene expressed lower than normal levels of GATA-1 but high levels of WT1. Our data suggest that the transcription factor CBF beta may be important for GATA-1 gene regulation. Thus, WT1 expression varied in different FAB subclasses, and GATA-1 expression was strongly affected by the presence of chromosome 16q22 abnormalities.","['Patmasiriwat, P', 'Fraizer, G C', 'Claxton, D', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Saunders, G F']","['Patmasiriwat P', 'Fraizer GC', 'Claxton D', 'Kantarjian H', 'Saunders GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, Wilms Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10(7):1127-33.,,,"['CA16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F5TW04925A/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LH2 locus was mapped to 9q33-34.1, centromeric to the ABL gene. In a recent report, it was suggested that high levels of LH2 expression are consistently observed in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients, whereas no transcription is detected in normal individuals. This led to the hypothesis that aberrant expression of LH2 may represent an additional mechanism for malignant cell proliferation in CML. We have studied the expression of LH2 in leucocytes from patients with CML or with other chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMD), and from normal individuals, using an optimised reverse-transcription and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Twenty-seven out of 29 cDNA samples from normal individuals (93%), 49 out of 51 samples from CML patients (96%) and 20 out of 20 from Philadelphia chromosome-negative CMD showed evidence of LH2 expression. Similarly, LH2 transcription was also detected in leucocytes from CML patients in complete cytogenetic remission after treatment with interferon-alpha. Furthermore, all 36 EBV-induced lymphoblastoid cell lines established from six chronic phase CML patients showed unequivocal LH2 expression, regardless of the BCR-ABL status of the line (9 BCR-ABL positive, 27 BCR-ABL negative). We conclude that LH2 expression is not confined to CML cells, and that the t(9;22)(q34;qll) does not promote 'de novo' transcriptional activation of this gene.","['Al-Jehani, F', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Spencer, A', 'Goldman, J M', 'Melo, J V']","['Al-Jehani F', 'Hochhaus A', 'Spencer A', 'Goldman JM', 'Melo JV']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10(7):1122-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In cells derived from patients, G alpha 16 expression has been detected in progenitor- and pre-B ALL cells and also in peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC). In this study, we analyzed G alpha 16 expression using a RT-PCR technique by testing elutriated blood cells from normal donors, PBSC from breast cancer patients and bone marrow or peripheral blood cells from acute leukemia patients. Both of two ALL patients and 15/16 AML patients expressed G alpha 16. In elutriation experiments, G alpha 16 expression was found in fractions containing the highest number of precursor cells but was absent in mature T and B cell fractions. In addition, CD34-enriched PBSC were positive for G alpha 16 expression. Further in vitro experiments using the cell line KG1 showed that G alpha 16 expression was not affected by the growth inhibiting hemoregulatory peptide pEEDCK which has a sequence homology present within G alpha 16. Taken together, these data demonstrate that G alpha 16 is expressed in various normal and malignant hematopietic progenitors but not in their differentiated counterparts.

These findings suggested the presence of a multiple important regulatory cis-elements in the 5'-flanking region of the MPO gene. We now report results of studies which reveal the presence of seven discrete nuclear protein binding sites (DP1-DP7) within the proximal 600 bp of 5'-flanking MPO DNA. DNase I footprinting and gel shift analyses indicate tissue-specific and/or maturation-specific differences in nuclear protein binding to most of these sites, suggesting that they play a role in transcriptional regulation. Mutation of site DP7 stimulates the activity of a 594-bp MPO promoter construct in transfection studies, whereas mutation of any of the six other sites (DP1-DP6) reduces promoter activity.

Acyclovir exerted an inhibitory effect on OM9;22 cells, p185BCR-ABL expressing cells, in a dose-dependent manner. Despite no down-modulation of a BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase activity or its expression was observed after treatment with ACV, cell cycle analysis demonstrated synchronization of OM9;22 cells at the G0/G1 phase.

Although selective inhibition of Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemia cell growth was not apparent, our data provides a therapeutic possibility for ACV in the treatment for leukemia.","['Nishimaki, J', 'Miyazawa, K', 'Gotoh, A', 'Yoshikawa, O', 'Ohyashiki, K', 'Toyama, K']","['Nishimaki J', 'Miyazawa K', 'Gotoh A', 'Yoshikawa O', 'Ohyashiki K', 'Toyama K']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'X4HES1O11F (Acyclovir)']",IM,"['Acyclovir/*pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 May;20(5):415-20. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(96)00009-4.,,"['0145212696000094 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(96)00009-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Doubling dilutions of cells were exposed to MTT for 3-4 h. The mean optical density of the formazan produced by each cell dilution was plotted and the gradient of the line produced was calculated, higher gradients indicating more metabolically active cells. Results showed that the median activity of mononuclear cells from seven patients with non-clonal disease was 0.202 (range 0.175-0.253); blast cells from 27 patients with de novo AML had a median activity of 0.187 (range 0.079-0.345) and 13 patients with MDS a median of 0.155 (range 0.062-0.311). Seven assays on mononuclear cells from five patients in remission had a median activity of 0.203 (range 0.190-0.248), indicating no significant difference between these and normal patients. There was no correlation between the metabolic activity of cells when compared with their proliferative capacity, cell size and expression of P-glycoprotein. Following exposure of the AML patients' blast cells to the anthracyclines, cytosine arabinoside, 6-thioguanine and etoposide, cell survival was measured using the MTT assay. While there was no correlation between the in vitro sensitivity of these cells to the anthracyclines or etoposide, less metabolically active cells showed significantly greater sensitivity to 6-thioguanine. Conversely, the more active cells appeared to be more sensitive to cytosine arabinoside. Patients whose blasts cells showed higher metabolic activity appeared to achieve remission and had a longer mean survival time. Therefore, by using a simple technique we were able to establish that some patients were more likely to respond to certain cytotoxic regimes. Our preliminary study reflected the multifactorial nature of clinical response in AML and MDS, so providing further information on the relationship between cellular metabolic activity and treatment failure.","['Elgie, A W', 'Sargent, J M', 'Taylor, C G', 'Williamson, C']","['Elgie AW', 'Sargent JM', 'Taylor CG', 'Williamson C']","['Haematology Research Department, Pembury Hospital, Kent, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Size/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Individuality', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', '*Tetrazolium Salts', '*Thiazoles']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 May;20(5):407-13. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00163-8.,,"['0145212695001638 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00163-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the liver, LIF is known to induce acute phase proteins in the hepatocytes. No comprehensive study has yet been performed on the physiological role of this cytokine during liver regeneration. Thus, we studied the level of expression and cellular distribution of transcripts for LIF, its receptor (LIFR), and signal transducing subunit gp13O during rat liver regeneration after both simple partial hepatectomy (PH) and the oval cell activation induced by the combination of 2-acetylaminofluorene and PH. In addition, the expression of an acute phase protein alpha1-acidglycoprotein was examined. The level of transcripts for LIF and its receptor subunits increased and remained elevated during oval cell expansion. In contrast, after PH, the transcripts were induced only transiently, showing a peak 24 hours after the operation. LIF and receptor subunits were expressed in both parenchymal and nonparenchymal fractions in the 2-acetylaminofluorene/PH model, but the level of expression was most pronounced in the nonparenchymal fraction. In situ hybridization clearly revealed a strong expression of LIF, LIFR, and gp13O in the oval cells and demonstrated only a weak expression in the parenchyma. Interestingly, transcripts of alpha1-acidglycoprotein were exclusively detected in the parenchyma. These results suggest a phenotypic difference between oval cells and hepatocytes in their signaling through gp130. We hypothesize that the LIF/LIFR gp130 system may be involved in the expansion and differentiation of the liver stem cell compartment.","['Omori, N', 'Evarts, R P', 'Omori, M', 'Hu, Z', 'Marsden, E R', 'Thorgeirsson, S S']","['Omori N', 'Evarts RP', 'Omori M', 'Hu Z', 'Marsden ER', 'Thorgeirsson SS']","['Laboratory of Experimental Carcinogenesis, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Lab Invest,Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology,0376617,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Il6st protein, rat)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Orosomucoid)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/genetics', 'Bile Ducts/chemistry/cytology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Epithelium/chemistry', 'Growth Inhibitors/*analysis/genetics', 'Hepatectomy', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Liver/*chemistry/cytology', '*Liver Regeneration', 'Lymphokines/*analysis/genetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/genetics', 'Orosomucoid/analysis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*analysis', 'Signal Transduction']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lab Invest. 1996 Jul;75(1):15-24.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Seventy six children, 0-15 years old, received renal transplants at 8 transplant centers of Kansai area up to December, 1993. Clinical study was carried out about the etiology of renal failure causes, the graft survival and the complications. RESULTS: End-stage renal failure was due to a variety of diseases. The 3 most common causes were chronic glomerulonephritis, chronic pyelonephritis including of reflux nephropathy and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). The graft rates at 3, 5 and 8 years were 75%, 71% and 53% for children receiving azathioprine (AZ), compared to 77%, 59% and 52% for ones receiving ciclosporin (Cs). Cs has led no improvement of the graft survival. Adult had the better graft survival rate than children in Cs immunosuppressive protocol. In 12 children transplanted kidneys for FSGS, only 3 cases had recurrent FSGS. Neoplasia was found in two case. They were acute leukemia and liposarcoma.

For long-chain complementary RNA sequences (>30 nt), effects in living cells are correlated with the association rate of the complementary RNA in vitro, but not with the stability of the formed double strand. Thus, sequence selectivity of complementary RNA has to be defined as fast versus slow annealing with the appropriate target or non-target sequences, respectively. In this work, we performed a systematic kinetic analysis to evaluate the selectivity of bcr-abl-directed antisense RNA and hammerhead ribozymes with a length of the complementary sequences of between 20 and 80 bases. By kinetic in vitro selection, we identified oligomeric as well as long-chain complementary RNA that annealed at least tenfold faster with the bcr-abl sequence in comparison with either of the wild-type sequences bcr or abl, respectively. In the presence of selected oligodeoxynucleotide sequences and RNase H, the bcr-abl transcript was specifically hydrolysed out of a mixture containing abl and bcr sequences as well. Hammerhead ribozymes were designed such that binding with their target was facilitated either via helix I or helix III-forming antisense arms but not both. Further, cleavage and binding occurred on opposite sides of the bcr-abl fusion point. Target selectivity was found for a ribozyme that annealed fast via abl sequences and cleaved within the bcr portion of bcr-abl RNA. Kinetic probing and calculations of the local folding potential indicate that the bcr-abl fusion point sequences are not easily accessible for complementary nucleic acids. This study supports the need for more detailed structural investigations of the bcr-abl fusion sequence and forms a more rational basis for the therapeutic use of nucleic acid inhibitors of the aberrant bcr-abl gene expression in Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells.","['Kronenwett, R', 'Haas, R', 'Sczakiel, G']","['Kronenwett R', 'Haas R', 'Sczakiel G']","['Universitat Heidelberg Medizinische Klinik, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Mol Biol,Journal of molecular biology,2985088R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Catalytic)', '0 (RNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Double-Stranded)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/chemistry/metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'RNA, Catalytic/*metabolism', 'RNA, Complementary/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Double-Stranded/chemistry/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Ribonuclease H/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/21 00:00,1996/06/21 00:01,['1996/06/21 00:00'],"['1996/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Biol. 1996 Jun 21;259(4):632-44. doi: 10.1006/jmbi.1996.0345.,,"['S0022-2836(96)90345-9 [pii]', '10.1006/jmbi.1996.0345 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, however, no suitable bone marrow imaging method has been found. The present study investigates the usefulness of bone marrow immunoscintigraphy using 99mTc-labeled antigranulocyte antibody (anti-NCA-95) in 31 patients with hematologic disorders. METHODS: One milligram of antibody labeled with 259-370 MBq 99mTc was injected intravenously, and bone marrow images were taken 4 hr later. We also calculated the uptake ratios of lumbar bone marrow-to-background (L/B) and ilium-to-background (I/B). RESULTS: Of 15 patients with aplastic anemia, 7 showed diffusely decreased antibody uptake (L/B = 2.3 +/- 0.8, I/B = 3.0 +/- 0.8) compared to control patients (n = 21, L/B = 8.2 +/- 2.5, I/B = 10.3 +/- 3.1) Six patients had both decreased and increased uptake areas and two had normal to slightly increased uptake. Of those patients receiving various types of therapy for aplastic anemia, all but one showed increased or irregular uptake. The degree of antibody uptake in the bone marrow correlated with peripheral blood analyses (hemoglobin, white blood cells, platelets). Of six patients with myelodysplastic syndrome, four had irregular uptake and two diffusely decreased uptake. Four patients with myelogenous leukemia showed normal uptake, whereas two with lymphocytic leukemia had decreased uptake. Patients with iron deficiency anemia, pure red cell aplasia or thalassemia minor exhibited normal uptake with bone marrow expansion.

We previously established that the oral bioavailability of cladribine is 50%. Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of oral cladribine to previously untreated patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-three patients with symptomatic but previously untreated CLL received cladribine solution 10 mg/m2/d orally for 5 consecutive days in monthly courses. RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 24 patients (38%), and 23 patients (37%) had a partial response (PR). Most patients, including those in whom there was no remission (NR) achieved normal blood lymphocyte counts. Failure to meet response criteria was mostly due to thrombocytopenia. The median response duration was not reached at 2 years. The median survival time among 13 deceased patients was 322 days, whereas the median observation time of surviving patients is 760 days. The overall survival rate at 2 years is 82%. Response rate was associated with clinical stage. Grade III to IV infectious toxicity occurred in one third of patients. CONCLUSION: Orally administered cladribine is an effective and feasible therapy for CLL, and produces durable remissions in three quarters of the patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: GM-CSF was administered 5 micrograms/kg/d by continuous intravenous (i.v.) infusion during induction therapy with daunorubicin (DNR) (days 1 to 3) and cytarabine (ARA-C) (days 1 to 7). A total of 102 patients were randomized onto four arms, as follows: (1) GM-CSF 24 hours before and during chemotherapy (arm +/-); (2) GM-CSF after chemotherapy until day 28 or recovery of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) (arm -/+);(3) GM-CSF before, during, and after chemotherapy (arm +/+); or (4) no GM-CSF (arm -/-). Stopping rules were applied in case of an initial WBC count greater than 30 x 10(9)/L or a secondary increase of circulating blast cells. Analyses were performed according to the intention-to-treat principle. RESULTS: The complete remission (CR) rates were 77% (arm -/-), 72% (arm +/-), 48% (arm -/+), and 46% (arm +/+). Patients randomized to receive GM-CSF after induction (arms -/+ and +/+) had a significantly lower CR rate (P = .008) and a trend toward accelerated recovery of neutrophils, but no fewer infections or induction deaths. The lower CR rate appeared to be related to an increased resistance rate, with persistent leukemia. The main side effects of GM-CSF were fluid retention and hypotension. CONCLUSION: GM-CSF administered during induction treatment of AML with a DNR/Ara-C combination did not provide any clinical benefit. Furthermore, there was a significant decrease in the CR rate with more persistent leukemia when GM-CSF was administered during the hypoplastic phase after the chemotherapy courses.","['Zittoun, R', 'Suciu, S', 'Mandelli, F', 'de Witte, T', 'Thaler, J', 'Stryckmans, P', 'Hayat, M', 'Peetermans, M', 'Cadiou, M', 'Solbu, G', 'Petti, M C', 'Willemze, R']","['Zittoun R', 'Suciu S', 'Mandelli F', 'de Witte T', 'Thaler J', 'Stryckmans P', 'Hayat M', 'Peetermans M', 'Cadiou M', 'Solbu G', 'Petti MC', 'Willemze R']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hotel-Dieu, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced', 'Survival Rate']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Jul;14(7):2150-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.7.2150.,,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.7.2150 [doi]'],"['5U10-CA11488-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10-CA11488-20/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5U10-CA11488-21/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['J Clin Oncol. 1997 Feb;15(2):862-3.

The B19p6-Luc construct was introduced into KB and MB-02 cells, both in undifferentiated and differentiated states, either via DNA-mediated transfection, or via infection with recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV), a non-pathogenic human parvovirus known to possess a broad host-range. Although Luc activity was readily detected in KB cells following transfection of the B19p6-Luc plasmid DNA, no expression from the B19p6 promoter was observed following infection with recombinant virus. In addition, transfection of the reporter plasmid resulted in high-level expression of Luc in differentiated but not in undifferentiated MB-02 cells. However, no Luc activity was detected, even in differentiated MB-02 cells, following infection with recombinant virus. Further studies with an additional recombinant as well as wild-type (wt) AAV revealed that MB-02 cells were non-permissive for AAV infection. A second human megakaryocytic leukaemia cell line, M07e, was likewise resistant to infection by recombinant as well as wt AAV. Taken together, these studies identify the first human cell type that cannot be infected by AAV. They indicate that expression from the B19p6 promoter, in the context of an AAV genome, is restricted to primary human haematopoietic cells, perhaps because parvoviral DNA replication and transcription are intrinsically coupled.","['Ponnazhagan, S', 'Wang, X S', 'Woody, M J', 'Luo, F', 'Kang, L Y', 'Nallari, M L', 'Munshi, N C', 'Zhou, S Z', 'Srivastava, A']","['Ponnazhagan S', 'Wang XS', 'Woody MJ', 'Luo F', 'Kang LY', 'Nallari ML', 'Munshi NC', 'Zhou SZ', 'Srivastava A']","['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5120, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,"['0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Cytomegalovirus/physiology', 'Dependovirus/genetics/*physiology', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'KB Cells', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/genetics/*physiology', 'Plasmids', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Simian virus 40/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Virus Replication']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1996 Jun;77 ( Pt 6):1111-22. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-77-6-1111.,,['10.1099/0022-1317-77-6-1111 [doi]'],"['AI-26323/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-48342/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-53586/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used AKR-PM as a model to further define the role of IFN-alpha beta in modulation of induction of macrophage nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in response to lipid A. Studies have revealed that AKR-PM produced a significantly lower level of IFN-alpha beta than responsive C3H-PM in response to lipid A. AKR-PM failed to increase NOS mRNA synthesis and NO generation when exposed to lipid A, although they had normal levels of TNF-alpha bioactivity and mRNA expression. This partial deficiency of AKR-PM to lipid A stimulation was reconstituted completely by exogenous IFN-alpha beta for both synthesis of NOS mRNA and release of NO. The failure of AKR-PM to produce NOS to lipid A stimulation appears to be related to reduced secretion of IFN-alpha beta and the resultant failure to express TNF-alpha type II receptor (TNF-RII) mRNA, which in turn decreases TNF-alpha binding to its receptor for autocrine induction of NOS. Insufficient synthesis and secretion of endogenous IFN-alpha beta may be the primary reason for AKR-PM refractoriness to induction of NOS in response to lipid A. furthermore, the close correlation between lack of IFN-alpha beta secretion and decreased TNF-RII mRNA synthesis may implicate a critical role for IFN-alpha beta in the upregulation of macrophage TNF-RII receptor expression for autocrine induction of NOS during lipid A stimulation.","['Jiang, H', 'Rummage, J A', 'Zhou, A', 'Chen, Z', 'Herriot, M J', 'Stewart, C A', 'Kolosov, M', 'Leu, R W']","['Jiang H', 'Rummage JA', 'Zhou A', 'Chen Z', 'Herriot MJ', 'Stewart CA', 'Kolosov M', 'Leu RW']","['Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Noble Center for Biomedical Research, Oklahoma City 73104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Lipid A)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '77238-31-4 (Interferon-beta)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Fibrosarcoma', 'Interferon-alpha/biosynthesis/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-beta/biosynthesis/immunology/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Lipid A/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/*enzymology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nitric Oxide/biosynthesis/toxicity', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/biosynthesis/*deficiency', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jul 1;157(1):305-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present report we used this system to investigate the role of ceramide in TNF action. We found that while maximum DNA fragmentation response was induced by 1 nM TNF, the synthetic membrane-permeable C-2, C-6, and C-8 ceramides had no effect even up to 40 microM concentration. To investigate the roles of ceramide in TNF action, we used ((2-isopropyl-1-(4-[3-N-methyl-N-(3,4-dimethoxy-phenethyl)amino] propyloxy)benzenesulfonyl))indolizine (SR33557), a potent inhibitor of acidic but not neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase). Even though ceramides by themselves did not mimic TNF, we found that SR33557 inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis and the addition of ceramide reversed this effect, indicating that ceramide generated by acidic SMase is involved in TNF action. The addition of SR33557 to cells at 0 or at 30 min after TNF treatment showed inhibition, but the addition 60 min later had no effect, indicating that an SR33557-sensitive step is located between 30 and 60 min of signal transduction. Since ceramide has been shown to play a role in TNF-mediated activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), we examined the effect of SR33557 on this early cellular response of TNF. Surprisingly, this inhibitor of ceramide production was found to have no effect on TNF-mediated NF-kappa B activation, thus suggesting that SR33557-sensitive acidic SMase is not involved in this process. From these results, we concluded that ceramide is needed for certain TNF-mediated cellular responses, but it alone may not be sufficient.","['Higuchi, M', 'Singh, S', 'Jaffrezou, J P', 'Aggarwal, B B']","['Higuchi M', 'Singh S', 'Jaffrezou JP', 'Aggarwal BB']","['Cytokine Research Laboratory, Department of Molecular Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phenethylamines)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.1.4.12 (Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase)', 'KU213XYO69 (fantofarone)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Base Sequence', 'Ceramides/*biosynthesis/*physiology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/immunology', 'Humans', 'Indolizines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology/immunology/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*biosynthesis', 'Phenethylamines/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jul 1;157(1):297-304.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These ligands were isolated from three pools of oligonucleotides, each representing 10(15) molecules: two pools contained 2'-NH2 pyrimidine-modified RNA with either 40 or 60 randomized sequence positions, and the third pool contained ssDNA with 40 randomized sequence positions. Based on sequence and structure similarities, these oligonucleotide IgE ligands were grouped into three families: 2'-NH2 RNA group A ligands are represented by the 35-nucleotide truncate IGEL1.2 (Kd = 30 nM); 2'-NH2 RNA group B ligands by the 25-nucleotide truncate IGEL2.2 (Kd = 35 nM); and the ssDNA group ligands by the 37-nucleotide truncate DI 7.4 (Kd = 10nM). Secondary structure analysis suggests G quartets for the 2'-NH2 RNA ligands, whereas the ssDNA ligands appear to form stem-loop structures. Using rat basophilic leukemia cells transfected with the human high-affinity IgE receptor Fc epsilon RI, we demonstrate that ligands IGEL1.2 and D17.4 competitively inhibit the interaction of human IgE with Fc1 epsilon RI.

The 1071-bp cDNA contains all sequences of IC exons and encodes the 37-kDa Fc gamma RIIB1 isoform. The 930-bp cDNA lacks sequences of the first IC exon and encodes the 30-kDa Fc gamma RIIB2 isoform.

When stably transfected in the lymphoma B cells IIA1.6, or in the mast cells RBL-2H3, this cDNA encoded 32-kDa Fc gamma RIIB whose biologic properties were undistinguishable from those of Fc gamma RIIB1: they inhibited B cell activation when coaggregated to B cell receptors and capped when aggregated at 37 degrees C, but failed to mediate endocytosis or phagocytosis. Sequences responsible for capping and inhibition of internalization, previously assigned to sequences encoded by the first IC exon, can thus be mapped in the 19 N-terminal residues. These residues are highly conserved in human Fc gamma RIIB1. The 87-bp first IC exon of the human gene ends by a single splice site in the downstream intron and encodes a 19-amino acid insertion.

The simultaneous addition of CD45 mAb with an activating OKT3 mAb had little effect on TCR-stimulated signals. However, when Jurkat cells were exposed to the CD45 mAb for 10 to 20 min before the addition of OKT3, a partial uncoupling of the TCR from intracellular signals was observed. The maximal increase in intracellular calcium was inhibited 47 +/- 10% (n = 11, range 33-67%), whereas no inhibition of inositol trisphosphate production was detected. The transient TCR-mediated activation of the Ca2+/calmodulin-activated kinase IV/Gr was also inhibited by the CD45 mAb, and this was reflected in a 50 to 60% inhibition in the TCR-stimulated generation of the p21 and p23 phosphoisomers of oncoprotein 18, a Ca2+/calmodulin-activated kinase IV/Gr substrate recently implicated in cell cycle regulatory events. Oncoprotein 18 is also a substrate for mitogen- activated protein kinase, but no inhibition by the CD45 mAb of TCR-triggered mitogen-activated protein kinase activation was observed. The CD45 mAb was therefore selective in causing the uncoupling of the TCR from calcium signals and calcium-regulated events without promoting a general inhibition of all TCR-mediated signals. Confocal microscopy revealed that binding of the CD45 mAb caused patching of CD45 molecules at the cell surface and, unexpectedly, a marked redistribution of intracellular CD45.

There have been no publications on this subject with special emphasis on survival. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to determine the cause of the erythroderma and the prognosis of these patients. METHODS: Clinical and follow-up data from 102 patients with erythroderma were analyzed. We estimated survival of patients with erythroderma, from causes other than Sezary syndrome, mycosis fungoides, or leukemia cutis. The survival was compared with that of an age-matched control group of the general population. RESULTS: The main cause of erythroderma was exacerbation of a preexisting dermatosis (53%). Drug reactions were rarely the cause (5%). A high proportion of the patients had chronic actinic dermatitis/actinic reticuloid (12%). Survival of men with erythroderma was significantly lower than that of the general population. CONCLUSION: Men with erythroderma, from causes other than Sezary syndrome, mycosis fungoides, or leukemia cutis, have a lower survival than men in the general population.","['Sigurdsson, V', 'Toonstra, J', 'Hezemans-Boer, M', 'van Vloten, W A']","['Sigurdsson V', 'Toonstra J', 'Hezemans-Boer M', 'van Vloten WA']","['Department of Dermatology, University Hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Am Acad Dermatol,Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology,7907132,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dermatitis, Exfoliative/*etiology/pathology', 'Drug Eruptions/complications', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides', 'Netherlands', 'Photosensitivity Disorders/complications', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors', 'Sezary Syndrome', 'Skin Diseases/complications', 'Skin Neoplasms', 'Survival Rate']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Am Acad Dermatol. 1996 Jul;35(1):53-7. doi: 10.1016/s0190-9622(96)90496-x.,,"['S0190-9622(96)90496-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0190-9622(96)90496-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical and neuropathological features of HAM rat disease generally mimic those of HAM/TSP in humans, although T-cell infiltration is absent in the affected spinal cord lesions in the case of HAM rat disease.

Each locus is believed to account for approximately 40% of cases of familial breast cancer. We used linkage and haplotype analysis with simple tandem repeat polymorphisms at chromosomal bands 17q21 and 13q12 to determine the contribution of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes to predisposition to breast cancer in four Australian breast cancer kindreds, one of which had two male cousins with breast cancer. Surprisingly all families segregated a haplotype of markers on 13q and showed positive lod scores supporting linkage to BRCA2. In addition, haplotype analysis identified an informative recombination between D13S260 and D13S171 in one affected individual, which refines the localisation of BRCA2 to between D13S260 and D13S267; a distance of 2-3 cM. Tumours of the stomach and cervix, as well as melanoma and leukaemia/lymphoma also occur in these pedigrees but the numbers are too low to determine whether they may be significantly associated with BRCA2 carrier status. Our results confirm the existence of BRCA2 on the long arm of chromosome 13 and support previous findings that this locus is likely to confer risk in families with affected males.

Here, we examined which mechanisms lead to upregulation of Sp100 gene expression and whether IFNs also increase expression of the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene. We found that both mRNA and protein levels of PML are also strongly upregulated by IFNs. In addition, new Sp100 and PML proteins were detected immunologically after IFN treatment of cells. Nuclear run-on analysis revealed protein-synthesis-independent, rapid IFN-enhanced transcription rates as well as synergistic activation of the Sp100 and PML genes by type-I and type-II IFNs.

This novel use of homologous recombination formally proves that chromosomal translocations contribute to malignancy and provides a general strategy to create fusion oncogenes for studying their role in tumorigenesis.","['Corral, J', 'Lavenir, I', 'Impey, H', 'Warren, A J', 'Forster, A', 'Larson, T A', 'Bell, S', 'McKenzie, A N', 'King, G', 'Rabbitts, T H']","['Corral J', 'Lavenir I', 'Impey H', 'Warren AJ', 'Forster A', 'Larson TA', 'Bell S', 'McKenzie AN', 'King G', 'Rabbitts TH']","['Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLLT3 protein, human)', '0 (Mllt3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chimera', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Targeting', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oncogenes/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/analysis', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Spleen/chemistry', 'Stem Cells', 'Thymus Gland/chemistry', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",1996/06/14 00:00,1996/06/14 00:01,['1996/06/14 00:00'],"['1996/06/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/14 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell. 1996 Jun 14;85(6):853-61. doi: 10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81269-6.,,"['S0092-8674(00)81269-6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0092-8674(00)81269-6 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the virion core, several hundred NCp10 molecules are bound to the genomic RNA dimer forming the nucleocapsid structure. In the course of virus assembly, NC protein, as the mature NCp10 and/or as the gag precursor, appears to direct genomic RNA packaging. In vitro, NCp10 has nucleic acid binding and annealing activities and promotes viral RNA dimerization and the annealing of replication primer tRNAPro to the primer binding site (PBS) which is necessary for the initiation of reverse transcription. To investigate whether maturation of NCp10 is required for virus formation, we substituted charged residues for the hydrophobic amino acids at the capsid-nucleocapsid protein cleavage site in order to prevent maturation of NCp10. Here we report that these mutations abolished maturation of capsid protein CAp30 and NCp10 by the viral protease in vitro. When these mutations were introduced into an infectious MoMuLV molecular clone, Pr65gag precursor was synthesized in transfected cells but virion production was strongly diminished and mutant viruses were not infectious. These results suggest that maturation of NCp10 is required for optimal virion release and production of infectious virus.","['Housset, V', 'Darlix, J L']","['Housset V', 'Darlix JL']","['Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, centre de recherche de Vitry-Alfortville, Vitry-sur-Seine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",France,C R Acad Sci III,"Comptes rendus de l'Academie des sciences.

In a first experiment, C57BL/6 mice were infected with a single i.p. administration of LP-BM5 and treated with 0.125 or 0.25 mg/ml AZT in drinking water for 3 months. AZT treatment was found to reduce lymphadenopathy (60 and 65 percent, respectively), splenomegaly (37 and 50 percent, respectively), and hypergammaglobulinemia (6 and 50 percent, respectively). Furthermore, at the highest AZT concentration, BM5d proviral DNA content in lymph nodes and in the spleen showed a reduction of 78 and 70 percent, respectively, compared to untreated animals. In a second experiment, infected mice were treated with AZT (0.25 mg/ml in drinking water) and with 2',3'-dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (ddCTP) encapsulated into autologous erythrocytes for macrophage protection. Combined treatments resulted in a further reduction of lymphadenopathy (a further 33 percent with respect to the single treatment of AZT) and splenomegaly (a further 28 percent respect to the single treatment of AZT) but not of gammaglobulinemia. Proviral DNA in lymph nodes and spleen showed a reduction of 82 and 77 percent, respectively, compared to infected mice. Stimulation index of T cells was also significantly increased in animals receiving both treatments versus AZT only. In conclusion, the selective administration of antiviral drugs that preferentially protect different cell types seems to provide additional advantages compared to single-agent therapy.","['Fraternale, A', 'Casabianca, A', 'Rossi, L', 'Chiarantini, L', 'Brandi, G', 'Aluigi, G', 'Schiavano, G F', 'Magnani, M']","['Fraternale A', 'Casabianca A', 'Rossi L', 'Chiarantini L', 'Brandi G', 'Aluigi G', 'Schiavano GF', 'Magnani M']","['Istituto di Chimica Biologica ""Giorgio Fornaini"", University of Urbino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol,Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes and human retrovirology : official publication of the International Retrovirology Association,9501482,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Dideoxynucleotides)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', ""66004-77-1 (2',3'-dideoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/*administration & dosage', 'Dideoxynucleotides', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Lymph Nodes/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*drug therapy/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proviruses/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Spleen/virology', 'Zidovudine/*administration & dosage']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr Hum Retrovirol. 1996 Jun 1;12(2):164-73. doi: 10.1097/00042560-199606010-00010.,,['10.1097/00042560-199606010-00010 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate whether an alteration in the mechanisms involved in the process of apoptosis could contribute to cellular resistance, induction of apoptosis was studied in a cisplatin-resistant cell line (L1210/DDP) derived from a L1210 murine leukemia cell line (L1210/0). We first established that the mutant cell line resisted 5-azacytidine, a drug to which it was never exposed and which is known to have a very different mechanism of action from that of cisplatin. We then showed that these cells did not exhibit any DNA fragmentation or morphological changes typical of apoptosis, when exposed to toxic concentrations of either cisplatin or 5-azacytidine. The failure of these cells to undergo typical apoptosis upon cisplatin or 5-azacytidine exposure was correlated with the lack of a nuclear endonuclease activity present in wild type cell nuclei. However, staurosporine, a potent protein kinase C inhibitor, which exerted the same toxicity on both cell lines, induced the internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and morphological features of apoptosis in both of them. This indicates that a functional pathway for apoptosis is preserved in the resistant cells. The induction of this pathway can be correlated with the presence of a cytoplamic endonuclease activity whose specificity seems different from that operating in L1210/0 cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that the mechanisms which control activation of apoptosis in L1210/0 cells differ from those which operate in L1210/DDP cells. One of the differences concerns the nature and the subcellular localization of the endonuclease activity possibly involved in the internucleosomal DNA cleavage.","['Segal-Bendirdjian, E', 'Jacquemin-Sablon, A']","['Segal-Bendirdjian E', 'Jacquemin-Sablon A']","['Unite de physicochimie et pharmacologie des macromolecules biologiques (URA147), Villejuif, France.']",['fre'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",France,Bull Cancer,Bulletin du cancer,0072416,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endonucleases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/toxicity', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Azacitidine/toxicity', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*toxicity', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/drug effects', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Endonucleases/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Staurosporine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bull Cancer. 1996 May;83(5):371-8.,37,['0007-4551(96)88931-4 [pii]'],,,Resistance au cisplatine d'une lignee de leucemie murine associee a un defaut d'apoptose.,,,,,,,,,,,,

When MEL cells were exposed to inhibitors of RNA methylation (neplanocin A, 3-deazaneplanocin A and cycloleucine) and assessed for their ability to differentiate by DMSO, accumulate RNA transcripts, produce hemoglobin, methylate poly(A)+ and poly(A)- RNA and synthesize S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), we observed the following: (a) MEL cells treated with DMSO underwent hypermethylation in poly(A)+ RNA that preferentially occurred at the 5'-cap structures (7-methylguanosine and 2'-O-methylcytidine and 2'-O-methyluridine); (b) inducer-treated MEL cells exhibited a decrease in the intracellular level of SAH that led to a lower ratio of SAH/SAM, an event that favors methylation; and (c) treatment of MEL cells with inhibitors of RNA methylation suppressed methylation of poly(A)- and poly(A)+ RNA, reversed the ratio SAH/SAM seen in differentiated MEL cells and prevented differentiation to occur. Moreover, we observed that treatment of MEL cells with selective inhibitors of RNA methylation caused fragmentation of beta major globin and c-myc mRNAs, two RNA transcripts coded by developmentally regulated genes, while had no detectable effect on the structural integrity of poly(A)+ RNA transcripts transcribed by two housekeeping genes (beta-actin and MER5). These data indicate that induction of erythroid cell differentiation of MEL cells is associated with changes in methylation of poly(A)+ RNA and selective differential stability of RNA transcripts, two events that might be related to each other.","['Vizirianakis, I S', 'Tsiftsoglou, A S']","['Vizirianakis IS', 'Tsiftsoglou AS']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Prdx3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA Caps)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', '0TQU7668EI (Cycloleucine)', '544SH4020S (3-deazaneplanocin)', '72877-50-0 (neplanocin A)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'EC 1.11.1.- (Peroxidases)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxin III)', 'EC 1.11.1.15 (Peroxiredoxins)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Actins/genetics', 'Adenosine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cycloleucine/pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology/metabolism', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Globins/genetics', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Methylation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Peroxidases', 'Peroxiredoxin III', 'Peroxiredoxins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'RNA Caps/chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Ribonucleotides/analysis/chemistry', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/metabolism', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/05 00:00,1996/06/05 00:01,['1996/06/05 00:00'],"['1996/06/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996 Jun 5;1312(1):8-20. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(96)00012-2.,,"['0167-4889(96)00012-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(96)00012-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In each case, DNA damage sites were determined at nucleotide resolution in the human single-copy beta-globin promoter and the locus control region (LCR) hypersensitive site 2 (HS-2). Exponential amplification of gene-specific genomic fragments was achieved by ligation-mediated PCR, and labeled reaction products were analyzed directly by sequencing gel electrophoresis. Bleomycin was found to cleave DNA preferentially at GC, GT, and GA dinucleotides. This study represents the first occasion that the sequence specificity of bleomycin has been determined in intact human cells at the single-copy gene level. The intensity of bleomycin damage sites in the LCR HS-2 was found to differ substantially between intact cells and purified DNA at putative transcription factor binding sites. Bleomycin activity was greatly reduced in cells at a tandem NF-E2/AP1 DNA sequence element. This footprint was strongest in K562 cells where the nuclear factor-erythroid 2 (NF-E2) is thought to bind. Protection and enhancement were also observed at other sequence elements in the HS-2 that associate with erythroid-specific and ubiquitous transcription factors. These results suggest that the activity of bleomycin is significantly reduced at the site of protein-DNA interactions in intact cells. This property of bleomycin is extremely useful in genomic ""footprinting"", where it has significant advantages over other commonly used agents.","['Cairns, M J', 'Murray, V']","['Cairns MJ', 'Murray V']","['School of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11056-06-7 (Bleomycin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'Bleomycin/*pharmacology', 'Chromatin/*chemistry', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Globins/*genetics', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factor AP-1/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",1996/07/02 00:00,1996/07/02 00:01,['1996/07/02 00:00'],"['1996/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1996 Jul 2;35(26):8753-60. doi: 10.1021/bi9600207.,,"['10.1021/bi9600207 [doi]', 'bi9600207 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1995) Biochemistry 34, 9785-9794]. In order to identify other contributions of the PSI structure to RNA dimerization, we studied the kinetics of dimerization as a function of salt concentration of short RNA transcripts comprising or not the autocomplementary sequence C283-G298. We propose that, apart from the crucial role of this sequence in RNA dimerization, the 364-565 domain of PSI can interfere, in vitro, with the initiation of dimer formation. Intermolecular loop-loop recognitions involving the 364-565 domain could stabilize, in a salt concentration-dependent manner, a transient RNA dimer built around the loop-loop U288-A293 interaction. This dimer evolves toward a more stable structure which mainly corresponds to the annealing of two C283-G298 sequences. We also show that chemically synthesized NCp10 does not modify these steps but rather helps the system to pass over the energy barriers associated with the transition to stable RNA structures comprising the stem-loop C278-G303. Data obtained in the presence of NCp10 suggest a binding site size of 9 +/- 1 nucleotides per protein at 37 degrees C and a 10-20-fold increase in the rate constant (i.e., k1 = 24 000 +/- 7000 M-1 s-1) of dimer formation.","['Girard, P M', 'de Rocquigny, H', 'Roques, B P', 'Paoletti, J']","['Girard PM', 'de Rocquigny H', 'Roques BP', 'Paoletti J']","['Unite de Biochimie, URA 147 CNRS, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '129924-33-0 (retroviral nucleocapsid protein NCp10, Moloney murine leukemia', 'virus)', '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Gene Products, gag/*chemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligonucleotides/pharmacology', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry/drug effects', 'Sodium Chloride', 'Temperature', 'Viral Core Proteins/*chemistry']",1996/07/02 00:00,1996/07/02 00:01,['1996/07/02 00:00'],"['1996/07/02 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/02 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/02 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1996 Jul 2;35(26):8705-14. doi: 10.1021/bi952454s.,,"['10.1021/bi952454s [doi]', 'bi952454s [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The chimeric strand of this duplex consists of the last four residues of the tRNA(Pro) primer for (-) strand DNA synthesis of Moloney murine leukemia virus and the first five residues of the (-) strand DNA produced by extending this primer; the complementary DNA strand corresponds to the (+) strand product from this template. The hybrid section of this chimeric duplex assumes a structure similar to that found for pure hybrid duplexes of mixed sequence, while the DNA section assumes a conformation closer to B-form DNA. There is significant distortion of the duplex at the hybrid-DNA junction which is manifested in marked changes in the helical parameters buckle, roll, and tip, changes in glycosidic torsion angles, and changes in the backbone torsion angles delta, epsilon, and zeta. The sugar conformations also undergo large changes, from heteromerous puckers in the hybrid section to a more B-form in the DNA section. Furthermore, the intrastrand phosphate separation in the chimeric strand is more typical of A-form duplexes in the RNA section but more like B-form duplexes in the DNA section. In the DNA section the minor groove width changes gradually from B-form at the periphery and approaches hybrid-like dimensions closer to the junction. The structural discontinuities act synergistically to produce a bend of 18 +/- 3 degrees at the junction. The global structure of this sequence is similar to that previously found in the chemically analogous Okazaki fragment r(gcg)d(TATACCC).d(GGGTATACGC) in solution. Such structure homology suggests a possible link between structure and function with respect to the recognition and cleavage of the junction RNA residues in both retroviral chimeras and Okazaki fragments during reverse transcription and normal DNA replication.","['Salazar, M', 'Fedoroff, O Y', 'Reid, B R']","['Salazar M', 'Fedoroff OY', 'Reid BR']","['Drug Dynamics Institute, College of Pharmacy, University of Texas at Austin, 78712, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Okazaki fragments)', '0 (RNA, Transfer, Pro)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Solutions)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Computer Simulation', 'DNA/*chemistry', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*chemistry', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'RNA, Transfer, Pro/chemistry', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry', 'Solutions']",1996/06/25 00:00,1996/06/25 00:01,['1996/06/25 00:00'],"['1996/06/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1996 Jun 25;35(25):8126-35. doi: 10.1021/bi9528917.,,"['10.1021/bi9528917 [doi]', 'bi9528917 [pii]']","['GM-32681/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-42896/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rex acts posttranscriptionally to enhance cytoplasmic accumulation of incompletely spliced viral mRNAs encoding structural proteins. We report a distinct negative regulatory function mediated by Rex affecting expression from the viral 5' LTR. Using both LTR-driven CAT reporters and a full-length HTLV-II proviral construct, we demonstrate that Rex decreases total cellular levels of LTR-containing mRNA in a dose-dependent manner. Negative regulation is an independent function as demonstrated by structural and functional dissociation from Rex positive posttranscriptional regulation. This negative regulatory action was dependent on nuclear localization sequences, but did not require the previously defined Rex-responsive element (RxRE). Negative regulation was observed in T cell lines but not in B cell lines, suggesting the involvement of cell type-specific factors distinct from those involved in posttranscriptional regulation. An internal deletion mutant of Rex removing aa 38-80 retained the ability to repress, but did not posttranscriptionally increase expression, while negative regulation requires a previously uncharacterized carboxy-terminal region (aa 154-170). These findings suggest that Rex may serve two simultaneous functions: to decrease overall levels of transcribed viral mRNA, and to facilitate nuclear to cytoplasmic export of mRNAs encoding structural proteins.

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is capable of establishing a latent infection in syncytiotrophoblast cells, with restriction of gene expression to immediate-early and early proteins. We analyzed the extent of replication of human T cell leukemia-lymphoma virus type I (HTLV-I) in human term syncytiotrophoblasts infected with HTLV-I alone or coinfected with HTLV-I and HCMV. Although syncytiotrophoblasts could be infected with cell-free HTLV-I, no viral protein expression was found in the singly infected cells. On the contrary, coinfection of the cells with HTLV-I and HCMV resulted in simultaneous replication of both viruses. Bidirectional enhancing activities between HTLV-I and HCMV were mediated primarily by the Tax and immediate-early proteins, respectively. The stimulatory effect of HTLV-I Tax on HCMV replication appeared to be mediated partly by tumor necrosis factor beta and transforming growth factor beta-1. We observed formation of pseudotypes with HTLV-I nucleocapsids within HCMV envelopes, whereas HCMV was not pseudotyped by HTLV-I envelopes in dually infected syncytiotrophoblast cells. Our data suggest that in vivo dual infection of syncytiotrophoblast cells with HTLV-I and HCMV may facilitate the transplacental transmission of both viruses.","['Toth, F D', 'Aboagye-Mathiesen, G', 'Szabo, J', 'Liu, X', 'Mosborg-Petersen, P', 'Kiss, J', 'Hager, H', 'Zdravkovic, M', 'Andirko, I', 'Aranyosi, J']","['Toth FD', 'Aboagye-Mathiesen G', 'Szabo J', 'Liu X', 'Mosborg-Petersen P', 'Kiss J', 'Hager H', 'Zdravkovic M', 'Andirko I', 'Aranyosi J', 'et al.']","['Department of Virus and Cancer, Danish Cancer Society, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses,AIDS research and human retroviruses,8709376,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Cytomegalovirus/*growth & development/pathogenicity', 'Gene Products, tax/physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/immunology/physiology', 'Immune Sera', 'Interleukin-2/immunology/physiology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/immunology/physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Placenta/*virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/immunology/physiology', 'Virus Latency', 'Virus Replication']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. 1995 Dec;11(12):1495-1507. doi: 10.1089/aid.1995.11.1495.,,['10.1089/aid.1995.11.1495 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the last 10 years, orthotopic cardiac transplantation has been our preferred treatment for infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome. METHODS: One hundred seventy-six infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome were entered into a cardiac transplant protocol between November 1985 and November 1995. Interventional procedures to stent the ductus arteriosus or enlarge the interatrial communication were performed in 8 and 35 patients, respectively. Thirty-four patients (19%) died during the waiting period, and 142 infants underwent cardiac transplantation. Age at cardiac transplantation ranged from 1.5 hours to 6 months (median, 29 days). The majority of grafts were oversized, and the median graft ischemic time was 273 minutes (range, 60 to 576 minutes). The implantation procedure used a period of hypothermic circulatory arrest ranging from 23 to 110 minutes (median, 53 minutes). Repair of other significant defects included interrupted aortic arch and total or partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection. RESULTS: There were 13 early and 22 late deaths. Patient actuarial survival at 1 month and at 1, 5 and 7 years was 91%, 84%, 76%, and 70% respectively. Half of the late deaths were due to rejection. Severe graft vasculopathy was confirmed in 8 patients. Retransplantation was performed in 5 patients for graft vasculopathy 4 and rejection 1. Lymphoblastic leukemia developed in 1 patient 3 years after cardiac transplantation. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac transplantation can be performed in infants with hypoplastic left heart syndrome with good operative and intermediate-term results. Improved survival can be achieved with increased donor availability, better management of rejection, and control of graft vasculopathy.","['Razzouk, A J', 'Chinnock, R E', 'Gundry, S R', 'Johnston, J K', 'Larsen, R L', 'Baum, M F', 'Mulla, N F', 'Bailey, L L']","['Razzouk AJ', 'Chinnock RE', 'Gundry SR', 'Johnston JK', 'Larsen RL', 'Baum MF', 'Mulla NF', 'Bailey LL']","['Department of Surgery, Loma Linda University School of Medicine, California, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Ann Thorac Surg,The Annals of thoracic surgery,15030100R,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Coronary Disease/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection/epidemiology/therapy', '*Heart Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome/mortality/*surgery', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Postoperative Complications/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Quality of Life', 'Reoperation', 'Time Factors']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Thorac Surg. 1996 Jul;62(1):1-7; discussion 8. doi: 10.1016/0003-4975(96)00295-0.,,"['0003497596002950 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-4975(96)00295-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concordance between scales, as judged by comparison of parallel formats, was statistically significant but poor. A questionnaire was then elaborated with similar items, based on a categorical scale. A direct comparison between LAS and our questionnaire was made on a group of 41 patients. Internal consistency was poor for the LAS (alpha = 0.58) and good for the questionnaire (alpha = 0.93); Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were disappointing for the LAS and good for the questionnaire; the questionnaire was judged reliable in 82.9% of cases, the LAS in 29.3% only; the questionnaire score, and not the LAS score, was significantly correlated with PS and disease status.

A further decrease of total cholesterol and LDL-C was found in nonresponders and in ANLL responders treated with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), known for its cholesterol-lowering action; in fact after the completion of GM-CSF therapy, these parameters returned progressively toward normal values. In ALL responders an increase of total cholesterol, HDL-C and apolipoprotein A1 with a simultaneous decrease of triglycerides and VLDL-C is evident; no variation was found in the nonresponder group.

Patients had also very low mitogen-induced cellular cytotoxicity. Their absolute numbers of peripheral blood CD16+, CD57+, CD3+, and CD8+ cells were significantly increased.

However, B-CLL NK cells released tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) following stimulation with PHA. We concluded that defective NKa in B-CLL patients is probably the result of an impairment in the production and/or release of soluble cytolytic mediators, but not of TNF-alpha by NK cells.

Evidence from recent in vitro and in vivo experiments suggests that damage by slowly proliferating cells of the hematopoietic microenvironment contributes to the sustained survival of irradiation-damaged hematopoietic progenitor cells/stem cells and can contribute to the selection and proliferation of a malignant clone. The molecular mechanism of the interaction of irradiated stromal cells with attached hematopoietic cells has been difficult to evaluate. Irradiated bone marrow stromal cell line D2XRII demonstrated altered patterns of fibronectin splicing and increased expression of several transcriptional splice variants of macrophage-colony-stimulating factor. Differential display has revealed specific radiation-induced gene transcripts which persist after irradiation of stromal cells in vitro or in vivo. In recent experiments, we demonstrated that irradiation of mouse bone marrow stromal cell line D2XRII induces release of significant levels of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta into the tissue culture medium despite the lack of a detectable increase in TGF-beta mRNA. Since TGF-beta is known to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS), we tested how a target hematopoietic cell line, responsive to ROS by up-regulation of a transgene for an antioxidant protein, responded to cocultivation with irradiated bone marrow stromal cells. Bone marrow stromal cell line GPIa/GBL, derived from long-term bone marrow culture of a C57BL/6J-GPIa mouse, was irradiated in vitro and then cocultured with the interleukin (IL)-3-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell line 32D cl 3, or with each of several subclonal lines expressing a transgene for human manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). Cobblestone island formation, as a measure of adherence and proliferation by 32D-MnSOD clones in the presence or absence of IL-3, was increased with irradiated compared to control GPIa cells. Furthermore, using a fluorescent dye which detects ROS, hematopoietic cells cocultivated with irradiated stromal cells demonstrated higher levels of intracellular ROS than cells cocultivated and forming cobblestone islands on nonirradiated stromal cells. Since ROS are known to induce mutations in hot spots in the p53 gene, it appears worthwhile to investigate a potential mechanism for irradiated stromal cell induction of hematopoietic stem cell transformation through ROS-induced mutations. The present cell culture and molecular biology techniques provide new methods to analyze the effects of irradiated stromal cells on closely attached hematopoietic stem cells during irradiation leukemogenesis.","['Greenberger, J S', 'Epperly, M W', 'Jahroudi, N', 'Pogue-Geile, K L', 'Berry, L', 'Bray, J', 'Goltry, K L']","['Greenberger JS', 'Epperly MW', 'Jahroudi N', 'Pogue-Geile KL', 'Berry L', 'Bray J', 'Goltry KL']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/radiation effects', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'RNA/analysis/radiation effects', 'Staining and Labeling/methods', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/radiation effects', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics', 'Time Factors', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/analysis/radiation effects', 'Transgenes/genetics/radiation effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1996;96(1):1-15. doi: 10.1159/000203708.,,['10.1159/000203708 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SCF on its own cannot drive noncycling hematopoietic progenitor cells into the cell cycle but does prevent their apoptotic death. SCF when combined with other cytokines increases the cloning efficacy of hematopoietic progenitor cells from all lineages. SCF also stimulates the growth of CD34+ leukemic progenitor cells from most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The mRNA expression of the SCF receptor c-kit has been shown to be significantly increased in all fresh AML blast cells compared with normal controls (healthy volunteers), in particular CD34+ cells. Two inhibitory cytokines, transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-4, decreased c-kit expression, whereas tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased c-kit expression, but chemotherapeutic drugs showed no effect on c-kit expression, but chemotherapeutic drugs showed no effect on c-kit expression in AML cells. Apoptosis has been shown to be directly related to a high complete remission rate in AML patients following induction therapy. Since SCF has been shown to stimulate the proliferation of mainly CD34+ AML cells, we have investigated whether the poor response of patients with CD34+ myeloid leukemia cells to chemotherapy could be due to SCF-induced resistance to apoptosis. The effect of SCF on the apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used in the treatment of AML - cytarabine, daunorubicin and carboplatin - was examined in human CD34+ myeloid leukemia cells in serum-free cultures. SCF significantly reduced the induced apoptosis by more than 50% in all CD34+ human leukemia cells treated by any of the three chemotherapeutic drugs. Antibodies blocking c-kit reversed the significant inhibitory effect of SCF on chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, confirming the role of SCF in the resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in CD34+ human leukemia. These results suggest that the poor response of patients with CD34+ leukemia cells could be at least partially due to less chemotherapy-induced apoptosis resulting from protection by SCF as an adjuvant mechanism for drug resistance in myeloid leukemia. We conclude that an antisense strategy to block c-kit expression in AML blast cells may prove valuable for decreasing the chemoresistance of AML patients. The abrogation of leukemic resistance to apoptotic death through anti-SCF/c-pit expression combined with chemotherapy offers potential for designing novel therapeutic approaches for refractory AML patients.","['Hassan, H T', 'Zander, A']","['Hassan HT', 'Zander A']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hamburg University Hospital Eppendorf, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Diseases/*pathology', '*Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/genetics', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology/*physiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1996;95(3-4):257-62. doi: 10.1159/000203893.,50,['10.1159/000203893 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retrovirus infection was confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction for detecting viral genome expression of the p12 envelope glycoprotein. The ability of these cell lines to support in vitro hematopoiesis was evaluated. The results demonstrated that when cocultured with normal or infected nonadherent mononuclear cells, noninfected cell lines efficiently supported the production of hematopoietic progenitors, whereas in virus-infected progenitors was suppressed. Expression of cytokine genes in stromal cell lines was also examined. All cell lines expressed equivalent levels of transcripts for interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, interferon, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and stem cell factor. However, infection was associated with higher expression of IL-4 and transforming growth factor-beta 1.

Graft rejection can be overcome by intensive pretransplant immunosuppressive therapy. Following transplantation, immunoreconstitution must occur from donor-derived progenitors and GvHD may occur from reactivity of donor-derived immunocompetent cells against host tissues. In a related, but distinct process, donor immunocompetent cells may react against the recipient leukemia and recent data confirm that this GvL effect plays a critical role in preventing posttransplant relapse. This report summarizes present data regarding the mechanism of these processes. A major challenge is to separate the beneficial GvL effect from GvHD, the major complication of allogeneic marrow transplantation.

These individuals typically have disturbed haemostasis, which reflects both impaired hepatic synthesis of clotting factors and disseminated intravascular coagulation compounded by large-volume transfusions of blood products occasionally required during surgery. The latter contribute significantly to the cost of this procedure, but may approximate the cumulative consumption of that required for the support of patients in liver failure. Perspective is provided by prospective analysis of data from the first 10 patients in the current programme. There were striking, if transient, intra-operative changes in standard laboratory parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis; all patients were readily controlled with replacement therapy administered according to serial haemostatic measurements combined with clinical judgement. In most patients these values had stabilised within 24 hours of surgery. Those with post-necrotic liver cirrhosis had the most marked degrees of hepatic dysfunction, reflected in more profound haemostatic disturbances; these patients required the largest amounts of blood products. Inclusive median costs for the first year were estimated at R35,000 and for the first 5 years at R60,000, with 80% of the patients expected to be alive between 5 and 10 years later and enjoying an excellent quality of life. These figures contrast with those estimated for optimal medical and non-transplant surgical management following variceal bleeding as a major complication of liver disease (R30,000 for the first year and R70,000 at 3 years). In addition, the latter patients would usually be unable to work and have a poor quality of life with minimal likelihood of survival beyond this point. We conclude that with a multidisciplinary approach in an academic centre, surgical replacement of the irreversibly damaged liver in properly selected patients is no more expensive and has a better outcome than acceptable alternative approaches.","['Robson, S C', 'Kahn, D', 'Gordon, P', 'Jacobs, P']","['Robson SC', 'Kahn D', 'Gordon P', 'Jacobs P']","['University of Cape Town Leukaemia Centre, Medical Research Council, Groote Schuur Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",South Africa,S Afr J Surg,South African journal of surgery.

Mice were whole-body-irradiated at 3 months of age with fission-neutron doses of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2 and 1.8 Gy at the RSV-TAPIRO reactor (mean neutron energy 0.4 MeV, in terms of kerma, y(D) = 51.5 keV/micron), or with 250 kVp X-ray doses of 1, 3, 5 and 7 Gy. Control and irradiated animals were then followed for their entire life span. As a general finding, male CBA/Cne mice appear more susceptible to tumorigenesis than females. In particular, the incidences of induced acute myeloid leukemia and malignant lymphomas are significant only in male mice. Benign and malignant solid tumors of many types are observed in mice of both sexes, the most frequent being in the lung, liver and ovary. However, evidence for a radiation response is limited to the case of Harderian gland neoplasms. In addition, a comparison of the observed frequency of all irradiated compared to unirradiated animals bearing solid tumors shows that the total tumor occurrence is not altered markedly by radiation exposure. A decrease in survival time is observed for both sexes and radiation types and correlates well with increasing dose. Moreover, both sex and radiation quality appear to influence the life shortening. A similar dose dependence of survival time is found when tumor-free animals alone are considered, suggesting a non-specific component of life-shortening.","['Di Majo, V', 'Coppola, M', 'Rebessi, S', 'Saran, A', 'Pazzaglia, S', 'Pariset, L', 'Covelli, V']","['Di Majo V', 'Coppola M', 'Rebessi S', 'Saran A', 'Pazzaglia S', 'Pariset L', 'Covelli V']","['Section of Toxicology and Biomedical Sciences, ENEA, CR-Casaccia, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'Longevity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality/pathology', '*Neutrons', 'Sex Factors', 'X-Rays']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1996 Jul;146(1):81-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer: 1950-1990.",1-27,"This continues the series of periodic general reports on cancer mortality in the cohort of A-bomb survivors followed by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation. The follow-up is extended by the 5 years 1986-1990, and analysis includes an additional 10,500 survivors with recently estimated radiation doses. Together these extensions add about 550,000 person-years of follow-up. The cohort analyzed consists of 86,572 subjects, of which about 60% have dose estimates of at least 0.005 Sv. During 1950-1990 there have been 3086 and 4741 cancer deaths for the less than and greater than 0.005 Sv groups, respectively. It is estimated that among these there have been approximately 420 excess cancer deaths during 1950-1990, of which about 85 were due to leukemia. For cancers other than leukemia (solid cancers), about 25% of the excess deaths in 1950-1990 occurred during the last 5 years; for those exposed as children this figure is nearly 50%. For leukemia only about 3% of the excess deaths in 1950-1990 occurred in the last 5 years. Whereas most of the excess for leukemia occurred in the first 15 years after exposure, for solid cancers the pattern of excess risk is apparently more like a life-long elevation of the natural age-specific cancer risk. Taking advantage of the lengthening follow-up, increased attention is given to clarifying temporal patterns of the excess cancer risk. Emphasis is placed on describing these patterns in terms of absolute excess risk, as well as relative risk. For example: (a) although it is becoming clearer that the excess relative risk for those exposed as children has declined over the follow-up, the excess absolute risk has increased rapidly with time; and (b) although the excess relative risk at a given age depends substantially on sex and age at exposure, the age-specific excess absolute risk depends little on these factors. The primary estimates of excess risk are now given as specific to sex and age at exposure, and these include projections of dose-specific lifetime risks for this cohort. The excess lifetime risk per sievert for solid cancers for those exposed at age 30 is estimated at 0.10 and 0.14 for males and females, respectively. Those exposed at age 50 have about one-third these risks. Projection of lifetime risks for those exposed at age 10 is more uncertain. Under a reasonable set of assumptions, estimates for this group range from about 1.0-1.8 times the estimates for those exposed at age 30. The excess life-time risk for leukemia at 1 Sv for those exposed at either 10 or 30 years is estimated as about 0.015 and 0.008 for males and females, respectively. Those exposed at age 50 have about two-thirds that risk. Excess risks for solid cancer appear quite linear up to about 3 Sv, but for leukemia apparent nonlinearity in dose results in risks at 0.1 Sv estimated at about 1/20 of those for 1.0 Sv. Site-specific risk estimates are given, but it is urged that great care be taken in interpreting these, because most of their variation can be explained simply by imprecision in the estimates.","['Pierce, D A', 'Shimizu, Y', 'Preston, D L', 'Vaeth, M', 'Mabuchi, K']","['Pierce DA', 'Shimizu Y', 'Preston DL', 'Vaeth M', 'Mabuchi K']","['Department of Statistics, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Risk', 'Sex Factors', 'Time Factors']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiat Res. 1996 Jul;146(1):1-27.,,,,"['Radiat Res. 1996 Nov;146(5):590-3.

The virus encodes Tax regulatory protein, which induces malignant transformation of the T lymphocytes. Tax increases the expression of cell protooncogenes as well as lymphokines, among others IL-2 and its receptor. This protein induces autocrine proliferation of T lymphocytes, which is probably the main cause of their transformation. Tax represses the human beta-polymerase gene enzyme involved in host cell DNA repair, and then irreversible damage is effected in the T lymphocyte genome. Moreover, this regulatory protein cooperates with Rex phosphoprotein, stabilizing cell mRNA, which originate as the result of Tax protein activity. The regulatory proteins of HTLV-I virus influence the transcription of some cell genes and their products and in this way induce malignant transformation.","['Papiez, M']",['Papiez M'],['Zaklad Wirusologii Instytutu Mikrobiologii Collegium Medicum Uniwersytetu Jagiellonskiego w Krakowie.'],['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw,Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej,0421052,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Adult', 'DNA Repair', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/physiopathology/*virology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*physiology', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw. 1995;49(5):585-97.,64,,,,Rola wirusa HTLV-I w transformacji limfocytow T.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lack of information relevant to the disease, low family income, low educational status of parents, cessation of therapy, uncertainty about the child's future, fear for the child's survival, anxiety over the treatment and its effect as well as some cultural and traditional factors, are the basic individual characteristics of the population that interfere with the successful treatment of children with cancer in Turkey. Because the child with cancer is under enormous physical and emotional stress, appropriate psychosocial resources for the patient and family are important for optimal therapy.

The French Cooperative Group on CLL.",1432-8,"BACKGROUND: Fludarabine seems to be a promising treatment for patients with advanced chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). We compared fludarabine therapy with the combination of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and prednisone (CAP) for treatment of CLL in a randomised, multicentre prospective trial. METHODS: Patients older than 18 years of age were entered into the study if they presented with previously untreated B-cell lineage CLL (B-CLL) of Binet stages B or C or relapsed B-CLL pretreated with chorambucil or similar non-anthracycline-containing regimens. Patients were randomly assigned to either fludarabine (25 mg/m2 per day on days 1-5) or CAP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 per day and doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 per day on day 1, and prednisone 40 mg/m2 per day on days 1-5), both given for six courses. FINDINGS: Of 196 evaluable patients, 100 were previously untreated whereas 96 patients had received prior therapy. Remission rates were significantly higher after fludarabine than CAP, with overall response rates of 60% and 44%, respectively (p = 0.023). A higher response rate to fludarabine was observed in both untreated (71% vs 60%, p = 0.26) and pretreated (48% vs 27%, p = 0.036) cases, although the difference was statistically significant only in pretreated cases. In the latter group, remission duration and survival did not differ between treatment groups with a median remission duration of 324 days after fludarabine and 179 days after CAP (p = 0.22) and median survival times of 728 days and 731 days, respectively. In untreated cases, on the other hand, fludarabine induced significantly longer remissions than CAP with the median not yet reached after fludarabine and a median of 208 days after CAP (p < 0.001). This effect also translated into a tendency towards longer overall survival after fludarabine (p = 0.087). Treatment-associated side-effects consisted in both regimens of predominantly myelosuppression and in particular granulocytopenia. CAP-treated patients had a higher frequency and severity of nausea and vomiting (25% vs 5%, p < 0.001) and alopecia (65% vs 2%, p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Fludarabine provided an effective and well-tolerated therapy for patients with advanced CLL, which compared favourably with CAP as one of the most effective standard regimens. In second-line therapy, fludarabine induced a significantly higher rate of complete and partial remissions, while in first-line therapy a significant prolongation of remission was obtained, which may translate into an improvement of overall survival.","['Johnson, S', 'Smith, A G', 'Loffler, H', 'Osby, E', 'Juliusson, G', 'Emmerich, B', 'Wyld, P J', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Johnson S', 'Smith AG', 'Loffler H', 'Osby E', 'Juliusson G', 'Emmerich B', 'Wyld PJ', 'Hiddemann W']","['Taunton and Somerset Hospital, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Agranulocytosis/chemically induced', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate', 'Time Factors', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1996/05/25 00:00,1996/05/25 00:01,['1996/05/25 00:00'],"['1996/05/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/25 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1996 May 25;347(9013):1432-8. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(96)91681-5.,,"['S0140-6736(96)91681-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(96)91681-5 [doi]']",,"['Lancet. 1996 May 25;347(9013):1420-1.

These are the first retroviral sequences to be identified in amphibians, and consequently retroviruses have now been found in each of the five major vertebrate classes. Comparison of the amphibian retroviral fragments, termed DevI, DevII, and DevIII, with mammalian and avian isolates revealed significant differences between their nucleotide sequences. This suggested that they were only distantly related to the seven currently recognized retroviral genera. Additional analysis by phylogeny reconstruction showed that the amphibian retroviral fragments were approximately equally related to the Moloney leukemia-related viruses, the spumaviruses, and walleye dermal sarcoma virus. Hybridization experiments revealed that viruses closely related to DevI, DevII, and DevIII do not appear to be widespread in other vertebrates and that DevI, DevII, and DevIII are all present at high copy numbers within their amphibian hosts, typically at over 250 copies per genome. The viruses described here, along with two others which have recently been found in a fish and a reptile, indicate that there may be some major differences in the retroviruses harbored by different vertebrate classes. This suggests that further characterization of retroviruses of fish, reptiles, and amphibians will help in understanding the evolution of the whole retroviral family and may well lead to the discovery of retroviruses with novel biological properties.","['Tristem, M', 'Herniou, E', 'Summers, K', 'Cook, J']","['Tristem M', 'Herniou E', 'Summers K', 'Cook J']","['Department of Biology, Imperial College, Silwood Park, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Anura/*virology', 'Base Sequence', 'Birds/virology', 'DNA, Viral', 'Humans', 'Mammals/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phylogeny', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Jul;70(7):4864-70. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.7.4864-4870.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.7.4864-4870.1996 [doi]'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,PMC190434,"['GENBANK/X95795', 'GENBANK/X95796', 'GENBANK/X95797']",,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, two chimeric viruses containing completely separate envelope regions from FMCF98 could both induce neurological disease. Clinical signs caused by both neurovirulent chimeras appeared to be indistinguishable from those caused by FMCF98, although the incubation periods were longer. One neurovirulence determinant mapped to the N-terminal portion of gp7O, which contains the VRA and VRB receptor-binding regions, while the other determinant mapped downstream of both of the variable regions.

Mutant M-MuLV integrases were constructed to define the functional domains important for 3' processing, strand transfer, and disintegration by in vitro assays. N-terminal mutants had no detectable 3' processing activity, and only one mutant which lacks the HHCC domain, Ndelta105, had strand transfer activity. Strand transfer mediated by Ndelta105 showed preference for one site in the target DNA. Disintegration activity of N-terminal mutants decreased only minimally. In contrast, all C-terminal mutants truncated by more than 28 amino acids had no integration or disintegration activity. Activity on a single-strand disintegration substrate did not require a functional HHCC domain but did require most of the C-terminal region. Complementation analysis found that the HHCC region alone was able to function in trans to a promoter containing only the DD(35)E and C-terminal regions and to enhance integration site selection. Increasing the reducing conditions or adding the HHCC domain to Ndelta105 reaction mixtures restored the wild-type strand transfer activity and range of target sites. The reducing agent affected Cys-209 in the DD(35)E region. The presence of C-209 was required for complementation of Ndelta105 by the HHCC region.","['Jonsson, C B', 'Donzella, G A', 'Gaucan, E', 'Smith, C M', 'Roth, M J']","['Jonsson CB', 'Donzella GA', 'Gaucan E', 'Smith CM', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, Robert W.

HBx is a transactivator that stimulates Ras signal transduction pathways in the cytoplasm and certain transcription elements in the nucleus. To better understand the activities of HBx protein and its mechanism of action, we have explored the manner by which HBx activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB during transient expression. We show that HBx induces prolonged formation, in a Ras-dependent manner, of transcriptionally active NF-kappaB DNA-binding complexes, which make up the family of Rel-related proteins, p50, p52, RelA, and c-Rel. HBx was found to activate NF-kappaB through two distinct cytoplasmic pathways by acting on both the 37-kDa IkappaBalpha inhibitor and the 105-kappaDa NF-kappaB1 precursor inhibitor protein, known as p105. HBx induces phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha, a three- to fourfold reduction in IKBalpha stability, and concomitant nuclear accumulation of NF-kappaB DNA-binding complexes, similar to that reported for human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 Tax protein. In addition, HBx mediates a striking reduction in cytoplasmic p105 NF-kappaB1 inhibitor and p50 protein levels and release of RelA protein that was sequestered by the p105 inhibitor, concomitant with nuclear accumulation of NF-kappaB complexes. HBx mediated only a slight reduction in the cytoplasmic levels of NF-kappaB2 p100 protein, an additional precursor inhibitor of NF-kappaB, which is thought to be less efficiently processed or less responsive to release of NF-kappaB. No evidence was found for HBx activation of NF-kappaB by targeting acidic sphingomyelinase- controlled pathways. Studies also suggest that stimulation of NF-kappaB by HBx does not involve activation of Ras via the neutral sphingomyelin-ceramide pathway. Thus, HBx protein is shown to activate the NF-kappaB family of Rel-related proteins by acting on two distinct NF-kappaB cytoplasmic inhibitors.","['Su, F', 'Schneider, R J']","['Su F', 'Schneider RJ']","['Department of Biochemistry and Kaplan Cancer Center, New York University School of Medicine, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Ceramides)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (hepatitis B virus X protein)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Ceramides/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleotides', 'Hepatitis B virus/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Precursors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sphingomyelins/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelA', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Jul;70(7):4558-66. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.7.4558-4566.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.7.4558-4566.1996 [doi]'],"['CA54525/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56533/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC190392,,,,,,,,,,,

As an early block to viral replication in resistant mice has been demonstrated previously by PCR studies, we postulated that alpha/beta interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) may be involved in resistance to MAIDS. Susceptible C57BL/6 mice infected with LP-BM5 were treated with IFN-alpha/beta or Newcastle disease virus. Newcastle disease virus induces high endogenous IFN-alpha/beta production in mice. Both treatments delayed the development of MAIDS, as assessed by splenomegaly and T- and B-cell proliferation. In addition, an IFN-alpha/beta response was detected by reverse transcription-PCR and dot blotting 3, 6, and 9 h after LP-BM5 infection in resistant mice but not in susceptible mice.

The number of AS208-binding sites was in the range of 7 X 10(4) to 17 X 10(4) per cell. Quantitative analysis of binding revealed that AS208-binding sites are heterogeneous with regard to ligand binding affinity or that cooperativity exists between receptors.

Taken together, these data suggested that amphotropic envelope-binding sites present at the cell surface do not act independently and do not participate equally in virus infection.","['Battini, J L', 'Rodrigues, P', 'Muller, R', 'Danos, O', 'Heard, J M']","['Battini JL', 'Rodrigues P', 'Muller R', 'Danos O', 'Heard JM']","['Laboratoire Retrovirus et Transfert Genetique, Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA Primers', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/metabolism', '*Receptors, Virus', 'Spodoptera', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*metabolism']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Jul;70(7):4387-93. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.7.4387-4393.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.7.4387-4393.1996 [doi]'],,,,PMC190372,,,,,,,,,,,

We introduced complete, truncated, or chimeric Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) envelopes into an MuLV particle-producing complementation cell line. As shown previously for HTLV-1 envelopes containing extracellular domains of F-MuLV TM (C. Denesvre, P. Sonigo, A. Corbin, H. Ellerbrok, and M. Sitbon, J. Virol. 69:4149-4157, 1995), reverse chimeric F-MuLV envelopes containing the extracellular domain of HTLV-1 TM were not processed. In contrast, a chimeric MuLV envelope containing the entire HTLV membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic domains (FHTMi) was efficiently processed, fusogenic as tested in a cell-to-cell assay, and efficiently incorporated into MuLV particles. However, these MuLV particles bearing FHTMi envelope proteins could not infect mouse or rat cells which are susceptible to wild-type F-MuLV. Therefore, envelopes which are readily fusogenic in cell-to-cell assays and also efficiently incorporated into virions may not necessarily confer virus-to-cell fusogenicity. HTLV envelopes, whether parental, chimeric (containing the MuLV cytoplasmic tail) or with a truncated cytoplasmic domain, were incorporated into MuLV particles with equal efficiencies, indicating that the cytoplasmic tails of these envelopes did not determine their incorporation into virions. In contrast to FHTMi envelope, HTLV-1 envelopes with F-MuLV membrane-spanning and cytoplasmic domains, as well as wild-type HTLV-1 envelopes, conferred virion infectivity. These results help to define requirements for envelope incorporation into retroviral particles and their cell-free infectivity.","['Denesvre, C', 'Carrington, C', 'Corbin, A', 'Takeuchi, Y', 'Cosset, F L', 'Schulz, T', 'Sitbon, M', 'Sonigo, P']","['Denesvre C', 'Carrington C', 'Corbin A', 'Takeuchi Y', 'Cosset FL', 'Schulz T', 'Sitbon M', 'Sonigo P']","['Genetique des Virus, ICGM-CNRS UPR415, Institut Cochin de GenetiqueMoleculaire, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism/virology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*metabolism/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism/pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virion/*metabolism/physiology', 'Virus Assembly']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Jul;70(7):4380-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.7.4380-4386.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.7.4380-4386.1996 [doi]'],,,,PMC190371,,,,,,,,,,,

Virus particles are inactivated by targeting toxic fusion proteins to virions, where they destroy viral components from within. We have fused Staphylococcus nuclease (SN) to the C-terminal end of Moloney murine leukemia virus Gag and demonstrated that expression of this fusion protein in chronically infected chicken embryo fibroblasts resulted in its incorporation into virions and subsequent inactivation of the virus particles by degradation of viral RNA. Release of particles incorporating Gag-SN fusion proteins into the extracellular milieu activates the nuclease and results in destruction of the virion from within. By comparing the effects of incorporated SN and SN*, an enzymatically inactive missense mutant form of SN, on the infectivity of virus particles, we have clearly demonstrated that nucleolytic activity is the antiviral mechanism. Expression of Gag-SN fusion proteins as a therapeutic agent causes a stable reduction of infectious titers by 20- to 60-fold. The antiviral effect of capsid-targeted viral inactivation in our model system, using both prophylactic and therapeutic approaches, suggests that a similar anti-human immunodeficiency virus strategy might be successful.","['Schumann, G', 'Qin, L', 'Rein, A', 'Natsoulis, G', 'Boeke, J D']","['Schumann G', 'Qin L', 'Rein A', 'Natsoulis G', 'Boeke JD']","['Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA, Recombinant', 'Gene Products, gag/*genetics/physiology', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/genetics/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/pharmacology', 'Ribonucleases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virion/metabolism', 'Virus Replication']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Jul;70(7):4329-37. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.7.4329-4337.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.7.4329-4337.1996 [doi]'],,,,PMC190365,,,,,,,,,,,

J. Med. Chem. 1994, 37, 811-815). This peptide, however, did not bind to SK-N-MC cells with Y-1 receptors. Since centrally truncated NPY analogs have been shown to bind Y-1 receptors, we synthesized similar analogs of [D-Trp(32)]NPY and investigated their Y-1 (SK-N-MC) and Y-2 (SK-N-BE2) receptor affinities and their properties in human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells. None of the analogs with D-Trp(32) mobilized intracellular calcium, [Ca2]i, in HEL cells. Although Des-AA(6-24)[Aoc(6)]NPY and the corresponding D-Trp(32) analog exhibited no affinity to Y-1 receptors, Des-AA(7-24)[Aoc(6),D-Trp(32)] NPY(6) exhibited weak binding. Replacing Pro(5) in 6 with D-Ala to stabilize the central chain reversal, and hence the antiparallel alignment of the N- and C-terminal regions known to be important for Y-1 binding, resulted in an analog, Des-AA(7-24)[D-Ala(5),Aoc(6),D-Trp(32)]NPY (7), which exhibited moderate antagonist potency in attenuating NPY effects on cAMP and [Ca2+]i, in SK-N-MC and HEL cells, respectively. This analog also shifted the dose-response curve of NPY on blood pressure in anesthetized rats. Deletion of only the 7-17 and/or the incorporation of N-Me-Ala(5), superior beta-turn stabilizer, in 7 did not improve the Y-1 receptor affinity. Des-AA(7-24)[D-Ala(5), Gly(6),D-Trp(32)]NPY exhibited an affinity similar to that of 7, suggesting that a long spacer arm is not necessary for efficient Y-1 receptor interaction. Locking the antiparallel alignment via a 2/26 or 2/27 lactam bridge did not improve the binding. Finally, replacement of D-Ala(5) in 7 with D-Trp dramatically increased both the binding and the antagonistic potencies. Modeling based on the avian pancreatic polypeptide X-ray structure suggested that analogs which have the N- and C-terminal regions in close proximity might exhibit good binding, and that the D-Trp(32) substitution may induce a beta-turn that could be important for exhibiting antagonism. A systematic investigation has resulted in the development of relatively potent Y-1 receptor antagonists. Further structure-activity studies with these compounds and those previously reported by us and other investigators should result in the development of long-acting and receptor selective antagonists.","['Balasubramaniam, A', 'Ujhelyi, M', 'Borchers, M', 'Huang, Y', 'Zhai, W', 'Zhou, Y', 'Johnson, M', 'Sheriff, S', 'Fischer, J E']","['Balasubramaniam A', 'Ujhelyi M', 'Borchers M', 'Huang Y', 'Zhai W', 'Zhou Y', 'Johnson M', 'Sheriff S', 'Fischer JE']","['Department of Surgery, Colleges of Medicine and Pharmacy, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio 45267-0558, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (Receptors, Neuropeptide Y)', '0 (neuropeptide Y, des-AA(7-24)-(Ala(5)-Aoc(6)-Trp(32))-)', '153549-78-1 (neuropeptide Y, Trp(32)-)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuropeptide Y/*analogs & derivatives/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Neuropeptide Y/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1996 Mar 1;39(5):1142-7. doi: 10.1021/jm9505371.,,"['10.1021/jm9505371 [doi]', 'jm9505371 [pii]']",['GM 47122/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RV+ cells are a P-glycoprotein overexpressing variant of the HL60 myeloid leukemia cell line. In addition to classic MDR, RV+ cells displayed relative resistance to complement-mediated cytotoxicity with both immunoglobulin G and M antibodies against different cell surface antigens, but not to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and lymphokine-activated killing. Complement resistance was reversed both by treatment with verapamil and with specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) capable of binding to P-glycoprotein and blocking its function. To further confirm that the resistance of RV+ cells was not a consequence of the selection of the cells on vincristine, a second system involving P-glycoprotein infectants was also investigated. K562 cells infected with the MDR1 gene, which were never selected on chemotherapeutic drugs, also displayed relative resistance to complement-mediated cytotoxicity. This MDR1 infection-induced resistance was also reversed by mAbs that bind to P-glycoprotein. Therefore, the MDR phenotype as mediated by P-glycoprotein provides resistance to complement-mediated cytotoxicity. The increased intracellular pH and the decreased membrane potential due to the MDR phenotype may result in abnormal membrane attack complex function. This observation may have implications for the possible mechanisms of action of P-glycoprotein and for a possible physiologic role for P-glycoprotein in protection against complement-mediated autolysis.","['Weisburg, J H', 'Curcio, M', 'Caron, P C', 'Raghu, G', 'Mechetner, E B', 'Roepe, P D', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Weisburg JH', 'Curcio M', 'Caron PC', 'Raghu G', 'Mechetner EB', 'Roepe PD', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/*immunology', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents/toxicity', 'Clone Cells', 'Colchicine/toxicity', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Daunorubicin/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*immunology', 'Genetic Variation', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/toxicity']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1996 Jun 1;183(6):2699-704. doi: 10.1084/jem.183.6.2699.,,['10.1084/jem.183.6.2699 [doi]'],['R01CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC2192622,,,,,,,,,,,

The first case of T cell granular lymphocytic leukaemia in a patient with sarcoidosis has been documented.","['Karakantza, M', 'Matutes, E', 'MacLennan, K', ""O'Connor, N T"", 'Srivastava, P C', 'Catovsky, D']","['Karakantza M', 'Matutes E', 'MacLennan K', ""O'Connor NT"", 'Srivastava PC', 'Catovsky D']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Marsden Hospital, London.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/*complications/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/complications/immunology', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/complications/immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sarcoidosis/*complications/immunology', 'Spleen/pathology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1996 Mar;49(3):208-12. doi: 10.1136/jcp.49.3.208.,,['10.1136/jcp.49.3.208 [doi]'],,,,PMC500399,,,,,,,,,,,

Normal thyroid tissues showed a consistent expression of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 whereas Bax and Bcl-X proteins were essentially absent from most follicular thyroid cells. Bax expression was observed in all papillary carcinomas (n = 23) and in 8 of 10 follicular carcinomas. The intensity of Bcl-2 immunostaining was generally higher in follicular tumors (n = 10) than in papillary carcinomas (n = 21 of 23). However, in undifferentiated tumors, both Bax and Bcl-2 were weakly expressed. Mcl-1 protein expression was similar to that of Bax in papillary and follicular tumors, but was also frequently detectable in undifferentiated tumors. Bcl-X immunostaining was seen in all undifferentiated tumors (n = 6), in 22 of 23 papillary tumors, and in 5 of 10 follicular tumors. Our findings show that the regulation of bcl-2 family gene expression is different in normal thyroid tissue compared to that of its neoplastic counterpart and varies with the tumor subtype. In particular, unlike normal thyroid epithelium, the apoptosis-blocking gene bcl-X and the apoptosis-inducing gene bax are frequently expressed in thyroid carcinomas derived from the follicular cells. Thus, alterations in the expression of these bcl-2 family genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of thyroid carcinomas.","['Branet, F', 'Brousset, P', 'Krajewski, S', 'Schlaifer, D', 'Selves, J', 'Reed, J C', 'Caron, P']","['Branet F', 'Brousset P', 'Krajewski S', 'Schlaifer D', 'Selves J', 'Reed JC', 'Caron P']","[""Service d'Endocrinologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Rangueil, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Endocrinol Metab,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,0375362,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma, Follicular/chemistry/*genetics', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Carcinoma, Papillary/chemistry/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/chemistry/*genetics', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1996 Jul;81(7):2726-30. doi: 10.1210/jcem.81.7.8675602.,,['10.1210/jcem.81.7.8675602 [doi]'],"['CA-60181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of K562 cells with recombinant human IFN-gamma for 48 h caused a significant increase of insulin binding at 37 degrees C. Recombinant human tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) alone had no effect but acted synergistically with IFN-gamma, leading to a two-fold increase of insulin binding. No change in affinity, number of binding sites or cell surface expression of insulin receptors (IR) after IFN-gamma treatment could be detected. The increased insulin binding observed at 37 degrees C was not seen at 4 degrees C, suggesting alteration of insulin internalization. The dose-response curve, as well as the time curve, for the increase in insulin binding after IFN-gamma treatment correlated with enhanced cell surface expression of MHC-I antigens. However, the correlation was not absolute. Our results show that IFN-gamma treatment alone or together with TNF-alpha, can alter the insulin binding to K562 cells without changing the expression or affinity of the IR. This correlates with the effect of IFN-gamma on MHC-I expression. These results support the findings that MHC-I molecules associate and interact with the IR at the cell surface.","['Ferm, M', 'Gronberg, A', 'Tally, M']","['Ferm M', 'Gronberg A', 'Tally M']","['Department of Immunology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunol Invest,Immunological investigations,8504629,"['0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Insulin)']",IM,"['Endocytosis/drug effects', 'HLA Antigens/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Receptor, Insulin/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunol Invest. 1996 Jan-Mar;25(1-2):37-47. doi: 10.3109/08820139609059289.,,['10.3109/08820139609059289 [doi]'],['CA 44882/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to identify genes whose expression is potentially important for the change from estrogen (E) to progesterone (P) dominance we have initiated a study of specific gene regulation using semiquantitative, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). PolyA+ RNA was isolated from both E-dominant (days 9-13 of artificial menstrual cycles [AMCs]) and P-dominant (days 21-23) rhesus monkey endometria. The two pools of mRNA were converted to cDNA, end-ligated to double-stranded oligonucleotide adaptors and amplified by PCR using an adaptor-complementary primer. This procedure resulted in the production of E- and PcDNA template populations for cDNA-specific screening and comparative quantitation by PCR. Initial analysis showed that placental protein 14 (PP14) was P-dependent and human complement 3 (HC3) was up-regulated in E-dominant tissue, whereas the housekeeping genes B-actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-3-PDH) were expressed at equivalent levels under E and P dominance. Expression of the E receptor (ER), P receptor (PR), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) was equivalent under E or P dominance. Expression of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and retinoblastoma (RB) was down-regulated in P-dominant tissue. Conversely IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1-R), transforming growth factor-beta 2 (TGFB-2), TGFB-2 receptor (TGFB-2-R), 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17-B-HSD) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) levels were up-regulated in PcDNA. Among these factors, PP14, LIF, IGF-1-R TGFB-2 and 17-B-HSD were also detectable in PCR in a P-dependent cDNA library isolated by subtractive hybridization. These data provide evidence for hormonal regulation of specific gene products that may play important roles in the normal maturation of the primate endometrium in preparation for implantation.","['Ace, C I', 'Okulicz, W C']","['Ace CI', 'Okulicz WC']","['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Mol Cell Endocrinol,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,7500844,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Receptors, Progesterone)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '4G7DS2Q64Y (Progesterone)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', '67763-96-6 (Insulin-Like Growth Factor I)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Endometrium/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Estradiol/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Hormones/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Insulin-Like Growth Factor I/genetics/metabolism', 'Macaca mulatta', 'Menstrual Cycle/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Progesterone/*genetics/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Estrogen/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Progesterone/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/genetics/metabolism']",1995/11/30 00:00,1995/11/30 00:01,['1995/11/30 00:00'],"['1995/11/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/30 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/30 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Endocrinol. 1995 Nov 30;115(1):95-103. doi: 10.1016/0303-7207(95)03674-v.,,"['030372079503674V [pii]', '10.1016/0303-7207(95)03674-v [doi]']",['HD-31620/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While ara-C has been implicated as a potent inhibitor of mammalian cell DNA replication, the specific mechanism by which ara-C kills cells is not known. In this report we describe the development of an in vitro model system to study the molecular mechanism of ara-CMP incorporation into DNA. This model system makes use of a recently described human cell multiprotein DNA replication complex (MRC) that is competent to replicate DNA in vitro. The MRC can successfully incorporate ara-CMP into replicating DNA at internucleotide positions. These results are similar to those described for studies using intact cells. This MRC-driven in vitro replication system may therefore serve as a powerful model for the study of anticancer agents that directly affect human cell DNA synthesis.","['Wills, P', 'Hickey, R', 'Ross, D', 'Cuddy, D', 'Malkas, L']","['Wills P', 'Hickey R', 'Ross D', 'Cuddy D', 'Malkas L']","['University of Maryland School of Medicine, Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Baltimore, MD 21201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Models, Biological', 'Simian virus 40/genetics']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;38(4):366-72. doi: 10.1007/s002800050496.,,['10.1007/s002800050496 [doi]'],"['R01-CA40188/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA57350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The most potent ecteinascidin is ET-729 with antitumor activity observed following administration of 3.8 and 10 micrograms/kg to mice bearing P388 leukemia and B16 melanoma, respectively. A reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay and an L1210 cell bioassay were developed for ET-729 and utilized for stability and murine pharmacokinetic studies. HPLC analysis showed that ET-729 was stable in organic solvents, mobile phase and acidic buffer (t1/2 > 100 h). Stability was diminished under neutral and basic conditions (t1/2 < 14 h). Following a 48-h incubation with L1210 cells in growth medium in the absence and presence of 2.5% murine plasma, the 50% growth inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of ET-729 were 37 and 72 pM, respectively.

The data demonstrated that some B-cell lymphomas appear to be unusual in that Abs were unable to bind to them irreversibly; except for those Abs that were rapidly internalized, none of the Abs tested was able to bind irreversibly to the B-cell lymphomas Raji or RL. In contrast, most Abs bound irreversibly to the tumors of other histological types, including other hematological tumors. Irreversible Ab binding to B-cell lymphomas was achieved by cross-linking the Abs on the cell surface. Such differences between cell lines may be due to differences in the supramolecular structure of the surface membrane, which affect the frequency or stability of bivalent Ab binding.

In this study, we showed by means of immunoblotting that the expression of PML-RARA decreased within 12 h in APL cells treated with ATRA at concentrations greater than 0.1 microM. The decrease of PML-RARA was associated with restoration of the normal subcellular PML localization. PML-RARA transcripts were not down-regulated by ATRA. However, lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the proteasome, almost completely inhibited the decrease of PML-RARA.

The Vav SH2 domain is required for this interaction and for TCR-mediated Vav tyrosine phosphorylation. Similar to Vav, overexpression of SLP-76 markedly potentiates TCR-mediated NF-AT and IL-2 gene activation. Furthermore, overexpression of both Vav and SLP-76 synergistically induces basal and TCR-stimulated NF-AT activation.

A study was performed to analyse the role of various factors particularly with respect to adhesion and aggregation in the CNS leukostasis development. The findings were also designated to evaluate the distribution of leukostasis in different CNS regions and to recognize its intensity in various CNS vessels. Basing on the studies the authors conclude that the risk of CNS leukostasis increases evidently when the leukocyte counts are elevated above 50 G/l. The adhesion and aggregation of leukemic and lymphomatous cells as well as local anatomical factors in the CNS vessels play and important role in the CNS leukostasis development, which is more intensive in the white matter and leptomeninges. The medium-sized vessels are much involved, whereas cortical capillaries are relatively less affected by leukostasis. The CNS leukostasis appears to be dynamic and reversible phenomenon, which undergoes fluctuations according to the leukocyte counts increase or decrease.","['Nowacki, P', 'Fryze, C', 'Zdziarska, B', 'Zyluk, B', 'Grzelec, H', 'Dudzik, T']","['Nowacki P', 'Fryze C', 'Zdziarska B', 'Zyluk B', 'Grzelec H', 'Dudzik T']","['Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, Szczecin.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Poland,Folia Neuropathol,Folia neuropathologica,9437431,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Brain Diseases/blood/etiology/*pathology', 'Capillaries/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Leukostasis/blood/etiology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*complications', 'Middle Aged']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Folia Neuropathol. 1995;33(1):59-65.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The mortality observed was compared with that expected from the death rates from the local male population where these chemical plants are located. Workers were assigned to one of five exposure categories based on their job with the highest level of potential exposure. Vital status was ascertained to the end of 1993. RESULTS: Among diseases of particular interest, there were no excess deaths from heart disease (standardised mortality ratio (SMR) 63.3), lung cancer (SMR 63.8), or non-malignant respiratory disease (SMR 37.7) for employees with 20 or more years after first exposure. Based on the level of potential exposure to epichlorohydrin, mortality for heart disease was slightly higher (SMR 75.7, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 51.8-106.7) in the moderate to heavy exposure group than in the none to light exposure group (SMR 59.5, 95% CI 37.7-89.3); this difference is well within the range of random variation. The SMR for heart disease was 90.4 among employees who had both probable exposure to allyl chloride and moderate to heavy exposure to epichlorohydrin, although it was 88.1 among employees who had moderate to heavy potential exposure to epichlorohydrin but no exposure to allyl chloride. CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support an association between exposure to epichlorohydrin and heart disease or lung cancer. There were no additional deaths from leukaemia in this update; the raised SMR for leukaemia noted in the previous study has substantially decreased from 500.0 to 161.3 (95% CI 33.2-471.0) and is not significant. The overall mortality and cancer mortality of employees potentially exposed to epichlorohydrin continued to be lower than that of the local population.","['Tsai, S P', 'Gilstrap, E L', 'Ross, C E']","['Tsai SP', 'Gilstrap EL', 'Ross CE']","['Corporate Medical Department, Shell Oil Company, Houston, Texas 77252-2463, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Occup Environ Med,Occupational and environmental medicine,9422759,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '08OOR508C0 (Epichlorohydrin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Cause of Death', 'Chemical Industry', 'Cohort Studies', 'Epichlorohydrin/*adverse effects', 'Heart Diseases/chemically induced/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lung Neoplasms/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Occupational Exposure/*adverse effects']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Occup Environ Med. 1996 May;53(5):299-304. doi: 10.1136/oem.53.5.299.,,['10.1136/oem.53.5.299 [doi]'],,,,PMC1128471,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A cohort of 11,663 German men was followed up for mortality from 1 January 1981 to 31 December 1991. Cohort members were active (n = 7536) or retired (n = 4127) at the beginning of the study, and had been employed for at least one year in one of five study plants producing types or general rubber goods. Vital status was ascertained for 99.7% of the cohort members, and cause of death found for 96.8% of the 2719 decedents. Age and calendar year adjusted standardised mortality ratios (SMR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated overall from national reference rates and stratified by year of hire and by years since hire. RESULTS: Mortalities from all causes (SMR 108; 95% CI 104-112) and all cancers (SMR 111; 95% CI 103-119) were significantly increased in the study cohort. Significant excesses in the mortalities from lung cancer (SMR 130; 95% CI 115-147) and pleural cancer (SMR 401; 95% CI 234-642) were identified. SMRs higher than 100 were found for cancers of the pharynx (SMR 144; 95% CI 76-246), oesophagus (SMR 120; 95% CI 74-183), stomach (SMR 110; 95% CI 86-139), rectum (SMR 123; 95% CI 86-170), larynx (SMR 129; 95% CI 69-221), prostate (SMR 108; 95% CI 84-136), and bladder (SMR 124; 95% CI 86-172), as well as for leukaemia (SMR 148; 95% CI 99-213). Mortalities from liver cancer, brain cancer, and lymphoma were lower than expected. CONCLUSIONS: Mortalities from cancer of several sites previously associated with the rubber industry were also increased among workers of the German rubber industry.

The most commonly observed defect affecting telomeres in humans is telomeric fusions, particularly in T lymphocytes in AT patients. Rarely, some tumour cells, like senescent cells, have dicentric chromosomes that may arise as a result of telomeric sequence loss. We show that the AT mutation in the homozygous state confers a predisposition to accelerated telomere shortening with increasing age in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs), which may be linked to premature senescence. We also show that telomeric fusions are associated with large (> 90%) preleukaemic translocation clones in T cells. We propose that these fusions may result from a compound effect of accelerated telomere shortening, together with a growth advantage of cells in large clones which leads to further telomere loss. Fusions are not observed in leukaemic cells in these patients. There is no evidence that either accelerated telomere loss per se or telomeric fusions are important in tumourigenesis. Telomerase is present in both normal and AT lymphocytes and so neither telomere shortening nor telomeric fusions can be explained by the absence of telomerase.","['Metcalfe, J A', 'Parkhill, J', 'Campbell, L', 'Stacey, M', 'Biggs, P', 'Byrd, P J', 'Taylor, A M']","['Metcalfe JA', 'Parkhill J', 'Campbell L', 'Stacey M', 'Biggs P', 'Byrd PJ', 'Taylor AM']","['CRC Institute for Cancer Studies, Medical School, University of Birmingham, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'T-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Telomerase/metabolism', 'Telomere/physiology/*ultrastructure']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 1996 Jul;13(3):350-3. doi: 10.1038/ng0796-350.,,['10.1038/ng0796-350 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each is characterized by an expanded and methylated trinucleotide repeat CGG (CCG). Of the three X chromosome sites, FRAXA, FRAXE and FRAXF, the former two are associated with mental retardation in their expanded forms. FRAXA expansion results in fragile X syndrome due to down regulation of expression of the FMR1 gene, which carries the hypermutable CGG repeat in the 5' untranslated portion of its first exon. Mild mental retardation without consistent physical findings has been found associated with expanded CCG repeats at FRAXE. We have identified a large gene (FMR2) transcribed distally from the CpG island at FRAXE, and down-regulated by repeat expansion and methylation. The gene is novel, expressed in adult brain and placenta, and shows similarity with another human protein, MLLT2, expressed from a gene at chromosome 4q21 involved in translocations found in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells. Identification of this gene will facilitate further studies to determine the role of its product in FRAXE associated mental deficiency.","['Gu, Y', 'Shen, Y', 'Gibbs, R A', 'Nelson, D L']","['Gu Y', 'Shen Y', 'Gibbs RA', 'Nelson DL']","['Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Human Genome Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Nat Genet,Nature genetics,9216904,"['0 (AFF2 protein, human)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)""]",IM,"['Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Brain/metabolism', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 4', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Primers', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates', 'Female', 'Fragile X Syndrome/*genetics', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Intellectual Disability/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Organ Specificity', 'Placenta/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Pregnancy', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*X Chromosome']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Genet. 1996 May;13(1):109-13. doi: 10.1038/ng0596-109.,,['10.1038/ng0596-109 [doi]'],"['HD29251/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HG00210/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States', 'HG00823/HG/NHGRI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['GENBANK/AC002368'],,,,,,,,,,

Using immunocytochemical detections annexin I was found mainly as patches in the cytoplasm of uninfected cells. Upon phagocytosis of yeast or E. coli organisms, annexin I rapidly translocated and concentrated around phagosomes. On the other hand, annexin I was never detected around live B. suis-containing phagosomes. However, when dead brucellae were used, annexin I did translocate to the periphagosomal region.

We therefore retrospectively compared the engraftment kinetics of mitoxantrone and daunorubicin patients following 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC) purged autologous bone marrow transplant (ABMT) with busulfan-etoposide conditioning. Despite equivalent graft colony forming units granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM), mitoxantrone patients (n = 13) took a median 7 weeks longer to achieve 1.0 x 10(9)/l granulocytes, 5 weeks longer to achieve platelet transfusion independence, and 10 weeks longer to achieve red blood cell transfusion independence, and required more platelet transfusions (P = 0.008), than daunorubicin patients (n = 13). Patients experiencing the post-remission cytopenia syndrome (n = 11) had significantly slower engraftment than those not experiencing the syndrome (n = 15; P < or = 0.04). Two mitoxantrone and five daunorubicin patients have relapsed after ABMT (P = 0.38). We conclude that the type of induction chemotherapy used in untreated adults with de novo AML can influence subsequent engraftment after 4HC-purged ABMT. We believe that mitoxantrone combined with high-dose cytarabine should be avoided as induction chemotherapy in patients for whom 4HC-purged ABMT is planned.","['Damon, L E', 'Rugo, H S', 'Ries, C A', 'Linker, C A']","['Damon LE', 'Rugo HS', 'Ries CA', 'Linker CA']","['Hematology/Oncology Division, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0324, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Purging', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Jan;17(1):93-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients surviving more than 7 days post-transplant without histologic or any of these clinical features of VOD were classified as not having VOD. Patient-, disease- and transplant-related characteristics of 95 patients with VOD were compared to those of 1514 without VOD.

Many receive red cell transfusions as part of treatment prior to BMT, adding to the potential iron load. However, organ dysfunction as a consequence of the transfused iron load would be surprising given the amounts of iron transfused. We studied 76 survivors of allogeneic and autologous BMT who were at least 1 year post-transplant and found that the majority (88%) had raised ferritins. Impaired liver function was common in these patients and in half was unexplained by viral hepatitis, veno-occlusive disease or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), suggesting that iron overload may be an important contributing factor to liver disease in the stable post-transplant setting. This view is supported by the observation of improving liver function tests in 10 patients after a trial of venesection therapy.","['McKay, P J', 'Murphy, J A', 'Cameron, S', 'Burnett, A K', 'Campbell, M', 'Tansey, P', 'Franklin, I M']","['McKay PJ', 'Murphy JA', 'Cameron S', 'Burnett AK', 'Campbell M', 'Tansey P', 'Franklin IM']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, Royal Infirmary, Glasgow, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Hemosiderosis/complications/*etiology', 'Hepatitis C/etiology', 'Humans', 'Liver Diseases/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Transfusion Reaction', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Jan;17(1):63-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although not life threatening, the psychological consequences are significant. Therefore semen cryopreservation is advisable prior to initial therapy, but oocyte storage is not yet possible and embryo cryopreservation seldom feasible. Treatment protocols should be carefully selected to maximise cure rates whilst limiting injury to the reproductive system. Involvement of a reproductive endocrinologist is thus ideal from presentation, and certainly necessary pretransplant and for long-term follow-up in order to provide the endocrine assessment, counselling and fertility management which are essential for adequate transplant care. Improvement in bone marrow transplant technology and more rigorous patient selection have resulted in a higher proportion of long-term survivors. This has increased the awareness of long-term effects, such as gonadal failure, which may become apparent several months or years after transplantation. Premature ovarian and testicular failure may be overlooked by physicians managing the life-threatening disease, but for patients, the physical, emotional, psychological and social consequences of functional castration consequent on high-dose therapy can be devastating. The pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of gonadal failure are reviewed here.","['Chatterjee, R', 'Goldstone, A H']","['Chatterjee R', 'Goldstone AH']","['Department of Reproductive Medicine, University College London Hospitals, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adult', 'Estrogen Replacement Therapy', 'Female', 'Fertility/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Gonads/*drug effects/physiopathology/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/physiopathology/*therapy', 'Primary Ovarian Insufficiency/physiopathology', 'Semen Preservation']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Jan;17(1):5-11.,79,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All patients ALL (n = 3) and AML (n = 5) were in relapse 7-31 months after first BMT. Donors (1-3 Ag mismatch) were selected from family members.

Treatment of these patients is complicated by their marked hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents. In this report we describe the results of allogeneic unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation in seven FA patients, using a low-dose cyclophosphamide (40 mg/kg) and TBI (400-450 cGy) conditioning regimen. Two patients had bone marrow failure with normal chromosomes and no dysplasia prior to transplant. The remaining five had clonal chromosomal abnormalities. One patient had refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation and two had early AML with 20 and 25% blasts, respectively. Two patients died early (before day 28) without hematological evidence of engraftment, one of veno-occlusive disease and one of infection (fungal). Four of the remaining five patients achieved sustained engraftment after the first marrow infusion; one patient had secondary graft failure requiring repeat marrow infusion but subsequently achieved engraftment. Of five evaluable patients, three had mild (grades I-II) acute GVHD and two had grade IV GVHD, which was fatal in both cases. Two of three evaluable surviving patients have chronic GVHD controlled with immunosuppression. Three patients survive 9 months to 3 years post-unrelated donor BMT: two who had early leukemia and one with severe aplasia at the time of transplant. These data indicate that unrelated donor BMT can be performed successfully in FA patients using cyclophosphamide 40 mg/kg and TBI 400 to 450 cGy, even after evolution to early leukemia. However, significant problems with both GVHD and engraftment remain. Future studies will evaluate the role of T cell depletion in improving the results of unrelated donor marrow transplantation in FA patients.","['Davies, S M', 'Khan, S', 'Wagner, J E', 'Arthur, D C', 'Auerbach, A D', 'Ramsay, N K', 'Weisdorf, D J']","['Davies SM', 'Khan S', 'Wagner JE', 'Arthur DC', 'Auerbach AD', 'Ramsay NK', 'Weisdorf DJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Fanconi Anemia/*therapy', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Jan;17(1):43-7.,,,"['N01-AI-85002/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-47095/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For second BMT, a uniform conditioning regimen consisting of busulfan and cyclophosphamide was used. Eleven patients had chronic myelogenous leukemia, seven acute leukemia, four lymphoma, and one myelodysplastic syndrome. Median patient age at second BMT was 32 years, the median time between first BMT and relapse was 22 months, and the median time to second BMT after relapse was 5 months. The second BMT marrow source included: autologous marrow (1), unrelated donors (4), new matched sibling donors (5) and same matched sibling donors as the first BMT (13). The Kaplan-Meier disease-free survival and survival rates at 3 years were 38 and 43%, respectively (median follow-up of survivors was 45 and 48 months, respectively), and five patients survive disease-free at 4-6 years.

In order to investigate the efficacy of rHuG-CSF in patients given a matched unrelated BMT with methotrexate as part of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis, we also analyzed the kinetics of engraftment in eight further children with acute or chronic leukemia, transplanted using a volunteer donor. Patients were treated with 5 micrograms/kg/day of rHuG-CSF by 1-h intravenous infusion from day +5 until the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was > or = 2 x 10(9)/l. No adverse effect related to treatment was observed in any patients. Children transplanted from an HLA-identical sibling and treated with rHuG-CSF reached an ANC count greater than 0.5 x 10(9)/l, 1 x 10(9)/l and of 2 x 10(9)/l in a significantly shorter time than the control group (day +9, +10 and +12, vs day +15, +22 and +29, respectively). An accelerated granulocyte production was also observed in patients receiving an unrelated transplant after a GVHD prophylaxis schedule including methotrexate, the median time to neutrophil recovery above 0.5 x 10(9)/l, 1 x 10(9)/l and 2 x 10(9)/l being +14, +15 and +17 days, respectively. In comparison to historical controls, all rHuG-CSF-treated patients had fewer days of fever, of antibiotic therapy and, only for children with HLA-compatible siblings, of hospitalization, whereas in the three groups the duration and severity of mucositis were comparable. No difference between the rHuG-CSF-treated patients and the historical controls given BMT from HLA-identical sibling was seen with regard to incidence of acute or chronic GVHD, relapse rate and actuarial event-free survival at day +100 and 1 year after transplantation. Our data suggest that in children given allogeneic BMT for acute or chronic leukemia, rHuG-CSF reduces duration of neutropenia, without increasing the rate of relapse or the incidence and severity of GVHD.","['Locatelli, F', 'Pession, A', 'Zecca, M', 'Bonetti, F', 'Prete, L', 'Carra, A M', 'Prete, A', 'Montagna, D', 'Comoli, P', 'Taibi, R M', 'Paolucci, G']","['Locatelli F', 'Pession A', 'Zecca M', 'Bonetti F', 'Prete L', 'Carra AM', 'Prete A', 'Montagna D', 'Comoli P', 'Taibi RM', 'Paolucci G']","['Clinica Pediatrica, Universita di Pavia, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Health Care Costs', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Jan;17(1):31-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found a continuing improvement more evident since 1987 for AML and since 1986 for ALL. A substantial reduction in the 3 years transplant related mortality (TRM): 26 vs 39% for AML (P = 10(-4)), and 25 vs 39% for ALL (P = 10(-4)), has resulted in an increase of the 5-year actuarial leukemia-free survival (LFS). 57 vs 45% for AML (P < 10(-4)) and 54 vs 45% (P = 10(-4)) for ALL. Four important changes have occurred. (1) Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prevention has involved an increased use of cyclosporin A (CsA) alone and subsequently its use in combination with methotrexate: this was associated with lower TRM both in AML and ALL; (2) Use of total body irradiation as pretransplant regimen has decreased; (3) a shorter interval from remission to BMT is more common; (4) an older population of patients has undergone BMT. Multivariate analyses were performed separately in AML and ALL. In AML four variables significantly influenced TRM favorably: year of BMT (P = 10(-4)), younger age at BMT (P = 10(-4)), prevention of GVHD including CsA (P = 0.008), sex match other than female donor to male recipient (P = 0.002). The relapse incidence (RI) was lower in patients with FAB M1-2-3 vs M4-5 (P = 0.0004). The LFS improved by year of BMT (P = 0.0004), younger age at BMT (P = 10(-4)), prevention of GVHD including CsA (P = 0.01), FAB M1-2-3 (P = 0.03). In ALL, three variables were associated with a lower TRM: year of BMT (P = 10(-4)), younger age at BMT (P = 10(-4)), sex combination other than female to male (P = 0.008). The LFS was better after 1986 (P = 0.0004) and in younger patients (P = 10(-4)). However a better outcome after 1986/87 was observed in patients receiving the same GVHD prophylaxis: therefore, other unidentified factors resulting in better patient care have also contributed to this. The improved results of allogeneic BMT are entirely related to a reduction in TRM without loss of the antileukemic effect since relapse incidence has not changed over the years.","['Frassoni, F', 'Labopin, M', 'Gluckman, E', 'Prentice, H G', 'Vernant, J P', 'Zwaan, F', 'Granena, A', 'Gahrton, G', 'De Witte, T', 'Gratwohl, A', 'Reiffers, J', 'Gorin, N C']","['Frassoni F', 'Labopin M', 'Gluckman E', 'Prentice HG', 'Vernant JP', 'Zwaan F', 'Granena A', 'Gahrton G', 'De Witte T', 'Gratwohl A', 'Reiffers J', 'Gorin NC']",,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Jan;17(1):13-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It also discusses whether to identify immunological subvariants of the blast crisis of CML is expedient.","['Baryshnikov, A Iu']",['Baryshnikov AIu'],,['rus'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Russia (Federation),Vestn Ross Akad Med Nauk,Vestnik Rossiiskoi akademii meditsinskikh nauk,9215641,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, CD7)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, CD7/analysis', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/immunology/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Stem Cells/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Vestn Ross Akad Med Nauk. 1996;(3):9-13.,53,,,,Ekspressiia antigenov primitivnoi stvolovoi kletki na blastnykh kletkakh bol'nykh khronicheskim mieloidnym leikozom.,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze the outcome and cost of mechanical ventilation for patients with malignancies, we retrospectively reviewed 115 patients with inoperable solid tumors or hematologic malignancies who received mechanical ventilation. Eighty eight of these 115 patients (77%) died while on mechanical ventilation; 18 patients (16%) were weaned from mechanical ventilation but still died during their hospitalization. Six patients (5%) were discharged but survived less than 3 months and only three patients (3%) survived for more than 3 months after discharge. The total time of mechanical ventilation was 772 person-days, which represented 5.5% (772/13974) of the total mechanical ventilator use in our hospital in 1993. The total hospital cost from initiation of mechanical ventilation to discharge or death of these 115 patients was NT $11,238,022 (US $432,200) and daily hospital cost per person during mechanical ventilation was approximately NT $10,845 (US $420). The ""daily cost of discharge survival"" (defined as total hospitalization cost from the initiation of mechanical ventilation to discharge or death divided by total discharge person-days) for patients with inoperable solid tumors was NT $73,421 (US $2,820)/per person-day. We concluded that mechanical ventilation should not be routinely used in patients with inoperable solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Physicians should explain the poor outcome to these patients and their families in advance and inquire about their willingness to forego mechanical ventilation.","['Lee, D L', 'Chiang, A A']","['Lee DL', 'Chiang AA']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Veterans General Hospital, Kaohsiung, Taiwan, R.O.C.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,,IM,"['Aged', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Respiration, Artificial/*economics', 'Retrospective Studies']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 1995 Dec;94 Suppl 2:S120-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of the Foss human melanoma cell line with LIF or OSM, two cytokines involved in acute-phase response, increased the expression of membrane alpha v beta 1 by 1.5-2 fold. The same phenomenon was observed on the SK-N-SH human neuroblastoma cell line. This modulation, which was inhibited by specific monoclonal antibodies against alpha v or beta 1 integrin subunits, was concomitant with improved tumor cell attachment to the fibronectin matrix. Similar results were obtained after TNF-alpha treatment.

Twenty-one chemicals that were positive in in vitro chromosomal aberration assays (CA) but negative in bacterial reverse mutation assays (BRM) were examined by the MLA using the microwell method. All chemicals were coded, and each chemical was tested by two or three laboratories. Positive responses were obtained with 14 chemicals: mitomycin C (an internal positive control), arsenic trioxide, cadmium sulphate, chlorendic acid, cytosine arabinoside, diethylstilbestrol, eugenol, 5-fluorouracil, griseofulvin, hexamethyl phosphoramide, hydroxyurea, methotrexate, monocrotaline and pentachloroethane. Two chemicals (benzene and chlorodibromomethane) showed positive responses in one of two laboratories and were judged probably positive chemicals. Three chemicals (bromodichloromethane, isophorone and tetrachloroethane) were inconclusive because of a marginal response in one laboratory and a negative response in the other. Urethane was judged probably negative because two laboratories out of three showed clear negative responses. Dideoxycytidine (DDC) was a clear negative chemical in this study. The present results showed that 75.0% of the test chemicals (15/20, excluding mitomycin C) were positive, 15.0% (3/20) were inconclusive, and 10.0% (2/20) were negative. This suggests that the MLA may detect a majority of CA-positive chemicals. The inconclusive chemicals, however, are critical for the judgement of the MLA potential to detect clastogens. The findings that DDC was clearly negative suggests that the MLA may not be able to detect some clastogens. To clarify these issues, we began the second phase of the collaborative study with other BRM-negative and CA-positive chemicals.","['Sofuni, T', 'Honma, M', 'Hayashi, M', 'Shimada, H', 'Tanaka, N', 'Wakuri, S', 'Awogi, T', 'Yamamoto, K I', 'Nishi, Y', 'Nakadate, M']","['Sofuni T', 'Honma M', 'Hayashi M', 'Shimada H', 'Tanaka N', 'Wakuri S', 'Awogi T', 'Yamamoto KI', 'Nishi Y', 'Nakadate M']","['National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,['0 (Mutagens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'International Cooperation', 'Japan', 'Laboratories', 'Leukemia L5178', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests/*methods', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Spindle Apparatus/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1996 Jul;11(4):349-55. doi: 10.1093/mutage/11.4.349.,,['10.1093/mutage/11.4.349 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To do this, it was first necessary to devise a complex serum-free medium (CSFM) in which to test its activity. Blastocyst formation rates in CSFM microdrops (18.4%) showed no difference to those obtained previously for embryos cultured in 1 ml T6 medium containing 10% serum (25%). The majority of blastocysts were of optimal blastocyst grade (BG1/BG2) as compared to the poor grade (BG3). The percentage of BG1/BG2 blastocysts was decreased in CSFM microdrops (10.2%) compared to that observed in T6 medium (24.8%). Addition of 1000 IU/ml LIF to CSFM microdrops increased the blastocyst formation rate from 18.4 to 43.6% (P = 0.025) and increased the percentage of BG1/BG2 blastocysts (33%; P = 0.025) to levels comparable with those observed in T6 medium. Thus LIF significantly increased the quality and number of human blastocysts formed in CSFM medium, increasing the potential for blastocyst transfer in human in-vitro fertilization (IVF).","['Dunglison, G F', 'Barlow, D H', 'Sargent, I L']","['Dunglison GF', 'Barlow DH', 'Sargent IL']","['Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford OX3 9DU, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Reprod,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",8701199,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Blastocyst/*physiology', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Culture Techniques', 'Embryo Transfer', 'Fertilization in Vitro', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Reprod. 1996 Jan;11(1):191-6. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a019016.,,['10.1093/oxfordjournals.humrep.a019016 [doi]'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tax activation of many of these target genes appears to be mediated by the NF-kappa B/Rel and CREB/ATF family of cellular transcription factors. However, the mechanism by which Tax transactivates the IL-2 gene remains unclear. In the present study, we demonstrate that neither NF-kappa B/Rel nor CREB/ATF is sufficient for Tax-mediated activation of the IL-2 promoter. Two novel nuclear protein complexes are induced by Tax and specifically bind to an IL-2 gene enhancer, the CD28-responsive element (CD28RE). Immunobiochemical analyses suggest that these DNA binding complexes contain at least two members of the nuclear factor of activated T cells, NF-ATp and NF-ATc. However, the CD28 binding NF-AT complexes do not contain Jun and Fos family proteins that have been proposed to serve as NF-AT partners in the activation of the IL-2 NF-AT motif. Transient transfection studies demonstrate that the in vivo expressed NF-ATp binds to the CD28RE probe and enhances Tax-mediated activation of this critical IL-2 enhancer. We demonstrate further that binding of NF-AT to CD28RE is critical for Tax activation of the IL-2 promoter. Together, these results suggest a novel mechanism of Tax-mediated activation of the IL-2 gene, which involves the induction of NF-AT-containing CD28RE binding complexes.","['Good, L', 'Maggirwar, S B', 'Sun, S C']","['Good L', 'Maggirwar SB', 'Sun SC']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey Medical Center, PA 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Relb protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', '*CD28 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/metabolism', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'NFATC Transcription Factors', '*Nuclear Proteins', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factor RelB', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Jul 15;15(14):3744-50.,,,['1 R01 CA68471-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC452042,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known about the molecular basis of this cellular decision. The family of signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat) proteins are involved in signaling through a variety of cytokine and growth factor receptors, although their biological roles have not been established. To address whether Stat proteins play roles in IL-6-induced growth or differentiation, we introduced two types of mutant Stat3 acting in a dominant-negative manner into M1 leukemic cells which respond to IL-6 with growth arrest and terminal differentiation. We show that dominant-negative forms of Stat3 inhibited both IL-6-induced growth arrest at G(0)/G1 and macrophage differentiation in the M1 transformants. Blocking of Stat activation resulted in inhibition of IL-6-induced repression of c-myb and c-myc. Furthermore, IL-6 enhanced the growth of M1 cells primarily through shortening the length of the G1 period when Stat3 was suppressed. Thus IL-6 generates both growth-enhancing signals and growth arrest- and differentiation-inducing signals at the same time. Stat3 may be a key molecule which determines the cellular decision from cell growth to differentiation in M1 cells.","['Nakajima, K', 'Yamanaka, Y', 'Nakae, K', 'Kojima, H', 'Ichiba, M', 'Kiuchi, N', 'Kitaoka, T', 'Fukada, T', 'Hibi, M', 'Hirano, T']","['Nakajima K', 'Yamanaka Y', 'Nakae K', 'Kojima H', 'Ichiba M', 'Kiuchi N', 'Kitaoka T', 'Fukada T', 'Hibi M', 'Hirano T']","['Department of Molecular Oncology, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'G1 Phase', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Jul 15;15(14):3651-8.,,,,,,PMC451995,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which v-Rel induces oncogenic transformation remains unclear. Several attempts to transform mammalian cells with v-Rel have failed, suggesting that v-Rel transformation may be a species-specific event. However, here we demonstrate that v-Rel, but not a truncated c-Rel, expressed under the control of the lck promoter, efficiently induced malignancies in transgenic mice. Most of the animals died before 10 months of age and developed immature, multicentric aggressive T-cell leukemia/lymphomas. Most tumors contain CD4+CD8+ cells or CD4-CD8+ cells, which have an immature rather than a mature peripheral phenotype. No tumor development was observed in control littermates and transgenic mice expressing a truncated form of c-Rel. Tumor formation was correlated with the presence of constitutive p50/v-Rel DNA binding activity and overexpression of several kappa B-regulated genes in v-rel transgenic thymocytes. However, v-Rel is also transforming in transgenic thymocytes lacking p50, indicating that p50/v-Rel heterodimer formation is not essential for the transforming activity of v-Rel. The transforming activity of v-Rel in p50 null mice has been identified as v-Rel/v-Rel homodimers. Since tumors represent immature T-lymphocytes, constitutive v-Rel expression appears to be leukemogenic at earlier stages of T-cell development. These v-Rel mice should aid in the study of lymphoma development, T-cell development and NF-kappa B regulation.","['Carrasco, D', 'Rizzo, C A', 'Dorfman, K', 'Bravo, R']","['Carrasco D', 'Rizzo CA', 'Dorfman K', 'Bravo R']","['Department of Oncology, Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Princeton, NJ 08543-4000, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I kappa B beta protein)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NUP107 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins v-rel)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chickens', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Interleukin-2/physiology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit', '*Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Oncogene Proteins v-rel', '*Oncogenes', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/genetics/physiology', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,EMBO J. 1996 Jul 15;15(14):3640-50.,,,,,,PMC451988,,,,,,,,,,,

We isolated stable transfectants of RBL-2H3 cells that overexpressed PHGPx.

Cells that overexpressed PHGPx were three times more resistant than parent cells and mock-transfected cells to the cytotoxic effects of an radical initiator (AAPH) that induced the oxidative stress. This resistance to damage by AAPH of cells that overexpressed PHGPx was not observed after pretreatment with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of the synthesis of glutathione.

Exocytotic events of individual granules including fusion, extrusion, and membrane retrieval were visualized in individual cells stimulated with antigen or A23187. Exocytosis of granules stimulated with A23187 showed two peaks in its time courses. The earlier one of the peaks was inhibited by wortmannin ( > 100 nM), as an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and the other was not. Exocytosis by antigen-stimulation, however, showed only one peak, which was inhibited by low concentration of wortmannin ( < 50 nM) as an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase).

In the present study, the peptide fragments liberated from the chicken liver enzyme by digestion with trypsin in dilute solutions of urea or guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) have been separated by FPLC and sequenced. The sequences obtained are unique when compared with the known sequence of DHFR and thus allow the points of proteolytic cleavage identified for the urea- and GuHCl-activated enzyme to be at or near the active site. It was also indicated by the enhanced fluorescence of 2-p-toluidinylnaphthalene 6-sulfonate that conformational changes at the active site in dilute GuHCl parallel GuHCl activation. The above results indicate that the activation of DHFR in dilute denaturants is accompanied by a loosening up of its compact structure especially at or near the active site, suggesting that the flexibility at its active site is essential for the full expression of its catalytic activity.","['Fan, Y X', 'Ju, M', 'Zhou, J M', 'Tsou, C L']","['Fan YX', 'Ju M', 'Zhou JM', 'Tsou CL']","['National Laboratory of Biomacromolecules, Institute of Biophysics, Academia Sinica, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Guanidines)', '0 (Naphthalenesulfonates)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Solutions)', '7724-15-4 (2-(4-toluidino)-6-naphthalenesulfonic acid)', '8W8T17847W (Urea)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'JU58VJ6Y3B (Guanidine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Chickens', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fluorescence', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Guanidine', 'Guanidines/*pharmacology', 'Liver/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Naphthalenesulfonates', 'Peptide Fragments/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Denaturation', 'Solutions', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Trypsin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Urea/*pharmacology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1996 Apr 1;315 ( Pt 1):97-102. doi: 10.1042/bj3150097.,,['10.1042/bj3150097 [doi]'],,,,PMC1217202,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubations for 48 h with 30 microM eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, n-3; EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, n-3; DHA) results primarily in substitution of long chain n-6 fatty acids with long-chain n-3 fatty acids. This results in a decrease in the n-6/n-3 ratio from 6.9 in unsupplemented cultures to 1.2 or 1.6 for EPA and DHA supplemented cultures, respectively. Coincident with these changes in membrane fatty acid composition, we observed a 5-fold increase in the rate of adenosine (5 microM) uptake via a nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR)-sensitive nucleoside transporter in EPA- and DHA-supplemented L1210 cells, relative to unsupplemented cells. This seemed to result from a decrease in the Km for adenosine from 12.5 microM in unsupplemented cultures to 5.1 microM in DHA-treated cultures. Guanosine (50 microM) transport was similarly affected by DHA with a 3.5-fold increase in the initial rate of uptake. In contrast, pyrimidine transport, as measured by uptake of thymidine and cytidine, was not similarly affected, suggesting that substrate recognition had been altered by fatty acid supplementation. Studies using [(3)H]NBMPR showed that there was no effect of EPA or DHA on either the number of NBMPR-binding sites or the affinity of these sites for NBMPR. This observation suggests that the increases in adenosine and guanosine transport were not due to increases in the number of transported sites but rather that EPA and DHA directly or indirectly modulate transporter function.","['Martin, D', 'Meckling-Gill, K A']","['Martin D', 'Meckling-Gill KA']","['Department of Human Biology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Purines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacokinetics', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Substrate Specificity']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1996 Apr 1;315 ( Pt 1):329-33. doi: 10.1042/bj3150329.,,['10.1042/bj3150329 [doi]'],,,,PMC1217190,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The final height of 28 long term survivors (18 males; 10 females), allografted before or at the onset of puberty, at a median age of 10.8 years (range 6.3 to 14.6) and who did not receive growth hormone (GH) treatment or other growth promoting agents, was evaluated. Median follow up period after bone marrow transplantation was 7.9 years (range 3.2 to 11.4), and age at the most recent evaluation 18.1 years (range 15.6 to 24.5). Height values were expressed in standard deviation score (SDS) from the mean of the normal population. Height at bone marrow transplantation was compared with final height as well as with parental genetic height. Patients were divided into three groups: severe aplastic anaemia (SAA): three patients given no radiotherapy; leukaemia-total body irradiation (TBI): 14 patients with acute or chronic leukaemia conditioned with chemotherapy and TBI; leukaemia-TBI with previous cranial radiation therapy (CRT): 11 patients. None of the patients had solid tumour. RESULTS: There was a decrease in final height SDS compared to pre-transplantation height SDS (paired t test, p < 0.0001). All patients except one reached an adult height above -2.0 SDS. A significant decrease in height SDS was found in the TBI and the CRT groups (paired t test, p = 0.02 and p = 0.0002, respectively). Whereas height SDS value at the time of transplant was higher than the genetic height SDS, final height SDS values were lower. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the decrease in height SDS found after bone marrow transplantation, 27 of the 28 patients spontaneously achieved what is considered to be a normal height SDS (above -2.0 SDS). This should be taken into account when considering GH treatment in children who underwent bone marrow transplantation for malignant haematological diseases.","['Cohen, A', 'Rovelli, A', 'Van-Lint, M T', 'Uderzo, C', 'Morchio, A', 'Pezzini, C', 'Masera, G', 'Bacigalupo, A', 'Romano, C']","['Cohen A', 'Rovelli A', 'Van-Lint MT', 'Uderzo C', 'Morchio A', 'Pezzini C', 'Masera G', 'Bacigalupo A', 'Romano C']","['University Department of Paediatrics I, Gaslini Institute, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Anemia, Aplastic/*therapy', '*Body Height/radiation effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*physiology', 'Brain/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Growth Disorders/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1996 May;74(5):437-40. doi: 10.1136/adc.74.5.437.,,['10.1136/adc.74.5.437 [doi]'],,,,PMC1511535,,,,,,,,,,,

Our novel neurotropic retrovirus is a useful experimental model for the development of drugs against HIV infection.","['Takase-Yoden, S', 'Shibahara, S', 'Morisawa, H', 'Watanabe, R']","['Takase-Yoden S', 'Shibahara S', 'Morisawa H', 'Watanabe R']","['Institute of Life Science, Soka University, Hachioji, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Antiviral Res,Antiviral research,8109699,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Inosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Organothiophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Brain/cytology/*virology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA, Viral/drug effects', 'Inosine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*drug effects/isolation & purification', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuroglia/*virology', 'Organothiophosphorus Compounds/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects', 'RNA, Viral/drug effects', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antiviral Res. 1995 Dec;28(4):359-68. doi: 10.1016/0166-3542(95)00061-5.,,"['0166354295000615 [pii]', '10.1016/0166-3542(95)00061-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although there was great variability in the shape of these fluctuations from different cells, they all could be represented by the same fractal form. This form displayed two different regimes. At short lags, the Hurst exponent H = 0.76 +/- 0.05 (SD) and, at long lags, H = 0.26 +/- 0.04 (SD). This finding indicated that, over short time intervals, the correlations were persistent (H > 0.5), that is, increases in the membrane voltage were more likely to be followed by additional increases. However, over long time intervals, the correlations were antipersistent (H < 0.5), that is, increases in the membrane voltage were more likely to be followed by voltage decreases. Within each time regime, the increments in the fluctuations had characteristics that were consistent with those of fractional Gaussian noise (fGn), and the membrane voltage as a function of time had characteristics that were consistent with those of fractional Brownian motion (fBm).","['Churilla, A M', 'Gottschalke, W A', 'Liebovitch, L S', 'Selector, L Y', 'Todorov, A T', 'Yeandle, S']","['Churilla AM', 'Gottschalke WA', 'Liebovitch LS', 'Selector LY', 'Todorov AT', 'Yeandle S']","['Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Biomed Eng,Annals of biomedical engineering,0361512,,IM,"['Animals', 'Electric Conductivity', '*Fractals', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/physiopathology', 'Mathematical Computing', 'Membrane Potentials/physiology', 'Mice', 'Models, Cardiovascular', 'Motion', 'Nonlinear Dynamics', 'Patch-Clamp Techniques', 'Random Allocation', 'Reference Values', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/physiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Biomed Eng. 1996 Jan-Feb;24(1):99-108. doi: 10.1007/BF02770999.,,['10.1007/BF02770999 [doi]'],['EY-6234/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only 37 cases of plasma cell neoplasia (MM and plasma cell leukemia) with meningeal involvement have been reported. CASE: A 60-year-old male with stage IIIA light lambda chain MM returned nine months after the diagnosis with back pain, lower right extremity paresthesias and gait disturbance. A lumbar puncture revealed atypical plasma cells in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and immunocytochemical studies showed a cytoplasmic monoclonal light lambda chain. A diagnosis of myelomatous meningitis was made, and the patient received intrathecal chemotherapy and craniospinal irradiation. He died six months after the diagnosis of meningeal disease. CONCLUSION: The present case and a review of the literature show that clinical manifestations of meningeal myeloma are non-specific. MM with meningeal involvement is accompanied frequently by circulating atypical plasma cells or plasma cell leukemia. Atypical plasma cells in the CSF are an important finding for the diagnosis of meningeal myeloma, and their neoplastic nature can be best identified by immunocytochemical analyses. Patients with meningeal myelomatosis can have a good response to treatment initially, but their prognosis is poor.","['Cavanna, L', 'Invernizzi, R', ""Berte', R"", 'Vallisa, D', 'Buscarini, L']","['Cavanna L', 'Invernizzi R', ""Berte' R"", 'Vallisa D', 'Buscarini L']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, City Hospital of Piacenza, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,,IM,"['Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/diagnosis/pathology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/complications/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Meningitis/diagnosis/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/complications/*diagnosis/pathology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Cytol. 1996 May-Jun;40(3):571-5. doi: 10.1159/000333918.,,['10.1159/000333918 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been reported that AML1 plays several pivotal roles in myeloid hematopoietic differentiation and other biological phenomena, probably through the transcriptional regulation of various relevant genes. Here, we investigated the mechanism of regulation of AML1 functions through signal transduction pathways. The results showed that AML1 is phosphorylated in vivo on two serine residues within the proline-, serine-, and threonine-rich region, with dependence on the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and with interleukin-3 stimulation in a hematopoietic cell line. These in vivo phosphorylation sites of AML1 were phosphorylated directly in vitro by ERK. Although differences between wild-type AML1 and phosphorylation site mutants in DNA-binding affinity were not observed, we have shown that ERK-dependent phosphorylation potentiates the transactivation ability of AML1. Furthermore the phosphorylation site mutations reduced the transforming capacity of AML1 in fibroblast cells. These data indicate that AML1 functions are potentially regulated by ERK, which is activated by cytokine and growth factor stimuli. This study provides some important clues for clarifying unidentified facets of the regulatory mechanism of AML1 function.","['Tanaka, T', 'Kurokawa, M', 'Ueki, K', 'Tanaka, K', 'Imai, Y', 'Mitani, K', 'Okazaki, K', 'Sagata, N', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Shibata, Y', 'Kadowaki, T', 'Hirai, H']","['Tanaka T', 'Kurokawa M', 'Ueki K', 'Tanaka K', 'Imai Y', 'Mitani K', 'Okazaki K', 'Sagata N', 'Yazaki Y', 'Shibata Y', 'Kadowaki T', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, University of Tokyo, Bunkyo-ku, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 2.7.11.17 (Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Jul;16(7):3967-79. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.7.3967.,,['10.1128/MCB.16.7.3967 [doi]'],,,,PMC231393,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies demonstrate that the CD28 response element (CD28RE) of the interleukin 2 (IL-2) promoter is the site upregulated by Tax in stimulated T cells. Although some reports suggest that this site is transactivated by NF-kappaB family members, others disagree, leaving the identity of the transcription factor(s) binding the CD28RE unclear. The studies presented here further characterize the response of the IL-2 promoter and CD28RE to the HTLV-1 Tax protein and demonstrate that the TATA-proximal AP-1 binding site of the IL-2 promoter is also necessary for Tax transactivation in stimulated Jurkat cells. In contrast to its upregulation of the IL-2 promoter which requires T-cell stimulation, Tax transactivates the isolated CD28RE-AP-1 element without stimulation but is greatly synergized by calcium ionophore and phorbol ester. Additionally, transactivation of the IL-2 promoter requires the Tax activation domain involved in upregulation of bZIP-enhanced transcription while the NF-kappaB-activating domain of Tax is dispensable. Interestingly, both domains appear to be necessary for the activation of the isolated CD28RE-AP-1 sequence in the context of a heterologous promoter construct. This strongly suggests that activation of NF-kappaB is insufficient to activate transcription via the CD28RE-AP-1 element of the IL-2 promoter and that a different transcription factor, upregulated via the activation domain of the HTLV-1 Tax protein, may be involved.","['Curtiss, V E', 'Smilde, R', 'McGuire, K L']","['Curtiss VE', 'Smilde R', 'McGuire KL']","['Department of Biology, San Diego State University, California 92182-4614, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '9002-72-6 (Growth Hormone)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'CD28 Antigens/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Growth Hormone/biosynthesis', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Ionomycin/pharmacology', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Jul;16(7):3567-75. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.7.3567.,,['10.1128/MCB.16.7.3567 [doi]'],['CA-53382/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC231352,,,,,,,,,,,

TFG3 is significantly similar to ENL and AF-9, two proteins implicated in human acute leukemia.

With this objective the Childhood ALL Collaborative Group coordinated a worldwide overview of all randomised trials that began before 1987. METHODS: Individual patient data were sought for about 3900 children in trials of longer vs shorter maintenance (eg, 3 vs 2 years), 3700 in trials of intensive ""reinduction"" chemotherapy during maintenance, and 4400 in trials of various other questions, including 1300 in trials of pulses of vincristine and prednisone (VP) during maintenance. Analyses were of survival in first remission, overall survival, and cause-specific mortality. FINDINGS: Deaths during remission were increased by longer maintenance (2.7 percent vs 1.2 percent), VP pulses (4.0 vs 3.2 percent), and intensive reinduction (4.8 percent vs 3.3 percent), but these increases were counterbalanced by reductions in relapses. Total events (relapse or death) were significantly reduced by longer maintenance (23.3 percent vs 27.6 percent), VP pulses (31.2 percent vs 40.4 percent) and intensive reinduction (27.8 percent vs 35.8 percent) (each 2p<0.001). Many of those who relapsed were successfully re-treated, however, and only for intensive reinduction was overall survival significantly improved (18.5 percent vs 22.3 percent; 2p=0.01). INTERPRETATION: Intensive reinduction chemotherapy in these trials produced an absolute improvement of about 4 percent in long-term survival; if the extra deaths in remission had been avoided, this would have been a 5 percent benefit. Further improvements in survival seem more likely to be obtained with intensive treatment than with longer low-level maintenance.",,,"['Childhood AlL Secretariat, CTSU, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lancet,"Lancet (London, England)",2985213R,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Analysis']",1996/06/29 00:00,1996/06/29 00:01,['1996/06/29 00:00'],"['1996/06/29 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/29 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/29 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Lancet. 1996 Jun 29;347(9018):1783-8. doi: 10.1016/s0140-6736(96)91615-3.,,"['S0140-6736(96)91615-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0140-6736(96)91615-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,['Childhood ALL Collaborative Group'],"['Richards S', 'Gray R', 'Peto R', 'Gaynon P', 'Masera G', 'Masera G', 'Pession A', 'Rondelli R', 'Valsecchi MG', 'Reiter A', 'Riehm H', 'Schrappe M', 'McIntyre OR', 'Bleyer A', 'Cairo M', 'Gaynon P', 'Reaman G', 'Sather H', 'Trigg M', 'Auclerc MF', 'Bancillon A', 'Lepage E', 'Schaison G', 'Clavell L', 'Datton V', 'Donnelly M', 'Gelber R', 'Sallan SE', 'Sackman-Smith EC', 'Lilleyman J', 'Land VJ', 'Mahoney D', 'Murphy S', 'Steuber CP', 'Vietti T', 'Crist W', 'Hancock M', 'Pui CH', 'Simone J', 'Mittra I', 'Shetty PA', 'Allison R', 'Baigent C', 'Clarke M', 'Duong H', 'Durrant J', 'Godwin J', 'Gray R', 'Greaves E', 'Harwood C', 'Peto J', 'Richards S', 'Sinclair D', 'Wheatley K']","['Richards, S', 'Gray, R', 'Peto, R', 'Gaynon, P', 'Masera, G', 'Masera, G', 'Pession, A', 'Rondelli, R', 'Valsecchi, M G', 'Reiter, A', 'Riehm, H', 'Schrappe, M', 'McIntyre, O R', 'Bleyer, A', 'Cairo, M', 'Gaynon, P', 'Reaman, G', 'Sather, H', 'Trigg, M', 'Auclerc, M F', 'Bancillon, A', 'Lepage, E', 'Schaison, G', 'Clavell, L', 'Datton, V', 'Donnelly, M', 'Gelber, R', 'Sallan, S E', 'Sackman-Smith, E C', 'Lilleyman, J', 'Land, V J', 'Mahoney, D', 'Murphy, S', 'Steuber, C P', 'Vietti, T', 'Crist, W', 'Hancock, M', 'Pui, C H', 'Simone, J', 'Mittra, I', 'Shetty, P A', 'Allison, R', 'Baigent, C', 'Clarke, M', 'Duong, H', 'Durrant, J', 'Godwin, J', 'Gray, R', 'Greaves, E', 'Harwood, C', 'Peto, J', 'Richards, S', 'Sinclair, D', 'Wheatley, K']",,,,,

Upon binding of glucocorticoid to the receptor, the ligand-binding protein, which dissociated from hsp90s, enters the nucleus, binds to a specific site in DNA, and thus transmits signal(s). The 70 kDa heat shock protein (hsp70) also works as a molecular chaperone when the ligand-binding protein enters the nucleus. Regarding the mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance, a decreased expression of glucocorticoid receptor and a mutant protein with low ligand binding affinity have been reported. In the present study, to address other mechanisms of glucocorticoid resistance, we examined the expression of hsp90 and hsp70 in addition to the number of glucocorticoid-binding sites and their affinity using glucocorticoid-sensitive and -resistant human leukemic cell lines. We showed that two of nine resistant cell lines with normal glucocorticoid-binding proteins express aberrant hsp90 and extremely low hsp70, while another seven resistant cell lines had decreased binding sites with normal hsps.

Results of this analysis demonstrated a 17% frequency of this translocation in the ALL population overall and 19% in patients with B-lineage ALL, similar to previous findings in Caucasian children. None of the patients with AML had TEL/AML1 fusion transcripts. In addition to its association with the B-lineage immunophenotype, TEL/AML1 was also correlated with a low presenting leukocyte count and favorable age (1-10 years).

By analysis of the purified tif cytoplasmic domain expressed in Escherichia coli, we have demonstrated that tif is an active protein tyrosine kinase capable of autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues and this phosphorylation is inhibited by a tyrosine-specific inhibitor genistein. Northern blot analyses of various leukemia cell lines have revealed that tif mRNA expression is primarily confined to those bearing erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes. Megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 and HEL cells induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate is accompanied by down-regulation of tif mRNA expression. In addition, treatment of K562 and HEL with hexamethylene bis-acetamide, but not with hemin, decreases the steady-state level of tif mRNA.

In the majority of cases, breakages occur at two breakpoint cluster regions; major breakpoint cluster (MBR) and minor cluster region (mcr). In a minority of cases with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), rearrangements involving the 5' flanking region of the BCL2 (5'-BCL2) have been reported. Here, we investigated 196 patients with NHL and 31 with CLL, with regard to rearrangement of the BCL2 gene. Hybridization analyses using probes representing the three cluster regions revealed that a total of 57 patients had a rearrangement of the BCL2; 42 (73.7%) were within the MBR, seven (12.2%) were within the mcr, and nine (15.8%) had a rearrangement at the 5'-BCL2. The nine patients with 5'BCL2 rearrangement included two with follicular lymphoma, four with diffuse large cell lymphoma and immunoblastic variant, two with leukemic phase of follicular lymphoma, and one with CLL. Comigration analysis with probes for the IG heavy chain gene (IGH), kappa-chain gene (IG kappa) and lambda-chain gene (IG lambda), demonstrated a 5'-BCL2/IGH junction at the JH region in four patients with NHL derived from follicular center B cell. Thus, the 5'flanking region is a third cluster for recombination between the BCL2 and IGH, which is closely associated with the development of follicular center cell lymphoma. Molecular cloning of a 5'-BCL2/IGH junction demonstrated recombination of the two affected genes in divergent orientation. A 5'-BCL2/IG kappa junction was observed in two patients with immunoblastic lymphoma, and one with CLL had a 5'-BCL2/IG lambda recombination. Two patients, including one with a BCL2-MBR/JH junction, lacked obvious recombination of the 5'-BCL2 with IG genes, suggesting the presence of a deletion at the 5'-BCL2. Our findings demonstrated heterogeneity not only in clinicopathological presentation of B cell disease with rearrangement of 5'-BCL2, but also in molecular lesions resulting from the rearrangement.","['Yabumoto, K', 'Akasaka, T', 'Muramatsu, M', 'Kadowaki, N', 'Hayashi, T', 'Ohno, H', 'Fukuhara, S', 'Okuma, M']","['Yabumoto K', 'Akasaka T', 'Muramatsu M', 'Kadowaki N', 'Hayashi T', 'Ohno H', 'Fukuhara S', 'Okuma M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Chromosome Fragility', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multigene Family/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jun;10(6):970-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify specific patients who should or should not receive a second induction course identical to the first we analyzed outcome in 370 patients with persistent AML after CO1 who received a second identical course. One hundred and forty-two (38%) achieved CR on this course; median subsequent disease-free survival (DFS) in these 142 was 29 weeks and 10% were alive in CR at 5 years. The 5-year DFS of CO2 responders was significantly lower than that of CO1 responders (10 vs 24%, P < 0.001). Logistic regression identified pretreatment cytogenetic abnormalities (except inv 16, t(8;21), or t(15;17)), presence of an antecedent hematologic disorder or secondary AML as each having unfavorable prognostic import similar to the case in untreated patients. Treatment with ""high-dose' rather than standard-dose cytarabine increased the probability of 2nd course CR. The occurrence of pneumonia, sepsis, or major hemorrhage were prognostically unfavorable, primarily in the high-dose cytarabine group, and, once in CR, DFS was shorter in this group. Equations predicting probability of 2nd course CR were derived. If validated prospectively these could be used to assign patients to either receive a second course of initial induction therapy or to change to salvage or investigational therapy after the first course. Alternatively, they could be used to stratify patients entering a prospective randomized trial comparing these two strategies.","['Anderlini, P', 'Ghaddar, H M', 'Smith, T L', 'Pierce, S', 'Kantarjian, H M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Keating, M J', 'Freireich, E J', 'Estey, E H']","['Anderlini P', 'Ghaddar HM', 'Smith TL', 'Pierce S', 'Kantarjian HM', ""O'Brien S"", 'Keating MJ', 'Freireich EJ', 'Estey EH']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jun;10(6):964-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The identification of these rearrangements provides critical diagnostic and prognostic information, which may contribute to the selection of specific anti-leukemic therapy. The translocation t(9;22), the equivalent of the BCR/ABL rearrangement, is associated with a poor prognosis. We therefore used RT-PCR to detect this molecular event in a prospective study including 890 children. 673 of them suffered from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) at primary diagnosis and a transcription of the chimeric gene was detected in 21 of 648 with a successful analysis (3.2%). All children were treated by one of the two German multicenter childhood ALL therapy studies ALL-BFM-90 or COALL-05-92, respectively. Comparison of clinical features between BCR/ABL-positive and -negative children showed no significant differences regarding WBC, percentage of blasts, splenomegaly, hepatomegaly and age. Immunophenotypic studies at diagnosis in 21 BCR/ABL-positive children identified common ALL in 16 patients (76.2%), pre-B-ALL in four (19.0%), and an early T-lineage ALL in one (4.8%). Coexpression of myeloid antigens (CD13 and/or CD33) was observed in six of 16 common ALL patients as well as in the one child with early T-lineage ALL phenotype. The type of breakpoint (m-BCR/ABL: n = 14; M-BCR/ABL: n = 7) showed no correlation with clinical parameters. A comparison of cytogenetic and molecular data was performed in 16 positive patients and was concordant in all of them. We analyzed the response to the prednisone pretreatment and found a higher incidence of poor responders among the BCR/ABL-positive children.

We therefore analyzed event-free survival according to age group in 96 children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 51 treated for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) before the age of 2 years. The study population was registered in consecutive institutional trials of multiagent chemotherapy conducted between 1980 and 1994. Among infants with ALL, event-free survival was significantly poorer in the 0- to 6-month-old group than in patients treated between 6 and 12 months of age (P = 0.03), whose outcome was in turn inferior to that in the 12- to 18-month and 18- to 24-month age groups (P = 0.013). Leukemic cells from ALL patients younger than 12 months had a significantly higher frequency of 11q23/MLL abnormalities, as well as better growth in stromal cell culture, compared to lymphoblasts from the older groups (P < 0.01). The only independent predictor of adverse prognosis among infants diagnosed with ALL before age 12 months was the presence of an 11q23/MLL rearrangement (P = 0.03). These findings contrast sharply with results for the AML cohort, whose event-free survival did not vary significantly by age group (P = 0.58). Male sex (P = 0.01) and leukocyte count > or = 50 x 10(9/l) (P = 0.04), but not 11q23 abnormalities, were independently associated with a poorer outcome for children with AML younger than 12 months at diagnosis.

Dysplastic features in one or more lineages are also found frequently in bone marrow aspirates from patients with de novo AML and have been associated with an unfavorable prognosis. We asked whether dyshematopoiesis is an independent prognostic factor or an indicator of unrecognized secondary leukemia, identified by characteristic chromosomal abnormalities. Bone marrow aspirates from 102 patients with newly diagnosed AML were analyzed. Morphological analysis was obtained in all patients, flow cytometric analysis in 96 and successful cytogenetic analysis in 65 bone marrow aspirates. Dysgranulopoiesis (DysG) was found in 55, dysmegakaryopoiesis (DysM) in 32 and dyserythropoiesis (DysE) in 23 patients. Decreased side scatter signals of neutrophils in the flow cytometric analysis (DysS) were detected in 32 patients. DysG and DysS showed a highly significant correlation (P = 0.0005). DysG was an adverse negative prognostic factor for remission rate and event-free survival (P = 0.04, P = 0.02). An unfavorable karyotype was associated with a significantly lower chance for event-free survival (P = 0.002). The incidence of an unfavorable karyotype was significantly higher in patients with DysG (P = 0.01), DysM (P = 0.02) and DysS (P = 0.01). In patients with an unfavorable karyotype, dysplasia had no additional prognostic influence, however, in patients with a normal, favorable or prognostically uncertain karyotype DysG remained a predictor of lower remission rate (P = 0.03).

Correlative studies indicate its association with poor risk features including secondary AML, CD34+ surface phenotype, unfavorable karyotype and advanced age. Reported disparity in the prognostic impact of Pgp relates in part to variance in drug transport capacity. In Pgp expressing cells, capacity for drug extrusion is governed by maturation phenotype and is largely restricted to CD34+ populations lacking myeloid maturation antigens. Three competitive inhibitors of Pgp function showing promise in pilot studies, cyclosporin A (CsA), quinine and the cyclosporin D analogue PSC 833, have entered testing in phase III trials. The presence of non-Pgp-related mechanisms of multidrug resistance, relatively insensitive to Pgp modulators, may limit the success of such treatment strategies. Preliminary investigations indicate that overexpression of the gene encoding the multidrug resistance-related protein (MRP) occurs infrequently in de novo AML, but relative increases in gene message are evident in relapsed specimens. Overexpression of lung resistance protein (LRP) is associated with adverse prognostic variables such as age, secondary disease and Pgp, and has demonstrated prognostic relevance. Because treatment with Pgp modulators may select for this drug resistance phenotype, LRP merits evaluation in randomized trials of Pgp antagonists. These observations indicate that multiple biological mechanisms contribute to anthracycline resistance in AML, thereby warranting development of multifunctional modulators or chemotherapeutic agents with novel mechanisms of action.","['List, A F']",['List AF'],"['Section of Hematology/Oncology, Arizona Cancer Center, University of Arizona College of Medicine, Tucson 85724, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD34/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporine/therapeutic use', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Quinine/therapeutic use']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jun;10(6):937-42.,43,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The same cytokines protect normal and leukemic cells from induction of apoptosis by irradiation and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic compounds. This suggests that decreasing the levels of viability inducing cytokines may increase the effectiveness of cytotoxic anti-cancer therapy. The susceptibility of normal and cancer cells to induction of apoptosis is also regulated by the balance between apoptosis-inducing genes such as the tumor suppressor wild-type p53, and c-myc and bax, and apoptosis-suppressing genes such as the oncogene mutant p53, and bcl-2 and bcl-XL. Cell susceptibility to induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells could be enhanced by increased expression of apoptosis-inducing genes and/or decreased expression of apoptosis-suppressing genes. Modulation of expression of apoptosis-regulating genes should thus also be useful for improvement of anti-cancer therapy.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*physiology', 'Genes, myc/genetics/physiology', 'Genes, p53/genetics/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Oncogenes/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jun;10(6):925-31.,131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have designed hammerhead ribozymes to cleave the two predominant forms of bcr-abl mRNA, b2a2 and b3a2. Synthetic bcr-abl RNA substrates were cleaved by the ribozymes in vitro, but so was a wild-type abl RNA sequence. bcr RNA was not cleaved in vitro and mutant ribozymes showed no cleavage activity. Ribozymes designed to cleave 9 nucleotides (nt) from either of the fusion points were non-specific for the bcr-abl substrate, but a ribozyme designed to cleave 3 nt upstream of the b3a2 fusion point was specific for b3a2 RNA. However, this ribozyme was less efficient than the others. The shortening of one of the ribozymes arms from 10 nt to 4 nt resulted in a ribozyme that was more specific without losing any efficiency.

There, hemopoietic cell proliferation and differentiation are regulated by a network of stromal/accessory cells and their products (ie cytokines and extracellular matrix molecules), known as the hemopoietic microenvironment. Recent in vitro studies indicate that both cell composition and functional abnormalities of the hemopoletic microenvironment are present in a proportion of patients with myeloid leukemia, both chronic (CML) and acute (AML). Cell composition abnormalities have been primarily observed in a subset of patients with AML; these abnormalities include reduced numbers of fibroblast progenitors and, in some cases, reduced numbers of macrophages and adipocytes. In terms of function, it has been shown that the marrow stromal cells from a significant number of both CML and AML patients, possess a deficient hemopoletic supportive capacity in vitro. This seems to be related to the presence of functionally abnormal, malignant macrophages. The mechanisms by which these macrophages alter the hemopoietic function of the marrow stroma, as a whole, are still not fully understood. Whereas in AML, a macrophage-derived soluble inhibitory activity (containing tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described; in CML, a direct, macrophage-mediated cell-to-cell contact mechanism for hemopoietic inhibition seems to be involved. To date, however, it is not clear whether the abnormalities in the hemopoietic microenvironment are secondary to myeloid leukemia or if they precede clinical CML/AML. Furthermore, it is not known to what extent the functional abnormalities observed in vitro contribute to the hematologic dysfunction that characterizes myeloid leukemia and to the in vivo progression of the disease.","['Mayani, H']",['Mayani H'],"['Oncological Research Unit, Oncology Hospital, Mexico, DF, Mexico.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Cytokines)'],IM,"['Adipocytes/pathology', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology/physiopathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Stromal Cells/pathology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jun;10(6):1041-7.,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two new continuous leukemia cell lines MUTZ-2 and MUTZ-3 were derived from the peripheral blood of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) FAB M2 and AML FAB M4. MUTZ-2 and MUTZ-3 cells have morphological and immunophenotypical features of myeloid and monocytic cells, respectively. While MUTZ-2 is negative, MUTZ-3 cells express the monocytic surface marker CD14, albeit weakly. The monocytic nature of MUTZ-3 cells is underlined by the expression of the monocyte-specific esterase (MSE), myeloperoxidase (MPO) and tartrateresistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) enzymes; MUTZ-2 is negative for MSE and TRAP, but expresses MPO. For sustained cell growth, both cell lines require constitutively the addition of cytokines to the culture medium and retain an absolute dependence on conditioned medium or recombinant growth factors for proliferation and survival. Incubation with single recombinant cytokines from a broad spectrum of growth factors established that the strongest proliferation response of MUTZ-2 cells was elicited by FLT-3 ligand, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage CSF (M-CSF), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and stem cell factor (SCF), whereas granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF), M-CSF, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and SCF were the most effective growth factors in inducing proliferation of MUTZ-3. Both cell lines were proliferatively responsive to several further cytokines, however, to a lesser extent. Exposure to phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or the physiological all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) had growth-inhibitory and differentiation-inducing effects on both cell lines. Using a clonogenic cell recovery assay, both cell lines were found to be sensitive to the chemotherapeutic drugs cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and daunorubicin (DNR), MUTZ-2 cells being more sensitive to both Ara-C and DNR treatment than MUTZ-3 cells. Chromosomal trisomies 8 and 10 were found in MUTZ-2 cells without any additional structural abnormalities. MUTZ-3 carries the rare, but recurrent AML-associated translocation (12;22)(p13;q11-q12) reflecting the karyotype of the original tumor. The main characteristics of these cell lines remained the same during about 1 year of continuous culture as well as after freezing and thawing. In summary, we established and characterized two new leukemia cell lines with myeloid or monocytic features which are growth factor-responsive, one of them carrying a unique chromosomal translocation. These cells will be of particular value for investigating the complex cytokine network and molecular events caused by chromosomal aberrations.","['Hu, Z B', 'Ma, W', 'Zaborski, M', 'MacLeod, R', 'Quentmeier, H', 'Drexler, H G']","['Hu ZB', 'Ma W', 'Zaborski M', 'MacLeod R', 'Quentmeier H', 'Drexler HG']","['DSMZ-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/pathology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jun;10(6):1025-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cordycepin-treated, ADA-inhibited, TdT-positive cells undergo the classic changes associated with drug-induced apoptosis: reduction in cell volume, chromatin clumping, membrane blebbing, and 180-bp multimer DNA laddering on agarose gels. In common with the apoptosis seen in normal TdT-positive thymocytes, following exposure to various agents, apoptosis induced by cordycepin in TdT-positive leukemia cells was associated with increased protein kinase A (PK-A) activity. Unlike thymocyte apoptosis however, no elevation in cAMP levels was seen preceding the rise in PK-A activity. Ex vivo we show that cordycepin monophosphate can activate PK-A as efficiently as cAMP. On this basis we speculate that cordycepin monophosphate in TdT-positive cells may be able to activate PK-A in place of cAMP, and that PK-A may phosphorylate TdT, augmenting its activity as an endonuclease. In cell-free experiments, the activity of recombinant TdT as an endonuclease digesting supercoiled plasmid DNA into linear fragments was dramatically increased following phosphorylation of TdT by PK-A.

Human B lymphocytes produce a species of a proteochondroitin sulfate (CSPG) with an approximate molecular mass of 135-150 kDa. Using a monoclonal antibody (mAb) against B cell CSPG in flow cytometry we found that this CSPG is expressed on tumor cells of patients with CD19+ common acute lymphoblastic leukemia and on the corresponding cell lines Nalm-6, Reh and KM3. The CSPG is also present on hairy cell leukemia JOK-1 cells and weakly on the myeloma line U266. Concomitant with CSPG expression, Nalm-6 cells express the integrins alpha 5/beta 1 (CD49e/CD29) and alpha 6/beta 1 (CD49f/CD29), adhesion receptors for fibronectin and laminin, in contrast to the other two cell lines tested. Expression patterns of these adhesion receptors and CSPG were paralleled by strong adhesion of Nalm-6 to fibronectin and laminin. Adhesion of Nalm-6 to fibronectin was inhibited by the alpha 5-specific antibody SAM 1 by 80% whereas the alpha 6-specific antibody GoH3 reduced binding to laminin only by 20%. A possible involvement of surface-expressed CSPG in adhesion to ECM components was investigated by 24 h incubation of Nalm-6 cells with p-nitrophenyl-beta-D-xyloside, an inhibitor of proteoglycan glycosylation. By this treatment, both adhesion of Nalm-6 to laminin and expression of CSPG were reduced by 40-50%. Furthermore, addition of chondroitin-6-sulfate, a structural element of Nalm-6 CSPG, reduced adhesion of Nalm-6 to laminin by 60%. Chondroitin-4-sulfate, heparin and heparan sulfate did not effectively inhibit the adhesion process. These observations suggest that surface-expressed CSPG may be involved in binding of Nalm-6 cells to laminin and that the specific sulfation pattern of chondroitin-6-sulfate may be essential in this regard.","['Blase, L', 'Merling, A', 'Engelmann, S', 'Moller, P', 'Schwartz-Albiez, R']","['Blase L', 'Merling A', 'Engelmann S', 'Moller P', 'Schwartz-Albiez R']","['Tumor Immunology Program, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha5)', '0 (Integrin alpha6)', '0 (Integrin alpha6beta1)', '0 (Integrin beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Membrane/immunology/metabolism', 'Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans/*metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha5', 'Integrin alpha6', 'Integrin alpha6beta1', 'Integrin beta1/metabolism', 'Integrins/metabolism', 'Laminin/*metabolism', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Laminin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism/pathology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jun;10(6):1000-11.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This inference finds experimental support in the following observations: 1) toxic levels of H2O2 are readily generated upon dissolution of survival-range concentrations of ascorbic acid in the culture medium; 2) the lethal effects elicited by ascorbic acid or reagent H2O2 are prevented by the addition of either catalase or the intracellular iron chelator o-phenanthroline and are characterized by similar temporal dependence; 3) U937 cells resistant to hydrogen peroxide are cross-resistant to ascorbic acid; 4) under the conditions utilized in this study, H2O2 and ascorbate promote similar modes of cell death (i.e., necrosis); and 5) cell killing provoked by H2O2 or ascorbate is an inverse function of cell density and is suppressed by coculturing U937 target cells with human erythrocytes (at a density far below that present in the blood) and human fibroblasts. Cytoprotection was not observed using catalase-depleted erythrocytes. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that H2O2 is entirely responsible for the ascorbate-induced U937 cell killing.

These receptors often share common signal transducing receptor components in the same family, which explains the functional redundancy of cytokines. One typical example is a group of receptor systems for interleukin-6 (IL-6) and related cytokines that share gp130 as a signal transducer. This subset of cytokines, i.e., IL-6, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and cardiotrophin-1, are all pleiotropic, exhibiting overlapping biological activities, and are known to function also in the neuronal system. In their receptor complexes, gp130 and ligand-specific chains possess no intrinsic tyrosine kinase domain but are associated with members of the Jak family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases. The Jak kinases become activated after ligand-induced homo- or heterodimerization of gp130. This activation appears to link the cell surface receptors to the nuclear genes through a series of biochemical changes, including tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of a latent cytoplasmic transcription factor called signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3).","['Taga, T']",['Taga T'],"['Institute for Molecular and Celular Biology, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Neurochem,Journal of neurochemistry,2985190R,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/chemistry/*physiology', 'Blood Cells/chemistry/cytology', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/chemistry/*physiology', 'Neurons/chemistry/cytology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurochem. 1996 Jul;67(1):1-10. doi: 10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.67010001.x.,90,['10.1046/j.1471-4159.1996.67010001.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo and ex vivo experiments identified macrophages as a major source of the induced HIV-1 transcripts. In contrast, T. gondii infection failed to stimulate HIV-1 transcription in tissues of two HIV-1 transgenic mouse strains harboring a HIV-1 proviral DNA in which the nuclear factor (NF) kappa B binding motifs from the viral long terminal repeats had been replaced with a duplicated Moloney murine leukemia virus core enhancer. A role for NF-kappaB in the activation of the HIV-1 by T. gondii was also suggested by the simultaneous induction of NF-kappaB binding activity and tumor necrosis factor alpha synthesis in transgenic mouse macrophages stimulated by exposure to parasite extracts.

Unstimulated fibroblasts did not produce substantial quantities of these cytokines, while IL-1 and TGF-beta(1) stimulated these cytokines in a potent fashion. MBP at doses < or = 44 micrograms/ml did not stimulate IL-6-type cytokine production. It did, however, interact in a synergistic, dose- and time-dependent fashion with rIL-1-alpha and TGF-beta(1) to further increase IL-6-type cytokine elaboration. These MBP-induced increases in cytokine production were associated with proportionate alterations in mRNA accumulation. In contrast, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin did not regulate fibroblast cytokine production, and MBP did not augment fibroblast granulocyte-macrophage-CSF, or type I collagen production, or fibroblast proliferation in this culture system. The effects of MBP could not be attributed to cell cytotoxicity or contaminants in the MBP preparations. They were, however, at least partially charge mediated, since heparin abolished the effects of MBP on IL-1-stimulated cells, and the surrogate cationic molecule poly-L-arginine mimicked the stimulatory effects of MBP on fibroblast IL-6-type cytokine elaboration. These studies demonstrate that MBP interacts in a synergistic fashion with rIL-1-alpha or TGF-beta(1) to further augment fibroblast IL-6-type cytokine production. They also demonstrate that this stimulation is pretranslationally mediated and due, in part, to the cationic nature of the MBP molecule. MBP regulation of fibroblast cytokine production may play an important role in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic disorders of the airway or other organs.","['Rochester, C L', 'Ackerman, S J', 'Zheng, T', 'Elias, J A']","['Rochester CL', 'Ackerman SJ', 'Zheng T', 'Elias JA']","['Yale University School of Medicine, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cations)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Eosinophil Granule Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Blood Proteins/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cations', 'Cell Communication', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Drug Interactions', 'Eosinophil Granule Proteins', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/*immunology/physiology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects/immunology/physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/administration & dosage', 'Interleukin-11/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lung/cytology/*immunology/physiology', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage', '*Ribonucleases', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/administration & dosage']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jun 1;156(11):4449-56.,,,"['AI 34953/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-02687/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-36708/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of the role of TNF-alpha.,4401-7,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), a pleiotropic cytokine with many biologic effects overlapping with those of IL-6, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of sepsis. We here analyzed the kinetics of LIF in 13 baboons challenged with a lethal (n=6) or sublethal (n=7) dose of Escherichia coli. In addition, to assess the role of TNF-alpha in the induction of LIF in vivo, seven baboons were studied that had either received a bolus injection of recombinant human TNF-alpha (100 micrograms/kg, n=3), or to whom 15 mg/kg of an anti-TNF mAB before lethal E. coli challenge was administered (n=4). LIF levels increased 2 h after E coli challenge, and reached maximum values at 4 and 8 h after a sublethal (4.4 +/- 1.6 ng/ml) or lethal (40.9 +/- 3.8 ng/ml) dose, respectively. TNF-alpha injection induced a modest rise in LIF concentrations, peaking after 6 h (228 +/- 46 pg/ml). Circulating LIF correlated with plasma levels of IL-6, both after E. coli challenge (Spearman Rank coefficient of correlation (r) = 0.849, p<0.001), as well as upon TNF-alpha injection (r=0.863, p<0.001). Moreover, the E. coli-induced release of either cytokine was reduced 6- to 10-fold after pretreatment with anti-TNF mAb, except in one nonsurviving animal, which exhibited a progressive increase of LIF and IL-6 levels despite the absence of TNF immunoreactivity. These results show that TNF-alpha is an intermediate factor in concerted release of LIF and IL-6 in vivo, and indicate that the enhanced elaboration of these cytokines may predict disease outcome in severe sepsis.","['Jansen, P M', 'de Jong, I W', 'Hart, M', 'Kim, K J', 'Aarden, L A', 'Hinshaw, L B', 'Taylor, F B Jr', 'Hack, C E']","['Jansen PM', 'de Jong IW', 'Hart M', 'Kim KJ', 'Aarden LA', 'Hinshaw LB', 'Taylor FB Jr', 'Hack CE']","['Central Laboratory of the Netherlands Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service and Laboratory for Clinical and Experimental Immunology, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli Infections/immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Growth Inhibitors/blood/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/blood/*metabolism', 'Papio', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sepsis/*immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology/physiology']",1996/06/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jun 1;156(11):4401-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IEL with a TCR-alpha(beta) that are CD8 single positive are absent from beta(2)-microglobulin (beta(2)m)-deficient mice, consistent with the idea that these IEL, like other TCR-alpha(beta)+, CD8+ T cells, require class I molecules for positive selection. In contrast, here we show that substantial numbers of TCR-alpha(beta)+, CD8 single positive IEL are present in mice deficient for the transporter associated with Ag processing 1 (TAP 1) gene, although T cells with this phenotype are absent from thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes of these same mice. The majority of TCR-alpha(beta)+, CD8 single positive IEL in TAP-deficient mice expresses CD8 molecules composed of alpha(alpha) homodimers and they express a diverse set of V(beta) gene segments. In addition, the number of TCR-alpha(beta)+, CD4/CD8 double positive IEL is decreased in beta(2)m-deficient mice but not in TAP-deficient mice. The dependence of the two TCR-alpha(beta)+ IEL populations that express CD8alpha(alpha) homodimers on beta(2)m as opposed to TAP molecules is striking. It suggests that TAP-independent but beta(2)m-requiring nonclassical class I molecules expressed by cells in the intestine, such as the thymus leukemia Ag and CD1, could play a pivotal role in the development and/or the accumulation of major subpopulations of TCR-alpha(beta)+ IEL.","['Sydora, B C', 'Brossay, L', 'Hagenbaugh, A', 'Kronenberg, M', 'Cheroutre, H']","['Sydora BC', 'Brossay L', 'Hagenbaugh A', 'Kronenberg M', 'Cheroutre H']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology and the Molecular Biology Institute, University of California at Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (TAP1 protein, human)', '0 (Tap1 protein, mouse)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 2', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8 Antigens/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Epithelium/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/metabolism', 'Intestines/cytology/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/deficiency/genetics']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jun 1;156(11):4209-16.,,,"['GM 07185/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 DK46763/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 52511/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: 20 relapses were evaluated, with special attention to changes in the criteria used for the definition of a phenotype as ""aberrant"". In all cases the same monoclonal antibody and fluorochrome were used at diagnosis and in relapse. RESULTS: Six out of the 16 patients showed aberrant phenotypes at diagnosis. At relapse, no changes in the aberrant phenotypes were detected in most of the patients; nevertheless, in two of the four patients with asynchronous antigen expression this aberration disappeared at relapse. At diagnosis in both cases there were already small blast cell subpopulations showing the phenotype of leukaemic cells at relapse. Ten out of the 16 cases analysed showed significant changes in the expression of at least one of the markers analysed. CONCLUSIONS: At relapse in AML the ""leukaemic phenotypes"" usually remained unaltered, while other phenotypic features--not relevant for distinguishing leukaemic blast cells among normal progenitors--changed frequently; however, they were not a major limitation in the immunological detection of minimal residual disease.","['Macedo, A', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Vidriales, M B', 'Lopez-Berges, M C', 'Garcia-Marcos, M A', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Landolfi, C', 'Orfao, A']","['Macedo A', 'San Miguel JF', 'Vidriales MB', 'Lopez-Berges MC', 'Garcia-Marcos MA', 'Gonzalez M', 'Landolfi C', 'Orfao A']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Salamanca, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/blood', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual/diagnosis/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Recurrence']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1996 Jan;49(1):15-8. doi: 10.1136/jcp.49.1.15.,,['10.1136/jcp.49.1.15 [doi]'],,,,PMC1023150,,,,,,,,,,,

We have shown in mice and humans that bone marrow (BM)-derived memory cells, capable of producing antibodies to the HBV envelope and nucleocapsid antigens, are transferable from BM donors (BMD) to their recipients. BMD BALB/c mice were immunized with recombinant HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), and BM from anti-HBs-positive donors was transplanted to irradiated recipient mice, who seroconverted to anti-HBs within 30 days of bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and responded to booster vaccination. In a similar manner, 19/26 human BM recipients, who received their HLA-matched BM from BMDs immunized once with HBsAg, seroconverted within several weeks after BMT. Antibodies to HBsAg were also observed in 3 recipients of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) obtained from HLA-matched immunized human donors. Finally, clearance of HBsAg and HBV DNA was observed in an HBsAg carrier with leukemia who received BMT from his HLA-matched anti-HBc+/anti-HBs+ brother.

METHODS: The cancer mortality in migrants from North Africa (Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia and Egypt) resident in France relative to that of the local-born population, is estimated from mortality data for the period 1979-1985, and population data from the 1982 French census. Risks of death from different cancers were adjusted for important confounding factors such as social status and area of residence. RESULTS: The risks are quite similar for Algerian, Tunisian and Moroccan migrants. Compared to the local-born, those Maghrebian migrants of one or both sexes have higher risks of death from cancer of the nasopharynx, gallbladder and bladder (in Algerians only). Conversely, Maghrebian migrants have lower risks of death from cancer of the oral cavity, other pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, lung, larynx, melanoma (in Algerians only), kidney and nervous system (except in Tunisians), breast, ovary, and cervix uteri (except in Moroccans). For Egyptian migrants, because of small numbers, few of the estimates are statistically significant. They are at lower risk of death from lung cancer and at higher risk for lymphoma and leukaemia. CONCLUSION: The findings provide confirmatory evidence of the unusual cancer patterns among North African populations, who have low risks for most cancer sites, and high risks for certain cancers, such as of the nasopharynx and bladder.","['Bouchardy, C', 'Parkin, D M', 'Wanner, P', 'Khlat, M']","['Bouchardy C', 'Parkin DM', 'Wanner P', 'Khlat M']","['Geneva Cancer Registry, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Epidemiol,International journal of epidemiology,7802871,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Africa, Northern/ethnology', 'Aged', 'Alcohol Drinking/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Emigration and Immigration/*statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'France/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Smoking/adverse effects', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/epidemiology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Epidemiol. 1996 Feb;25(1):5-13. doi: 10.1093/ije/25.1.5.,,['10.1093/ije/25.1.5 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The finding that Thy-1 from detergent-solubilized RBL-2H3 cells forms complexes with src-related protein-tyrosine kinase p56/p53lyn suggested that this kinase may play a key role in Thy-1-mediated mast-cell activation. The molecular mechanism of this activation is, however, unknown. Here we show that in RBL-2H3-derived cells extracted by the standard procedure with several non-ionic detergents, the majority of Thy-1 and p56/p53lyn were not released into postnuclear supernatant but remained associated with the detergent-resistant cytoskeletal/nuclear fraction. Pretreatment of the cells with the cholesterol-complexing agents, saponin or digitonin, resulted in complete solubilization of Thy-1 and p56/p53lyn in non-ionic detergents and dissociation of the complexes; this implies that cholesterol plays a crucial role in stabilization of the complexes. This conclusion was supported by double immunofluorescence colocalization experiments which also allowed us to estimate the size of the insoluble complexes to be about 0.1 micron. Sequential treatment with saponin and Nonidet P-40 was used to fractionate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins during Thy-1-mediated activation of RBL-2H3 cells. Among the soluble cytoplasmic proteins the most dramatic change in tyrosine phosphorylation was found in pp72, whereas pp40 and pp33 were found mainly in the membrane fraction. Our data suggest that surface aggregation of GPI-anchored Thy-1 molecules leads to aggregation of p56/p53lyn kinase located in the same membrane microdomain, followed by transphosphorylation of both soluble and membrane-bound substrates.","['Draberova, L', 'Amoui, M', 'Draber, P']","['Draberova L', 'Amoui M', 'Draber P']","['Institute of Molecular Genetics, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Praha, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,"['0 (Detergents)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cholesterol/physiology', 'Detergents', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Rats', 'Thy-1 Antigens/*immunology', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1996 Jan;87(1):141-8.,,,,,,PMC1383980,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of gag RNA sequences downstream of the 3' end of the psi domain decreases the level of spontaneous dimerization. Here, we report the effects of RNA length on dimerization in vitro, studied with RNA fragments from Moloney murine leukaemia virus that contain the psi domain and all or part of the gag sequence. Extension of the RNA leads to progressive inhibition of the in vitro dimerization process. Sequences located downstream of the 3' end of the psi domain seem to stabilize the monomeric structures. This stabilization participates in dimerization of the RNA sequences involved in the recognition of two RNA molecules. We studied the ability of nucleocapsid protein 10 to promote dimerization of such long RNA fragments, and found that the protein greatly enhances their dimerization in vitro. We propose that nucleocapsid protein 10 stimulates the overall dimerization process by reduction of the energy barrier that must be overcome to allow dimer formation. Our results show that dimerization of RNA form Moloney murine leukaemia virus in vitro is enhanced by nucleocapsid protein 10.

One of these proteases, granzyme B, has an unusual substrate site preference for Asp residues, a property that it shares with members of the emerging interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme (ICE)/CED-3 family of proteases. Here we show that granzyme B is sufficient to reproduce rapidly all of the key features of apoptosis, including the degradation of several protein substrates, when introduced into Jurkat cell-free extracts. Granzyme B-induced apoptosis was neutralized by a tetrapeptide inhibitor of the ICE/CED-3 family protease, CPP32, whereas a similar inhibitor of ICE had no effect. Granzyme B was found to convert CPP32, but not ICE, to its active form by cleaving between the large and small subunits of the CPP32 proenzyme, resulting in removal of the prodomain via an autocatalytic step. The cowpox virus protein CrmA, a known inhibitor of ICE family proteases as well as granzyme B, inhibited granzyme B-mediated CPP32 processing and apoptosis.

Substantial evidence documents that retrovirus particles were clearly demonstrable in various tissues and cells in both health and disease and were abundant in the placenta and that their occurrence could be implicated in some of the reproductive diseases. The characteristics of HERVs are summarized, mechanisms of replication and regulation are outlined, and the consistent hormonal responsiveness of HERVs is noted. Clear evidence implicating HERV gene products as participants in glomerulonephritis in some cases of systemic lupus erythematosus is adduced. Data implicating HERVs as etiologic factors in reproductive diseases, in some of the autoimmune diseases, in some forms of rheumatoid arthritis and connective tissue disease, in psoriasis, and in some of the inflammatory neurologic diseases are reviewed.

In both cases, the nature of the target cells and mechanisms of transformation induced by MAV remain to be established.

METHOD: A nested case-control design with all possible controls in a cohort of nuclear workers, and a Mantel-Haenszel test (requiring only one degree of freedom) to discover whether there was any level of exposure age where the null hypothesis of no effects of radiation was rejected. This analysis was followed by inspection of how different types of cancers were related to the cancer risk. RESULTS: For radiation received at least 15 years before a cancer death (to allow for cancer latency) evidence of a dose related risk was found which was largely the result of exposures during the last 10 years of working life (between 55 and 65 years of age). The relative frequency of site specific cancers showed no signs of being different for radiogenic and idiopathic cancers, and there was no evidence of the exceptionally strong association between radiation and leukaemia found in atomic bomb data and other high dose situations.

Both these factors stimulate myoblast proliferation, and whereas LIF is neurotrophic for sensory neurons, and for the motor neurons which innervate muscle, IL-6 has only been reported to act on a population of septal neurons in the brain. We have looked at the effect of peripheral nerve trauma on the expression of these factors. We show here that whereas LIF and IL-6 mRNAs are expressed in low levels in normal sciatic nerve and skeletal muscle, there is significant up-regulation in the nerve segments after injury, with proximally and distally. There is also an increase in LIF and IL-6 expression in the denervated muscle located largely in the muscle cells. In addition, while there is retrograde axonal transport of LIF by the sciatic nerve, IL-6 is not retrogradely transported, and as a result, IL-6 does not stimulate the survival of sensory neurons in vitro. Both growth factors are produced by Schwann cells. These results show a rapid response in the expression of these genes after injury and suggest that LIF and IL-6 act as trauma factors but with different roles in injured peripheral nerve.","['Kurek, J B', 'Austin, L', 'Cheema, S S', 'Bartlett, P F', 'Murphy, M']","['Kurek JB', 'Austin L', 'Cheema SS', 'Bartlett PF', 'Murphy M']","[""Melbourne Neuromuscular Research Centre, St. Vincent's Hospital, Victoria, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Neuromuscul Disord,Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,9111470,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Denervation', 'Ganglia, Spinal/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Muscles/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sciatic Nerve/injuries/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neuromuscul Disord. 1996 Mar;6(2):105-14. doi: 10.1016/0960-8966(95)00029-1.,,"['0960896695000291 [pii]', '10.1016/0960-8966(95)00029-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A highly significantly relationship was found between levels of soluble LIF produced by the clones and their in vivo tumorigenicity. Such results suggested a role for LIF as a tumour facilitating agent. To test this hypothesis, the highly tumorigenic and LIF producing PROb clone was transfected with the LIF cDNA in antisense orientation in order to decrease LIF production. Conversely, REGb, a low LIF producer that is rejected by syngeneic animals, as well as nude mice, was transfected with the LIF cDNA to increase its production. PROb cells transfected with antisense cDNA were shown to have decreased LIF production along with decreased tumorigenicity. LIF-transfected REGb cells expressing high LIF levels still regressed in syngeneic rats, but could form progressive tumours in nude mice. We did not detect LIF receptors on PROb or REGb cells and their in vitro proliferation was not modified by the addition of exogenous LIF. Therefore, LIF was not an autocrine growth regulator for PROb and REGb cells. Instead, LIF appears to facilitate in vivo tumour growth, without being an immunosuppressive factor sufficient on its own to allow growth of immunogenic cells in fully immunocompetent hosts.","['Burg, C', 'Patry, Y', 'Le Pendu, J', 'Moreau, M', 'Tesson, L', 'Godard, A', 'Soulillou, J P', 'Meflah, K', 'Anegon, I']","['Burg C', 'Patry Y', 'Le Pendu J', 'Moreau M', 'Tesson L', 'Godard A', 'Soulillou JP', 'Meflah K', 'Anegon I']","['Institut de Biologie, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Animals', 'Clone Cells', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Globins/genetics', 'Graft Rejection', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Introns', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transfection', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 1995 Nov;7(8):784-92. doi: 10.1006/cyto.1995.0094.,,"['S1043-4666(85)70094-4 [pii]', '10.1006/cyto.1995.0094 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine retroviral shuttle vectors, which express the anti-Rev SFv moiety, have now been constructed. HIV-1 infection was dramatically inhibited in human T-lymphocytic cell-lines, CEM and Sup-T1, transduced with these anti-Rev SFv-expressing vectors. This resistance to high levels of HIV-1 expression was demonstrated in both mixed populations and clones of these cells. Of further potential clinical significance, HIV-1 infection was also potently inhibited in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), transduced with retroviral vectors expressing the anti-Rev SFv molecule.

U-50488H also provoked reduction of ODC mRNA level and increase of ODC turnover, as well as inhibition of cell growth. U-69593, another kappa-selective agonist, was only slightly effective. The action of U-50488H on ODC induction was not blocked by naloxone, beta-chlornaltrexamine or by the kappa-selective opioid antagonists Mr1452 and nor-binaltorphimine (nBNI). Actually Mr1452 and nBNI exerted some inhibitory effect. Furthermore, the separated enantiomers (+) and (-) of U-50488H were similarly effective. The (-)cis-(1S,2R)-U50488 stereoisomer, exhibiting low affinity for kappa and high affinity for sigma receptors and carbetapentane, another sigma ligand, also inhibited ODC induction, although less effectively than U-50488H. None of several other opioid ligands tested had significant effects on ODC induction. In conclusion, the inhibition of ODC expression by U-50488H does not involve classical, enantiospecific opioid receptors; rather, these results suggest the involvement of a distinct site of action linked to inhibition of lymphoid cell proliferation.","['Flamigni, F', 'Stefanelli, C', 'Stanic, I', 'Muscari, C', 'Giaccari, A', 'Rossoni, C']","['Flamigni F', 'Stefanelli C', 'Stanic I', 'Muscari C', 'Giaccari A', 'Rossoni C']","['Dipartimento di Biochimica G.

The sensitivity of HL60 cells to physiological differentiating agents, but not to DMSO, is enhanced when cells are exposed to 'anti-inflammatory agents' (e.g. indomethacin) or are 'primed' (pretreated) with a small amount of ATRA: alone, neither treatment induces differentiation. We earlier suggested that indomethacin might act by inhibiting the endogenous formation of a differentiation-suppressing prostanoid (Bunce, C.M., et al. (1994) Leukemia 8, 595-604). Studies of the formation of prostanoids by HL60 cells and of the effects of prostanoids on these cells failed to identify any prostanoid that could be implicated in sensitization by indomethacin. 3 alpha-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 alpha-HSD) is another target of such 'anti-inflammatory agents'. Steroid inhibitors of 3 alpha-HSD sensitized HL60 cells to inducers of differentiation in a manner similar to indomethacin. 3 alpha-HSD is a member of the aldoketoreductase enzyme family, which comprises many enzymes of similar size and primary sequence. A protein that was recognised by an antiserum to 3 alpha-HSD was found in HL60 cells, but the cells showed no detectable 3 alpha-HSD activity. The 3 alpha-HSD-like protein was strikingly down-regulated by 'priming' doses of ATRA. When treatment with a differentiation-sensitizing 'anti-inflammatory agent' or steroid was combined with ATRA ""priming', the effects of the different treatments were not additive: the resulting increase in sensitivity equalled that achievable by either treatment alone. We conclude that interference with a single intracellular regulatory mechanism underlies the increases in sensitivity of cells to differentiating agents that are caused by anti-inflammatory agents, by certain steroids and by 'priming' with ATRA. Decreased activity of a yet-to-be-identified member of the aldoketoreductase family of dehydrogenases is likely to be a central feature of a previously unrecognised mechanism that controls the responsiveness of cells to environmental stimuli such as retinoids and D3.","['Bunce, C M', 'Mountford, J C', 'French, P J', 'Mole, D J', 'Durham, J', 'Michell, R H', 'Brown, G']","['Bunce CM', 'Mountford JC', 'French PJ', 'Mole DJ', 'Durham J', 'Michell RH', 'Brown G']","['Department of Immunology, University of Birmingham, Edgbaston, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal)', '0 (Prostaglandins)', '08J2K08A3Y (Dihydrotestosterone)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '298-83-9 (Nitroblue Tetrazolium)', '4TI98Z838E (Estradiol)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 1.1.- (3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'HSU1C9YRES (Medroxyprogesterone)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases/*metabolism', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal/*pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acid/metabolism', 'Aspirin/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cholecalciferol/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Dihydrotestosterone/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Estradiol/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Medroxyprogesterone/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/drug effects/enzymology', 'Nitroblue Tetrazolium/metabolism', 'Prostaglandins/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",1996/05/28 00:00,1996/05/28 00:01,['1996/05/28 00:00'],"['1996/05/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/28 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996 May 28;1311(3):189-98. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(96)00005-5.,,"['0167-4889(96)00005-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(96)00005-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 19995-20000). However, most cells exhibit these enzymatic activities and nevertheless synthesize low to undectectable amounts of 22:6(n-3). Moreover, there are few data on the occurrence of this pathway in human cells. In the present work, we have analysed the biosynthetic pathway of 22:6(n-3) in human Y-79 retinoblastoma and Jurkat T-cells. Y-79 cells were supplemented with 18:3(n-3) and 20:5(n-3) or incubated with [1-14C]18:3(n-3) and [1-14C]20:5(n-3) and lipids analysed by argentation TLC, reverse-phase TLC and GLC-mass spectrometry. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that synthesis of 22:6(n-3) from 20:5(n-3) in Y-79 cells occurred through two successive elongations, followed by a delta 6-desaturation of 24:5(n-3) to 24:6(n-3) and retroconversion to 22:6(n-3). Incubation of Y-79 cells with [1-14C]18:3(n-3) in medium containing 50 microM trans-9,12-18:2, a potent inhibitor of delta 6-desaturase, caused a reduction of 22:6(n-3) synthesis mainly by interfering with the desaturation of 18:3(n-3). However, when [1-14C]20:5(n-3) was used as precursor, synthesis of 22:6(n-3) was depressed to a lesser extent and mainly by reduction of 24:6(n-3) retroconversion. Neuronal differentiation of Y-79 cells caused a great increase in delta 6-desaturase activity on 18:3(n-3), though the amount of 22:6(n-3) synthesized did not change or diminish, suggesting the existence of a particular delta 6-desaturase involved in the synthesis of 22:6(n-3). The existence of a distinctive delta 6-desaturase activity could also explain why Jurkat cells growing in serum-free medium showed a near 3-fold increase in the synthesis of pentaenes from 18:3(n-3) and, at the same time, a large decrease in the synthesis of 22:6(n-3). The verification of the involvement of two delta 6-desaturase activities in 22:6(n-3) synthesis would have important implications for the formulation of the nutritional requirements of this fatty acid during development.","['Marzo, I', 'Alava, M A', 'Pineiro, A', 'Naval, J']","['Marzo I', 'Alava MA', 'Pineiro A', 'Naval J']","['Departmento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '25167-62-8 (Docosahexaenoic Acids)', '63X7MBT2LQ (Bucladesine)', 'EC 1.14.19.- (Fatty Acid Desaturases)', 'EC 1.14.19.3 (Linoleoyl-CoA Desaturase)']",IM,"['Bucladesine/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Docosahexaenoic Acids/*metabolism', 'Eye Neoplasms/metabolism', 'Fatty Acid Desaturases/*metabolism', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Linoleoyl-CoA Desaturase', 'Retinoblastoma/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/11 00:00,1996/06/11 00:01,['1996/06/11 00:00'],"['1996/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996 Jun 11;1301(3):263-72. doi: 10.1016/0005-2760(96)00051-3.,,"['0005-2760(96)00051-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2760(96)00051-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cloned cDNA consisted of 2274 base pairs with an open reading frame that encodes a putative polypeptide of 512 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 58,112 daltons and 12 putative transmembrane domains. The polypeptide appears to carry a net positive charge (pI = 8.6) which may be important for its interaction with the negatively charged substrate. Functional identity of the IFC1(RFC1) clone was established by expression in Xenopus oocytes. An 11-fold increase in 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) uptake was observed in oocytes injected with 10 ng IFC1(RFC1) cRNA compared to water-injected controls. The expressed folate uptake in the cRNA injected oocyte was (1) 4,4'-diisothiocyanatosilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS)-sensitive; and (2) saturable with an apparent Km of 1.99 +/- 0.32 micrometers and a V(max) of 3782 +/- 188 fmol/oocyte per h. The distribution of mRNA species complementary to IFC1(RFC1) in different mouse tissues was examined by Northern blot analysis. In addition to the small intestine, expression of such mRNA species were also found in the kidney, large intestine, brain, heart and liver. Furthermore, mRNA species complementary to IFC1(RFC1) were also detected by Northern blot analysis in the small intestine of human and other animal species (rat and rabbit). Expression of mRNA complementary to IFC1(RFC1) was markedly higher in rat intestinal villus cells than in crypt cells. These results represent the first identification of a folate transporter in mammalian intestine.","['Said, H M', 'Nguyen, T T', 'Dyer, D L', 'Cowan, K H', 'Rubin, S A']","['Said HM', 'Nguyen TT', 'Dyer DL', 'Cowan KH', 'Rubin SA']","['VA Medical Center - 151, Long Beach, California 90822, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Complementary/*analysis', 'Female', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression', 'Humans', '*Intestinal Absorption', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oocytes/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Rats', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Xenopus laevis']",1996/06/11 00:00,1996/06/11 00:01,['1996/06/11 00:00'],"['1996/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996 Jun 11;1281(2):164-72. doi: 10.1016/0005-2736(96)00005-3.,,"['0005-2736(96)00005-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0005-2736(96)00005-3 [doi]']","['DK47203/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'IF32 DK09040/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['GENBANK/L36539'],,,,,,,,,,

This effect was abolished by the PKC inhibitors H-7 and bisindolylmaleimide I while pertussis toxin failed to block stimulation. The phosphotransferase activity was also increased by acetylated LDL (acLDL) and maleylated albumin (malBSA), the oxLDL effect was inhibited by chloroquine which also blocked oxLDL-induced stimulation of tyrosine kinase activity. Marginal stimulation of PKC activity was observed when lipid extracts from oxLDL were used, indicating that uptake via scavenger receptors (SR) is mandatory. Polyinosinic acid (poly I) exhibited a concentration-dependent inhibition of the oxLDL-induced effect suggesting that SR II/I but not CD36 interactions are critical to PKC activation. Modified (lipo)proteins increased the concentration of diacylglycerol and differentially affected the levels of individual PKC isoenzymes predominantly in the cytosolic fraction. Changes of activity induced by oxLDL could be primarily assigned to alterations of the activities and levels of the isoenzymes beta and delta. Treatment with oxLDL, acLDL, and malBSA was also accompanied by increased production of prostaglandins as well as by an enhanced level of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX 2) as determined by Western blot analysis. Effects (correction) of oxLDL on PKC activity/expression was suppressed by the cyclooxygenase, 2,2-dimethyl-6-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-phenyl-2,2-dihydro-1H-pyrrolizine-5- ylacetic acid (ML 3000), and by treatment with the specific COX 2-inhibitor N-(2-cyclohexyloxy-4-nitrophenyl) methane-sulfonamide (NS-398). These results indicate that oxLDL, acLDL, and malBSA exhibit a COX 2-dependent and isotype specific effect on PKC in P388D1 cells following uptake via SR II/I and subsequent lysosomal degradation.","['Claus, R', 'Fyrnys, B', 'Deigner, H P', 'Wolf, G']","['Claus R', 'Fyrnys B', 'Deigner HP', 'Wolf G']","['Pharmazeutisch-Chemisches Institut, Universitat Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*enzymology', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/biosynthesis/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/16 00:00,1996/04/16 00:01,['1996/04/16 00:00'],"['1996/04/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/16 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1996 Apr 16;35(15):4911-22. doi: 10.1021/bi952036n.,,"['10.1021/bi952036n [doi]', 'bi952036n [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The prognostic role of Pgp expression in breast cancer is still unclear. We investigated the expression of Pgp in primary and metastatic breast cancer tissues in relation to patient characteristics and treatment outcome. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Pgp expression was evaluated in 92 primary and 12 metastatic breast cancers by the use of immunohisto/cytochemistry with three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (JSB-1, C219, MRK16), and an RNAse protection assay. Follow-up information was available for 77 primary breast cancer patients (median follow-up 42 months; range 2-63 months). RESULTS: Concordance among the anti-Pgp MAbs varied, the highest being between JSB-1 and MRK16 (71%; p=0.002). Pgp expression was more frequent in metastatic disease (58%) than in primary breast cancer (29%) (JSB-1; p=0.055). Pgp expression as assessed with JSB-1 (univariate analysis; p<0.05) was associated with shorter overall survival (OS). Nineteen (21%) primary breast cancers had Pgp expression in fibroblasts in desmoplastic stroma and this did not correlate with Pgp expression in the tumor. The combination of Pgp-positive tumor cells and Pgp-expressing fibroblasts was the strongest prognostic factor for OS by multivariate analysis. Subgroup analysis suggested that Pgp expression was associated with a shorter OS in tamoxifen-treated patients, but not in those who received chemotherapy (most often CMF). CONCLUSIONS: Pgp expression in tumor cells, and especially when accompanied by Pgp expression in fibroblasts in desmoplastic stroma, has prognostic value in primary breast cancer patients and is likely to be a marker of a more malignant phenotype. Pgp expression of tumor cells might play a role in tamoxifen resistance. These findings may have important implications for teh treatment of breast cancer patients, and warrant further prospective investigation in a larger patient population.","['Linn, S C', 'Giaccone, G', 'van Diest, P J', 'Blokhuis, W M', 'van der Valk, P', 'van Kalken, C K', 'Kuiper, C M', 'Pinedo, H M', 'Baak, J P']","['Linn SC', 'Giaccone G', 'van Diest PJ', 'Blokhuis WM', 'van der Valk P', 'van Kalken CK', 'Kuiper CM', 'Pinedo HM', 'Baak JP']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Breast/metabolism', 'Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Survival Rate']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 1995 Sep;6(7):679-85. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059284.,,"['10.1093/oxfordjournals.annonc.a059284 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)61307-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All children with ALL and ANLL diagnosed in The Netherlands in the period 1973-1979, registered by the Dutch Childhood Leukaemia Study Group and followed until 1991 were included. Bone marrow and blood smears had been uniformly classified in a central laboratory; cases with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) were subdivided into standard risk (SR) and high risk (HR). PEL, assessed as a risk indicator in a separately conducted population-based case-control study of the same children (response rate: 88%), was divided into low, when neither of the parents had more than elementary school or lower vocational education, and high when either had more. Children with SR ALL of high PEL parents had a slightly higher 10-year survival rate than of low PEL parents (58% versus 54%, P = 0.25), whereas survival for the latter increased more (P = 0.06) from a lower level in the period 1973-1975. However, children of low PEL parents with HR ALL and ANLL had a higher 10-year survival rate compared with children of high PEL parents (P = 0.10 and 0.22, respectively). Children without information on PEL, non-responders, migrants and with missing values exhibited slightly worse survival rates. The influence of PEL on survival of acute leukaemia in children in The Netherlands during 1973-1979 appeared small or even equivocal. Small differences in SES and optimal geographic and financial access to care, delivered through national treatment protocols, may be responsible for these results.","['Coebergh, J W', 'van der Does-van den Berg, A', 'Hop, W C', 'van Weerden, F', 'Rammeloo, J A', 'van Steensel, H A', 'van Wering, E R', 'Kamps, W A']","['Coebergh JW', 'van der Does-van den Berg A', 'Hop WC', 'van Weerden F', 'Rammeloo JA', 'van Steensel HA', 'van Wering ER', 'Kamps WA']","['Dutch Childhood Leukaemia Study Group, Hauge, Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",9005373,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Educational Status', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*mortality', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', '*Parents', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality', 'Survival Rate']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer. 1996 Feb;32A(2):286-9. doi: 10.1016/0959-8049(95)00577-3.,,"['0959-8049(95)00577-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0959-8049(95)00577-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compounds were subjected to a preliminary biological screening, to assess their inhibitory activity against bovine liver dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and in vitro antitumor activity against human leukemia CCRF-CEM cells.

In the antitumor assay, lower homologues (C10-C14) displayed an interesting activity profile, suggesting the desirability of additional studies with these and similar compounds.","['Pignatello, R', 'Sorrenti, V', 'Spampinato, G', 'Pecora, T', 'Panico, A', 'Di Giacomo, C', 'Fresta, M', 'Vanella, A', 'Puglisi, G']","['Pignatello R', 'Sorrenti V', 'Spampinato G', 'Pecora T', 'Panico A', 'Di Giacomo C', 'Fresta M', 'Vanella A', 'Puglisi G']","['Cattedra di Tecnologia, Socioeconomia e Legislazione Farmaceutiche, Citta Universitaria, Catania, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Prodrugs)', ""0 (methotrexate-N,N'-bis(dodecylamide))"", ""136181-93-6 (methotrexate-N,N'-bis(decylamide))"", 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cattle', 'Drug Stability', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lipid Metabolism', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Prodrugs/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1996 Apr;11(3):253-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In U937 cells, both PI 3-kinase inhibitors (wortmannin and LY294002) and etoposide activated the CPP32 apoptotic protease by cleavage to active p17 subunits. In contrast, treatment with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) resulted in the accumulation of a distinct active CPP32 subunit, p20. Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-xL blocked DNA fragmentation, CPP32 activation and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase in U937 cells treated with both PI 3-kinase inhibitors and etoposide, but not in cells treated with TNFalpha. Distinct patterns of CPP32 activation and differential sensitivities to Bcl-xL thus distinguish the cell death pathways activated by PI 3-kinase inhibition and DNA damage from that activated by TNFalpha.","['Erhardt, P', 'Cooper, G M']","['Erhardt P', 'Cooper GM']","['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Pathology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Caspase 1', 'Caspase 3', '*Caspases', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'Wortmannin', 'bcl-X Protein']",1996/07/26 00:00,1996/07/26 00:01,['1996/07/26 00:00'],"['1996/07/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/26 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/26 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jul 26;271(30):17601-4. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.30.17601.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.30.17601 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)86953-3 [pii]']",['CA18689/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Repetitive calcium spikes are initiated by phospholipase C-mediated production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) and are thought to be generated by a positive feedback mechanism in which calcium potentiates its own release, a negative feedback mechanism by which calcium release is terminated, and a slow recovery process that defines the time interval between calcium spikes. The molecular mechanisms that terminate each calcium spike and define the spike frequency are not yet known. Here we show, in intact rat basophilic leukemia cells, that calcium responses induced by InsP3 are diminished for a period of 30-60 s following an InsP3-induced calcium spike. The sensitivity of calcium release for InsP3 was probed by UV laser-mediated photorelease of InsP3, and calcium responses were monitored by fluorescence calcium imaging. A maximal loss in sensitivity (desensitization) was observed for InsP3 increases that resulted in a near maximal calcium spike and was expressed as an 80-100% reduction in the calcium response to an equal amount of InsP3, released 10 s after the first UV pulse. When the amount of released InsP3 in the second pulse was increased 2-3-fold, desensitization was overcome and a second calcium response of equal amplitude to the first was produced. A power dependence of 3.2 was measured between the amount of released InsP3 and the amplitude of the triggered calcium response, explaining how a small decrease in InsP3 sensitivity can lead to a nearly complete reduction in the calcium response. Desensitization was abolished by the addition of the calcium buffers BAPTA and EGTA and could be induced by microinjection of calcium, suggesting that it is a calcium-dependent process. Half-maximal desensitization was observed at a free calcium concentration of 290 nM and increased with a power of 3.7 with peak calcium concentration. These studies suggest that reversible desensitization of InsP3-induced calcium release serves as a ""saw-tooth"" parameter that controls the termination of each spike and the frequency of calcium spikes.","['Oancea, E', 'Meyer, T']","['Oancea E', 'Meyer T']","['Department of Cell Biology, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['526U7A2651 (Egtazic Acid)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', ""K22DDW77C0 (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid)"", 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Egtazic Acid/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Homeostasis', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Models, Biological', 'Oscillometry', 'Rats', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",1996/07/19 00:00,1996/07/19 00:01,['1996/07/19 00:00'],"['1996/07/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jul 19;271(29):17253-60. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.29.17253.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.29.17253 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)31326-7 [pii]']",['GM48113/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An effect independent of the acquisition of DNA-binding activity by the heat shock transcription factor.,16111-8,"Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are induced in mammalian cells in a variety of pathophysiological states and have an important role in cytoprotection in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we report that the calcium ionophore A23187, a glucose-regulated protein (GRP) inducer, dramatically inhibits HSP70 synthesis and HSP70 mRNA transcription after induction by heat shock, sodium arsenite, or prostaglandin A1 treatment in human K562 cells. A23187 does not suppress, and it actually prolongs, the DNA-binding activity of the human heat shock transcription factor (HSF), while it alters HSF1 phosphorylation in heat shock-treated cells. To inhibit HSP70 expression, A23187 needs to be present during heat shock, while treatment before or after heat shock does not affect HSP70 mRNA transcription. The GRP inducer thapsigargin, which specifically inhibits the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, has no effect on heat-induced HSP70 synthesis, indicating that A23187 inhibitory activity is not due to depletion of intracellular calcium stores and is independent of the concomitant induction of GRP genes. Inhibition of HSP70 expression is correlated with alterations in HSF1 phosphorylation in heat-shocked cells, but not in sodium arsenite-treated cells, indicating that different mechanisms may be involved in mediating A23187 inhibitory activity.","['Elia, G', 'De Marco, A', 'Rossi, A', 'Santoro, M G']","['Elia G', 'De Marco A', 'Rossi A', 'Santoro MG']","['Institute of Experimental Medicine, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Viale K.

Our previous studies suggested that of four proteins from MEL cells that bind to this CAAT box region (CP1, GATA-1, and two factors that were denoted DSFr and DSF1) DSFr is involved in the up-regulation of transcription. In the present report, the DSFr protein in MEL cells was identified as C/EBPgamma through expression cloning and antibody studies. C/EBPgamma DNA binding activity could not be detected in K562 cells. However, K562 cells, but not MEL cells, were found to express LIP, which is a truncated form of C/EBPbeta and is an inhibitor of transcription. Thus, the differential expression of C/EBP members could account for the ability of the beta-globin CAAT box to stimulate transcription in MEL cells, but not function in K562 cells. Juxtaposing a specific C/EBP binding sequence next to the beta-globin promoter, in constructs in which the CAAT box had been rendered inactive by mutation or deletion, restored full promoter activity in MEL cells only if CP1 still bound to the promoter. In conjunction with previous mutation analyses, these results suggest that C/EBPgamma may collaborate with CP1 to enhance transcription through the beta-globin CAAT box.","['Wall, L', 'Destroismaisons, N', 'Delvoye, N', 'Guy, L G']","['Wall L', 'Destroismaisons N', 'Delvoye N', 'Guy LG']","['Institut du cancer de Montreal of the Centre de Recherche L.-C.

Monovalent hapten treatment reverses these events, resulting in receptor dephosphorylation and an abrupt arrest of cell degranulation. Thus far, it has been assumed that there is a direct linkage between receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, Syk activation and phosphorylation, and cell degranulation. However, we show here that when FcepsilonRI receptors are cross-linked for extended periods of time, hapten-mediated receptor dephosphorylation is delayed. These receptors, which remain tyrosine-phosphorylated despite the addition of hapten, are progressively targeted to a Triton X-100-insoluble fraction, suggesting their progressive association with the membrane skeleton. In contrast to FcepsilonRI receptors, hapten-induced Syk dephosphorylation and the consequent arrest of degranulation are not affected by prolonged cross-linking. Thus, some tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors persist in deactivated cells. We propose that, with time, some tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors become unaccessible to phosphatases and, in addition, unable to activate Syk. This inactive status of tyrosine-phosphorylated FcepsilonRI may be the result of membrane skeleton compartmentalization. However, another population of clustered receptors that includes the ones most recently formed is still immediately sensitive to hapten deactivation. This latter population is critical in maintaining Syk activity and cell degranulation. The shift from a transiently active state of phosphorylated receptors toward an inactive state could be a general mechanism of desensitization also utilized by other antigen receptors.","['Paolini, R', 'Serra, A', 'Kinet, J P']","['Paolini R', 'Serra A', 'Kinet JP']","['Molecular Allergy and Immunology Section, NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland 20852, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Phosphopeptides)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, rat)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'Haptens', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Phosphopeptides/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Phosphorylation', '*Phosphotyrosine', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*chemistry/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Serotonin/metabolism', 'Syk Kinase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/05 00:00,1996/07/05 00:01,['1996/07/05 00:00'],"['1996/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jul 5;271(27):15987-92. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.27.15987.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.27.15987 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)48570-5 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experiments utilizing 1,25-(OH)2D3 analogues and kinase/phosphatase inhibitors suggested that tyrosine kinase and serine/threonine phosphorylation cascades, rather than vitamin D3 receptor-mediated signals, were involved in 1,25-(OH)2D3 action. Here we show that NB4 cells express the alpha and delta (but not the beta, epsilon, and theta) isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC). Both authentic 1, 25-(OH)2D3 and the nongenomic analogue 1alpha,25-dihydroxyprevitamin D3 (HF) increased expression of PKCalpha and PKCdelta. PKCalpha and PKCdelta were translocated to the nucleus of the cell in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 or HF. The effects of HF were attenuated by the nongenomic antagonist 1beta,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, suggesting that changes in PKC expression are mediated by a nongenomic signaling pathway. Consistent with the involvement of serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation cascades mediating 1,25-(OH)2D3 action, enhanced phosphorylation of a variety of cellular proteins at serine and threonine residues and the specific enhanced phosphotyrosyl content of a 33-kDa protein (vdrp33) were observed immediately after 1,25-(OH)2D3 addition. We propose that 1,25-(OH)2D3 primes NB4 cells for 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced monocytic differentiation by increasing the expression of specific PKC isoforms and inducing the specific phosphorylation of key protein signaling intermediates.","['Berry, D M', 'Antochi, R', 'Bhatia, M', 'Meckling-Gill, K A']","['Berry DM', 'Antochi R', 'Bhatia M', 'Meckling-Gill KA']","['Department of Human Biology and Nutritional Sciences, University of Guelph, Guelph, Ontario N1G 2W1, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCA protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (PRKCD protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-alpha)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phosphoproteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Kinase C/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-alpha', 'Protein Kinase C-delta', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/05 00:00,1996/07/05 00:01,['1996/07/05 00:00'],"['1996/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jul 5;271(27):16090-6. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.27.16090.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.27.16090 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)48583-3 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found recently that 14-3-3 associates with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K) in T cells. We report here the identification of the 120-kDa 14-3-3tau-binding phosphoprotein present in activated T cell lysates as Cbl, a protooncogene product of unknown function which was found recently to be a major protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK) substrate, and to interact with several signaling molecules including PI3-K, in T lymphocytes. The association between 14-3-3tau and Cbl was detected both in vitro and in intact T cells and, in contrast to Raf-1, was markedly increased following T cell activation. The use of truncated 14-3-3tau fusion proteins demonstrated that the 15 C-terminal residues are required for the association between 14-3-3 and three of its target proteins, namely, Cbl, Raf-1, and PI3-K. The findings that 14-3-3tau binds both PI3-K and Cbl, together with recent reports of an association between Cbl and PI3-K, suggest that 14-3-3 dimers play a critical role in signal transduction processes by promoting and coordinating protein-protein interactions of signaling proteins.","['Liu, Y C', 'Elly, C', 'Yoshida, H', 'Bonnefoy-Berard, N', 'Altman, A']","['Liu YC', 'Elly C', 'Yoshida H', 'Bonnefoy-Berard N', 'Altman A']","['Division of Immunobiology, La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (14-3-3 Proteins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)']",IM,"['14-3-3 Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'DNA Primers', 'Escherichia coli', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase', '*Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases']",1996/06/14 00:00,1996/06/14 00:01,['1996/06/14 00:00'],"['1996/06/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/14 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jun 14;271(24):14591-5. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.24.14591.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.24.14591 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)46840-8 [pii]']","['CA35299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM50819/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated a possible relationship by looking for associations between these enzymes. We found that in a human erythroleukemia cell line, as well as in rabbit platelets, PI 3-kinase and PKCdelta associate in a specific manner that is modulated by cell activation. Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor treatment of cells caused increased association of PKCdelta and PI 3-kinase as did treatment of platelets with platelet-activating factor. Results using two PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY-294002, showed that the former inhibited this association, while the latter did not, suggesting that PI 3-kinase lipid products may not be a prerequisite for the PI 3-kinase/PKCdelta association.

We demonstrated that IL-9 gene expression is controlled, at least in part, by transcriptional activation. Transient expression of the luciferase reporter gene linked to serially deleted sequences of the 5'-flanking region of the IL-9 gene has revealed several positive and negative regulatory elements involved in the basal and inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells. An AP-1 site at -146 to -140 was shown to be involved in the expression of the IL-9 gene. A proximal region between -46 and -80 was identified as the minimum sequence for the basal and inducible expression of the IL-9 gene in C5MJ2 cells. Within this region, an NF-kappaB site at -59 to -50 and its adjacent 20-base pair upstream sequence were demonstrated to play a critical role for the IL-9 promoter activity. DNA-protein binding studies indicated that NF-kappaB, c-Jun, and potentially novel proteins (around 35 kDa) can bind to this important sequence. Mutations at different sites within this proximal promoter region abolished the promoter activity as well as the DNA binding.

All-trans-retinoic acid (RA) is a potent and specific inducer of CD38 in myeloid cells. In this report, we demonstrate that RA-induced CD38 protein from human myeloid (HL-60) leukemia cells coimmunoprecipitates with another protein of molecular mass approximately190 kDa (p190). The p190 protein is localized exclusively in the membranes and is a consequence of post-translational cross-linking of CD38 protein. This conclusion was based on the observations that purified CD38 effectively competes with p190, its accumulation is preceded by the accumulation of CD38, it immunoreacted with three different monospecific anti-CD38 antibodies on immunoblots, and its peptide map revealed several peptides in common with CD38. Furthermore, CD38 could serve as a suitable substrate for transglutaminase (TGase)-catalyzed cross-linking reactions in vitro, and the accumulation of p190 in RA-treated HL-60 cells is effectively blocked by the presence of TGase-specific inhibitor. The purified p190 showed at least three times more cyclase activity than CD38. Conversely, p190 was at least 2.5-fold less active than CD38 in hydrolyzing cADPR to ADPR. These results suggest that post-translational modification of CD38 may represent an important mechanism for regulating the two catalytic activities of this bifunctional enzyme.","['Umar, S', 'Malavasi, F', 'Mehta, K']","['Umar S', 'Malavasi F', 'Mehta K']","['Department of Bioimmunotherapy, The University of Texas M.

In order to better characterize the human gammac promoter and define the minimal tissue-specific promoter region, progressive 5'-deletion constructs of a segment extending 1053 base pairs upstream of the major transcription start site were generated and tested for promoter activity in various hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types. The -1053/+34 construct allowed promoter activity only in cells of hematopoietic origin, and tissue specificity was conserved in all other constructs tested. The region downstream of -90 appeared critical for basal promoter activity. It contains two potential Ets binding sites conserved in the murine gammac promoter gene, one of which was found essential for functional promoter activity as determined by mutational analysis. The functional Ets binding site was found to bind Ets family proteins, principally GA-binding protein and Elf-1 and could be transactivated by GABPalpha and -beta synergistically. These results indicate that, as already reported for the IL2Rbeta promoter, GA-binding protein is an essential component of gammac basal promoter activity. Although GABP expression is not restricted to the hematopoietic lineage, its interaction with other specific factors may contribute to the tissue-specific expression of the gammac gene.","['Markiewicz, S', 'Bosselut, R', 'Le Deist, F', 'de Villartay, J P', 'Hivroz, C', 'Ghysdael, J', 'Fischer, A', 'de Saint Basile, G']","['Markiewicz S', 'Bosselut R', 'Le Deist F', 'de Villartay JP', 'Hivroz C', 'Ghysdael J', 'Fischer A', 'de Saint Basile G']","['INSERM U429, Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades, 149 rue de Sevres, 75743 Paris Cedex 15, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ELF1 protein, human)', '0 (Elf1 protein, mouse)', '0 (GA-Binding Protein Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gabpb1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Burkitt Lymphoma', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'GA-Binding Protein Transcription Factor', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Organ Specificity', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/genetics/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X Chromosome']",1996/06/21 00:00,1996/06/21 00:01,['1996/06/21 00:00'],"['1996/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jun 21;271(25):14849-55. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.25.14849.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.25.14849 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)37259-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This results in the activation of genes such as Hoxa-1, Hoxb-1, laminin, collagen IV(alpha1), tissue plasminogen activator, RARbeta, and CRABPII. The CRABPI gene is regulated in an unusual fashion; CRABPI message and protein levels are induced at low concentrations of RA, but induction is diminished at higher concentrations. AB1 cells take up RA rapidly from the medium, and the addition of low, exogenous concentrations of RA to the culture medium results in very high intracellular RA concentrations. For example, AB1 stem cells cultured in 5 nM [3H]RA have an internal [3H]RA concentration of 1-2 microM within the first hour. AB1 cells also metabolize [3H]RA to more polar RA derivatives. The half-life of RA in AB1 cells not previously exposed to RA is about 2-2.5 h versus 40-45 min in cells cultured for 2-3 days in 1 microM exogenous RA. Thus, the enzyme(s) which metabolize RA are induced or activated by RA. Furthermore, the local concentration of RA required to elicit some biological responses may be higher than previously thought.","['Chen, A C', 'Gudas, L J']","['Chen AC', 'Gudas LJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Cornell University Medical College, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (retinoic acid binding protein I, cellular)', '0 (retinoic acid binding protein II, cellular)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Actins/biosynthesis', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Probes', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*biosynthesis', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1996/06/21 00:00,1996/06/21 00:01,['1996/06/21 00:00'],"['1996/06/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/21 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jun 21;271(25):14971-80. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.25.14971.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.25.14971 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)37277-6 [pii]']","['HD07560/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA43796/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

D., and Ishizuka, H. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 29085-29093). Now, using Northern hybridization and RNase protection assay, we provide evidence that the multidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP) gene, which encodes a human GS-X pump, is expressed at higher levels in cisplatin-resistant (HL-60/R-CP) cells than in sensitive cells, whereas amplification of the MRP gene is not detected by Southern hybridization. Culturing HL-60/R-CP cells in cisplatin-free medium resulted in reduced MRP mRNA levels, but these levels could be induced to rise within 30 h by cisplatin and heavy metals such as arsenite, cadmium, and zinc. The increased levels of MRP mRNA were closely related with enhanced activities of ATP-dependent transport of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) in plasma membrane vesicles. The glutathione-platinum (GS-Pt) complex, but not cisplatin, inhibited ATP-dependent LTC4 transport, suggesting that the MRP/GS-X pump transports both LTC4 and the GS-Pt complex. Expression of gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase in the cisplatin-resistant cells was also co-induced within 24 h in response to cisplatin exposure, resulting in a significant increase in cellular GSH level. The resistant cells exposed to cisplatin were cross-resistant to melphalan, chlorambucil, arsenite, and cadmium. These observations suggest that elevated expression of the MRP/GS-X pump and increased GSH biosynthesis together may be important factors in the cellular metabolism and disposition of cisplatin, alkylating agents, and heavy metals.","['Ishikawa, T', 'Bao, J J', 'Yamane, Y', 'Akimaru, K', 'Frindrich, K', 'Wright, C D', 'Kuo, M T']","['Ishikawa T', 'Bao JJ', 'Yamane Y', 'Akimaru K', 'Frindrich K', 'Wright CD', 'Kuo MT']","['Department of Experimental Pediatrics and Section of Eucaryotic Cell Research, University of Texas M.

The first DR-2 elements of the series do not bind known receptors but do bind the SP1 transcription factor. Two alleles of the MPO gene exist that differ at one position within this element, resulting in one allele with and one without a strong SP1 binding site. The element with the SP1 site activates transcription by 25-fold in transient transfection assays, while the alternative allele confers severalfold less transcriptional activity. Most cases of acute myelocytic leukemia are homozygous for the allele with the SP1 binding site, suggesting this element plays an important role in regulating the MPO gene in myeloid leukemias.

To determine whether the IL-10R has signaling functions similar to IL-6R in cells normally expressing these receptors, leukocytes of the B-, T-, and NK-cell lineages were treated with either cytokine. Both cytokines activated factors that bound to the sis-inducible element and included STAT1 and STAT3. The cell response to IL-10 characteristically differed from that to IL-2/IL-15, IL-4, and interferon gamma. The signaling capabilities of the IL-10R for activating specific STAT proteins and inducing gene transcription were defined by reconstitution of receptor functions in transfected tissue culture cells. COS-1 cells, co-expressing the human IL-10R and individual STAT proteins, confirmed a preference of the IL-10R for STAT3 and STAT1. Unlike many hematopoietin receptors, the IL-10R did not detectably activate STAT5. The IL-10R, together with reporter gene constructs containing different IL-6-responsive gene elements, reconstituted in hepatoma cells an induction of transcription by IL-10 that was comparable to that by IL-6. This regulation could not be appreciably modified by enhanced expression of STAT proteins. The similar actions of IL-10R and IL-6R on the induction of endogenous IL-6-responsive genes were demonstrated in hepatoma cells stably expressing the IL-10R. These receptor functions required the presence of the box 3 motifs, as shown by the analysis of the mouse IL-10R constructs containing progressively truncated cytoplasmic domains.

In addition we identified antibodies that were able to neutralize only one single cytokine of the IL-6 family. This was the case for the B-K5 antibody, which antagonized the binding of OSM to gp130 but did not interfere with the signals provided by the related cytokines triggering the proliferation of the TF1 erythroleukemia cell line or the induction of haptoglobin synthesis in the HepG2 hepatoma cell line. Similarly, we also characterized two additional antibodies B-P8 and B-P4, which inhibited the TF1 cell proliferation observed in the presence of CNTF and IL-11, respectively.

When U937 cells were treated with 10(-8) M bufalin in the absence of serum, mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity was markedly increased 6 h after the start of treatment and elevated so for 12 h. Prior to the activation of MAP kinase, increased activities of Ras, Raf-1, and MAP kinase kinase were found, but these enzymes were transiently activated by the treatment with bufalin. These results suggest that the signal was transmitted sequentially from Ras, Raf-1, and MAP kinase kinase to MAP kinase. In association with this signal transduction, the concentration of cAMP in the cells decreased markedly, suggesting that Raf-1 was also activated by a decrease in the extent of phosphorylation by protein kinase A. In fact, pretreatment of U937 cells with forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, which are known to increase the concentration of cAMP in the cells, and subsequent treatment with bufalin resulted in a decrease in both Raf-1 activity and DNA fragmentation.

The transformants were significantly resistant to both DNA fragmentation and cell death in response to bufalin.

After identification of the consensus binding site of GRBF, we cloned cDNA for that factor by Southwestern method, and it was identified as a previously reported transcription factor, delta, a murine form of YY-l which is a versatile transcription factor.

In gel mobility shift assays with the U5RE DNA probe, Jurkat T cell nuclear proteins generated five different complexes, named U5RE binding protein complexes (U5RP)-A1, -A2, -A3, -B, and -C. Only U5RP-C was affected by pretreatment with an excess of poly(dI-dC) and was immunodepressed by anti-Ku/p80 antibodies, suggesting that U5RP-C is a nonspecific complex involving Ku antigen. UV cross-linking showed at least six nuclear proteins involved in the other complexes, including U5RP-A1, -A2, -A3, and -B. The sequence of the binding core element of these specific complexes, determined by competition assays and gel mobility shift assays using a series of the U5RE mutants, is CACCC which is identical to that for the Sp1 transcription factor. LTR with a mutant U5RE, which has no ability to bind with the nuclear proteins, showed stronger promoter activity than LTR with the wild U5RE, suggesting that the specific interaction of these U5RE-binding proteins might result in the U5-mediated repression. U5RP-A1 was supershifted by anti-Sp1 antibodies and U5RP-A2 and -B were supershifted by anti-Sp3 antibodies, suggesting that Sp1 or Sp3 is involved in U5RP-A1 or U5RP-A2 and -B, respectively.

The role of calcineurin.,13484-90,"Down-regulation of c-myb mRNA levels by [Ca2+]i-increasing agents (A23187, thapsigargin, cyclopiazonic acid) and erythropoietin was comparatively studied in the erythropoietin-responsive murine erythroleukemia cell line, ELM-I-1. The Ca2+-induced suppression of c-myb mRNA could be inhibited by the calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine and calmidazolium, as well as by cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B (calcineurin). KN-62, an inhibitor of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, did not antagonize the Ca2+-mediated decrease in c-myb mRNA. In cyclosporin A-treated ELM-I-1 cells, a close correlation could be demonstrated between the antagonization of the Ca2+ effect on c-myb mRNA levels and inhibition of the calcineurin phophatase activity. On the other hand, FK506, which did not inhibit calcineurin activity in ELM-I-1 cells, failed to prevent the Ca2+-mediated decrease in c-myb mRNA. The erythropoietin-induced down-regulation of c-myb mRNA levels could be demonstrated also in the presence of EGTA and was resistant to calmodulin antagonists and cyclosporin A. In addition, no increase in [Ca2+]i was observed in ELM-I-1 cells in response to erythropoietin. Cyclosporin A inhibited the Ca2+-induced hemoglobin production, while the erythropoietin-mediated increase in hemoglobin synthesis was not affected. The results indicate that the Ca2+-induced decrease in c-myb mRNA and increase in hemoglobin synthesis is mediated by calcineurin, while these effects of erythropoietin occur independently of Ca2+ in ELM-I-1 cells. Calcineurin may be involved in the regulation of c-myb expression in erythroid precursor cells and Ca2+ signals via calcineurin may positively modulate the differentiation inducing action of erythropoietin.","['Schaefer, A', 'Magocsi, M', 'Stocker, U', 'Fandrich, A', 'Marquardt, H']","['Schaefer A', 'Magocsi M', 'Stocker U', 'Fandrich A', 'Marquardt H']","['Department of Toxicology, Hamburg University Medical School, Grindelallee 117, D-20146 Hamburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (Calmodulin-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Calcineurin)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'WM0HAQ4WNM (Tacrolimus)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcineurin', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Calmodulin-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Genes, myc/drug effects', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', '*Oncogenes/drug effects', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', 'Tacrolimus/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/07 00:00,1996/06/07 00:01,['1996/06/07 00:00'],"['1996/06/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/07 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jun 7;271(23):13484-90. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.23.13484.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.23.13484 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)41348-8 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regulation of L-arginine transport and no production by CAT-1, CAT-2A, and CAT-2B.",11694-702,"Cytokine-dependent production of nitric oxide (NO) by rat cardiac myocytes is a consequence of increased expression of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS or NOS2) and, in the presence of insulin, depresses the contractile function of these cells in vivo and in vitro. Experiments reported here show that L-lysine, a competitive antagonist of L-arginine uptake, suppressed NO production (detected as nitrite accumulation) by interleukin (IL)-1beta and interferon (IFN) gamma-pretreated cardiac myocytes by 70%, demonstrating that NO production is dependent on L-arginine uptake. Cardiac myocytes constitutively exhibit a high-affinity L-arginine transport system (Km = 125 microM; Vmax = 44 pmol/2 X 10(5) cells/min). Following a 24-h exposure to IL-1beta and IFNgamma, arginine uptake increases Vmax = 167 pmol/2 X 10(5) cells/min) and a second low-affinity L-arginine transporter activity appears (Km = 1.2 mM). To examine the molecular basis for these cytokine-induced changes in arginine transport, we examined expression of three related arginine transporters previously identified in other cell types. mRNA for the high-affinity cationic amino acid transporter-1 (CAT-1) is expressed in resting myocytes and steady-state levels increase by 10-fold following exposure to IL-1beta and IFNgamma. Only cytokine-pretreated myocytes expressed a second high-affinity L-arginine transporter, CAT-2B, as well as a low-affinity L-arginine transporter, CAT-2A. In addition, insulin, which potentiated cytokine-dependent NO production independent of any change in NOS activity, increased myocyte L-arginine uptake by 2-fold and steady-state levels of CAT-1, but not CAT-2A or CAT-2B mRNA. Thus, NO production by cardiac myocytes exposed to IL-1beta plus IFNgamma appears to be dependent on the coinduction of CAT-1, CAT-2A, and CAT-2B, while insulin independently augments L-arginine transport through CAT- 1.","['Simmons, W W', 'Closs, E I', 'Cunningham, J M', 'Smith, T W', 'Kelly, R A']","['Simmons WW', 'Closs EI', 'Cunningham JM', 'Smith TW', 'Kelly RA']","['Cardiovascular Division, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '94ZLA3W45F (Arginine)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 3.5.4.16 (GTP Cyclohydrolase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arginine/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'GTP Cyclohydrolase/genetics', 'Insulin/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Male', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Myocardium/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', '*Receptors, Virus']",1996/05/17 00:00,1996/05/17 00:01,['1996/05/17 00:00'],"['1996/05/17 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/17 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/17 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 May 17;271(20):11694-702. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.20.11694.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.20.11694 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)82607-2 [pii]']","['CA61246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R37-HL36141/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although GM-CSF does not appear to be essential for normal hemopoiesis, overexpression of GM-CSF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some diseases such as myeloid leukemia and chronic inflammation. An NF-kappaB/Rel binding site within the GM-CSF promoter, termed the kappaB element appears to be important for controlling expression in reporter gene assays in response to a number of stimuli in T cells. We investigated oligonucleotide-directed triple helix formation across this regulatory sequence as a potential tool to inhibit GM-CSF gene transcription. A 15-base oligonucleotide, GM3, was targeted to a purine-rich region in the GM-CSF proximal promoter, which overlaps the kappaB element. Gel mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting demonstrated that GM3 formed a sequence-specific collinear triplex with its double-stranded DNA target. Triplex formation by GM3 blocked recombinant and nuclear NF-kappaB proteins binding to the GM-CSF element. GM3 also caused selective inhibition of the human T-cell lymphotrophic virus-1 Tax transactivator-induced luciferase activity from a reporter construct driven by the GM-CSF promoter in Jurkat T cells. Finally, GM3 greatly reduced the concentration of endogenous GM-CSF mRNA induced by different stimuli in Jurkat T cells but did not affect interleukin 3 mRNA levels in the same cells. We conclude that the kappaB element in the GM-CSF promoter plays a central role in the transcriptional activation of the endogenous GM-CSF gene. Colinear triplex formation acts as a selective transcriptional repressor of the GM-CSF gene and may have potential therapeutic application in cases of undesirable overexpression of this protein.","['Kochetkova, M', 'Shannon, M F']","['Kochetkova M', 'Shannon MF']","['Division of Human Immunology, Hanson Centre for Cancer Research, Institute of Medical and Veterinary Science, Frome Road, Adelaide 5000, South Australia, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'DNA/chemistry', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Gene Products, tax/*metabolism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/metabolism', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/14 00:00,1996/06/14 00:01,['1996/06/14 00:00'],"['1996/06/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/14 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 Jun 14;271(24):14438-44. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.24.14438.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.24.14438 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)46818-4 [pii]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it does stimulate a prolonged and biphasic tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Stat3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3; at least 24 h) and, to a lesser extent, Stat1. Gel shift and supershift analyses confirm that IL-6 predominantly activates Stat3 (and some Stat1) and stimulates sis-inducible element binding activity. Other members of the same cytokine subfamily, including ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor, also cause a transient initial phase of tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Stat1 and Stat3 (up to 1 h) but fail to stimulate a second phase of response and do not produce significant neurites. These results suggest that sustained signaling of either STAT or ERK pathways in PC12-E2 cells leads to induction of neuronal differentiation. However, only the latter is effective in native PC12 cells as the activation of Stat3 and Stat1 in native PC12 cells by IL-6 fails to induce neuronal differentiation. Thus, the response of PC12-E2 cells to IL-6 suggests the constitutive expression of a required factor(s) for differentiation, that is induced in native PC12 cells by NGF or bFGF (possibly by ERK activation), but not by IL-6 via Janus kinase/STAT activation. This factor(s), which has a sufficient half-life to allow primed cells to remain responsive to IL-6 for several days, is necessary but not sufficient for differentiation (as measured by neurite proliferation) to occur.","['Wu, Y Y', 'Bradshaw, R A']","['Wu YY', 'Bradshaw RA']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, College of Medicine, University of California, Irvine, California 92717-1700, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Acute-Phase Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', '0 (Stat1 protein, rat)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.- (Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Proteins/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Growth Factors/metabolism', 'Neurites/*drug effects/metabolism', 'PC12 Cells', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Rats', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/05/31 00:00,1996/05/31 00:01,['1996/05/31 00:00'],"['1996/05/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/31 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/31 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 May 31;271(22):13023-32. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.22.13023.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.22.13023 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)41467-6 [pii]']",['AG 09735/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Laparoscopic tube cholecystostomy was performed instead of immediate conversion to laparotomy in 9 patients with acute cholecystitis after unsuccessful attempts at laparoscopic dissection. Elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy was done 3 months later. RESULTS: Following this approach eight patients were treated successfully. After 3 months the acute process had subsided sufficiently to allow a safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy. One additional patient died of acute leukemia 6 weeks after cholecystostomy. Before adopting this technique we subjected 171 patients with acute calculous cholecystitis to laparoscopic cholecystectomy; there was an 11% (19 cases) rate of conversion. Since cholecystostomy has begun to be offered as an alternative to conversion, 121 patients with acute cholecystitis have had laparoscopic cholecystectomy and only 2 cases (1.5%) have been converted to immediate open cholecystectomy. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend the alternative of performing a cholecystostomy with delayed laparoscopic cholecystectomy instead of conversion to open procedure when facing a case of acute cholecystitis not amenable to laparoscopic cholecystectomy.","['Kuster, G G', 'Domagk, D']","['Kuster GG', 'Domagk D']","['Division of General Surgery, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Surg Endosc,Surgical endoscopy,8806653,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Cholecystectomy, Laparoscopic/*methods', 'Cholecystitis/*surgery', 'Cholecystostomy/*methods', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gallbladder/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Postoperative Complications/*epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Surg Endosc. 1996 Apr;10(4):426-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00191631.,,['10.1007/BF00191631 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This process of HTLV-dependent cellular activation and induction of proliferation has been considered distinctive because of an apparent independence from conventional T-cell costimulatory signals. We have examined several HTLV-infected cell lines and found that proliferation was readily induced in resting PBMC by T-cells that were productively-infected with HTLV. However, equivalent HTLV-productive infection in a B-cell line failed to induce proliferation in PBMC, suggesting that HTLV-dependent induction of proliferation in PBMC was, at least in part, dependent upon a T-cell-specific signal. Furthermore, the induction of proliferation in PBMC populations was found to overlap with, and actually require, transfer and establishment of HTLV infection within the T-cell compartment of the PBMC population. These findings suggest that virus-induced activation of target cells may be directly associated with transfer and spread of HTLV infection.","['Martin, T C', 'Southern, P J']","['Martin TC', 'Southern PJ']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human immunodeficiency virus 2)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '6L3XT8CB3I (Zalcitabine)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/drug effects/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/*immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zalcitabine/pharmacology', 'Zidovudine/pharmacology', 'env Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1996 Jul 15;221(2):375-81. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0389.,,"['S0042-6822(96)90389-X [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.0389 [doi]']",['CA 09138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not known how the activity of PR is regulated so that proteolysis occurs at this time. Cellular aspartic proteases are synthesized as zymogens with short N-terminal extensions that are proteolytically removed to generate the free active enzyme. In the avian sarcoma and leukosis viruses (ASLV), PR is expressed as the carboxy-terminal domain of the Gag polyprotein, which thus has a structure analogous to such a zymogen. We have investigated the enzymatic properties of ASLV PR when it is part of a longer protein, NC-PR, serving as a model for Gag. This protein represents about one-third of Gag and consists of the nucleocapsid (NC) domain fused to the N-terminus of PR. NC-PR and derivatives of NC-PR were expressed in bacterial cells and purified. In short-term assays, these fusion proteins lacked measurable protease activity toward an exogenous substrate prepared by in vitro translation. In contrast to PR, which is a homodimer, NC-PR migrated as a monomer both by glycerol gradient sedimentation and by gel filtration chromatography. Thus the NC domain appears to inhibit enzymatic activity by altering the dimerization potential of the PR domains. However, upon long incubations NC-PR was found to cleave itself to generate free and fully active PR, implying that dimerization was not prevented entirely. On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that the Gag protein in vivo is also incompletely active as a protease, because upstream portions of Gag interfere with proper interaction of the PR domains. The eventual dimerization, perhaps triggered by other events, then could lead to a cascade whereby PR is proteolytically freed from Gag and thereby gains enzymatic activity.","['Sellos-Moura, M', 'Vogt, V M']","['Sellos-Moura M', 'Vogt VM']","['Section of Biochemistry, Molecular and Cell Biology, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.23.- (Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*enzymology', 'Avian Sarcoma Viruses/*enzymology', 'Capsid/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Viral Core Proteins/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",1996/07/15 00:00,1996/07/15 00:01,['1996/07/15 00:00'],"['1996/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1996 Jul 15;221(2):335-45. doi: 10.1006/viro.1996.0383.,,"['S0042-6822(96)90383-9 [pii]', '10.1006/viro.1996.0383 [doi]']",['CA20081/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pulse-chase experiments showed that the precursor protein can be labeled by [3H]palmitic acid prior to its cleavage into the surface and TM subunits. By using site-directed mutagenesis, we determined that palmitoylation occurs on a cysteine residue, Cys 606, located in the transmembrane domain. A thin-layer chromatography assay after acid hydrolysis showed that incorporated label comigrated with palmitic acid. When another cysteine residue was introduced into the cytoplasmic tail 22 amino acids from the transmembrane domain, no palmitoylation was observed to occur on this cysteine residue, demonstrating the importance of the position of the cysteine residue for palmitoylation.

This effect was demonstrated in dose- and time-course-dependent manners. In comparison with previous reports on HIV-1 Rev, these effects with Rex seemed to be similar, but less distinct, which may reflect precise differences in the subcellular localization and/or shuttling pathways of Rev and Rex. Interestingly, the endogenous truncated form of the Rex protein, p21x, significantly interfered with the intracellular translocation of Rex, when coexpressed in trans.

We report here the isolation and characterization of the human C/EBPepsilon gene (CEBPE). By using low-stringency hybridization conditions and probes derived from the C/EBPalpha and C/EBPdelta genes, we have isolated overlapping genomic clones that cover almost 25 kb of the C/EBPepsilon gene locus and corresponding cDNA clones. DNA sequence analysis reveals that the gene encodes a protein highly homologous to rat CRP1. The gene was assigned to chromosome 14q11.2 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and was physically linked to the genetic marker D14S990. Based on linkage data derived from this marker, we positioned the CEBPE gene between the T-cell receptor alpha/delta locus and a cluster of four serine proteases expressed exclusively in hematopoietic cells. Expression of C/EBPepsilon was detected in Jurkat T-cell and in HL 60 promyelocytic cell lines. From a variety of normal human tissues studied, expression of mRNA was monitored only in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, tissues involved in the immune system, and ovaries.

An elevation of [Ca2+]i observed in P2 cells was abrogated by an addition of EGTA, which partially inhibited the differentiation of P2 cells stimulated by lipid A.

These adhesion resulted from the interaction between alpha4beta1 and VCAM-1. Interestingly, treatment with mAb against human beta1 (4B4 clone), which has been known as inhibitory mAb, enhanced binding of alpha4mK562 cells to rhTNF-treated HUVEC but not to murine endothelial cells. This increase in binding induced by 4B4 mAb was completely inhibited by another mAb against human beta1 (mAb13), but only partially by anti-alpha4 mAb (PSsolidus2). The increase in binding induced by 4B4 mAb was also abolished by metabolic inhibitors, indicating that the increased binding is energy dependent. These observations suggest that the binding of 4B4 mAb to the chimeric alpha4beta1 induces an unique outside-in signaling and enhances the specific binding of alpha4mK562 cells to rhTNF-treated HUVEC.","['Miyakawa, Y', 'Nishimura, T', 'Ueyama, Y', 'Miyake, K', 'Miyasaka, M', 'Ikeda, Y', 'Habu, S']","['Miyakawa Y', 'Nishimura T', 'Ueyama Y', 'Miyake K', 'Miyasaka M', 'Ikeda Y', 'Habu S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Anti-Allergic Agents)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Allergic Agents/immunology/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Chimera', 'DNA, Complementary/physiology', 'Endothelium, Vascular/*cytology/metabolism', 'Epitopes/analysis', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/physiology', 'Umbilical Veins/cytology', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']",1996/07/10 00:00,1996/07/10 00:01,['1996/07/10 00:00'],"['1996/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Jul 10;226(1):75-9. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0204.,,"['S0014-4827(96)90204-9 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0204 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In experiments with B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells (n = 28) and purified CD19(+) cells from normal bone marrow (n = 6) we found that homogeneous populations of bone marrow fibroblasts could sustain survival of normal and leukemic immature B-cells as efficiently as composite bone marrow stromal layers.

Immunogold labelingsoliduselectron microscopy analysis revealed that the areas of contact between lymphoblasts and fibroblasts contained beta1 integrins (VLA-4 and VLA-5), fibronectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), and a cartilage-link protein, CD44.

We hypothesize that these molecular interactions either bring lymphoblasts into close physical proximity with other fibroblast-bound or ECM-bound survival factors or provide survival signals themselves.","['Murti, K G', 'Brown, P S', 'Kumagai, M a', 'Campana, D']","['Murti KG', 'Brown PS', 'Kumagai Ma', 'Campana D']","[""Department of Virology and Molecular Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, 38101, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/chemistry/*cytology/ultrastructure', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Extracellular Matrix/chemistry', 'Fibroblasts/chemistry/cytology/ultrastructure', 'Fibronectins/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/chemistry/*cytology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Stromal Cells/chemistry/cytology/ultrastructure']",1996/07/10 00:00,1996/07/10 00:01,['1996/07/10 00:00'],"['1996/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Jul 10;226(1):47-58. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0201.,,"['S0014482796902013 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0201 [doi]']",['CA 58297/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In many cases, this apoptosis is inhibited by BCL-2, suggesting the involvement of a common regulatory pathway. One frequent characteristic of apoptosis is the digestion of DNA into oligonucleosome-length fragments. Intracellular acidification and increased intracellular calcium have been variously implicated in activating the endonuclease responsible for this DNA digestion. To explore the involvement of these potential signals in endonuclease activation, we have analyzed three Chinese hamster ovary cell lines: a parental line, one expressing a cDNA encoding BCL-2, and the third expressing the BCL-2 family member MCL-1. Apoptosis was induced with the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine and intracellular pH and calcium were measured by flow cytometry. We found that both MCL-1 and BCL-2 inhibited DNA digestion compared to the parent cell line, although BCL-2 was more potent in this regard. Concurrent with DNA digestion, we observed intracellular acidification; MCL-1 and BCL-2 inhibited intracellular acidification to an extent commensurate with their ability to inhibit DNA digestion. In contrast, staurosporine caused a dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium in all three cell lines, demonstrating that intracellular free calcium levels did not correlate with the induction of apoptosis. These results suggest that BCL-2 and MCL-1 may regulate a pathway for intracellular pH homeostasis during apoptotic cell death.","['Reynolds, J E', 'Li, J', 'Craig, R W', 'Eastman, A']","['Reynolds JE', 'Li J', 'Craig RW', 'Eastman A']","['Department of Pharmacology, Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, New Hampshire 03755, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Acids)', '0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'P976261J69 (bisbenzimide ethoxide trihydrochloride)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Acids/metabolism', 'Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Benzimidazoles', 'CHO Cells/cytology/enzymology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Staurosporine']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1996 Jun 15;225(2):430-6. doi: 10.1006/excr.1996.0194.,,"['S0014-4827(96)90194-9 [pii]', '10.1006/excr.1996.0194 [doi]']","['CA23108/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50224/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57359/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Elucidation of the role of cytokine cooperation in vasculogenesis may lead to a better understanding of organogenesis, blood vessel regulation during tumorigenesis, and tissue injury. We have used embryonic stem cells to derive an endothelial cell line, designated IEM, which expresses a range of endothelial markers, including Von Willibrand Factor VIII related antigen, vascular cell adhesion molecule, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (CD31), and receptors for acetylated low-density lipoprotein. More importantly, IEM cells can be induced upon exposure to combinations of basic fibroblast growth factor and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to proliferate and undergo vasculogenesis in vitro, resulting in the formation of vascular tubes and microcapillary anastomoses. Moreover, exposure to both cytokines conditionally permits IEM cells to specifically chimerize microvascular endothelium in vivo following blastocyst injection. These results indicate that bFGF and LIF together contribute to the induction and support of embryonic vasculogenesis in an isolated endothelial cell line.

Similar mechanisms are also functional in T-lymphocytes through the beta 1-integrin VLA-4. A putative FAK-related phosphoprotein (fakB) was identified that is responsive to intracellular signals induced through ligation of antigen receptors on both T- and B-lymphocytes, and whose induced tyrosine phosphorylation is augmented by TCR costimulation through the adhesion/costimulatory receptors CD2 and CD4. In this report, fakB is shown to respond to extracellular signals through the beta 2-integrin LFA-1 in the absence of primary signals through the TCR. Protein-protein complex formation was observed involving an association between fakB, phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC gamma 1), and the tyrosine phosphoprotein pp35-36. Evidence is provided here that fakB interacts with PLC gamma 1 through its SH3 domain. The association between fakB and PLC gamma 1 does not appear to require T-cell activation, whereas the induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein complex components occurs following engagement of LFA-1. These data indicate that the beta2-integrin LFA-1 expressed on T-lymphocytes stimulates a novel, FAK-related molecule that may function in the interplay between adhesion receptors and intracellular signaling enzymes responsible for downstream second messenger generation.","['Kanner, S B']",['Kanner SB'],"['Bristol-Myers Squibb Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Seattle, Washington 98121, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/drug effects/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell', 'Lymphocyte Function-Associated Antigen-1/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Protein Binding/physiology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'src Homology Domains/*drug effects']",1996/07/10 00:00,1996/07/10 00:01,['1996/07/10 00:00'],"['1996/07/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/10 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1996 Jul 10;171(1):164-9. doi: 10.1006/cimm.1996.0188.,,"['S0008-8749(96)90188-4 [pii]', '10.1006/cimm.1996.0188 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Stimulation by rhIFN-gamma for 72 hr significantly increased the levels of HLA-DR and -DP expression but did not affect levels of HLA-DQ. Stimulation by rhIL-4 for 72 hr had minimal effect on expression of class II molecules, but induced a significant difference in levels of ICAM-1 (CD54) expression, indicating that this cytokine is involved instead in the control of certain accessory molecules.

The procedure utilizes horseradish peroxidase (HRPase)-based detection with a chemiluminescent substrate. After detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) with exposure to X-ray film, the antigen-antibody complexes on the blot are reacted with a chromogenic substrate (either 3.3'-diaminobenzidine [DAB] or SG [Vector Labs, Inc.]) which renders the antigen-antibody-HRPase complexes unreactive in subsequent reprobings of the same membrane with additional antibodies using the same detection method. Because no stripping is involved, immobilized proteins are not lost from the membrane, thus allowing for multiple sequential reprobings of the same membrane with different primary antibodies (> or = 12) and retention of strong signal intensities for all antibody probings. A variation of the method (the ""rainbow Western"") is described in which four different HRPase-colorimetric substrates that produce black, brown, red, and green colors are employed sequentially for detection and simultaneous display of four different antigens on the same blot. Both techniques could be particularly valuable for analysis of cellular populations that are difficult to isolate in large numbers or of clinical specimens where the amounts of protein samples that can be obtained are limiting or only available on a one-time basis.","['Krajewski, S', 'Zapata, J M', 'Reed, J C']","['Krajewski S', 'Zapata JM', 'Reed JC']","['Burnham Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Antigens/*analysis', '*Blotting, Western', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', '*Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*analysis/genetics']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 1996 May 1;236(2):221-8. doi: 10.1006/abio.1996.0160.,,"['S0003-2697(96)90160-8 [pii]', '10.1006/abio.1996.0160 [doi]']","['CA-60181/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60421/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-67329/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that potassium ions were required specifically in several cell types. Adhesion to fibronectin- (FN) coated surfaces was independent of K+ in the medium. In contrast, cells that adhered to FN in the absence of K+ failed to spread. This requirement for K+ occurred only during a discrete time frame: in the first 15 minutes following adhesion. Moreover, we identified a specific trans-membrane flux of the radioactive K+ analog 86Rb+, the kinetics of which correlated with this requirement. Both this ion flux and cell spreading were blocked by the K+ -channel inhibitors tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). Our results suggest that this K+ ion flux and the channels that regulate it are important in regulating the initial responses to adhesion that lead to spreading.","['Zigrino, P', 'Gaietta, G', 'Zambonin-Zallone, A', 'Pelletier, A J', 'Quaranta, V']","['Zigrino P', 'Gaietta G', 'Zambonin-Zallone A', 'Pelletier AJ', 'Quaranta V']","['The Scripps Research Institute, Department of Cell Biology, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Potassium Channels)', '78VO7F77PN (arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid)', 'MLT4718TJW (Rubidium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Movement', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Ion Channel Gating', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oligopeptides', 'Potassium Channels/*metabolism/physiology', 'Rats', 'Rubidium/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/05 00:00,1996/04/05 00:01,['1996/04/05 00:00'],"['1996/04/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/05 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Apr 5;221(1):51-8. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.0543.,,"['S0006-291X(96)90543-4 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.0543 [doi]']","['GM46902/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'RR04050/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From 1985 to 1990, 1612 children with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) in the UK were treated on MRC UKALL X with intensive induction therapy, central nervous system directed therapy (cranial irradiation and intrathecal methotrexate), and continuing treatment for two years. There was a randomisation to receive blocks of additional intensification treatment at five weeks, 20 weeks, not at all, or both. The five year disease free survival was 71% for children randomised to two blocks of intensification, a 14% improvement on children randomised to no intensification treatment. Treatment related mortality in this national multicentre study has been analysed for induction and first remission (including those after intensification treatment). There were 38 induction deaths, 2.3% and 53 deaths in first remission, 3.3% (including those from a second malignancy). Thirty one (84%) of the induction deaths followed an infection: bacterial in 22 and fungal in nine. Thirty seven infective remission deaths occurred: bacterial in 11, viral in 16, fungal in seven, and three caused by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Ten of these deaths followed a block of intensification treatment. The majority of noninfective remission deaths followed the development of a second tumour. Risk analysis for an induction death showed girls and children with Down's syndrome to be at greater risk. For deaths in first remission analysis showed an increased risk for bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients and children with Down's syndrome. There was no effect of age and leucocyte count for either group. Most significantly when BMT patients were excluded from the analysis, intensification treatment did not increase the risk of remission death.","['Wheeler, K', 'Chessells, J M', 'Bailey, C C', 'Richards, S M']","['Wheeler K', 'Chessells JM', 'Bailey CC', 'Richards SM']","['Clinical Trials Service Unit, Radcliffe Infirmary, Oxford.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/complications', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/radiotherapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1996 Feb;74(2):101-7. doi: 10.1136/adc.74.2.101.,,['10.1136/adc.74.2.101 [doi]'],,,,PMC1511507,,,,,,,,,,,

Using rats as a model, histological, immunocytochemical and electron microscopic analysis was applied to investigate changes in the seminiferous epithelium. In rats transplanted with leukaemic cells at early puberty, degenerate primary spermatocytes and spermatids were prevalent within stage VIII tubules. Electron microscopically, step 8 spermatids showed acrosomal abnormalities and nuclear contour distortion. In the distorted step 9 spermatids, the microtubules of the manchette were abnormally oriented or deficient. Antitubulin antibody staining was reduced in elongating spermatids in the group transplanted with leukaemic cells at early puberty but was not observed in the older leukaemic group. Step 13 spermatids showed extracted chromatin and degenerate step 19 spermatids were occasionally found. Similar but less severe changes were seen in the group of rats transplanted with leukaemic cells at late puberty. We conclude that germinal cell damage induced by ALL is dependent on the developmental maturity of the seminiferous epithelium.

In this study, acute leukemia that was myeloperoxidase negative by light microscopy and had at least one lymphoid antigen was defined as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

CD11b and CD15 were present in a wide range of lymphoid disorders irrespective of B/T lineage and maturity. Unclassified ALL and phenotypically immature ALL frequently expressed CD13 and CD33, and occasionally expressed CD14. Among early B precursor ALL, CD13, and/or CD33 were significantly associated with the presence of stem cell marker CD34 and the chromosomal abnormality t(9;22). In addition, ALL with deletion of chromosome 7 commonly expressed CD13 and CD33. Taken together, CD13 and/or CD33 positive ALL may originate from a multipotential stem cell. Among mature neoplasms, CD14 was frequently, and CD13 and CD33 were occasionally expressed in B-cell, but not T-cell tumors. These results suggest that CD13, CD14, and CD33 are preferentially expressed in two types of lymphoid neoplasms, namely undifferentiated ALL and mature B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.","['Nakase, K', 'Kita, K', 'Shiku, H', 'Tanaka, I', 'Nasu, K', 'Dohy, H', 'Kyo, T', 'Tsutani, H', 'Kamada, N']","['Nakase K', 'Kita K', 'Shiku H', 'Tanaka I', 'Nasu K', 'Dohy H', 'Kyo T', 'Tsutani H', 'Kamada N']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yamada Red Cross Hospital, Misono, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharide Receptors)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'CD13 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharide Receptors/analysis', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1996 Jun;105(6):761-8. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/105.6.761.,,['10.1093/ajcp/105.6.761 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed in 83 bone marrow and 30 peripheral blood samples from patients with CML to compare results with karyotyping and to evaluate utility of this test on peripheral blood samples. Using isolated total cellular RNA and a single primer pair, cDNA was transcribed, amplified, electrophoresed, and probed for bcr/abl fusion involving M-bcr exons 2 and 3 of the bcr gene. Fifty-three samples were from untreated or conventionally treated patients (pre-BMT), and 60 were from patients who had undergone bone marrow transplantation (post-BMT).

The authors have analysed the effect of increased cAMP on the activation of NF-kappa B transcription factor. This factor controls the expression of several genes (e.g. IL-2 and IL-2 receptor) involved in the activation and proliferation of T cells. The authors found that elevation of intracellular cAMP in Jurkat T leukaemia cells activated with phorbol ester (PDBu)/calcium ionophore (A23187) increased the DNA-binding of NF-kappa B as detected by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Analysis of the subunit composition of the DNA-binding complex indicated that the amount of c-Rel was enhanced while RelA was decreased. Analysis of the effect of elevated cAMP on the degradation of I kappa B-alpha and I kappa B-beta did not reveal an essential change in degradation kinetics of these inhibitor proteins. The elevation of cAMP did not increase the synthesis of c-Rel, but it enhanced the nuclear localization of this protein. Transfection of Jurkat cells with a plasmid kB/TK10-CAT indicated that the increased DNA-binding of c-Rel containing complexes seen in EMSA was also functional. These data imply that the strong and long-lasting c-Rel nuclear localization and DNA-binding induced by protein kinase A is not due to increased c-Rel synthesis or enhanced degradation of the I kappa B inhibitors. Therefore, a direct phosphorylation of the c-Rel protein is the most plausible explanation for these observations. Taken together, these results suggest that cAMP is able to regulate the expression of NF-kappa B-dependent genes in T cells by modifying the composition and subunit activity of NF-kappa B.","['Lahdenpohja, N', 'Henttinen, T', 'Hurme, M']","['Lahdenpohja N', 'Henttinen T', 'Hurme M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Tampere Medical School, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Compartmentation', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Transcription Factor RelB', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1996 Jun;43(6):640-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3083.1996.d01-268.x.,,['10.1046/j.1365-3083.1996.d01-268.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The photodynamic actions of these dyes in different cell lines are tested. It was found that dye 2 and dye 3 are efficient photosensitizers and mediate eradication of K562, EM2, myeloid cell lines (CML) and the SMF-AI rhabdomyosarcoma line.","['Pal, P', 'Zeng, H', 'Durocher, G', 'Girard, D', 'Li, T', 'Gupta, A K', 'Giasson, R', 'Blanchard, L', 'Gaboury, L', 'Balassy, A', 'Turmel, C', 'Laperriere, A', 'Villeneuve, L']","['Pal P', 'Zeng H', 'Durocher G', 'Girard D', 'Li T', 'Gupta AK', 'Giasson R', 'Blanchard L', 'Gaboury L', 'Balassy A', 'Turmel C', 'Laperriere A', 'Villeneuve L']","['Laboratoire de photophysique moleculaire, Universite de Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,"['0 (4,5-dibromorhodamine n-butyl ester)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '934QHK1OOK (4,5-dibromorhodamine methyl ester)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Photochemistry', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/drug therapy', 'Rhodamines/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 1996 Feb;63(2):161-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-1097.1996.tb03008.x.,,['10.1111/j.1751-1097.1996.tb03008.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The obtaining of recombinant cytokine has facilitated the study of its biological properties and its application in the treatment of certain neoplastic and infectious diseases. IL-2 affects the target cells by means of a receptor of great affinity consisting of three independent chains: alpha, beta, gamma. The cytokine is the most important growth factor of lymphocytes T, conditioning their clonal expansion. Antigen stimulation is the condition for the expression of IL-2 does not, however, affect resting lymphocytes T. The expression of the receptor for this cytokine on NK cells is, however, continuous in character but only a very small percentage of these cells has receptors of great affinity. IL-2 plays a great role in adoptive immunotherapy consisting in intravenous administration of cells with cytotoxic properties. Cells obtained from peripheral blood and grown in vitro are called LAK cells (lymphocyte activated killer cells), while cells obtained from neoplasms and grown in similar conditions are named TIL cells (tumor infiltrated lymphocytes). LAK and TIL cells reveal a similar antineoplastic activity in vivo. At present, however, recombinant IL-2 alone is used more often, either intravenously or subcutaneously. The cytokine is effective in the treatment of patients with disseminate cancer of the kidney and melanoma, and in adjuvant therapy of acute myeloid leukemia. Attempts have been made to apply it in the treatment of AIDS and leprosy. The toxic effect of IL-2 depends on the dose and the mode of administration. In the majority of patients parainfluenza symptoms appear. Most undesirable effects are connected with multisystemic syndrome of capillary vessels hyperpermeability leading to the increased fluid retention into extravascular spaces, oedema, hypotonia and oliguria.","['Robak, T']",['Robak T'],['II Klinika Chorob Wewnetrznych Akademii Medycznej w Lodzi.'],['pol'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Poland,Postepy Hig Med Dosw,Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej,0421052,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Kidney Neoplasms/therapy', 'Leprosy/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Postepy Hig Med Dosw. 1995;49(3):367-93.,102,,,,Wlasciwosci biologiczne i zastosowanie lecznicze interleukiny 2 (IL-2).,,,,,,,,,,,,

Enrollment requires certification by a physician that the patient has a life expectancy of less than six months. We examined how long before death patients enrolled in hospice programs. METHODS: Using 1990 Medicare claim data, we analyzed the characteristics and survival of 6451 hospice patients followed for a minimum of 27 months with respect to mortality. RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 76.4 years; 92.4 percent were white. Half the patients were women, and 80.2 percent had cancer of some type. The most common diagnoses were lung cancer (21.4 percent), colorectal cancer (10.5 percent), and prostate cancer (7.4 percent). The median survival after enrollment was only 36 days, and 15.6 percent of the patients died within 7 days. At the other extreme, 14.9 percent of the patients lived longer than six months. Survival varied substantially according to diagnosis, even after adjustment for age and co-existing conditions. The unadjusted survival after enrollment was shortest for those with renal failure, those with leukemia or lymphoma, and those with liver or biliary cancer; it was longest for those with chronic lung disease, those with dementia, and those with breast cancer. Patients at for-profit, larger, outpatient, or newer hospices lived longer after enrollment than those in other types of hospice programs. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients who enter hospice care do so late in the course of their terminal illnesses. The timing of enrollment in hospice programs varies substantially with the characteristics of the patients and the hospices.","['Christakis, N A', 'Escarce, J J']","['Christakis NA', 'Escarce JJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Aged', 'Dementia/mortality', 'Federal Government', 'Female', 'Heart Failure/mortality', 'Hospice Care/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Lung Diseases, Obstructive/mortality', 'Male', '*Medicare', 'Neoplasms/mortality', 'Renal Insufficiency/mortality', '*Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'United States']",1996/07/18 00:00,1996/07/18 00:01,['1996/07/18 00:00'],"['1996/07/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/18 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1996 Jul 18;335(3):172-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199607183350306.,,['10.1056/NEJM199607183350306 [doi]'],,"['N Engl J Med. 1996 Jul 18;335(3):201-2.

These data were originally collected for the purpose of identifying potential human carcinogens. However, the objective of our analysis was to investigate the frequency of possible anticarcinogenic effects in these data, since recurring cases of chemical-associated tumor reductions have been noted in the course of these studies over time. Our analysis reveals that most (>90%) NTP-tested chemicals show at least one statistically significant (p<0.05) decrease in site-specific tumor incidence. Because of the large number of statistical comparisons made in a long-term bioassay, random variability can account for many of these tumor decreases. However, we found that certain tumors (predominantly those with a high spontaneous incidence) show chemically related decreases far more frequently than chance expectation. Many of these decreases, particularly those for pituitary and mammary gland tumors, adrenal pheochromocytoma and uterine polyps in rats and liver and lung tumors in mice, are associated with the reduced body weights frequently observed in the dosed groups. The chemically related decreased incidences of leukemia in rats appear to be related to spleen damage, i.e., chemically related splenic toxicity is evident for most chemicals showing decreased incidences of leukemia. While random variability, associations with body weight and splenic toxicity can account for most of the decreased tumor incidences observed in NTP studies, there are other tumor decreases that could not be totally explained by these factors. Further investigations of possible mechanisms of action are underway. These data are relevant to the concept of chemoprevention as well as to the task of using long-term laboratory animal studies to predict enhanced human environmental-cancer risk for regulatory purposes.","['Haseman, J K', 'Johnson, F M']","['Haseman JK', 'Johnson FM']","['National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,['0 (Anticarcinogenic Agents)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Anticarcinogenic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Biological Assay', 'Body Weight', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Toxicology', 'United States']",1996/02/19 00:00,1996/02/19 00:01,['1996/02/19 00:00'],"['1996/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1996 Feb 19;350(1):131-41. doi: 10.1016/0027-5107(95)00098-4.,,"['0027-5107(95)00098-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0027-5107(95)00098-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We find that both chromatin and cell extracts derived from human T-cell leukemia virus type 1-infected human T lymphocytes support higher levels of 5S rRNA and tRNA gene transcription than chromatin or extracts from uninfected T lymphocytes. The viral protein Tax was likely responsible for this higher level of class II gene transcription, as purified Tax was found to stimulate both genes when added to the uninfected cell extract or in reconstituted systems. Both limiting-component transcription assays and DNA binding assays identified the class III gene transcription factor TFIIIB as the principle target of Tax activity.

To assess how Pbx proteins influence Hox DNA-binding specificity, we used a binding-site selection approach to determine high-affinity target sites recognized by various Pbx-Hox homeoprotein complexes. Pbx-Hox heterodimers preferred to bind a bipartite sequence 5'-ATGATTNATNN-3' consisting of two adjacent half sites in which the Pbx component of the heterodimer contacted the 5' half (ATGAT) and the Hox component contacted the more variable 3' half (TNATNN). Binding sites matching the consensus were also obtained for Pbx1 complexed with HoxA10, which lacks a hexapeptide but requires a conserved tryptophan-containing motif for cooperativity with Pbx. Interactions with Pbx were found to play an essential role in modulating Hox homeodomain amino-terminal arm contact with DNA in the core of the Hox half site such that heterodimers of different compositions could distinguish single nucleotide alterations in the Hox half site both in vitro and in cellular assays measuring transactivation. When complexed with Pbx, Hox proteins B1 through B9 and A10 showed stepwise differences in their preferences for nucleotides in the Hox half site core (TTAT to TGAT, 5' to 3') that correlated with the locations of their respective genes in the Hox cluster. These observations demonstrate previously undetected DNA-binding specificity for the amino-terminal arm of the Hox homeodomain and suggest that different binding activities of Pbx-Hox complexes are at least part of the position-specific activities of the Hox genes.","['Chang, C P', 'Brocchieri, L', 'Shen, W F', 'Largman, C', 'Cleary, M L']","['Chang CP', 'Brocchieri L', 'Shen WF', 'Largman C', 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, California 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (exd protein, Drosophila)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Drosophila/genetics', '*Drosophila Proteins', '*Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Apr;16(4):1734-45. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.4.1734.,,['10.1128/MCB.16.4.1734 [doi]'],"['CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM10452-31/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC231160,,,,,,,,,,,

Pbx1/Exd binds DNA elements cooperatively with a large subset of Hox/HOM-C proteins containing a conserved pentapeptide motif, usually YPWMR, located just N terminally to their homeodomains. The pentapeptide is essential for cooperative DNA binding with Pbx1. In this study, we identify structural determinants of Pbx1 that are required for cooperative DNA binding with the pentapeptide-containing Hox protein HoxA5. We demonstrate that the homeodomain of Pbx1 contains a surface that binds the pentapeptide motif and that the Pbx1 homeodomain is sufficient for cooperative DNA binding with a Hox protein. A sequence immediately C terminal to the Pbx1 homeodomain, which is highly conserved in Pbx2 and Pbx3 and predicted to form an alpha-helix, enhances monomeric DNA binding by Pbx1 and also contributes to maximal cooperativity with Hox proteins. Binding studies with chimeric HoxA5-Pbx1 fusion proteins suggest that the homeodomains of Pbx1 and HoxA5 are docked on the representative element, TTGATTGAT, in tandem, with Pbx1 recognizing the 5' TTGAT core motif and the Hox protein recognizing the 3' TGAT core. The proposed binding orientation permits Hox proteins to exhibit further binding specificity on the basis of the identity of the four residues 3' to their core binding motif.","['Lu, Q', 'Kamps, M P']","['Lu Q', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (exd protein, Drosophila)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila/genetics', '*Drosophila Proteins', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/genetics/*metabolism', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Apr;16(4):1632-40. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.4.1632.,,['10.1128/MCB.16.4.1632 [doi]'],"['2 PO1 CA50528-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56876-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC231149,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(12;21) translocation encodes a 93-kDa fusion protein that localizes to a high-salt- and detergent-resistant nuclear compartment. This protein binds the enhancer core motif, TGTGGT, and interacts with the AML-1-binding protein, core-binding factor beta. Although TEL/AML-1B retains the C-terminal domain of AML-1B that is required for transactivation of the T-cell receptor beta enhancer, it fails to activate transcription but rather inhibits the basal activity of this enhancer. TEL/AML-1B efficiently interferes with AML-1B dependent transactivation of the T-cell receptor beta enhancer, and coexpression of wild-type TEL does not reverse this inhibition. The N-terminal TEL helix-loop-helix domain is essential for TEL/AML-1B-mediated repression. Thus, the t(12;21) fusion protein dominantly interferes with AML-1B-dependent transcription, suggesting that the inhibition of expression of AML-1 genes is critical for B-cell leukemogenesis.","['Hiebert, S W', 'Sun, W', 'Davis, J N', 'Golub, T', 'Shurtleff, S', 'Buijs, A', 'Downing, J R', 'Grosveld, G', 'Roussell, M F', 'Gilliland, D G', 'Lenny, N', 'Meyers, S']","['Hiebert SW', 'Sun W', 'Davis JN', 'Golub T', 'Shurtleff S', 'Buijs A', 'Downing JR', 'Grosveld G', 'Roussell MF', 'Gilliland DG', 'Lenny N', 'Meyers S']","[""Department of Tumor Cell Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic/genetics', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Apr;16(4):1349-55. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.4.1349.,,['10.1128/MCB.16.4.1349 [doi]'],"['CA-57261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-56819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA-64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC231119,,,,,,,,,,,

ICSAT is structurally most closely related to the previously cloned ICSBP, a member of the IFN regulatory factor (IRF) family of proteins that binds to interferon consensus sequences (ICSs) found in many promoters of the IFN-regulated genes. Among T-cell lines investigated, ICSAT was abundantly expressed in human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-infected T cells. When the HTLV-1 tax gene was expressed or phorbol myristake acetate-A23187 stimulation was used, ICSAT expression was induced in Jurkat cells which otherwise do not express ICSAT. When the binding of ICSAT to four different ICSs was tested, the relative differences in binding affinities for those ICSs were determined. To study the functional role of ICSAT, we performed cotransfection experiments with the human embryonal carcinoma cell line N-Tera2. ICSAT was demonstrated to possess repressive function over the gene activation induced by IFN stimulation or by IRF-1 cotransfection. Such repressive function is similar to that seen in IRF-2 or ICSBP. However, we have found that ICSAT has a different repressive effect from that of IRF-2 or ICSBP in some IFN-responsive reporter constructs. These results suggest that a novel mechanism of gene regulation by ""differential repression"" is used by multiple members of repressor proteins with different repressive effects on the IFN-responsive genes.","['Yamagata, T', 'Nishida, J', 'Tanaka, S', 'Sakai, R', 'Mitani, K', 'Yoshida, M', 'Taniguchi, T', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Yamagata T', 'Nishida J', 'Tanaka S', 'Sakai R', 'Mitani K', 'Yoshida M', 'Taniguchi T', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Tokyo University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interferon Regulatory Factors)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-4)', '0 (interferon regulatory factor-8)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '9008-11-1 (Interferons)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, pX', 'Humans', 'Interferon Regulatory Factors', 'Interferons/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Apr;16(4):1283-94. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.4.1283.,,['10.1128/MCB.16.4.1283 [doi]'],,,,PMC231112,['GENBANK/D78261'],,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is unclear if the FAB classification is the best way to describe the individual biology in AML.

With data from the AML cooperative group on one hand and in a kind of meta-analysis with cytogenetic date from different studies on the other hand, we are able to conclude that cytogenetics are much more feasible to describe the biological entity in AML patients.

By virtue of their different pH optima in the reaction buffer, two different topo II activities were found with activity optima at pH 7.9 and at pH 8.9 under high stringency conditions. The activities could be identified as topo II beta activity (pH 7.9) and topo II alpha activity (pH 8.9) by their different sensitivities to topo II alpha inhibitors, dephosphorylation experiments and immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibodies. Seventy-two bone marrow or blood samples from patients with acute myeloid leukemias have been examined and their in vitro sensitivities to anthracyclines and epipodophyllotoxines correlated to the activities of topo II alpha and topo II beta. Although the topo II alpha activity could be directly inhibited by incubation of the cells with the mentioned drugs, no correlation between the topo II alpha activity and the sensitivity of the cells could be found. In contrast, the topo II beta activity which was not substantially inhibited by the drugs inversely correlated with the sensitivity of the cells. These findings were statistically significant for idarubicin (P=0.017) and daunorubicin (P=0.006). Vice versa, resistant cells (IC90 > median) had a higher topo II beta activity. Clinical relevance might be indicated by the finding that cells from patients that relapsed after initial treatment with anthracyclin-containing regiments had a significantly higher topo II alpha/beta activity ratio (P=0.0276). Obviously, the sensitivity of AML cells is substantially influenced by the activity of the resistant topo II (topo II beta) which gives evidence that the remaining topo II activity after treatment helps the cell to survive the DNA repair phase.","['Gieseler, F', 'Glasmacher, A', 'Kampfe, D', 'Wandt, H', 'Nuessler, V', 'Valsamas, S', 'Kunze, J', 'Wilms, K']","['Gieseler F', 'Glasmacher A', 'Kampfe D', 'Wandt H', 'Nuessler V', 'Valsamas S', 'Kunze J', 'Wilms K']","['Medizinische Poliklinik, Medical School, University of Wuerzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'L36H50F353 (Podophyllotoxin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Idarubicin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/*enzymology/physiopathology', 'Podophyllotoxin/*pharmacology', 'Precipitin Tests', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10 Suppl 3:S46-S49.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between 1989 and 1995, P-gp expression was studied in bone marrow blast cells of 322 (239 AML; 83 ALL) acute leukemia patients. 166 AML patients with the AML-6 protocol (EORTC), containing daunorubicin, vincristine and conventional-dose cytarabine (ara-C), and 63 AML patients treated with intermediate-does Ara-C plus amsacrine. Further 71 ALL patients were treated according to a German standard polychemotherapy protocol (BMFT04/1989). P-gp was determined by using monoclonal antibodies C219 and 4E3, and the cutoff point for P-gp overexpression was set at >/= 10%. A significant (P < 0.06) difference in P-gp overexpression was demonstrated between AML (21.6%) and ALL (10.2%) patients at primary diagnosis and between primary diagnosis and relapse/refractoriness in AML (21.6%; 51.0%) and ALL (10.2%; 27.2%) patients. According to FAB classification P-gp overexpression was detected in AML patients significantly (P < 0.05) more frequently in classes M4, M5a and M5b and less frequently in M3, as compared to other types. For AML patients with P-gp overexpression at primary diagnosis or early relapse/refractoriness, the predictive value for nonresponse to the AML-6 protocol was 91 and 95%, respectively, while late-relapsed AML patients with P-gp overexpression had a significantly (P < 0.05) lower predictive value of 73% for nonresponse. Additionally, in refractory and late-relapsed P-gp--overexpressing AML patients treated with intermediate-dose ara-C plus amsacrine the predictive values for nonresponse were 44 and 39%, respectively, significantly (P < 0.05) lower as compared to AML-6 protocol-treated refractory or late-relapsed AML patients. In P-gp-overexpressing treated ALL patients the predictive values of 50 and 55% for non-response were calculated at primary diagnosis and late relapse, respectively. We conclude that P-gp overexpression is a common phenomenon in AML patients at primary diagnosis or relapse, has an inverse influence on AML-6 treatment outcome and should be taken into consideration in the development of new therapy strategies.","['Nussler, V', 'Pelka-Fleischer, R', 'Zwierzina, H', 'Nerl, C', 'Beckert, B', 'Gieseler, F', 'Diem, H', 'Ledderose, G', 'Gullis, E', 'Sauer, H', 'Wilmanns, W']","['Nussler V', 'Pelka-Fleischer R', 'Zwierzina H', 'Nerl C', 'Beckert B', 'Gieseler F', 'Diem H', 'Ledderose G', 'Gullis E', 'Sauer H', 'Wilmanns W']","['Medizinische Klinik III, Klinikum Grobhadern, Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Risk Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation']",1996/07/01 00:00,1996/07/01 00:01,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jul;10 Suppl 3:S23-S31.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its wild-type gone encodes for a protein with pivotal functions: (i) interaction with key players in the cell cycle leading to cell cycle arrest; (ii) induction of programmed call death, or apoptosis. P53 may be seen as another member of the family of proteins involved in resistance to anticancer therapy, since mutations/deletions involving the p53 gene lead frequently to resistance of radiation/cytotoxic drug treatment. Consequently, patients with p53-mutated tumors may harbor a worse prognosis. On the other hand, reintroducing wild-type P53 may lead to an adequate function of the cellular cell cycle and/or apoptosis program, thus enabling efficient anti-cancer therapy even in the presence of mutated P53.

Apparently the equilibrium of bcl-2 and bax hetero- and homodimers is important for the susceptibility of cells for stimuli inducing apoptosis. In this study we determined the role of bcl-2 to bax expression ratio, bcl-xL and ICE expression level for predicting clinical response to chemotherapy in acute myelold leukemia (AML). Bone marrow samples from 14 patients with AML were examined using an immunophosphatase staining method. Initial bone marrow blast portion was over 80% in all cases. Clinical response was defined by bone marrow aspiration 4 weeks after treatment initiation. There was a significant correlation between bcl-2 to bax expression ratio and clinical response (P < 0.005). No patients with a bcl-2/bax ratio >1.0 achieved complete remission after induction therapy. No significant correlation between bcl-2- and p-glycoprotein-expression was observed in this group.

Working Group on Flow Cytometry and Image Analysis.,877-95,"Flow cytometry has become the preferred method for the lineage assignment and maturational analysis of malignant cells in acute leukemias and lymphomas. Multiparametric immunophenotyping allows the detection of aberrant antigen coexpression and the analysis of heterogeneity and clonality of malignant cells in leukemias and lymphomas. The complexity of multiparameter analysis techniques and the multitude of available monoclonal antibodies demand a standardization of protocols for the use of flow cytometry in clinical laboratories in order to achieve interlaboratory reproducibility. Therefore, the Working Group on Flow Cytometry and Image Analysis has started an initiative in order to establish a consensus protocol on the current methods of the phenotyping of hematological neoplasias as a basis for quality assurance and support for upcoming technologies such as quantitative analysis of antigen densities and automated knowledge-based analysis software. In addition to general recommendations on assay procedures and quality control specific recommendations are given for the selection of two-color reagent panels and data interpretation in an attempt to define a basis for cross-evaluation against the different currently established laboratory protocols.","['Rothe, G', 'Schmitz, G']","['Rothe G', 'Schmitz G']","['Institute for Clinical Chemistry, University of Regensburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Guideline', 'Journal Article', 'Practice Guideline']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '9005-49-6 (Heparin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Anticoagulants/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Blood Cells/immunology', 'Cell Separation/instrumentation/methods', 'Coloring Agents', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/*methods/standards', 'Forms and Records Control', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Heparin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/instrumentation/*methods/standards', 'Leukemia/classification/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'Quality Assurance, Health Care', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Sensitivity and Specificity']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):877-95.,,,,['Leukemia. 2000 Feb;14(2):336-7.

In this study, we have established three new human myeloma cell lines (DP-6, KAS-6/1 and KP-6) from patients with aggressive disease. Extensive characterization of these cell lines revealed considerable heterogeneity at several levels. Growth factor responsiveness was initially addressed. Although the potent myeloma cell growth factor, IL-6, induced the proliferation and allowed for the expansion of all three cell lines, a panel of other cytokines elicited heterogeneous responses in each cell line. IL-3, IL-10, IL-11, insulin-like growth factor-I and tumor necrosis factor-alpha also stimulated DNA synthesis in all three cell lines; however, the magnitude of the response was generally lower than that observed in cultures containing IL-6. Transforming growth factor-beta, by contrast, uniformly inhibited the growth of all three cell lines. IL-1alpha and IL-1beta induced the proliferation of the DP-6 cells, but had minimal effects on the KAS-6/1 and KP-6 cells. Interferon (IFN)-alpha stimulated DNA synthesis in the KAS-6/1 cells, but inhibited the proliferation of the DP-6 and KP-6 cells. By comparison, IFN-gamma induced the growth of the KAS-6/1 and DP-6 cells, but inhibited the KP-6 cells. The gp130-associated cytokines, IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M, stimulated the growth of the KAS-6/1 cells, but had minimal effects on the DP-6 and KP-6 cells. The cell lines were also analyzed for IL-6 expression. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that all three cell lines expressed IL-6 mRNA. However, when culture supernatants were tested using a sensitive IL-6 ELISA or IL-6 bioassay only the DP-6 and KP-6 cells were shown to be secreting biologically active IL-6. In summary, although all three of these cell lines were established from myeloma patients, the heterogeneity observed between these cell lines was considerable and may reflect, as well as provide tools to study, the heterogeneity observed in clinical disease.","['Westendorf, J J', 'Ahmann, G J', 'Greipp, P R', 'Witzig, T E', 'Lust, J A', 'Jelinek, D F']","['Westendorf JJ', 'Ahmann GJ', 'Greipp PR', 'Witzig TE', 'Lust JA', 'Jelinek DF']","['Department of Immunology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):866-76.,,,"['CA62228/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA62242/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a consequence of leukaphereses, platelets progressively decreased, reaching the nadir after the last procedure (84-205 x 10(9)/l). A mean of two aphereses (1-3) were performed between day +4 and +7 during which 10 liters of blood were processed each time by a cell separator.

The evaluation of engraftment after transplantation was accomplished by PCR analysis of four hypervariable genomic regions (VNTR) (ApoB, ApoC2, YNZ-22, and MCT 118) which allowed to demonstrate the condition of donor chimaera in all patients after transplantation. As far as the clinical outcome, two patients died of interstitial pneumonitis at day +243 and +69 and two patients died at day +62 and +152 of pulmonary aspergillosis. Four patients remain alive in remission between day +88 and +287 with grade 0-l GVHD.

Suggestions from epidemiological studies that HD may represent an unusual response to infection imply that the lack of previous response could be due to genetic factors. Following recent reports suggesting that there is an increased frequency of HLA-DPB1*0301 in Hodgkins disease, we have studied DPB1 in two series of patients using molecular typing methods. One series is a retrospective group of 118 patients over the age of 15 years from a single centre, and the other is a multi-centre prospective group of 45 patients between the age of 16 and 24 years. In both series, the percentage of HD patients with DPB1*0301 is greater than in the controls, confirming that this seems to be an HD-susceptibility allele. However, extension of the analysis in relation to HD subtype shows that the increase in *0301 is present in nodular sclerosing (NS), mixed cellularity (MC) and lymphocyte predominant patients (LP) HD patients, but preliminary evidence suggests an increase in *0401, and possibly *0501 in MC- and LP-HD. The DPB1 hypervariable region (HVR) amino-acid motif Asp55, Glu56 (*0301-like, HVR-C) is increased in NS compared with non-NS (ie MC+LP), whereas the frequency of Ala55, Ala56 (*0401-like) is increased in non-NS compared with NS. Conversely, Asp84, Glu85Ala86(*0301-like, HVR-F) motif is more frequent in NS than non-NS patients, but there is no increase in Gly84, Gly855, Pro86 (*0401-like). These findings suggest that genetic susceptibility in HD may reside at the level of HVR-encoded DPB1 peptide-binding residues, rather than with a specific allele, and that this may in some way influence the HD subtype.","['Taylor, G M', 'Gokhale, D A', 'Crowther, D', 'Woll, P', 'Harris, M', 'Alexander, F', 'Jarrett, R', 'Cartwright, R A']","['Taylor GM', 'Gokhale DA', 'Crowther D', 'Woll P', 'Harris M', 'Alexander F', 'Jarrett R', 'Cartwright RA']","[""Immunogenetics Laboratory, St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (HLA-DP Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DP beta-Chains)', '0 (HLA-DPB1 antigen)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Cohort Studies', 'England/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'HLA-DP Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DP beta-Chains', 'Hodgkin Disease/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):854-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

German Low-Grade Lymphoma Study Group.",836-43,"The current study was initiated to compare the anti-lymphoma activity and side-effects of prednimustine/mitoxantrone (PmM) vs cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone (COP) in patients with advanced low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in way of a prospective randomized multicenter trial. Two hundred and forty-six patients with stage III or IV centroblastic-centrocytic (CB-CC (Kiel-classification)) or follicle center lymphoma (FCL (REAL classification)) and centrocytic (CC) or mantle-cell-lymphoma (MCL) were randomized for therapy with either PmM or COP and are fully evaluable for response and toxicity. PmM consisted of prednimustine 100 mg/m2/day on days 1-5 and mitoxantrone 8 mg/m2 /day days 1 and 2, while COP comprised cyclophosphamide 400 mg/m2/day on days 1-5, vincristine 1.4 mg/m2/day on day 1 and prednisone 100 mg/m2/day on days 1-5. Both regimens were repeated for a total of six cycles followed by an additional two courses for consolidation in responding cases and a subsequent second randomization for interferon alpha maintenance vs observation only. Overall response rates were comparable with 83% complete and partial remissions after COP and 84% remissions after PmM. PmM revealed a significantly higher rate of complete remissions (36 vs 18%, P < 0.006), the majority being achieved after four courses. The more rapid and possibly also more effective reduction of the lymphoma cell mass by PmM resulted in a tendency to a longer event-free interval for patients achieving remissions after PmM as compared to COP with estimated median event-free intervals of 31 vs 14 months, respectively (P=0.04). Separate analysis of lymphoma subtypes showed a tendency to a lower rate of complete remission in CC or MCL as compared to CB-CC or FCL (16 vs 30%, P=0.12, NS) while overall response rates were in a similar range (81 vs 85%). In both subtypes, PmM induced a higher rate of complete remission while overall response rates were comparable after PmM or COP. Treatment associated side-effects comprised predominantly myelosuppression and granulocytopenia in particular which was more frequently observed after PmM than COP (43 vs 31 %, P < 0.0001). This difference was clinically irrelevant, however, since serious infectious complications were encountered in less than 3% of cycles after both regimens. COP therapy was associated with a significantly higher incidence and degree of hair loss and complete alopecia (31 vs 2%) as well as of peripheral neurotoxicity (23 vs 2%). These data show that both PmM and COP reveal a high anti-lymphoma activity in patients with advanced stage non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. PmM appears advantageous with a higher rate of complete remissions and a better tolerability with regard to secondary side-effects. A longer follow-up is needed to assess the long-term effects of initial treatment on disease-free and overall survival and the impact on additional maintenance therapy with interferon alpha.","['Unterhalt, M', 'Herrmann, R', 'Tiemann, M', 'Parwaresch, R', 'Stein, H', 'Trumper, L', 'Nahler, M', 'Reuss-Borst, M', 'Tirier, C', 'Neubauer, A', 'Freund, M', 'Kreuser, E D', 'Dietzfelbinger, H', 'Bodenstein, H', 'Engert, A', 'Stauder, R', 'Eimermacher, H', 'Landys, K', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Unterhalt M', 'Herrmann R', 'Tiemann M', 'Parwaresch R', 'Stein H', 'Trumper L', 'Nahler M', 'Reuss-Borst M', 'Tirier C', 'Neubauer A', 'Freund M', 'Kreuser ED', 'Dietzfelbinger H', 'Bodenstein H', 'Engert A', 'Stauder R', 'Eimermacher H', 'Landys K', 'Hiddemann W']","['Dept of Hematology and Oncology, University of Gottingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9403SIO2S8 (Prednimustine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'COP protocol 1', 'PmM protocol']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Prednimustine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):836-43.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Primary and cultured Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (H-RS) cells, regarded as the malignant components of Hodgkin's disease (HD), display high levels of the counter-receptors for these ligands, ie CD30, CD40 and 4-1BB. CD30L and CD40L are known to share some biological activities that can be linked to the unbalanced secretion of cytokines seen in HD. In addition, cell contact-dependent molecules such as adhesion or activation antigens are critically involved in T cell/H-RS cell interactions. Primary and cultured H-RS cells frequently overexpress intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1/CD54), BB-1 (B7-1/CD80) and B70/B7-2 (CD86). Here we show that CD30L and CD40L, but not 4-1BBL upregulate CD54 expression by cultured H-RS cells on the mRNA and protein level, as a result of transcriptional gene activation. Furthermore, enhanced CD54 surface expression by these cells is accompanied by increased shedding of surface-bound CD54, as evidenced by high levels of the 82 kDa soluble (s) CD54 form detectable in culture supernatants after specific stimulation. Addition of CD30L in combination with CD40L to cultured H-RS cells additively enhanced CD54 surface expression and its shedding.

The Cpmax with a single dose of ATRA on day 1 of treatment and immediately at CR obtained with continuous ATRA in three cases demonstrated similar values in one patient and an approximately two-fold decrease in two patients. More importantly, compared with a relatively well-matched historic group of 20 APL patients treated with high-dose ATRA, our results suggest that low-dose ATRA is as effective as high-dose in treating APL patients and may provide advantages through decreased hyperleukocytosis and other side-effects.","['Chen, G Q', 'Shen, Z X', 'Wu, F', 'Han, J Y', 'Miao, J M', 'Zhong, H J', 'Li, X S', 'Zhao, J Q', 'Zhu, J', 'Fang, Z W', 'Chen, S J', 'Chen, Z', 'Wang, Z Y']","['Chen GQ', 'Shen ZX', 'Wu F', 'Han JY', 'Miao JM', 'Zhong HJ', 'Li XS', 'Zhao JQ', 'Zhu J', 'Fang ZW', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z', 'Wang ZY']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, China.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adult', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukocytosis/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):825-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found the potent activity to produce internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in a 150 000 g supernatant of cell lysate which was prepared from etoposide-treated HL-60 cells undergoing apoptosis. This nuclear-DNA fragmenting activity could be detected when the supernatant was incubated with isolated nuclei under Mg2+-dependent conditions. On the other hand, we could not detect such activity in the supernatant of cell lysate from non-treated HL-60 cells. Treatment of the supernatant with a serine protease inhibitor, N-tosyl-L-phenylala-nylchloromethyl ketone (TPCK), abolished the DNA fragmenting activity. An inhibitor of interleukin 1-beta-converting enzyme (ICE), Z-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (VAD-FMK), had no effect on this DNA fragmenting activity in vitro. However, when the cells were incubated with etoposide in the presence of VAD-FMK, the formation of TPCK-sensitive DNA fragmenting activity was blocked. Our data indicate that serine and ICE-like proteases may be involved in etoposide-induced apoptosis at the different stages, and especially a serine protease may be closely associated with the final step for induction of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation during apoptosis in HL-60 cells.","['Yoshida, A', 'Takauji, R', 'Inuzuka, M', 'Ueda, T', 'Nakamura, T']","['Yoshida A', 'Takauji R', 'Inuzuka M', 'Ueda T', 'Nakamura T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Serine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '402-71-1 (Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.36 (Caspase 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspase 1', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Cell-Free System', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*physiology', 'Serine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Tosylphenylalanyl Chloromethyl Ketone/pharmacology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):821-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used a long-term co-culture system to analyze the interaction of ALL blasts with components of the marrow microenvironment. Blast cells from 10 cases of precursor-B ALL were cultured on allogeneic human bone marrow stromal layers at 37 degrees C in microtiter wells, and replated when stroma showed evidence of deterioration. Leukemic cells from seven of 10 cases showed evidence of survival and proliferation beyond 30 days in culture, while in three cases there was a progressive decline in the number of viable leukemic cells by 7-21 days. Two cases continued to proliferate for 149 to 332+ days, while five underwent senescence after 34-52 days. In the two cases with long-term proliferation, the leukemic identity of the cells was confirmed by immunophenotyping, cytogenetics, and demonstration of clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. Evidence of selection of leukemic subclones was seen in two cases, with immumophenotypic evidence of loss of CD10 and CD34 antigens, and acquisition of CD20 and surface mu chain. The leukemic cells in these cases grew either in clumps attached to the surface of the stroma, or as'cobblestone areas' beneath the stromal cells. Survival and growth of two evaluable cases was dependent on the continuing presence of stromal cells in the culture system. In one case, direct contact with stroma was shown to be necessary to main- tain viability, while blast cells from the other case survived equally well when separated from the stroma by a 0.4-micron pore size microporous membrane. These results indicate that leu- kemic cells from the majority of cases of precursor-B ALL are able to persist and undergo proliferation in vitro in the presence of normal marrow stroma. This process appears dependent on either direct cell-cell contact, or on diffusible factors derived from the stroma. The availability of ALL cells capable of indefinite proliferation under these conditions will allow further analysis of the mechanisms mediating leukemic cell proliferation.","['Bradstock, K', 'Bianchi, A', 'Makrynikola, V', 'Filshie, R', 'Gottlieb, D']","['Bradstock K', 'Bianchi A', 'Makrynikola V', 'Filshie R', 'Gottlieb D']","['Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Coculture Techniques', '*Connective Tissue Cells', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Time Factors']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):813-20.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the mRNAs of macrophage colony-stimulating factor and stem cell factor, but not that of Interleukin-3, were detectable in all the hematopoietic-supportive and non-supportive stromal cell lines. The transcripts of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, interleukin-7, and leukemia inhibitory factor were expressed in a wide variety of cell lines. Most stromal cell lines synthesized mRNA of c-mpl, the ligand of which stimulates megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. These observations indicate that the pattern of mRNA expression of cytokines is not correlated with the hematopoietic-supportive ability of stromal cell lines.

Some have suggested that the determination of cell lineages involved by the Ph chromosome may be used for distinguishing CML presenting in L-BP (presumably multilineage disease) from Ph+ ALL (presumably lymphoid-restricted), although others have suggested the term 'stem cell ALL' for the multilineage process. Because it has been difficult to perform lineage studies of the Ph chromosome, we investigated the use of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with probes for BCR (on chromosome 22) and ABL (on chromosome 9) to study lineage involvement in Ph+ lymphoblastic malignancies. We analyzed routine blood and marrow specimens from eight patients who presented with Ph+ lymphoblastic leukemia and found that FISH recognized the 9;22 translocation, distinguished between the two common molecular variants, and readily identified multilineage vs lymphoblast-restricted disease. In our series, four patients had multilineage and four had lymphoblast-restricted disease. Multilineage disease was associated with morphologic features of CML at diagnosis and/or reversion to chronic phase CML after treatment leading us to consider it as CML presenting in L-BP. Patients with lymphoid-restricted disease lacked such findings. The survival of three of our four patients with multilineage disease was prolonged, at 25, 28+, and 126+ months, and when data from our entire series are added to those of 18 previously reported cases that were studied for lineage involvement (reviewed in Leukemia 1993; 7: 147), the difference in overall survival between patients with multilineage and lymphoblast-restricted disease is significant (median overall survival of 47 months vs 8 months, respectively; P=0.013, log rank). Our findings illustrate that FISH analysis can be used to recognize lineage involvement in patients presenting with Ph+ lymphoblastic malignancies, and they provide further support to the notion that multilineage and lymphoblast-restricted disease are distinct clinically as well as biologically.","['Anastasi, J', 'Feng, J', 'Dickstein, J I', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Rubin, C M', 'Larson, R A', 'Rowley, J D', 'Vardiman, J W']","['Anastasi J', 'Feng J', 'Dickstein JI', 'Le Beau MM', 'Rubin CM', 'Larson RA', 'Rowley JD', 'Vardiman JW']","['Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, IL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Blast Crisis/genetics/*pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*analysis', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*pathology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):795-802.,,,['CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is not normally expressed in either human or murine hematopoietic cells, but is overexpressed in retrovirus-induced murine myeloid leukemias as well as human myeloid leukemias with 3q26 abnormalities, and thus thought to be responsible for both human and murine leukemogenesis. In this study, possible involvement of the Evi-1 gene in human leukemias was evaluated by Northern blot analysis in a total of 73 patients with various types of leukemias. We found that increased expression of the Evi-1 gene was most frequently observed in patients with CML in blastic crisis. It was found in 10 of 14 (71.0%) samples from CML in blastic crisis, three of 15 (20.0%) from acute myelocytic leukemia, three of 11 (27.3%) from MDS-derived leukemia, and one of 11 (9.1%) from acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Among 18 patients showing increased Evi-1 expression, none of 17 informative patients showed cytogenetic abnormalities involving 3q26. In addition, Southern blot analysis revealed neither amplification nor rearrangements of the Evi-1 gene in 11 Evi-1-positive patients whose DNA samples were available. Our results suggest that increased expression of the Evi-1 gene may play an important role in development of human leukemias, especially in progression from chronic phase to blastic crisis of CML even without 3q26 abnormalities.","['Ogawa, S', 'Kurokawa, M', 'Tanaka, T', 'Tanaka, K', 'Hangaishi, A', 'Mitani, K', 'Kamada, N', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Hirai, H']","['Ogawa S', 'Kurokawa M', 'Tanaka T', 'Tanaka K', 'Hangaishi A', 'Mitani K', 'Kamada N', 'Yazaki Y', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blast Crisis/*genetics', 'Cell Differentiation/genetics', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3/genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA Splicing', '*Transcription Factors']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):788-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the expression pattern of ufo mRNA in a panel of 76 human continuous leukemia-lymphoma cell lines. The gene was not expressed in cell lines derived from lymphoid malignancies (n=28), but transcription was seen in 3/11 myeloid, 0/6 monocytic, 9/13 erythroid and 11/18 megakaryocytic cell lines. Several cell lines were treated with phorbol ester leading to significant upregulation of the ufo message in constitutively positive cells. An apparent ufo mRNA overexpression was not found in any of the positive leukemia cell lines, but was identified in the drug-resistant subclones of the cervix carcinoma cell line HeLa. Southern blot analysis of restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA did not provide evidence for gene amplification, but the HeLa subclones showed banding patterns suggestive of gene rearrangement. Two main ufo mRNA bands of 3.2 and 5.0 kb were identified; no differences in the half-lives (t1/2 = 2.5 h) of these two mRNA species could be identified. In summary, ufo, representing a novel type of receptor tyrosine kinase, is expressed solely in myeloid and erythro-megakaryocytic leukemias but not in lymphoid malignancies. These and previous data suggest an involvement of the ufo receptor tyrosine kinase in normal and malignant myelopoiesis; however, its exact role, if any, and mode of operation in leukemogenesis remains to be determined.","['Challier, C', 'Uphoff, C C', 'Janssen, J W', 'Drexler, H G']","['Challier C', 'Uphoff CC', 'Janssen JW', 'Drexler HG']","['German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (axl receptor tyrosine kinase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Half-Life', 'HeLa Cells/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'KB Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):781-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is physically linked in the surface of B cells to membrane immunoglobulin, forming the B cell antigen receptor complex. Expression of the mb-1 (CD79a) chain has been studied in leukaemias and shown to be present in most B lineage acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL). In contrast, little is known about the expression of B29 (CD79b) in this condition. Two monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) were used in this study by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry: HM57, against an intracellular epitope of the mb-1(CD79a) chain, and SN8, reacting with an extracellular epitope of B29 (CD79b). Our aim was to investigate the expression of B29 (CD79b) in the various immunological subtypes of B lineage ALL and compare its cytoplasmic and membrane expression. Seventy-nine cases were studied, including 13 chronic myeloid leukaemia in B lymphoid blast crisis (CML-BC) and 66 ALL, subclassified as early B (two), common (28), pre-B (23), mature (five) and biphenotypic with B lymphoid commitment (eight). Most cases expressed mb-1 (CD79a) in the cytoplasm. B29 (CD79b) was expressed in the cytoplasm in 65% (15/23) of pre-B-ALL and in 14% (4/28) common-ALL but it was detected in the cell membrane in only three cases of mature B-ALL, being negative in all other B lineage subtypes ALL. Three of the biphenotypic leukaemias coexpressed cytoplasmic B29 (CD79b) and mu-chain. This was also seen in two cases of CML-BC, while four cases expressed only cytoplasmic B29 (CD79b) without mu-chain. Our results suggest that during B cell differentiation, B29 (CD79b) is expressed later than mb-1 (CD79a) in the cytoplasm and parallels the cytoplasmic expression of mu-chain. B29 (CD79b) is present in the membrane at a later stage compared to its cytoplasmic expression and found in mature B blasts (B-ALL) that express membrane Ig as it is in normal and leukaemic B lymphocytes.","['Astsaturov, I A', 'Matutes, E', 'Morilla, R', 'Seon, B K', 'Mason, D Y', 'Farahat, N', 'Catovsky, D']","['Astsaturov IA', 'Matutes E', 'Morilla R', 'Seon BK', 'Mason DY', 'Farahat N', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, The Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD79 Antigens)', '0 (CD79A protein, human)', '0 (CD79B protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'CD79 Antigens', 'Cell Differentiation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):769-73.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we investigated the effect of rIP-10 on different normal and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) progenitor populations. We first studied hematologically normal bone marrow using the delta culture assay, in which marrow low-density cells were incubated in liquid culture with recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rGM-CSF) for 1 week, to allow the differentiation of mature progenitors, and thereafter cultured in methylcellulose in the presence of rGM-CSF and recombinant erythropoietin (rEPO). In this assay rIP-10 significantly inhibited the proliferation of normal marrow hemopoietic progenitors in a dose-dependent fashion. However, when fresh normal marrow cells were cultured in methylcellulose without preincubation in liquid culture, rIP-10 did not affect the growth of colony-forming cells. In contrast, when recombinant c-kit ligand (rKL) was added to rGM-CSF and rEPO, an increment in colony numbers was observed that was eliminated by rIP-10. Similar experiments performed with low-density, non-adherent, T cell-depleted AML marrow cells, obtained from 12 untreated adult AML patients, revealed qualitatively similar results: rIP-10 inhibited the proliferation of AML progenitors in the AML delta assay but did not affect the growth of rGM-CSF-responsive AML colony-forming cells when plated in semisolid media in the presence of rGM-CSF. When rKL was added to rGM-CSF during plating in an effort to recruit additional AML progenitor populations, there was an increment in leukemic blast colony numbers that was eliminated by rIP-10. As observed with normal progenitors, the effect of rIP-10 on these AML progenitors was concentration-dependent, statistically significant and reversible with a rIP-10-neutralizing antiserum. To delineate the mechanism of action of rIP-10 we used the thymidine suicide assay and found that rIP-10 significantly reduced the fraction of leukemic progenitors synthesizing DNA. Our data suggest the rIP-10 inhibits the proliferation of (probably immature) AML progenitor populations by reducing the fraction of cells undergoing DNA synthesis. Additional studies are needed to further elucidate the mechanism of this inhibition and to determine the potential clinical benefits of rIP-10 in future therapies for AML.","['Sarris, A H', 'Talpaz, M', 'Deisseroth, A B', 'Estrov, Z']","['Sarris AH', 'Talpaz M', 'Deisseroth AB', 'Estrov Z']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL10)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'CD13 Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL10', '*Chemokines, CXC', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):757-65.,,,"['P01 CA55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P0CA49639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA58655/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The t(9;22) was suggested to be associated with genomic imprinting of centromeric regions of chromosomes 9 and 22, but the genes directly affected by the translocation, ABL and BCR, were shown not to be imprinted. For most diagnostic and research purposes the BCR-ABL gene can be efficiently identified by reverse-transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR) amplification of its fusion transcripts, which can be quantified by competitive PCR and similar assays for assessment of residual disease in the follow-up of therapy. In the great majority of CML patients the BCR-ABL transcripts exhibit a b2a2 and/or a b3a2 junction; in rare cases, the only detectable BCR-ABL transcripts have unusual junctions, such as b2a3, b3a3, e1a2 or e6a2. There is a recent suggestion that the BCR-ABL gene may not be always 'functional', since extremely low levels of BCR-ABL transcripts can be found in leucocytes from normal individuals and, conversely, it appears that no BCR-ABL transcription can be detected in a proportion of Ph-positive haematopoietic progenitors from some CML patients. The role, if any, of the reciprocal ABL-BCR hybrid gene in CML is unknown. Although its mRNA message is in frame, no ABL-BCR fusion protein has yet been identified in CML patients. The blast crisis of CML has been variably associated with abnormalities of proto-oncogenes, such as RAS and MYC, or of tumour suppressor genes, in particular RB, p53 and p16, or with the generation of chimeric transcription factors, as in the AML1-EVI1 gene fusion. It is likely, therefore, that multiple and alternative molecular defects, as opposed to a single universal mechanism, underlie the acute transformation of the disease.","['Melo, J V']",['Melo JV'],"['Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/pathology', 'Exons/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*genetics/physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, abl', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/physiology', 'Oncogenes', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 May;10(5):751-6.,58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A CCG/NIH study on long-term survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia.,687-90,"In a cohort of 593 long-term survivors of acute lymphocytic leukemia identified through the Children's Cancer Group (CCG), treatment abstracts were obtained and compared to protocol information on radiation therapy and intravenous chemotherapy. This was done in order to evaluate the actual compliance to protocol-specified treatment, and assess if protocol-specified doses can be used in studies of late effects of treatment. The compliance to protocol-specified type of treatment ranged between 95.3% (intrathecal methotrexate) and 98.6% (adriamycin) for chemotherapy, and between 94.1% (cranial radiation) and 97.0% (extended field radiation) for radiation. Concordance with the protocol-specified chemotherapy dose (+/- 25%) was 57.5% for adriamycin, 91.3% for daunomycin, and 48.5% for cyclophosphamide. When concordance was low, most patients received doses that were lower than expected. Concordance with chemotherapy was significantly lower for high-dose regimens than for low-dose regimens. Concordance with protocol-specified radiation dose (+/- 10%) was 87.4% for cranial radiation, 87.8% for spinal radiation, and 85.7% for extended field radiation. Concordance with treatment did not differ by gender, relapse status, or age at diagnosis. In this cohort of leukemia survivors, the validity of type of treatment was greater than the validity of dosage. Great care should be used when drawing conclusions about effects of treatment dosage. Although costly and time consuming, it appears that chart reviews are the most appropriate way to collect information about dose-related effects of therapy.","['Haupt, R', 'Novakovic, B', 'Fears, T R', 'Byrne, J', 'Robinson, L L', 'Tucker, M A', 'Reaman, G H']","['Haupt R', 'Novakovic B', 'Fears TR', 'Byrne J', 'Robinson LL', 'Tucker MA', 'Reaman GH']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, G.

In this article we demonstrate that the binding of PF4 on HEL cells and its inhibitory effect on HEL cell growth were mediated by heparan sulfate. We found that binding of iodine 125-labeled PF4 to HEL cells was inhibited by heparin, heparan sulfate, and dermatan sulfate and to a smaller extent by chondroitin sulfate. Ninety percent of 125I-labeled PF4 bound to HEL cells was released by cells after exposure to heparin and heparan sulfate. Treatment of cells with heparitinase and heparinase induced a decrease in the binding of 125I-labeled PF4 to cells. Binding of 125I-labeled PF4 was partially inhibited by the presence of increasing concentrations of protamine sulfate and basic fibroblast growth factor. To test whether PF4 bound to cell surface proteoglycans, proteoglycan synthesis was inhibited by using 4-methylumbelliferyl-beta-D-xyloside. The binding of 125I-labeled PF4 on treated cells was decreased, and xyloside treatment of cells abrogated the biologic activity of PF4 in a plasma clot culture system. The inhibitory effect of PF4 was retained in a serum-free agar culture system, which indicates that the binding of PF4 to HEL cells induces cell growth inhibition in a direct fashion. Taken together, these findings suggest that PF4 directly acts on HEL cell growth by fixation on heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the HEL cell surface.","['Maurer, A M', 'Han, Z C', 'Dhermy, D', 'Briere, J']","['Maurer AM', 'Han ZC', 'Dhermy D', 'Briere J']","['INSERM U 409, Hopital Beaujon, Clichy, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Lab Clin Med,The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,0375375,"['0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Glycosides)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Protamines)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', '9050-30-0 (Heparitin Sulfate)', 'EC 4.2.2.- (Polysaccharide-Lyases)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/*metabolism', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Glycosaminoglycans/metabolism', 'Glycosides/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Heparitin Sulfate/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Platelet Factor 4/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Polysaccharide-Lyases/metabolism', 'Protamines/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Lab Clin Med. 1996 Apr;127(4):382-90. doi: 10.1016/s0022-2143(96)90186-9.,,"['S0022-2143(96)90186-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-2143(96)90186-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cytoplasmic staining with TIA-1 and TIA-2 was carried out by the immunoalkaline phosphatase anti-alkaline phosphatase technique in 67 cases with a T cell disorder: 31 large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukaemia, nine T-prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), five Sezary syndrome, four peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL), 13 T cell lymphocytosis, and five T-acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL). All had over 75% abnormal T cells which were CD2+, CD3+, CD5+, CD7+, and negative with B cell markers. RESULTS: TIA-1 was positive in 77% cases of LGL leukaemia and half of the PTCL and T-ALL, whereas it was negative in all Sezary syndrome and most T-PLL (8/9) and reactive T-lymphocytosis (10/13). In LGL leukaemia, TIA-1 was positive irrespective of the membrane phenotype, whether CD8+, CD4- or CD4+, CD8-, and was more often positive in cases where cells were CD16+, CD56+, or CD57+. TIA-2 was positive in 60% of cases encompassing all diagnostic types of T cell disorder. There was no correlation between TIA-2 expression and that of other T cell markers, activation antigens, and natural killer markers. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of TIA-1 expression in T cell malignancies may help in the differential diagnosis among LGL leukaemia (high expression), T cell lymphocytosis and other T cell diseases (low expression). As TIA-2 is expressed in over 95% mature T lymphocytes and thymic cells, its assessment may be useful to demonstrate aberrant phenotypes which can be exploited for detecting minimal residual disease.","['Matutes, E', 'Coelho, E', 'Aguado, M J', 'Morilla, R', 'Crawford, A', 'Owusu-Ankomah, K', 'Catovsky, D']","['Matutes E', 'Coelho E', 'Aguado MJ', 'Morilla R', 'Crawford A', 'Owusu-Ankomah K', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Poly(A)-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1)', '0 (TIA1 protein, human)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocytosis/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/*analysis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Poly(A)-Binding Proteins', '*Proteins', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*analysis', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/analysis', 'T-Cell Intracellular Antigen-1']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1996 Feb;49(2):154-8. doi: 10.1136/jcp.49.2.154.,,['10.1136/jcp.49.2.154 [doi]'],,,,PMC500350,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus dose-dependent increases were found both in ectopeptidase activities and in the proportion of cells undergoing apoptosis in HeLa cell monolayers after exposure to UV and other perturbants causing arrest of DNA synthesis (indirectly or directly as a result of DNA damage). The nature of the correlation made no distinction as to whether an increase in peptidase activity was causal of, or consequential to apoptosis, nor whether the increase was a general response by all cells. As a wider approach to understanding the possible role played by ectopeptidases in apoptosis, we report the effect on expression of a known ectopeptidase, aminopeptidase N (CD13), by a myelomonocytic cell line induced to undergo apoptosis. Using THP-1 cultures exposed to low concentrations of ethanol, we used FACS technology to sort for early apoptotic cells that have an increased ability to sequester the vital dye Hoechst 33342 while excluding nonvital dyes. Apoptosis was verified by light, fluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy, and the presence of DNA fragmentation. These early apoptotic cells showed a significant loss in CD13 labeling. Another surface marker, CD33, behaved similarly, whereas CD14 was lost globally, and not just by the apoptotic cells. Peptidase assays confirmed that an aminopeptidase was shed into the bathing media and that this activity was inhibitable both by bestatin and by a CD13 neutralizing monoclonal antibody. In treated cells, there was no evidence for an increase in cell surface protease activity directed toward a highly aliphatic nonapeptide substrate used as a model for TGF-alpha scission from its precursor form. However, other cell surface proteases of different specificity are presumably responsible for the observed shedding of CD13.","['Brown, S B', 'Kluck, R M', 'Ellem, K A']","['Brown SB', 'Kluck RM', 'Ellem KA']","['Queensland Cancer Fund Research Unit, Bancroft Centre, P.O.

The median peripheral blood blast count was 2%. All except 3 cases of erythroleukemia had marrow blast count that exceeded 30% of all nucleated marrow cells. All cases were classifiable with the FAB criteria. FAB classification revealed a preponderance of the M1 category followed by M2 and M6 types. The majority of blasts were type I and the median myeloperoxidase positivity was 14%. Immunophenotyping of bone marrow cells by flow cytometry in 9 cases showed expression of myeloid antigens (CD13, CD33); 6 cases also expressed CD34 antigen. Significant dysplasia involving erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages was seen in most of the cases. Trilineage dysplasia was observed in 5 cases. Median survival of the entire group was 10.5 months. Eleven patients underwent induction therapy consisting of daunorubicin and cytosine arabinoside +/- 6 thioguanine; 8 patients achieved complete remission (72.6%). Remission duration was 14.5 months. Three patients (27.4%) died secondary to infections during induction therapy. Higher frequencies of trilineage dysplasia and FAB M6 type together with low percentage of peripheral blasts and presence of antecedent hematologic disorders suggest that some of these cases might represent the hypocellular form of acute myeloid leukemia with trilineage dysplasia.","['Tuzuner, N', 'Cox, C', 'Rowe, J M', 'Bennett, J M']","['Tuzuner N', 'Cox C', 'Rowe JM', 'Bennett JM']","['Istanbul University, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Turkey.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/epidemiology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'New York/epidemiology', 'Survival Analysis']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1995;9(3-4):195-203.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HDMP was administered orally at a single dose of 20-30 mg/kg/day combined with low-dose cytosine arabinoside (LD Ara-C) (10 mg/m2, 12-hourly s.c.) for 2 weeks. The treatment continued with mitoxantrone (10 mg/m2, i.v.) and Ara-C (5 mg/kg, i.v.) once a week for four doses followed by maintenance chemotherapy.

With the exception of two patients who relapsed 6 and 24 months after remission, treatment could be stopped in others who remained in remission for 36 months without evidence of EMI; 6 months later one of them developed myelodysplastic relapse (RAEB). No side effects related to HDMP treatment were noted, but hyperleukocytosis developed in two patients who initially had high WBC counts.

Three of 188 NHL tumors were homozygous for this change, but they were not identified in 84 CMLs or in 97 normal controls. On the other hand, in one CML case a transition from G to A in codon 64 substituted amino acid threonine for alanine.

Northern blot analysis showed that WEHi-3 cells expressed two types of mts1-specific mRNA: standard (550 nt) and additional (about 800 nt). The steady-state expression level of the 800-nt RNA was isolated and sequence analysis showed that it contained a 357-bp fragment represented by long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences and a 5' untranslated region of the gag gene of the intracisternal A-particle (IAP) element. The chimeric IAP::mts1 800-nt mRNA is initiated from the 5' LTR promoter. The rearranged and normal loci of mts1 were cloned and partially sequenced. The results suggested that the insertion of the IAP sequences into the first intron of mts1 brings the gene under control of the strong IAP promoter. The additional chimeric 800-nt IAP::mts1 RNA transcript was the result of a splicing event linking IAP sequences with the coding part of mts1. We suggest that the chimeric IAP::mts1 RNA is capable of producing a functional Mts1 protein.,"['Tarabykina, S', 'Ambartsumian, N', 'Grigorian, M', 'Georgiev, G', 'Lukanidin, E M']","['Tarabykina S', 'Ambartsumian N', 'Grigorian M', 'Georgiev G', 'Lukanidin EM']","['Danish Cancer Society, Division of Cancer Biology, Copenhagen.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/12 00:00,1996/02/12 00:01,['1996/02/12 00:00'],"['1996/02/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/12 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene. 1996 Feb 12;168(2):151-5. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(95)00742-3.,,"['0378111995007423 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(95)00742-3 [doi]']",,,,,['GENBANK/Z36947'],,,,,,,,,,

We established a cell culture from leukemic cells collected from the aqueous humor of a living patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and glaucoma secondary to the leukemia. We then perfused 16 pairs of fresh cadaver normal human eyes at a constant pressure of 10 mmHg at 37 degrees C. We delivered as a bolus either cultured CLL cells or cultured normal lymphocytes, using 3 x 10(2), 3 x 10(3), 3 x 10(4) or 3 x 10(5) cells in Barany's solution, into one eye of each pair. The other eye of the pair served as a control, receiving a sham bolus of Barany's solution alone. In addition, CLL and normal lymphocytes were perfused through 0.2, 0.6, 2, and 3 microns millipore filters. Following perfusion, the tissue and the filters were examined histopathologically by light, transmission and scanning electron microscopy. Cultured leukemic lymphocytes perfused into normal cadaver eyes caused a significantly more profound reduction in outflow facility than normal lymphocytes (P < 0.05); however, there was no significant difference in the effect on outflow facility between leukemic and normal lymphocytes when they were perfused through the millipore filters. Histopathology confirmed the presence of lymphocytes in the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm's canal, deforming on passage through the inner wall. Our results suggest that leukemic lymphocytes in CLL may reduce outflow facility by means of a biological interaction with the tissues of the outflow pathways, rather than by mechanical obstruction due to a lack of distensibility. Questions remain as to the nature of this biological interaction.","['Schuman, J S', 'Wang, N', 'Eisenberg, D L']","['Schuman JS', 'Wang N', 'Eisenberg DL']","['New England Eye Center, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Exp Eye Res,Experimental eye research,0370707,,IM,"['Aqueous Humor/*cytology', 'Glaucoma/*etiology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/complications/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*pathology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Middle Aged', 'Trabecular Meshwork/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1995/11/01 00:00,1995/11/01 00:01,['1995/11/01 00:00'],"['1995/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Eye Res. 1995 Nov;61(5):609-17. doi: 10.1016/s0014-4835(05)80054-5.,,"['S0014-4835(05)80054-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-4835(05)80054-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Treatment of HL-60 cells with cytochalasin B or botulinum C2 toxin, which leads to the disruption of microfilaments, increased the binding of the stable GTP analogue guanosine 5'[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTPS[S]) to permeabilized cells by about 30%. In contrast, the microtubule-disrupting agents colchicine and vinblastine, and cytochalasin B treatment of isolated HL-60 membranes did not affect GTP[S] binding. The stimulatory effect of cytochalasin B treatment was concentration and time dependent, with maximal increases observed at 5 micrograms/ml cytochalasin B and an incubation time of 10 min, and was counteracted by the F-actin-stabilizing toxin phalloidin. Cytochalasin B treatment increased the amount of G proteins activated by chemoattractant receptors by about 25%. Furthermore, the number of Gi-protein-coupled receptors for the chemoattractant, N-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, was increased by about 25% upon cytochalasin B treatment. Based on these functional data, which suggest an association of G proteins with actin filaments, the Triton X-100 (1%)-insoluble cytoskeleton was analyzed for the presence of G proteins. Gia subunits were detected in the cytoskeleton preparations, both by specific antisera and by pertussis-toxin -catalyzed ADP-ribosylation. Cytochalasin B pretreatment depleted the cytoskeleton in Gialpha, with an approximately 20% concomitant increase in membrane Gialpha content. In conclusion, evidence is presented that part of the cellular Gia is localized at actin filaments in HL-60 cells. After filament disruption, these Gia subunits seem to be translocated to the plasma membrance, where they can productively interact with chemoattractant receptors.","['Meyer zu Heringdorf, D', 'Liedel, K', 'Kaldenberg-Stasch, S', 'Michel, M C', 'Jakobs, K H', 'Wieland, T']","['Meyer zu Heringdorf D', 'Liedel K', 'Kaldenberg-Stasch S', 'Michel MC', 'Jakobs KH', 'Wieland T']","['Institut fur Pharmakologie, Universitatsklinikum Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Peptide)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.4.24.69 (Botulinum Toxins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Botulinum Toxins/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Microfilament Proteins/*metabolism', 'Microtubules/drug effects', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/drug effects/metabolism', 'Receptors, Peptide/drug effects/metabolism']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1996 Feb 1;235(3):670-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.00670.x.,,['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1996.00670.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, incorporation of [3H]delta4Ach into phospholipids clearly precedes incorporation into triacylglycerol, indicating that the phospholipid pool constitutes the primary metabolic fate of the delta4Ach via a remodelling pathway. In contrast, [3H]delta4Ach is incorporated into triacylglycerol almost exclusively via de novo synthesis, as evidenced by studies using propranolol, a phosphatidate phosphohydrolase inhibitor. This compound induced a time-dependent and concentration-dependent increase in the levels of [3H]delta4Ach-containing phosphatidate that is directly correlated with a decrease in the levels of [3H]delta4Ach-containing triacylglycerol. In addition, no change in the levels of [3H]delta4Ach-containing diacylglycerol and monoacylglycerol were apparent along the time course of fatty acid incorporation into triacylglycerol. However, a sharp and transient accumulation of cell-associated free [3H]delta4Ach was detected shortly after exposure of the cells to the radioactive fatty acid.

Differentiation was followed by determining the extent of hemoglobinization and beta-globin gene expression, which are representative measures of red cell maturation. In this study we have shown a delay and decrease in the extent of MEL cell differentiation by MNU exposure at the time of induction to differentiate, even at sub-lethal MNU concentrations. Once the differentiation process was initiated, exposure to MNU at sub-lethal doses showed a significantly smaller effect on the molecular course of events. Pre-treatment of MEL cells with MNU before DMSO induction did not affect differentiation. The MNU-induced delay in differentiation was reflected in the delayed appearance of beta-globin transcripts during the first 12 h post induction.

In addition, the putative loss of wild-type function of CDKN1B and ETV6 could indicate a synergistic effect of both genes in the pathogenesis of this leukemia case.","['Wlodarska, I', 'Baens, M', 'Peeters, P', 'Aerssens, J', 'Mecucci, C', 'Brock, P', 'Marynen, P', 'Van den Berghe, H']","['Wlodarska I', 'Baens M', 'Peeters P', 'Aerssens J', 'Mecucci C', 'Brock P', 'Marynen P', 'Van den Berghe H']","['Center for Human Genetics, Flanders Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology, Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/*genetics', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Jun 1;56(11):2655-61.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the cytotoxicity of and resistance to complex-stabilizing topo II inhibitors, such as etoposide, is thought to be mediated through stabilization of these complexes, the mechanisms of cytotoxicity and resistance to catalytic inhibitors are not well known. To investigate this issue, we established 12 merbarone-resistant cell lines from human leukemia CEM cells, designated CEM/M70-B1 through -B12. Assessed by either growth inhibition or clonogenic assay, these cell lines are 3.5- to 6.6-fold resistant to merbarone, compared to the CEM parent cells. Karyotype analysis of three of the cell lines revealed that while CEM and drug-resistant cell lines had chromosome abnormalities in common, indicating a common origin, two of the merbarone-resistant lines (B1 and B8) each had unique structural markers. These novel cell lines are cross-resistant to complex-stabilizing topo II inhibitors, etoposide, teniposide, amsacrine, and doxorubicin, but not to other catalytic inhibitors, aclarubicin or SN-22995. Of considerable interest, these cell lines are cross-resistant to SN-38, a putative topo I inhibitor, but cross-resistance to other topo I inhibitors (camptothecin and topotecan) was lower and not seen in every cell line. In all 12 cell lines, there was a high correlation among drug resistance ratios between etoposide and teniposide and between merbarone and SN-38. By contrast, there was a low correlation between merbarone and etoposide and between SN-38 and other topo I inhibitors. These results suggest that resistance to merbarone and cross-resistance to etoposide might be through different mechanisms, whereas cross-resistance to SN-38 might be through a merbarone-related mechanism. Etoposide and SN-38 stabilized fewer DNA-topoisomerase complexes in CEM/M70-B cells than in CEM cells, but camptothecin stabilized more. Merbarone inhibited complex formation induced by etoposide in drug-sensitive and -resistant cells, but the degree of inhibition was lower in CEM/M70-B cells than in the parental cells. Moreover, merbarone did not affect complex formation stabilized by SN-38 or camptothecin. Immunoblot analysis of the CEM/M70-B cells showed decreased topo IIalpha, increased topo IIbeta, and no change of topo I protein, compared to CEM cells. We propose the hypothesis that decreased topo IIalpha may play a role in the resistance to merbarone that is different from that to complex-stabilizing drugs. Cross-resistance to catalytic inhibitors may be due to reduced complex formation as a consequence of decreased topo IIalpha. We also found that DNA-protein complexes stabilized by SN-38 might be different from those stabilized by topo II inhibitors and blocked by merbarone. Judging from both the high correlation of drug sensitivities and complex-formation assays, we postulate that mechanisms of cytotoxicity and cross-resistance of SN-38 in CEM/M70-B cells might be similar to those of merbarone. We believe that the CEM/M70-B cells are the first to be selected and characterized for resistance to a catalytic inhibitor of topo II. This study provides novel cell lines with characteristics of resistances to topo II and topo I inhibitors.","['Kusumoto, H', 'Rodgers, Q E', 'Boege, F', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Beck, W T']","['Kusumoto H', 'Rodgers QE', 'Boege F', 'Raimondi SC', 'Beck WT']","[""Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Thiobarbiturates)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', 'YWB9IF596V (merbarone)']",IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Resistance', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Thiobarbiturates/*pharmacology', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Jun 1;56(11):2573-83.,,,"['CA-23099/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-49721/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Patients with leukemia who received fluconazole prophylaxis were compared with a concurrent group of patients not given prophylaxis for fungal organisms. RESULTS: A trend to reduction of oropharyngeal colonization by Candida albicans was seen (p = 0.07) although no significant differences in systemic candidiasis were seen. In patients with documented systemic candidiasis, oral colonization was present and systemic infection was identified after the development of ulcerative oral mucositis. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the potential of fluconazole to reduce oropharyngeal colonization by Candida albicans, however, we did not show prophylaxis of oral candidiasis or systemic candidiasis. These findings and reports of fluconazole-resistant candidal species and a rising number of cases of infection as a result of Candida krusei indicate the need for further studies of prophylaxis of candidal infection in patients who are anticipated to develop profound neutropenia.","['Epstein, J B', 'Ransier, A', 'Lunn, R', 'Chin, E', 'Jacobson, J J', 'Le, N', 'Reece, D']","['Epstein JB', 'Ransier A', 'Lunn R', 'Chin E', 'Jacobson JJ', 'Le N', 'Reece D']","['Department of Dentistry, Vancouver Hospital, BC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod,"Oral surgery, oral medicine, oral pathology, oral radiology, and endodontics",9508562,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '8VZV102JFY (Fluconazole)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Candidiasis, Oral/*prevention & control', 'Dental Care for Chronically Ill/*methods', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Female', 'Fluconazole/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Premedication', 'Statistics, Nonparametric']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol Oral Radiol Endod. 1996 Mar;81(3):291-6. doi: 10.1016/s1079-2104(96)80328-3.,,"['S1079-2104(96)80328-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s1079-2104(96)80328-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The extraordinary stabilities of alpha- and beta-globin mRNAs permit globin proteins to accumulate to substantial levels in these cells, even in the face of physiologic transcriptional silencing. Structural features that determine alpha-globin mRNA stability have recently been identified within its 3'UTR; in contrast, the structural features that determine beta-globin mRNA stability remain obscure. The current study begins to define the structural basis for beta-globin mRNA stability. Two tandem antitermination mutations are introduced into the wild-type human beta-globin gene that permit ribosomes to read into the 3'UTR of the encoded beta-globin mRNA. The readthrough beta-globin mRNA is destabilized in cultured erythroid cells, indicating that, as in human alpha-globin mRNA, an unperturbed 3'UTR is crucial to maintaining mRNA stability. Additional experiments show that the beta-globin and alpha-globin mRNA 3'UTRs provide equivalent levels of stability to a linked beta-globin mRNA coding region, suggesting a parallel in their functions. However, destabilization of the antiterminated beta-globin mRNA is independent of active translation into the 3'UTR, whereas translation into the alpha-globin mRNA 3'UTR destabilizes a linked beta-globin coding region in a translationally dependent manner. This indicates that the alpha- and beta-globin 3'UTRs may stabilize linked mRNAs through distinct mechanisms. Finally, it is shown that neither of the two mutations that, in combination, destabilize the beta-globin mRNA have any effect on beta-globin mRNA stability when present singly, suggesting potential redundancy of stabilizing elements. In sum, the current study shows that a functionally intact beta-globin mRNA 3'UTR is crucial to maintaining beta-globin mRNA stability and provides a level of stability that is functionally equivalent to, although potentially mechanistically distinct from, the previously characterized alpha-globin mRNA 3'UTR stability element.","['Russell, J E', 'Liebhaber, S A']","['Russell JE', 'Liebhaber SA']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/*chemistry/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics', 'Ribosomes/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):5314-23.,,['S0006-4971(20)61234-4 [pii]'],['K11-HL02623/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Children with high levels (> 10(-3) leukemic cells per marrow cell) nearly always relapse, whereas those with low levels (<2 x 10(-5)) seldom do. However, the importance of MRD in adult ALL is unclear. We studied 27 patients aged 14 to 74 who were treated with a standard protocol and who attained morphological remission. MRD in the marrow at first remission was quantified by using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), with the rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain gene as a molecular marker. Levels of MRD varied from 3 x 10(-1) to <7 x 10(-7). The probability of long-term relapse-free survival was significantly related to the level of MRD and only one of nine patients with MRD >10(-3) did not relapse. For patients who did relapse, there was an inverse relationship between MRD level and the length of remission. Overall, MRD in adults in whom a translocation had not been identified was significantly higher than in comparably-treated children, suggesting that ALL in adults is more drug-resistant than in children.","['Brisco, J', 'Hughes, E', 'Neoh, S H', 'Sykes, P J', 'Bradstock, K', 'Enno, A', 'Szer, J', 'McCaul, K', 'Morley, A A']","['Brisco J', 'Hughes E', 'Neoh SH', 'Sykes PJ', 'Bradstock K', 'Enno A', 'Szer J', 'McCaul K', 'Morley AA']","['Department of Hematology, Flinders Medical Center, Bedford Park, Adelaide, South Australia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*mortality/pathology/therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):5251-6.,,['S0006-4971(20)61227-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these rearrangements may be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using VH gene framework III (FRIII) and JH consensus primers. However, about 20% of BCP-ALLs fail to amplify with this technique. To determine the causes of these PCR failures and to investigate any possible association with specific subgroups of disease, we analyzed 72 acute leukemias of defined immunophenotype and cytogenetics, comparing FRIII with VH-family leader-specific PCR methods and Southern blotting. Of 37 BCP-ALL cases, 6 (16.2%) failed totally to amplify with FRIII and JH primers. None of these cases amplified with VH leader primers. Additionally, all cases retained germline VH6 genes and 5 of 11 rearranged alleles amplified with a consensus DH primer, indicating that these rearrangements represented biallelic DH-JH recombinations. Among the 6 FRIII and VH leader PCR-negative BCP-ALL cases, there was no common immunophenotype or consistent cytogenetic abnormality, although all showed structural chromosomal abnormalities and 3 of 5 successfully karyotyped had abnormalities of chromosome 12p. 13 cases with t(9;22)(q34;q11) Philadelphia chromosome-positive [Ph+]) and IGH rearrangements (9 BCP-ALL and 4 biphenotypic cases) were also analyzed. Of 23 rearranged IGH alleles, 19 (82%) were positive by FRIII PCR, and all 4 remaining alleles were amplified by VH leader primers. Use of the leader primers in these Ph+ cases also detected 3 additional clonal rearrangements that were not anticipated from Southern blotting; such unexpected bands were not observed in 21 other Ph- cases. The additional bands represented ""new"" and unrelated VH rearrangements rather than VH-VH replacement events. We conclude that biallelic DHJH rearrangements occur in a subgroup of BCP-ALL; in these cases, the activation of the full VHDHJH recombination mechanism had not occurred. Therefore, these cases of BCP-ALL were arrested at an early stage of B-cell differentiation. In contrast, all Ph+ BCP-ALLs and biphenotypic acute leukemias, which may represent the transformation of multipotent hemopoietic stem cells, had undergone VHDHJH recombination. Of 9 Ph+ BCP-ALL cases, 3 also showed ongoing VHDHJH rearrangement, reflecting the persistent expression of the VHDHJH recombinase. Finally, sequence analysis of 33 rearranged VHDHJH genes showed that only 3 including 2 Ph+ BCP-ALL maintained an intact open-reading frame. Loss of the open-reading frame occurred not only because of out-of-frame VHDH and DHJH joining, but also because of VH gene mutation and deletion. These data show that most BCP-ALLs may represent the neoplastic transformation of BCPs destined to die in the bone marrow.","['Height, S E', 'Swansbury, G J', 'Matutes, E', 'Treleaven, J G', 'Catovsky, D', 'Dyer, M J']","['Height SE', 'Swansbury GJ', 'Matutes E', 'Treleaven JG', 'Catovsky D', 'Dyer MJ']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Haddow Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research-Royal Marsden Hospital, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clone Cells/chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Leukemia/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):5242-50.,,['S0006-4971(20)61226-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Id proteins have been reported generally to function as inhibitors of cell differentiation, and their gene expression is often downregulated during cell differentiation. We examined the expression of human Id mRNAs by Northern hybridization in 11 human myeloid cell lines, several myeloid cell lines induced to differentiate, fresh myeloid leukemia samples, and normal human myeloid cells. Id2 mRNA was expressed in myelomonoblastic and monoblastic leukemic cells (PLB-985, THP-1, and U-937) but was weakly expressed in myeloblastic leukemic cells (KG-1 and HL-60). Id2 mRNA levels markedly increased with induction of differentiation of myeloid blasts (HL-60, PLB-985, THP-1, and U-937) toward either granulocytes or macrophages. Examination of fresh acute myeloid leukemic samples from 22 individuals also showed prominent Id2 mRNA expression in those samples having more differentiated blasts. Using the French-American-British classification, only 2 of 8 M0/M1 samples expressed Id2 mRNA; however, 10 of 13 M2/M3/M4 samples expressed it. In normal human myeloid cells, Id2 mRNA was expressed in cultured macrophages from bone marrow and in mature granulocytes and monocytes from peripheral blood. The half-life of Id2 mRNA was short (1 hour), and its expression was inducible by cessation of protein synthesis. Id3 mRNA was moderately expressed in monoblastic cell lines (THP-1 and U-937), and levels decreased with their differentiation. Almost no Id3 expression was detectable in either other myeloid leukemia lines, fresh leukemic samples, or normal human myeloid cells by Northern analyses. Id1 mRNA was not detected by polymerase chain reaction in either leukemic or normal myeloid cells except in K562 myeloid/erythroid cells. These results showed that Id2 mRNA was constitutively expressed in more mature myeloid blast cells and level markedly increased with terminal myeloid differentiation, suggesting that Id2 protein may inhibit an HLH transcriptional complex that normally represses myeloid differentiation.","['Ishiguro, A', 'Spirin, K S', 'Shiohara, M', 'Tobler, A', 'Gombart, A F', 'Israel, M A', 'Norton, J D', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Ishiguro A', 'Spirin KS', 'Shiohara M', 'Tobler A', 'Gombart AF', 'Israel MA', 'Norton JD', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ID2 protein, human)', '0 (Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Differentiation Protein 2', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Repressor Proteins', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):5225-31.,,['S0006-4971(20)61224-1 [pii]'],"['CA 26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neither p210 nor p190 BCR-ABL transcripts were detected in normal healthy adults (n = 20). The numbers of p190 transcripts determined by competitive PCR in patients with CML were low compared with the numbers of p210 transcripts. The median numbers of p210 and p190 transcripts per unit volume of cDNA in positive samples were 1.0 x 10(5) (range, 15 to 1.4 x 10(6)) and 10 (range, 10 to 2.9 x 10(3)), respectively. The numbers of p190 and p210 transcripts were significantly correlated in individual samples (r = .65, P < .001). The median number of p210 BCR-ABL transcripts was significantly lower in samples negative for p190 BCR-ABL transcripts than in samples in which p190 BCR-ABL transcripts were identified (3.1 x 10(3)[n = 73] v 1.0 x 10(5)[n = 115]; P < .0001). The median ratio of p190 to p210 BCR-ABL mRNA was not significantly different between chronic phase CML (1.9 x 10(-4)) and CML in blast crisis (1.7 x 10(-4)). The median ratio in p210 ALL was also low (1.9 x 10(-3)) but significantly higher than that of CML. We conclude that pl90 BCR-ABL transcripts are frequently present at a low level in p210 BCR-ABL-positive leukemias. p190 mRNA may arise through alternative or missplicing and its presence is probably of no pathogenetic significance.","['van Rhee, F', 'Hochhaus, A', 'Lin, F', 'Melo, J V', 'Goldman, J M', 'Cross, N C']","['van Rhee F', 'Hochhaus A', 'Lin F', 'Melo JV', 'Goldman JM', 'Cross NC']","['LRF Centre for Adult Leukaemia, Department of Haematology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/classification/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):5213-7.,,['S0006-4971(20)61222-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All three THLs exhibited clinical and morphologic features of malignancy. Neoplastic cells in the THLs had abundant eosinophilic vacuolated cytoplasm and pleomorphic nuclei, and expressed histiocytic antigens in the absence of lymphocyte-specific lineage markers.

An anti-CD3 activated human CD4+ T-cell clone was found to induce significant call proliferation in four of nine BCP-ALL samples analyzed. In one of these cases, the T-cell effect was clearly dependent on interaction between CD40 and its ligand. Accordingly, a more thorough analysis was performed on this particular leukemia (case 461, adult early pre-B-ALL, mBCR+, Philadelphia+, i(9q)+). Thus, autologous CD4+ T cells isolated from the patient were also able to induce CD40-dependent proliferation of the leukemic blasts. Analysis of the phenotype after coculture showed that, among the CD19+ cells, a proportion gradually lost expression of CD10 and CD34, whereas some cells acquired CD23. In addition, and in contrast with normal BCP, activated T cells promoted maturation of a subset of the case 461 leukemic cells into surface IgM+ cells. The leukemic origin of the cycling and the maturing cells was assessed by the presence of i(9q), a chromosomal abnormality associated with this leukemia and evidenced by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Taken together, these results show that leukemic BCP can be activated via CD40 but that not all cases display detectable stimulation in response to T cells despite their expression of CD40. In addition, the present data suggest that CD4+ T cells could potentially play a role in the physiology of BCP-ALL.","['Renard, N', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff, M', 'Durand, I', 'Duvert, V', 'Coignet, L', 'Banchereau, J', 'Saeland, S']","['Renard N', 'Lafage-Pochitaloff M', 'Durand I', 'Duvert V', 'Coignet L', 'Banchereau J', 'Saeland S']","['Schering-Plough Laboratory for Immunological Research, Dardilly, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD40 Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, CD19/analysis', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'CD40 Antigens/*drug effects/physiology', 'CD40 Ligand', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/immunology', 'Neprilysin/analysis', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/biosynthesis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):5162-70.,,['S0006-4971(20)61215-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have now investigated the molecular basis of this phenomenon. Soluble monoclonal antibody (MoAb) to CD18 inhibited 75% of K562-induced DNA fragmentation and membrane disruption, whereas blocking MoAb to Fas partially inhibited only the DNA fragmentation. MoAbs to CD2, CD11a, CD11b, B7, or CD16 had limited or no effect on K562-induced death of LAK cells. Receptor ligation with either immobilized MoAb to CD18 or Fas induced membrane disruption and DNA degradation in LAK cells independently of K562, and MoAb to CD18, CD11a, or CD11b enhanced DNA fragmentation induced by anti-Fas. Fas-L-transfected Raji cells also killed LAK cells, but only if Fas-L expression was amplified. K562 cells rapidly triggered protein phosphorylation in LAK cells, and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Herbimycin A, inhibited DNA fragmentation and membrane disruption. Protease inhibitors strongly suppressed K562-mediated DNA fragmentation of LAK cells, but not membrane disruption. In conclusion, (1) K562-induced death of LAK cells involves primarily CD18, although other molecules, such as Fas, may also be involved; (2) K562-mediated apoptosis of LAK cells requires tyrosine phosphorylation and protease activity; (3) engagement of Fas by immobilized MoAb or Fas-L on target cells can also kill LAK cells; and (4) Fas-immobilized MoAb synergizes with coimmobilized MoAb to CD11a, CD11b, or CD18 for LAK cell killing. Activation-induced death of NK cells may represent a mechanism for NK cell regulation.","['Yamauchi, A', 'Taga, K', 'Mostowski, H S', 'Bloom, E T']","['Yamauchi A', 'Taga K', 'Mostowski HS', 'Bloom ET']","['Division of Cellular and Gene Therapies, Center for Biologics Evaluation Research, Food and Drug Administration.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD/immunology/physiology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Benzoquinones', 'CD18 Antigens/immunology/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases/metabolism', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'DNA/analysis', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*cytology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/physiology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Serine Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):5127-35.,,['S0006-4971(20)61211-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This ecto-ST is effective in reconstituting different surface glycoconjugates on desialylated B cells in the presence of exogenous CMP-NeuAc. We found that this ecto-ST is distinct in its activity from soluble ST released into the culture supernatant. Surface sialylation was independent of the amount of ST secreted into the culture supernatant and followed different kinetics than sialylation of exogenous substrate by soluble ST. Four human B-cell lines representing different maturation stages were analyzed for secreted and ecto-ST activity. The myeloma cell line U266 and the lymphoblastoid cell line JOK-1 showed higher activity of both ST forms than the acute lymphoblastic leukemia B-cell line Nalm-6. ST activity in culture supernatants of U266, JOK-1, and Nalm-6 cells consisted predominantly of the alpha 2,6 ST type with specificity for N-linked oligosaccharides. As an exception, the myeloma cell line IM-9, deficient of alpha 2,6 ST activity, secreted only small amounts of ST and showed low activity of ecto-ST. Sialylation of surface-expressed glycoconjugates by ecto-ST was measured by incubating B-cell lines in the presence of fluorescent CMP-sialic acid. Surface structures labeled with fluorescent sialic acid under this condition were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy and fluorescent label was quantitatively assessed by flow cytometric analysis on live cells. Incubation of cells in acidified culture medium, to release possibly receptor-bound ST, did not alter the intensity of cell surface sialylation. Inhibition of internalization and membrane traffic by various approaches (reduced incubation temperature and chloroquine or brefeldin A treatment) did not block surface sialylation. Together, these observations point to cell surface sialylation in B lymphocytes mediated by a cell surface-expressed ecto-ST distinct from the secreted ST form. On desialylated JOK-1 cells, ecto-ST in the presence of exogenous CMP-NeuAc was able to resialylate the B-cell surface sialoglycans CDw75 and HB-6 and major surface glycoproteins of B cells, such as HLA class I and II antigens, transferrin receptor, and surface IgM. In contrast, cell surface glycans of coincubated desialylated erythrocytes were not sialylated by the B-cell ecto-ST. Ecto-alpha 2,6 ST of B cells may be involved in the sialylation of distinct differentiation glycan antigens.","['Gross, H J', 'Merling, A', 'Moldenhauer, G', 'Schwartz-Albiez, R']","['Gross HJ', 'Merling A', 'Moldenhauer G', 'Schwartz-Albiez R']","['Institut fur klinische Chemie, Universitatsklinikum, Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Neuraminic Acids)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '3063-71-6 (Cytidine Monophosphate N-Acetylneuraminic Acid)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)', 'EC 2.4.99.- (Sialyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.99.1 (beta-D-galactoside alpha 2-6-sialyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.99.4 (beta-galactoside alpha-2,3-sialyltransferase)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/*enzymology', 'Brefeldin A', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/chemistry', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology', 'Cytidine Monophosphate N-Acetylneuraminic Acid/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Glycosylation/drug effects', 'HLA-D Antigens/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Neuraminic Acids/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/drug effects', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/metabolism', 'Sialyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):5113-26.,,['S0006-4971(20)61210-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The significance of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules at this stage of development is unknown. As a first stop of inquiry into their function, we have characterized the profile of major self-peptides bound to the HLA-DR molecules expressed by KG-1 cells, a line that shares many of the phenotypic characteristics of colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage progenitors. Searches of protein data bases showed that all matching peptides bound to the HLA-DR molecules of KG-1 cells corresponded to intracellular, rather than exogenous or transmembrane, precursor proteins. Because the absence of a conventional self-peptide repertoire could be related to altered trafficking of class II molecules, the biosynthesis of HLA-DR and the invariant chain proteins was determined. The MHC class II associated invariant chain protein is synthesized normally in KG-1 cells, but processed fragments of invariant chain, class II-associated invariant chain peptides (CLIPs), occupy the antigen-binding groove of KG-1 class II molecules at a much lower frequency compared with that of mature antigen-presenting cells. Low CLIP occupancy of HLA-DR is a characteristic shared by KG-1 cells, normal CD34+ progenitor cells, and HLA-DR+ breast carcinoma cells. The unusual profile of MHC class II bound peptides and the low level of CLIP bound to HLA-DR suggest that the antigen-processing pathway of KG-1 is different from that characterized in professional antigen-presenting cells and that exogenous antigen-processing may be a developmentally acquired characteristic in the myeloid lineage.","['Harris, P E', 'Maffei, A', 'Colovai, A I', 'Kinne, J', 'Tugulea, S', 'Suciu-Foca, N']","['Harris PE', 'Maffei A', 'Colovai AI', 'Kinne J', 'Tugulea S', 'Suciu-Foca N']","['Department of Pathology, College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (invariant chain)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Autoantigens/biosynthesis/*isolation & purification', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Female', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology/metabolism', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Fluid/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/biosynthesis/*isolation & purification', 'Self Tolerance', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):5104-12.,,['S0006-4971(20)61209-5 [pii]'],['R01 AI 25210-09/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to analyze the regulation of human heme oxygenase-1 gene expression under thermal stress. The amounts of heme oxygenase-1 protein were not increased by heat shock (incubation at 42 degrees C) in human alveolar macrophages and in a human erythroblastic cell line, YN-1-0-A, whereas heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) was noticeably induced. However, heat shock factor does bind in vitro to HHO-HSE and the synthetic HHO-HSE by itself is sufficient to confer the increase in the transient expression of a reporter gene upon heat shock. The deletion of the sequence, located downstream from HHO-HSE, resulted in the activation of a reporter gene by heat shock. These results suggest that HHO-HSE is potentially functional but is repressed in vivo. Interestingly, heat shock abolished the remarkable increase in the levels of heme oxygenase-1 mRNA in YN-1-0-A cells treated with hemin or cadmium, in which HSP70 mRNA was noticeably induced. Furthermore, transient expression assays showed that heat shock inhibits the cadmium-mediated activation of the heme oxygenase-1 promoter, whereas the HSP70 gene promoter was activated upon heat shock. Such regulation of heme oxygenase-1 under thermal stress may be of physiologic significance in erythroid cells.","['Okinaga, S', 'Takahashi, K', 'Takeda, K', 'Yoshizawa, M', 'Fujita, H', 'Sasaki, H', 'Shibahara, S']","['Okinaga S', 'Takahashi K', 'Takeda K', 'Yoshizawa M', 'Fujita H', 'Sasaki H', 'Shibahara S']","['Department of Applied Physiology and Molecular Biology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat Shock Transcription Factors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '00BH33GNGH (Cadmium)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)', 'EC 1.14.14.18 (Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing))']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Cadmium/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/*enzymology', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Heat Shock Transcription Factors', 'Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing)/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Luciferases/biosynthesis', 'Macrophages, Alveolar/*enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):5074-84.,,['S0006-4971(20)61206-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two possible sources for their biosynthetic origin are endogenous synthesis in megakaryocytes or endocytosis from plasma. Using ultrastructural and confocal laser scanning microscopic (CLSM) image analysis, we observed that treatment of Dami cells, a human megakaryocytic cell line, with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) induces the accumulation of PAI-1 and Vn in intracellular storage vacuoles that contain other alpha-granule proteins such as von Willebrand factor. To examine evidence for biosynthesis of PAI-1 and Vn by Dami cells, we immunoprecipitated PAI-1 and Vn from the conditioned media of cells biosynthetically radiolabeled with 35S-methionine in the presence or absence of PMA. In contrast to Hep G2 cells, which synthesize both PAI-1 and Vn, only 35S-PAI-1 was recovered from PMA-treated Dami cells. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis of RNA extracted from resting and PMA-treated Dami cells confirmed that PAI-1 mRNA expression was detectable at low levels in resting cells and induced by PMA treatment. In contrast, Vn mRNA was not detected. We examined binding and internalization (endocytosis) of PAI-1 and Vn by Dami cells using biotinylated analogs (b-PAI-1 and b-Vn). Flow cytometry analysis indicated that the binding of b-Vn to Dami cells was dose-dependent, saturable, and specific for multimeric forms of Vn. Cells were incubated at 4 degrees C or 37 degrees C and endocytosis of b-Vn was shown by probing electrophoretically fractionated cell lysates with 125I-labeled streptavidin. Only cells incubated at 37 degrees C internalized b-Vn. CLSM image analysis confirmed that the b-Vn was internalized and that it colocalized with PAI-1 in storage granules. The binding of b-Vn to cells was inhibited by the presence of PAI-1, and there was no evidence of specific b-PAI-1 binding or uptake to resting or PMA-treated cells. These data suggest that accumulation of PAI-1 in Dami cell storage granules is due to endogenous synthesis and that the accumulation of Vn is due to endocytosis of serum-derived Vn.","['Hill, S A', 'Shaughnessy, S G', 'Joshua, P', 'Ribau, J', 'Austin, R C', 'Podor, T J']","['Hill SA', 'Shaughnessy SG', 'Joshua P', 'Ribau J', 'Austin RC', 'Podor TJ']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Vitronectin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*metabolism', '*Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vacuoles/metabolism', 'Vitronectin/*metabolism']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):5061-73.,,['S0006-4971(20)61205-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, whether intensive induction therapy should be continued in the presence of profound myelosuppression is an important question. The Children's Cancer Group (CCG) conducted a prospective randomized trial in which 589 patients with AML were randomized at diagnosis to one of two induction approaches involving a 4-day cycle of five active chemotherapeutic agents, with the second cycle administered either 10 days after the first cycle, despite low or dropping blood counts (intensive timing), or 14 days or later from the beginning of the first cycle, depending on bone marrow status (standard timing). All patients achieving remission received a total of four cycles of induction therapy. They were then allocated to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) if a compatible family donor was present or randomized to aggressive nonmyeloablative therapy or to myeloablative therapy with purged autologous BMT rescue. The three postremission arms remain coded. Induction success and median days to complete induction were similar for the 295 patients randomized to the intensive timing arm (75%, 99 days) compared with the 294 patients randomized to the standard timing arm (70%, 105 days; P = .18 for remission). However, a marked improvement in outcome was demonstrated in patients randomized to the intensive timing arm, with an actuarial event-free survival at 3 years of 42% +/- 7% (95% confidence interval [CI]) versus 27% +/- 6% for patients on the standard timing arm (P = .0005). Disease-free survival results at 3 years from the end of induction were superior for patients receiving intensively timed induction therapy (N = 211), 55% +/- 9% versus 37% +/- 9% for standard timing patients (N = 195, P = .0002), with a median follow-up from achieving remission of 28 months. Superior results were documented for patients receiving intensive timing irrespective of the postremission therapy to which they were allocated. Intensively timed induction therapy for patients with AML markedly improves event-free survival, even for patients undergoing myeloablative therapy with BMT rescue. Without controlling for the type of induction therapy received, results of various BMT studies in AML comparing different preparative regimens will be difficult to interpret.","['Woods, W G', 'Kobrinsky, N', 'Buckley, J D', 'Lee, J W', 'Sanders, J', 'Neudorf, S', 'Gold, S', 'Barnard, D R', 'DeSwarte, J', 'Dusenbery, K', 'Kalousek, D', 'Arthur, D C', 'Lange, B J']","['Woods WG', 'Kobrinsky N', 'Buckley JD', 'Lee JW', 'Sanders J', 'Neudorf S', 'Gold S', 'Barnard DR', 'DeSwarte J', 'Dusenbery K', 'Kalousek D', 'Arthur DC', 'Lange BJ']","['University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DCTER protocol']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/chemically induced/therapy', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):4979-89.,,['S0006-4971(20)61196-X [pii]'],"['CA 02971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 17829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, among these negative regulators in cell cycle control, only 4 have been shown to be consistently involved in the development of human cancers as tumor suppressors: Rb (Retinoblastoma susceptibility protein), p53, and two recently identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, p16INK4A/MTS1 and p15INK4B/MTS2. Because there are functional interrelations among these negative regulators in the cell cycle machinery, it is particularly interesting to investigate the multiplicity of inactivations of these tumor suppressors in human cancers, including leukemias/lymphomas. To address this point, we examined inactivations of these four genes in primary lymphoid malignancies by Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism analyses. We also analyzed Rb protein expression by Western blot analysis. The p16INK4A and p15INK4B genes were homozygously deleted in 45 and 42 of 230 lymphoid tumor specimens, respectively. Inactivations of the Rb and p53 genes were 27 of 91 and 9 of 173 specimens, respectively. Forty-one (45.1%) of 91 samples examined for inactivations of all four tumor suppressors had one or more abnormalities of these four tumor-suppressor genes, indicating that dysregulation of cell cycle control is important for tumor development. Statistical analysis of interrelations among impairments of these four genes indicated that inactivations of the individual tumor-suppressor genes might occur almost independently. In some patients, disruptions of multiple tumor-suppressor genes occurred; 4 cases with p16INK4A, p15INK4B, and Rb inactivations; 2 cases with p16INK4A, p15INK4B, and p53 inactivations; and 1 case with Rb and p53 inactivations. It is suggested that disruptions of multiple tumor suppressors in a tumor cell confer an additional growth advantage on the tumor.","['Hangaishi, A', 'Ogawa, S', 'Imamura, N', 'Miyawaki, S', 'Miura, Y', 'Uike, N', 'Shimazaki, C', 'Emi, N', 'Takeyama, K', 'Hirosawa, S', 'Kamada, N', 'Kobayashi, Y', 'Takemoto, Y', 'Kitani, T', 'Toyama, K', 'Ohtake, S', 'Yazaki, Y', 'Ueda, R', 'Hirai, H']","['Hangaishi A', 'Ogawa S', 'Imamura N', 'Miyawaki S', 'Miura Y', 'Uike N', 'Shimazaki C', 'Emi N', 'Takeyama K', 'Hirosawa S', 'Kamada N', 'Kobayashi Y', 'Takemoto Y', 'Kitani T', 'Toyama K', 'Ohtake S', 'Yazaki Y', 'Ueda R', 'Hirai H']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Cycle/*genetics', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Female', 'G1 Phase/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma', '*Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multiple Myeloma/genetics/pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 15;87(12):4949-58.,,['S0006-4971(20)61193-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PNH clone is thus expected to exhibit some neoplastic features.

Theoretical considerations, based on calculated aromaticities of the uracil and thiouracil rings, suggest that lack of substrate activity of 2,4-dithio-dUMP may result from increased pyrimidine ring aromaticity of the latter, leading to resistance of C(6) to nucleophilic attack by the enzyme active center cysteine.","['Dzik, J M', 'Bretner, M', 'Kulikowski, T', 'Golos, B', 'Jarmula, A', 'Poznanski, J', 'Rode, W', 'Shugar, D']","['Dzik JM', 'Bretner M', 'Kulikowski T', 'Golos B', 'Jarmula A', 'Poznanski J', 'Rode W', 'Shugar D']","['Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warszawa, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"[""0 (1-(2-deoxyribofuranosyl)-2,4-dithio-5-fluorouracil-5'-phosphate)"", ""0 (1-(2-deoxyribofuranosyl)-2,4-dithiouracil-5'-phosphate)"", '0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '039LU44I5M (Floxuridine)', '134-46-3 (Fluorodeoxyuridylate)', ""964-26-1 (2'-deoxyuridylic acid)"", 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.- (Phosphotransferases)', 'EC 2.7.1.77 (nucleoside phosphotransferase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Deoxyuracil Nucleotides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Floxuridine/pharmacology', 'Fluorodeoxyuridylate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Structure', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Thionucleotides/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/07 00:00,1996/03/07 00:01,['1996/03/07 00:00'],"['1996/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1996 Mar 7;1293(1):1-8. doi: 10.1016/0167-4838(95)00219-7.,,"['0167-4838(95)00219-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4838(95)00219-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Homogeneous, 190 000 MTDNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase isolated from mouse erythroleukemia cells has turnover constants of 0.15-0.59 h-1 with single-stranded and unmethylated double-stranded oligonucleotides containing a single CpG dinucleotide. These substrates were designed to mimic DNA transcriptional cis elements previously reported to have cytosine C-5-methylated regulation. The rate-limiting step for these substrates is the methylation step itself. In contrast, hemimethylated double-stranded substrates show burst kinetics, consistent with a rapid methylation event (3 h-1) followed by a slower step which determines steady-state Kcat. Hemimethylated and unmethylated double-stranded DNA shows similar binding affinities; these results reveal the molecular basis for the enzyme's preference for hemimethylated DNA to be the methyl transfer step. Substrates with multiple recognition sites do not show burst kinetics and have turnover rate constants of 6 h-1. Catalytic turnover for the mammalian enzyme is thus approximately 10-fold slower than that for the related bacterial enzymes. Our combined results show quantitatively that one enzyme is certainly capable of both maintenance and de novo methylation and that maintenance of the genomic methylation pattern is preferred over the de novo establishment of new patterns. Direct comparison of the mammalian enzyme with the bacterial DNA cytosine-C5 methyltransferase, M.SssI, indicates dramatic differences in preferences for single-stranded, double-stranded, and hemimethylated double-stranded substrates. Moreover, the specificity hierarchy shown for the M.SssI is derived from very different changes in K(m) and catalysis than those observed for the mammalian DCMTase. These results demonstrate that the M.SssI, and perhaps other DNA cytosine methyltransferases from bacteria, is functionally dissimilar to the mammalian enzyme.","['Flynn, J', 'Glickman, J F', 'Reich, N O']","['Flynn J', 'Glickman JF', 'Reich NO']","['Department of Chemistry, University of California, Santa Barbara 93106, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (Dinucleoside Phosphates)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Polydeoxyribonucleotides)', ""2382-65-2 (cytidylyl-3'-5'-guanosine)"", '25853-45-6 (poly d(I-C))', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', 'EC 2.1.1.37 (DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Composition', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA (Cytosine-5-)-Methyltransferases/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Dinucleoside Phosphates', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Mammals', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemical synthesis/*metabolism', 'Polydeoxyribonucleotides', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'S-Adenosylmethionine', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/11 00:00,1996/06/11 00:01,['1996/06/11 00:00'],"['1996/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 1996 Jun 11;35(23):7308-15. doi: 10.1021/bi9600512.,,"['10.1021/bi9600512 [doi]', 'bi9600512 [pii]']",['GM 46333/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Considering that adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) represents a T-lymphocytic proliferative disorder similar to CTCL, it is likely that PUVA therapy is effective for treating ATL. We applied PUVA therapy to a 53 year old man with acute (i.e. crisis)-type ATL associated with generalized erythematous papules, and succeeded in achieving a complete remission (CR). To elucidate the mechanism of PUVA therapy in this case, we compared ultrastructures of leukemic cells obtained before and after PUVA therapy by electron microscopy, and found that PUVA therapy caused apoptosis in leukemic cells in the peripheral blood. In this paper, the antitumor mechanism of PUVA is discussed, and its efficacy is emphasized.","['Takemori, N', 'Hirai, K']","['Takemori N', 'Hirai K']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Asahikawa Kosei General Hospital, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Hum Cell,Human cell,8912329,,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukocytes/*physiology/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged', '*PUVA Therapy']",1995/09/01 00:00,1995/09/01 00:01,['1995/09/01 00:00'],"['1995/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Cell. 1995 Sep;8(3):121-6.,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we describe the development of a cell model that reflects the resistance levels that are likely to be found clinically. We then investigated the methods used to detect MDR1 expression at these low levels of drug resistance. We demonstrated that the immunological and PCR-based methods are unable to detect increased MDR1 expression in cells with a < 5.2- and 6.5-fold increase in vinblastine resistance, respectively, in our drug-resistant sublines. The rhodamine 123 (Rh 123) efflux assay was able to discriminate the vinblastine-sensitive parent cells from all the vinblastine-resistant sublines, including cells with a 1.7-fold increase in resistance. However, this assay is non-specific to the MDR1 gene and may detect the activity of other drug efflux proteins such as the MDR-associated protein (MRP).

In ABMT recipients (matched paired 530 x 2) with ALL CR-1, AML CR-1 and AML intermediate disease, transplant-related mortalities (TRM) relapse incidence (RI) and leukaemia-free survival (LFS) did not differ significantly in patients treated with BU/CY or CY/TBI.

In BMT recipients of bone marrow from HLA-identical siblings (matched paired 391 x 2), the TRM, RI and LFS did not differ significantly between the two treatments in all groups. In particular, the 2-year LFS in patients with AML CR-1 was 64 +/- 3% in those treated with BU/CY (n = 237) compared to 66 +/- 3% in those given CY/TBI (n = 237). In all groups the findings were confirmed in a multivariate analysis of prognostic factors. Veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver (P < 0.05) and haemorrhagic cystitis (P < 0.001) was more common in the BU/CY group compared to the CY/TBI group for ABMT and BMT patients.

Alterations at the short arm of chromosome 9 have been reported in a remarkable percentage of acute lymphoblastic leukaemias (ALL) and have been suggested to cause the loss of activity of the putative TSG, p16INK4A (MTS1/CDKN2) gene. In order to evaluate the correlation between this gene inactivation and visible cytogenetic abnormalities, we have investigated p16INK4A homozygous gene deletions in 10 paediatric acute leukaemias of different cell lineages which demonstrated karyotype aberrations involving chromosome 9. Moreover, the dimension of the genetic alteration was evaluated by studying the loss of heterozygosity of two highly polymorphic markers of chromosome 9p, namely alpha-interferon (IFNA) and D9S104, and the deletion of 5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAPase) gene. Finally, the deletion of a gene belonging to p16INK4A family, the p18 gene, was analysed in these acute leukaemias. Our results demonstrated that: (1) the biallelic loss of p16INK4A gene is strictly related to a specific immunophenotype, namely ALL of T-cell lineage; (ii) no significant correlation exists between alterations at chromosome 9p level and the homozygous deletions of p16INK4A gene; and (iii) p18 gene was not deleted in the examined cases. These findings suggest a possible correlation between the T-lymphocyte phenotype and the expression of p16INK4A gene. Moreover, the absence of MTAPase activity seems to be a valuable marker of p16INK4A gene inactivation, thus indicating that the deleted chromosomal area on 9p21 very frequently involves the MTAPase gene.","['Faienza, M F', 'della Ragione, F', 'Basso, G', 'Coppola, B', 'Miraglia del Giudice, E', 'Schettini, F', 'Iolascon, A']","['Faienza MF', 'della Ragione F', 'Basso G', 'Coppola B', 'Miraglia del Giudice E', 'Schettini F', 'Iolascon A']","[""Dipartimento di Biomedicina dell'Eta Evolutiva, Universita di Bari, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)""]",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/genetics']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jun;93(3):632-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1674.x.,,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1674.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In BMT between HLA-identical pairs this CD4-mediated GVL would require CML cells to process and present antigens through MHC class II molecules. To investigate whether CML cells are capable of processing and presenting antigens, and suitable targets for CD4+ T-cell-mediated cytotoxicity, we generated HLA-DR1-restricted CD4+ cytotoxic T-cell clones that specifically recognized tuberculous purified protein derivative (PPD). We have shown that CML cells and B lymphoblastoid cell line (B-LCL) cells but not PHA-blasts from patients with CML processed exogenous antigen, PPD, and induced proliferative and cytotoxic CD4+ T-cell responses. Antigen presentation was blocked by antibodies to HLA-DR but not to MHC class I and by treatment with chloroquine and brefeldin. This indicates that CML cells use a classic MHC class II antigen processing pathway to present PPD antigens to CD4+ T cells. Cytotoxicity to CML was shown by antibody blocking studies to be mediated mainly through fas antigen. These findings indicate that donor CD4+ T cells alone are sufficient to mediate GVL effects following allogeneic BMT for CML.","['Jiang, Y Z', 'Mavroudis, D', 'Dermime, S', 'Hensel, N', 'Couriel, D', 'Molldrem, J', 'Barrett, A J']","['Jiang YZ', 'Mavroudis D', 'Dermime S', 'Hensel N', 'Couriel D', 'Molldrem J', 'Barrett AJ']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Hematology Branch, NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '20350-15-6 (Brefeldin A)', '886U3H6UFF (Chloroquine)']",IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Brefeldin A', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Chloroquine/pharmacology', 'Cyclopentanes/pharmacology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Reaction', 'HLA-DR Antigens/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*immunology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'fas Receptor/immunology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jun;93(3):606-12. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1676.x.,,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1676.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This enabled us to investigate cell lineage involvement in three malignant conditions: MDS (n = 12), leukaemia-transformed MDS (LT-MDS) (n = 5) and de novo AML (n = 7). In MDS we found blasts and often significant proportions of mature granulocytic and erythroid cells to be cytogenetically abnormal. Percentages of granulocytic and erythroid cells with cytogenetic aberrations were generally less than those of blasts. These data support the involvement of a transformed pluripotent stem cell that has retained maturation abilities. In two patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMMoL) the clonal involvement of monocytes was predominant. Results in the five patients with LT-MDS were similar to those in MDS. In the bone marrow of five of the seven de novo AML patients the cytogenetic abnormalities were restricted to the blasts and did not include the more mature granulocytic or erythroid populations. In the other two patients with AML, both with a t(8;21) and a loss of the Y chromosome, high percentages of mature neutrophils were cytogenetically abnormal. These patterns of clonal lineage involvement in MDS, LT-MDS, t(8;21) AML and AML appear typical and may be of clinical use, for example, for distinguishing LT-MDS from de novo AML in newly presenting patients.","['van Lom, K', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Vandekerckhove, F', 'Smit, E M', 'Lowenberg, B']","['van Lom K', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Vandekerckhove F', 'Smit EM', 'Lowenberg B']","['Department of Haematology, University Hospital, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Erythroblasts/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*pathology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jun;93(3):594-600. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1692.x.,,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1692.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The availability of PTK inhibitors prompted us to evaluate the effects of genistein, a natural inhibitor of PTKs, on in vitro colony formation by normal multilineage colony-forming units (CFU-Mix), erythroid bursts (BFU-E), granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), long-term culture-initiating cells (LTC-IC) and acute myelogenous leukaemia colony-forming units (CFU-AML). Continuous exposure of normal marrow and blood mononuclear non-adherent cells, blood CD34+CD45RA- cells, and leukaemic blasts to increasing doses of genistein (1-100 microM) resulted in a statistically significant (P < or = 0.05) dose-dependent suppression of CFU-Mix, BFU-E, CFU-GM and CFU-AML growth. Regression analysis showed that growth inhibition was linearly related to genistein concentration. Genistein dose causing 50% inhibition (ID50) of CFU-AML was significantly lower compared to CFU-GM ID50 for marrow (19 v 32 microM, P < or = 0.017), unseparated blood (19 v 44 microM, P < or = 0.028) or CD34+CD45RA- blood (19 v 36, P < or = 0.04). Preincubation of leukaemic blasts with genistein (200 microM) for 1-2h confirmed that CFU-AML were significantly more sensitive than normal marrow and blood CFU-GM to genistein. Preincubation conditions which maximally suppressed leukaemic and normal colony growth spared a substantial percentage of marrow (29 +/- 4%) and blood (40 +/- 3%) LTC-IC. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that: (a) genistein strongly inhibits the growth of normal and leukaemic haemopoietic progenitors; (b) growth inhibition is dose- and time-dependent; (c) leukaemic progenitors are more sensitive than normal progenitors to genistein-induced growth inhibition; (d) genistein exerts a direct toxic effect on haemopoietic cells while sparing a substantial proportion of LTC-IC. The potent CFU-AML growth inhibition associated with the relative resistance of normal LTC-IC strongly supports the use of genistein for marrow purging.","['Carlo-Stella, C', 'Regazzi, E', 'Garau, D', 'Mangoni, L', 'Rizzo, M T', 'Bonati, A', 'Dotti, G', 'Almici, C', 'Rizzoli, V']","['Carlo-Stella C', 'Regazzi E', 'Garau D', 'Mangoni L', 'Rizzo MT', 'Bonati A', 'Dotti G', 'Almici C', 'Rizzoli V']","['Department of Haematology, Bone Marrow Transplantation Centre, University of Parma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Isoflavones)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Genistein', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jun;93(3):551-7. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1694.x.,,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1694.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effect of the supernatant from a bone marrow stroma cell line, KM-101, on the chemotaxis of human malignant plasma cell lines to assess the chemotaxis-regulatory roles of the bone marrow microenvironment. Five human malignant plasma cell lines, FR4ds, OPM-1ds, U266/B1, RPMI-8226 and ARH-77 showed different profiles of the expression of beta 1 integrins of FN and LN receptors. FR4ds, OPM-1ds and U266/B1 cells showed chemotaxis promoted by FN (ChFN) and LN (ChLN). ARH-77 cells showed ChFN but not ChLN. RPMI-8226 cells did not show either ChFN or ChLN. The supernatant from KM-101 cells inhibited the chemotaxis of each of these cell lines regardless of whether the chemotaxis was promoted by FN or LN. Among the cytokines produced by KM-101 cells, it was postulated that IL-6 mediated this inhibitory effect because anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody (MoAb) and anti-IL-6 receptor MoAb significantly reversed the inhibition. Recombinant IL-6 (rIL-6) also exhibited a similar inhibitory effect. Because anti-gp130 MoAb significantly reversed the chemotaxis inhibitory effect of rIL-6, the inhibitory signal is probably transduced via the signal transducing receptor component, gp130. The chemotaxis-regulatory effect is another previously unrecognized function of this pleiotropic cytokine, IL-6. High levels of IL-6 in the bone marrow microenvironment of patients with multiple myeloma appears to be favourable for the localization of myeloma cells there.","['Shibayama, H', 'Tagawa, S', 'Hattori, H', 'Harigaya, K', 'Taga, T', 'Machii, T', 'Kitani, T']","['Shibayama H', 'Tagawa S', 'Hattori H', 'Harigaya K', 'Taga T', 'Machii T', 'Kitani T']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Osaka University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Fibronectin)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Receptors, Laminin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chemotaxis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Plasmacytoma/metabolism/*pathology', 'Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fibronectin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6', 'Receptors, Laminin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 Jun;93(3):534-41. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1691.x.,,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.d01-1691.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in the intracytoplasmic domain may result in the uncoupling of these two processes, as in acute leukaemia, and such alterations could occur either as isoforms or mutations. We have studied the transmembrane domain and intracytoplasmic tail of the G-CSFR in RNA from blood or bone marrow of 11 haematologically normal controls and 40 patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). Two novel transcripts of the receptor were identified, both were minor components and are unlikely to be of major physiological significance. We could find no evidence for altered levels of expression of these transcripts in the AML patients. In addition, only one point mutation was detected in the 40 patients screened by RT-PCR-SSCP, a C-->A substitution at nucleotide 2088 which changes a threonine to asparagine in the transmembrane domain and is probably a polymorphism.

The results suggest that the occupancy of the internal volume by cells after prolonged cultivation is largely due to the growth of cells that are deposited in the interior as opposed to the migration of cells from the external surface into the interior. This method of observing cell behavior in a three-dimensional structure may find applications in other three-dimensional cell culture systems.

Both GM-CSF and G-CSF, currently approved for clinical use, are generally well tolerated by the majority of patients during short term administration. Constitutional symptoms and bone pain are the most frequently reported adverse effects, but they are rarely treatment-limiting. Reactivation of rheumatoid symptoms, and exacerbation of autoimmune thyroiditis or autoimmune haematological disorders have sometimes been described. Severe cardiovascular complications include the possibility for arterial thromboses and the vascular leak syndrome, which is more specifically observed with GM-CSF. Reports of several cases and small series of patients have suggested that growth factors might increase the pulmonary toxicity of chemotherapy, a possibility that remains debated and requires further attention. Generalised or local cutaneous reactions are frequently noted with GM-CSF. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis was observed with both growth factors, while neutrophilic dermatoses have been mostly described with G-CSF. Exacerbation of psoriasis and isolated anaphylactic reactions have appeared with GM-CSF and G-CSF. The hepatotoxic potential of the growth factors is not clearly established, but the occurrence of coagulation abnormalities has recently been reported. Renal and biological disturbances are usually transient. Long term treatment with GM-CSF and G-CSF also seems to be well tolerated, but the possible occurrence of several adverse events, i.e. bone disorders, leukaemia, unmasking or acceleration of underlying disease, require further investigation in patients receiving prolonged treatment, as in myelodysplasia. Finally, antibodies against growth factors have been reported only with GM-CSF. Other cytokines are still under investigation. Flu-like and constitutional symptoms, sometimes dose-limiting, have been reported with IL-1, IL-3, IL-4 and IL-6, while M-CSF was occasionally associated with such adverse effects. More specific adverse events, also frequently considered as dose-limiting toxicities, include hypotension with IL-1, severe headache or skin rash with IL-3, and nasal congestion and gastroduodenal lesions with IL-4. Severe capillary leak syndrome has been reported only with IL-4. M-CSF toxicity is minimal and limited to reversible but sometimes dose-limiting thrombocytopenia and ophthalmological symptoms with the recombinant product. Again, the safety of long term administration of these cytokines has not yet been determined, and IL-3-induced disease progression in myelodysplastic patients has been suggested.","['Vial, T', 'Descotes, J']","['Vial T', 'Descotes J']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie et Toxicologie Medicale, INSERM U80.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Drug Saf,Drug safety,9002928,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Cytokines/*adverse effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/adverse effects', 'Interleukin-3/adverse effects', 'Interleukin-4/adverse effects', 'Interleukin-6/adverse effects', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects']",1995/12/01 00:00,1995/12/01 00:01,['1995/12/01 00:00'],"['1995/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Saf. 1995 Dec;13(6):371-406. doi: 10.2165/00002018-199513060-00006.,236,['10.2165/00002018-199513060-00006 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transport at 40 muM [3H]methotrexate was separated by inhibitors into two components comprising 62 and 38% of total transport activity. The predominant route was inhibited by low concentrations of indoprofen (Ki=2.5 muM, 4-biphenylacetic acid (Ki=5.3 muM), and flurbiprofen (Ki=5.2 muM, whereas the second component showed a high sensitivity to the glutathione conjugates of bromosulfophthalein (Ki=0.08 muM), ethacrynic acid (Ki=0.52 muM, and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (Ki=0.77 muM). Bilirubin ditaurate was a potent inhibitor of both transport components (Ki=1.5 and 0.17 muM, respectively). Separation of transport activities without interference from the other route was achieved by adding an excess (100 muM) of either the glutathione conjugate of ethacrynic acid or biphenylacetic acid. Double-reciprocal plots of transport at various substrate concentrations gave Km values of 170 and 250 muM for methotrexate transport via the anion-sensitive and conjugate-sensitive routes, respectively. A comparison of inhibitor specificities indicated that the anion-sensitive transport activity in vesicles represents efflux system II for methotrexate in intact cells and is the same system identified previously in vesicles as an anion/anion conjugate pump. The conjugate-sensitive activity corresponds to efflux system I for methotrexate in intact cells and is the same system identified in vesicles as the high-affinity glutathione conjugate pump.","['Saxena, M', 'Henderson, G B']","['Saxena M', 'Henderson GB']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Anions)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Anions/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ion Transport/physiology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*metabolism', 'Mice']",1996/04/12 00:00,1996/04/12 00:01,['1996/04/12 00:00'],"['1996/04/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/12 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 Apr 12;51(7):974-82. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00051-2.,,"['0006-2952(96)00051-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00051-2 [doi]']",['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the onset of nephrotic syndrome, the patient remained in a hematological remission. A renal biopsy showed diffuse mesangial proliferation with marked glomerular infiltration of macrophages and massive subendothelial and mesangial deposits. After the institution of the combined therapy with corticosteroid, anticoagulant, and dipyridamole, urinary protein excretion was attenuated to less than 1.0 g/day. It should be emphasized that the recurrence of nephrotic syndrome was observed after the following chemotherapy, including M-CSF, whereas the bone marrow still remained completely remitted. In contrast, after the last course of chemotherapy, which did not include M-CSF, urinary protein excretion was not enhanced. Of note is that the renal histology at autopsy showed a remarkable improvement of mesangial hypercellularity with concomitant reduction in the number of glomerular macrophages. These evolutional changes in both proteinuria and glomerular histology suggest a close linkage between the M-CSF treatment and macrophage-related glomerular injury. The possibility can be raised that M-CSF accelerated the underlying renal disease in this case through enhancing macrophage accumulation into the glomerulus, leading to the development of nephrotic syndrome.","['Omura, K', 'Kawamura, T', 'Utsunomiya, Y', 'Abe, A', 'Joh, K', 'Sakai, O']","['Omura K', 'Kawamura T', 'Utsunomiya Y', 'Abe A', 'Joh K', 'Sakai O']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Jikei University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Kidney Dis,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,8110075,['81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kidney Glomerulus/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/drug therapy/*etiology/pathology', 'Remission Induction']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Kidney Dis. 1996 Jun;27(6):883-7. doi: 10.1016/s0272-6386(96)90527-2.,,"['S0272-6386(96)90527-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0272-6386(96)90527-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Assessment, education, emotional support, monitoring of complications, and provision of help to the patient with fatigue to prioritize activities and plan periods of rest are important supportive care measures.","['Utley, S M']",['Utley SM'],"['Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232-2415, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Oncol Nurs,Seminars in oncology nursing,8504688,,IM,"['Humans', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes/classification/diagnosis/etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Patient Care Planning', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Oncol Nurs. 1996 Feb;12(1):51-8. doi: 10.1016/s0749-2081(96)80018-0.,56,"['S0749-2081(96)80018-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s0749-2081(96)80018-0 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTAP is abundant in normal cells but is deficient in many cancers. Recently, the genes for the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p16 and p15 have been localized to the short arm of human chromosome 9 at band p21, where MTAP and interferon alpha genes (IFNA) also map. Homozygous deletions of p16 and p15 are frequent malignant cell lines. However, the order of the MTAP, p16, p15, and IFNA genes on chromosome 9p is uncertain, and the molecular basis for MTAP deficiency in cancer is unknown. We have cloned the MTAP gene, and have constructed a topologic map of the 9p21 region using yeast artificial chromosome clones, pulse-field gel electrophoresis, and sequence-tagged-site PCR. The MTAP gene consists of eight exons and seven introns. Of 23 malignant cell lines deficient in MTAP protein, all but one had complete or partial deletions. Partial or total deletions of the MTAP gene were found in primary T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL). A deletion breakpoint of partial deletions found in cell lines and primary T-ALL was in intron 4. Starting from the centromeric end, the gene order on chromosome 9p2l is p15, p16, MTAP, IFNA, and interferon beta gene (IFNB). These results indicate that MTAP deficiency in cancer is primarily due to codeletion of the MTAP and p16 genes.","['Nobori, T', 'Takabayashi, K', 'Tran, P', 'Orvis, L', 'Batova, A', 'Yu, A L', 'Carson, D A']","['Nobori T', 'Takabayashi K', 'Tran P', 'Orvis L', 'Batova A', 'Yu AL', 'Carson DA']","['The Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, and Department of Medicine, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, 92093-0663, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)""]",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Artificial, Yeast', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes', 'Genetic Linkage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*enzymology', 'Pseudogenes', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/deficiency/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/11 00:00,1996/06/11 00:01,['1996/06/11 00:00'],"['1996/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Jun 11;93(12):6203-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.12.6203.,,['10.1073/pnas.93.12.6203 [doi]'],['U01 CA64976/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC39214,"['GENBANK/L40432', 'GENBANK/L42627', 'GENBANK/L42635']",,,,,,,,,,

We report here the ATRA-induced gene expression in a cell line (NB4) derived from a patient with APL. By differential display-PCR, we isolated and characterized a novel gene (RIG-E) whose expression is up-regulated by ATRA. The gene is 4.0 kb long, consisting of four exons and three introns, and is localized on human chromosome region 8q24. The deduced amino acid sequence predicts a cell surface protein containing 20 amino acids at the N-terminal end corresponding to a signal peptide and an extracellular sequence containing 111 amino acids. The RIG-E coded protein shares some homology with CD59 and with a number of growth factor receptors. It shares high sequence homology with the murine LY-6 multigene family, whose members are small cysteine-rich proteins differentially expressed in several hematopoietic cell lines and appear to function in signal transduction. It seems that so far RIG-E is the closest human homolog of the LY-6 family. Expression of RIG-E is not restricted to myeloid differentiation, because it is also present in thymocytes and in a number of other tissues at different levels.","['Mao, M', 'Yu, M', 'Tong, J H', 'Ye, J', 'Zhu, J', 'Huang, Q H', 'Fu, G', 'Yu, L', 'Zhao, S Y', 'Waxman, S', 'Lanotte, M', 'Wang, Z Y', 'Tan, J Z', 'Chan, S J', 'Chen, Z']","['Mao M', 'Yu M', 'Tong JH', 'Ye J', 'Zhu J', 'Huang QH', 'Fu G', 'Yu L', 'Zhao SY', 'Waxman S', 'Lanotte M', 'Wang ZY', 'Tan JZ', 'Chan SJ', 'Chen Z']","['Key Laboratory of Human Genome Research and Shangai Institute of Hematology, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (LY6E protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Antigens, Surface', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/11 00:00,1996/06/11 00:01,['1996/06/11 00:00'],"['1996/06/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/11 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/11 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Jun 11;93(12):5910-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.12.5910.,,['10.1073/pnas.93.12.5910 [doi]'],['CA59936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC39161,['GENBANK/U42376'],,,,,,,,,,

HMBA has been shown to induce differentiation of neoplastic cells in patients, but is not an adequate therapeutic agent because of dose-limiting toxicity. We report on a group of three potent second generation hybrid polar compounds, diethyl bis-(pentamethylene-N,N-dimethylcarboxamide) malonate (EMBA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), and m-carboxycinnamic acid bis-hydroxamide (CBHA) with optimal concentrations for inducing MEL cells of 0.4 mM, 2 microM, and 4 microM, respectively, compared to 5 mM for HMBA. All three agents induce accumulation of underphosphorylated pRB; increased levels of p2l protein, a prolongation of the initial G1 phase of the cell cycle; and accumulation of hemoglobin. However, based upon their effective concentrations, the cross-resistance or sensitivity of an HMBA-resistant MEL cell variant, and differences in c-myb expression during induction, these differentiation-inducing hybrid polar compounds can be grouped into two subsets, HMBA/EMBA and SAHA/CBHA.

Previous results suggest that after RNA-directed DNA synthesis, fragments of RNA remain annealed to the newly synthesized DNA [DeStefano et al.(1991) J. Biol.Chem. 266, 7423-7431]. These must be removed to allow synthesis of the second DNA strand. We measured the ability of HIV-, AMV- and MuLV-RT to coordinate DNA-dependent DNA synthesis and removal of downstream segments of RNA. The substrates employed were DNA templates having upstream DNA and downstream RNA primers. We found that none of the wild type RTs elongated the upstream DNA without simultaneous degradation of the RNA. Consistent with these results, HIV-, AMV- and MuLV-RT showed relatively higher affinity for RNA than for DNA oligonucleotides bound to a DNA template. Differences were observed in the RNA degradation and DNA extension patterns generated by the different RTs. AMV-RT degraded the RNA to segments 11-12 nt long, and readily elongated the upstream DNA to the end of the template. MuLV- and HIV-RT degraded the RNA primarily to segments 15-16 nt long. At low concentrations of the latter two RTs, the DNA primer stalled when it encountered the 5'-end of the RNA. In sufficient excess, all of the RTs elongated the upstream primer without stalling. Even though we were unable to detect displacement of the downstream RNA by the wild type RTs, MuLV- and HIV-RT lacking RNase H, were able to elongate the upstream DNA to the end of the template without degradation of the RNA. This suggests that degradation of downstream pieces of RNA is not absolutely required before synthesis of the plus strand DNA. The implications of these findings for viral replication are discussed.","['Fuentes, G M', 'Fay, P J', 'Bambara, R A']","['Fuentes GM', 'Fay PJ', 'Bambara RA']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Rochester,School of Medicine and Dentistry, NY 14642, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA primers)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', 'EC 3.1.26.4 (Ribonuclease H)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Myeloblastosis Virus/enzymology/genetics/physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'DNA Replication/*genetics', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis/genetics', 'HIV/enzymology/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/enzymology/genetics/physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/enzymology/genetics/*physiology', 'Ribonuclease H/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Virus Replication/*genetics']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1996 May 1;24(9):1719-26. doi: 10.1093/nar/24.9.1719.,,"['6a0012 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/24.9.1719 [doi]']","['1F 31 GM 17200-01/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 49573/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC145840,,,,,,,,,,,

N-hydroxypyridine-4-thione (4-HPT) and N-hydroxyacridine-9-thione (HAT), were tested for their potency to induce DNA damage in L1210 mouse leukemia cells and in isolated DNA from bacteriophage PM2. DNA single-strand breaks and modifications sensitive to various repair endonucleases (Fpg protein, endonuclease III, exonuclease III, T4 endonuclease V) were quantified. Illumination of cell-free DNA in the presence of 2-HPT and 4-HPT gave rise to damage profiles characteristic for hydroxyl radicals, i.e. single-strand breaks and the various endonuclease-sensitive modifications were formed in the same ratios as after exposure to established hydroxyl radical sources. In contrast, HAT plus light gave rise to a completely different DNA damage profile, namely that characteristic for singlet oxygen. Experiments with various scavengers (t-butanol, catalase, superoxide dismutase) and in D2O as solvent confirmed that hydroxyl radicals are directly responsible for the DNA damage caused by photoexcited 2-HPT and 4-HPT, while the damage by HAT plus light is mediated by singlet oxygen and type I reactions. The type of DNA damage characteristic of hydroxyl radicals was also observed in L1210 mouse leukemia cells when treated with 2-HPT plus light or with H2O2 at 0 degrees C. t-Butanol (2%) inhibited the cellular DNA damage by approximately 50%. A dose of 2-HPT plus light that generated single-strand breaks at a frequency of 5 x 10(-7)/bp was associated with 50% cell survival. No DNA damage and cytotoxicity was observed after treatment with 2-HPT in the dark. We propose that 2-HTP and 4-HTP may serve as new agents to study the consequences of DNA damage induced by hydroxyl radicals in cells.

The suppression of transcription from human T-cell leukemia virus promoter by Lck was independent of the presence of the enhancer core sequences within the long terminal repeat. The suppression of transcription was observed with Lck mutants that had either diminished or enhanced tyrosine-kinase activity. A mutant lacking the myristylation site also suppressed transcription. From the analysis with various deletion mutants of Lck, it was suggested that Src-homology domain 2 (SH2) is both necessary and sufficient for the suppression of transcription. A similar effect was also observed with the SH2 domain of the v-src gene. Thus, overexpression of Lck could suppress gene expression through a unique function of the SH2 domain.","['Ohta, M', 'Nagai, H', 'Nyunoya, H', 'Shimotohno, K']","['Ohta M', 'Nagai H', 'Nyunoya H', 'Shimotohno K']","['Virology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FOXN2 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Transcription Factors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Forkhead Transcription Factors', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Phosphorylation', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'src Homology Domains/*genetics/physiology', 'src-Family Kinases/*genetics/metabolism']",1996/03/07 00:00,1996/03/07 00:01,['1996/03/07 00:00'],"['1996/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Mar 7;12(5):989-97.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A possible mechanistic basis for Mxi1-mediated repression was provided by the recent demonstration that the repressive potential of Mxi1 correlates with its ability to physically associate with mSin3B, one of two mammalian homologues of the yeast transcriptional repressor SIN3. Here, we sought to characterize more fully the physical properties of the second homologue, mSin3A and to determine whether the recruitment of mSin3A by Mxi1 is indeed required for anti-Myc activity. Transient transfection of mammalian cells showed that the mSin3A protein can associate with the strong repressive isoform of Mxi1 (Mxi1-SR) and that, like other Myc superfamily members, both mSin3A and Mxi1-SR localize to the nucleus. From a developmental standpoint, a comparative analysis of Myc, Mxi1-SR and Sin3A expression during postnatal mouse development and in differentiating mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells revealed that dramatic and reciprocal changes in Myc and Mxi1-SR mRNA levels are accompanied by minimal stage-specific changes in mSin3A gene expression. This constant expression profile, coupled with the observation that over-expression of mSin3A does not augment the anti-Myc activity of Mxi1-SR in the rat embryo fibroblast (REF) transformation assay, suggests that mSin3A is not a limiting factor in the regulation of Myc superfamily function. Finally, a mSin3A-Mxi1 fusion protein, in which the amino terminal mSin3-interacting domain of Mxi1-SR was replaced with the full-length mSin3A, exhibited a level of repression activity equivalent to, or greater than, the level of repression obtained with Mxi1-SR. Taken together, these observations directly demonstrate that the amino-terminal repression domain of Mxi1-SR functions solely to recruit mSin3A and possibly other proteins like mSin3A and this association is necessary for the anti-Myc activity of Mxi1-SR.","['Rao, G', 'Alland, L', 'Guida, P', 'Schreiber-Agus, N', 'Chen, K', 'Chin, L', 'Rochelle, J M', 'Seldin, M F', 'Skoultchi, A I', 'DePinho, R A']","['Rao G', 'Alland L', 'Guida P', 'Schreiber-Agus N', 'Chen K', 'Chin L', 'Rochelle JM', 'Seldin MF', 'Skoultchi AI', 'DePinho RA']","['Department of Cell Biology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, New York 10461, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MXI1 protein, human)', '0 (Mxi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Mxi1 protein, rat)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Repressor Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription Factors/chemistry/*metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/03/07 00:00,1996/03/07 00:01,['1996/03/07 00:00'],"['1996/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Mar 7;12(5):1165-72.,,,"['2T32AG00194/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', '5R37CA16368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RT32CA-09173/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,['GENBANK/U22394'],,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis was induced with a camptothecin analogue, 9-amino-20(s)-camptothecin, or a purine analogue, fludarabine. Cell death was monitored by propidium iodide staining and FACS analysis. Drug-induced apoptosis in B-CLL cells was p53-independent. Immunoblot analysis of bcl-2 and bax expression revealed a correlation between drug-induced apoptosis and the ratio of endogenous levels of bcl-2 to bax proteins. B-CLL cells with none to low bcl-2/bax ratios were drug-sensitive as compared to cells with intermediate to high ratios that were drug-resistant (P = 0.015). Prior to drug treatment, bax protein migrated as a single species of 21 kDa. Following drug-induced apoptosis, anti-bax specific protein complexes of 36-42 kDa were up-regulated. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, bax complexes were disrupted under reducing conditions to reveal homo- and heterodimers of 18 and 21 kDa suggesting that disulfide interactions were required for complex formation. The de novo appearance of the 18 kDa anti-bax specific protein together with its increased expression in drug-sensitive B-CLL B-cells undergoing cell death suggests a role for this protein in the regulation of apoptosis.","['Thomas, A', 'El Rouby, S', 'Reed, J C', 'Krajewski, S', 'Silber, R', 'Potmesil, M', 'Newcomb, E W']","['Thomas A', 'El Rouby S', 'Reed JC', 'Krajewski S', 'Silber R', 'Potmesil M', 'Newcomb EW']","['Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, New York 10016, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)']",IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Mercaptoethanol/pharmacology', '*Mutation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Up-Regulation', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",1996/03/07 00:00,1996/03/07 00:01,['1996/03/07 00:00'],"['1996/03/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/07 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/07 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Mar 7;12(5):1055-62.,,,['CA-60138/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

K562 cells exposed to 0.4 microM antisense oligonucleotide showed markedly reduced proliferation which was associated with reduced cell viability. Sense, scrambled and mutant antisense oligonucleotides had no effect on the proliferation of K562 cells. MM6 cells exposed to 0.4 microM antisense oligonucleotide also showed significantly reduced cellular proliferation which was also accompanied by loss of cell viability. In the K562 and MM6 antisense cultures that exhibited reduced cell viability, both DNA fragmentation and morphological features consistent with apoptosis could be identified. In contrast the growth of HL-60 cells was unaffected by exposure to 0.4 microM antisense oligonucleotide. In each of the cell lines examined, WT1 antisense oligonucleotide abrogated WT1 protein expression, and analysis of WT1 coding sequence in these cells showed that no oncogenic point mutations in the gene were present.

The basal level of RARalpha, RXRalpha and PML mRNA and protein were roughly the same in the three cell lines. While NB4 and NB4-R1 cells express comparable amounts of PM-RARalpha mRNA and 120 kDa protein, NB4-R2 cells despite normal mRNA levels the 120 kDa protein was not detectable. In NB4-R2 cells however, two novel PML-related entities of 65 kDa and 85 kDA were detected with a anti-PML antibody, in addition to the two PML isoforms of 78 and 97 kDa found in any NB4 cells. Despite the 120 kDa PML-RARalpha defect, NB4-R2 cells show micropunctuated nuclear bodies typical of APL cells. Contrasting with NB4 cells, neither NB4-R1 cells which express PML-RARalpha, nor NB4-R2 cells lacking the 120 kDa PML-RARalpha reorganised nuclear bodies (PODs) in response to RA. Importantly, in RA-primed NB4-R1 cells, a secondary event triggered by cAMP restored PODs, concomitant to maturation. This indicates that the recovery of nuclear bodies in APL is dissociated from the early action of RA in cell maturation. Finally, the key finding of this work is that cAMP signalling ultimately determines the recovery of nuclear bodies associated to cell maturation.","['Duprez, E', 'Lillehaug, J R', 'Naoe, T', 'Lanotte, M']","['Duprez E', 'Lillehaug JR', 'Naoe T', 'Lanotte M']","['INSERM U-301, Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire des Leucemies, Centre G.

All-trans RA and cAMP which show synergistic activity in inducing maturation of NB4 cells and maturation triggering of the RA 'primed' NB4-R1 resistant cells, distinctly modulate RXRalpha, RARalpha and PML-RARalpha mRNA. In the NB4 and NB4-R1 cells, RXRalpha mRNA was downregulated by RA, but only in RA-primed NB4-R1 cells a release from RXRalpha mRNA downregulation was obtained by cAMP treatment. RXRalpha protein (53 kDa) was decreased to the western-blot detection limit (97.5%) by RA in NB4 cells, but in NB4-R1 cells although it was frankly decreased (85%), the signal for RXRalpha protein remained very significant. More importantly, while cAMP slightly upregulated RXRalpha protein in RA-treated NB4 cells, it caused an increase of RXRalpha protein in RA-treated NB4-R1 cells bringing RXRalpha to the initial control level. RXRalpha partners in heterodimers (PML-RARalpha, RARalpha) were also analysed. In contrast to RXRalpha, RARalpha and PML-RARalpha mRNA were not modulated by RA and/or cAMP, while significant changes were observed at the protein levels. A putatively phosphorylated form of RARalpha (52 kDa) decreased during maturation of NB4 cells, but was unchanged in resistant NB4-R1 cells. Conversely, while PML-RARalpha remained stable during RA-induced NB4 maturation, RA treatment which failed to induce maturation of NB4-R1 cells significantly down-regulated the chimeric receptor (120 kDa). These differences most likely results from translational and post-translational regulation. This work reveals complex pattern of subtle changes at the protein level distinguishing RA-sensitive and RA-resistant cells. Our data show that the RA-cAMP synergistic effect on NB4 cell maturation and cooperation in triggering maturation of RA-primed NB4-R1 cells operate changes in the RXR/PML-RARalpha ratio which are both favouring RXRalpha. In both cell lines, variations of PML-RARalpha and RXRalpha may result in a decrease in the formation of the PML-RARalpha/RXRalpha heterodimers which are supposed involved in the block of maturation. This may prove crucial to embark cells on maturation.","['Duprez, E', 'Lillehaug, J R', 'Gaub, M P', 'Lanotte, M']","['Duprez E', 'Lillehaug JR', 'Gaub MP', 'Lanotte M']","['INSERM U-301, Genetique Moleculaire et Cellulaire des Leucemies, Centre G.

We show that p40tax-1 alone cannot render the hematopoietic cell line, BAF-B03, able to proliferate in the absence of cytokines, but it can do so in cooperation with lckF505, or c-Myc but not with Bcl-2.","['Miyazaki, T', 'Liu, Z J', 'Taniguchi, T']","['Miyazaki T', 'Liu ZJ', 'Taniguchi T']","['Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Cinnamates)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '3XQ2233B0B (Hygromycin B)', '3YJY415DDI (hygromycin A)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Line', '*Cinnamates', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'ErbB Receptors/metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Hygromycin B/analogs & derivatives', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/physiology', 'Puromycin', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection', 'src-Family Kinases/genetics/metabolism']",1996/06/06 00:00,1996/06/06 00:01,['1996/06/06 00:00'],"['1996/06/06 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/06 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/06 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Jun 6;12(11):2403-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Factor D is an essential enzyme of the alternative pathway of complement and is increased during renal failure. On the other hand the contact of blood with biomaterials activates the complement cascade through the alternative pathway. PAN filters adsorb factor D which looses its enzymatic activity whilst bound to the membrane [1]; the complement alternative pathway function of serum exposed to PAN filters is greatly diminished and restored after addition of purified factor D [1]. The aim of our study was to measure the time course of factor D adsorption and its blood concentration during CVVH in critically ill patients with acute renal failure. METHODS: We studied seven critically ill patients with ARF before, during and after continuous veno-venous haemofiltration (CVVH) with AN69. RESULTS: There was a rapid decrease of factor D levels to 62(+/-6%) of the pre-CVVH value during the first 2 h, which continued to 51(+/-7.3%) after 12 h; at 24 h there was a slight rise to 62 +/- 12%. Sequential use of Polyacrylonitrile (AN69) filters lowered factor D levels below the normal plasma concentration in three patients, thus producing a state of factor D depletion. CONCLUSION: The significant reduction of factor D levels during CVVH with PAN filters suggests that frequent changes of PAN filters may reduce alternative pathway function by lowering factor D levels. CVVH (as opposed to intermittent dialysis) with PAN membranes may further improve the outcome of critically ill patients.","['Gasche, Y', 'Pascual, M', 'Suter, P M', 'Favre, H', 'Chevrolet, J C', 'Schifferli, J A']","['Gasche Y', 'Pascual M', 'Suter PM', 'Favre H', 'Chevrolet JC', 'Schifferli JA']","['Department of Anaesthesiology, Hopital Cantonal, Universitaire de Geneve, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Nephrol Dial Transplant,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",8706402,"['0 (Acrylic Resins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membranes, Artificial)', '25014-41-9 (polyacrylonitrile)']",IM,"['Acrylic Resins', 'Acute Kidney Injury/blood/*therapy', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Complement Activation/*physiology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*blood', 'Hemofiltration/*instrumentation', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*blood', '*Membranes, Artificial', 'Middle Aged']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nephrol Dial Transplant. 1996 Jan;11(1):117-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pol alpha specific activity decrease was correlated with a decreased proliferative capacity frequently seen in cells from aged donors. Pol alpha isolated from pSV3.neo-transformed GM3529 cells (GM3529T) exhibited a single isoform with about 10-fold higher specific activity than pol alpha from GM3529 cells. GM3529T pol alpha was immunoreactive with both anti-pol alpha and anti-SV40 large tumor antigen. Polymerases from GM3529 and GM3529T cells were treated with a pol alpha accessory protein, alpha AP, isolated from L1210 cells. Pol alpha from GM3529T cells showed no increase in activity in the presence of alpha AP, while pol alpha isolated from GM3529 cells exhibited about an 8-fold increase in activity after treatment with alpha AP. Double stranded SV40 DNA containing multiple ori sequences exhibited a greater decrease in electrophoretic mobility in the presence of GM3529T pol alpha than when treated with GM3529 pol alpha. In the presence of pol alpha from either GM35229 or GM3529T cells SV40 dsDNA exhibited a decrease in electrophoretic mobility, and in each instance addition of alpha AP resulted in an even greater decrease in DNA mobility. These data indicate that alpha AP increased pol alpha binding to SV40 dsDNA, or that alpha AP bound the DNA in addition to previously bound pol alpha. GM3529 pol alpha also bound non-specific, non-SV40, dsDNA, whereas GM3529T pol alpha with associated TAg did not bind the non-viral dsDNA unless alpha AP was added to the preparation. While not all human diploid fibroblast cell lines derived from aged human donors necessarily exhibit decreased proliferative capacity compared with cells from young donors, decreased specific activity associated with a decline in cellular DNA synthesis is typical of pol alpha from cells derived from aged human donors. We suggest that a decrease in endogenous alpha AP interaction with pol alpha may account, in part, for the loss of DNA binding affinity and specific activity of pol alpha from GM3529 cells derived from an aged donor.","['Schroeder, M', 'Miller, S', 'Srivastava, V', 'Merriam-Crouch, E', 'Holt, S', 'Wilson, V', 'Busbee, D']","['Schroeder M', 'Miller S', 'Srivastava V', 'Merriam-Crouch E', 'Holt S', 'Wilson V', 'Busbee D']","['Department of Anatomy and Public Health, College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A & M University, College Station 77843, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Polyomavirus Transforming/immunology', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose', 'DNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Protein Binding', 'Simian virus 40/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1996 May;316(5-6):237-48. doi: 10.1016/s0921-8734(96)90006-5.,,"['S0921-8734(96)90006-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0921-8734(96)90006-5 [doi]']","['AG06347/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG07739/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of the 21-bp repeats contains a nonpalindromic cyclic AMP response element (CRE) sequence which is capable of binding members of the ATF/CREB family of transcription factors. The HTLV-1 transactivator protein Tax is able to markedly stimulate the in vitro binding of CREB to the CRE sites present in each of the 21-bp repeats but not to CRE sites present in cellular promoters. The ability to Tax to stimulate CREB binding to different CRE sites correlates with the ability of Tax to activate gene expression from these sites. We wished to determine how sequence differences between the somatostatin CRE and the 21-bp repeat were involved in this different response to Tax. Scatchard analysis indicated that CREB bound to the somatostatin CRE with a single class of high-affinity binding while CREB bound to the 21-bp repeats with a biphasic binding pattern, indicating the presence of both low- and high-affinity binding. Tax increased the affinity of CREB binding but not that of another ATF/CREB protein, CREB2, to the 21-bp repeat. However, Tax did not increase affinity of binding of CREB to the somatostatin CRE. To determine the mechanism by which Tax increased dCREB binding affinity, immobilized oligonucleotides corresponding to either the 21-bp repeat or the somatostatin CRE were used to demonstrate that Tax formed a highly specific complex with CREB on the 21-bp repeat but not on the somatostatin CRE. These results indicate that formation of a complex between Tax and CREB results in specific high-affinity binding of this ternary complex to the HTLV-1 21 bp repeats.","['Yin, M J', 'Gaynor, R B']","['Yin MJ', 'Gaynor RB']","['Department of Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235-8594, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '51110-01-1 (Somatostatin)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'DNA, Viral/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Models, Biological', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Somatostatin/genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Jun;16(6):3156-68. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.6.3156.,,['10.1128/MCB.16.6.3156 [doi]'],,,,PMC231309,,,,,,,,,,,

Except in stem cells, which have a low level of telomerase activity, its activity is absent from normal somatic tissues. Understanding the regulation of telomerase activity is critical for the development of potential tools for the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Using the telomeric repeat amplification protocol, we found that immortal, telomerase-positive, pseudodiploid human cells (HT1080 and HL60 cells) sorted by flow repressed in quiescent cells. This was true whether quiescence was induced by contact inhibition (NIH 3T3 mouse cells), growth factor removal (bromodeoxyuridine-blocked mouse myoblasts), reexpression of cellular senescence (the reversibly immortalized IDH4 cells), or irreversible cell differentiation (HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells and C2C12 mouse myoblasts). Taken together, these results indicate that telomerase is active throughout the cell in dividing, immortal cells but that its activity is repressed in cells that exit the cell cycle.

Its activation by either chromosomal translocation or proviral insertion leads to Ewing's sarcoma in humans or erythroleukemia in mice, respectively, Fli-1 is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic and endothelial cells. This expression pattern resembled that of c-ets-1, another ets gene closely related and physically linked to Fli-1. We also generated a germ line mutation in Fli-1 by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. Homozygous mutant mice exhibit thymic hypocellularity which is not related to a defect in a specific subpopulation of thymocytes or to increased apoptosis, suggesting that Fli-1 is an important regulator of a prethymic T-cell progenitor. This phenotype was corrected by crossing the Fli-1 deficient mice expressing Fli-1 cDNA. Homozygous mutant mice remained susceptible to erythroleukemia induction by Friend murine leukemia virus, although the latency period was significantly increased. Surprisingly, the mutant Fli-1 allele was still a target for Friend murine leukemia virus integration, and leukemic spleens with a rearranged Fli-1 gene expressed a truncated Fli-1 protein that appears to arise from an internal translation initiation site and alternative splicing around the neo cassette used in the gene targeting. The fortuitous discovery of the mutant Fli-1 protein, revealed only as the result of the clonal expansion of leukemic cells harboring a rearranged Fli-1 gene, suggests caution in the interpretation of gene-targeting experiments that result in either no or only a subtle phenotypic alteration.","['Melet, F', 'Motro, B', 'Rossi, D J', 'Zhang, L', 'Bernstein, A']","['Melet F', 'Motro B', 'Rossi DJ', 'Zhang L', 'Bernstein A']","['Program in Molecular Biology and Cancer, Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute, Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Fli1 protein, mouse)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*physiology', 'Female', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Gene Targeting', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics/physiology', 'Homozygote', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Phenotype', 'Pregnancy', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Protein c-fli-1', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Thymus Gland/*growth & development', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics/*physiology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1996 Jun;16(6):2708-18. doi: 10.1128/MCB.16.6.2708.,,['10.1128/MCB.16.6.2708 [doi]'],,,,PMC231261,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated whether these sphingolipids act on different receptors by testing the effect of varying concentrations of SPPC on [Ca2+]i in human leukemia HL-60 cells, which have been found to be nonresponsive to SPP. SPPC potently (EC50 = 1.5 microM) and rapidly increased [Ca2+]i in HL-60 cells in a pertussis toxin-sensitive manner.

SPPC did not activate phospholipase C or D in HL-60 cells. However, SPPC, but not SPP, stimulated the generation of superoxide anions in dibutyryl cAMP-differentiated HL-60 cells as well as in human neutrophils, suggesting that the SPPC receptor may play a role in the inflammatory defense against invading microorganisms.

Kinetic measurements (K(m), K(i), and V(max)) of synthetic homopolymeric template primers have shown that HPMPApp is a selective and potent inhibitor of polymerase epsilon, whereas PMEDAPpp strongly inhibits polymerase delta. These two compounds may be useful for elucidating the roles of polymerases delta and epsilon.

Seventy-seven patients were treated according to a normal-risk protocol and 15 patients received more intensive chemotherapy according to a high-risk protocol. In most of the patients the duration of follow-up was 12 years for irradiated patients and 4.5 years for the nonirradiated patients. Thirty of 92 patients were treated according to a protocol without CI, but with a difference in the use of corticosteroids: 19 patients received dexamethasone during the remission-induction and maintenance treatment and 11 patients received prednisone. The influence of dexamethasone vs. prednisone, sex, CI and high-dose vs. low-dose chemotherapy on weight for height was evaluated. Patients who received dexamethasone showed a significant increase in weight for height immediately after the start of therapy. In patients who received CI, weight for height significantly increased after the first year of treatment. The overweight in these patients persisted during the whole follow-up period. The weight for height of patients treated with prednisone and of patients who did not receive CI was below the mean of the normal population during treatment but was not different from normal after cessation of therapy.

Results of clinical studies of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) suggested that DXM is more potent relative to PRD than assumed. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative antileukemic activity of PRD phosphate and DXM phosphate in 133 untreated childhood ALL samples in vitro, using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium-bromide (MTT) assay. There was a marked variation in antileukemic activity of both agents among the patient samples. The median LC50 (drug concentration lethal to 50% of the ALL cells) for PRD phosphate was 3.50 microM, for DXM phosphate 0.20 microM. The individually calculated ratios of the LC50 values for PRD and DXM phosphate showed a large range from 0.7 to >500, with a median of 16.2. This 16-fold difference could not be explained by differences between these glucocorticoids in stability, hydrolysis into unesterified drug, adhesion to the wall of the microculture plates, or protein binding. ALL cells were cross-resistant to PRD and DXM phosphate (correlation coefficient = 0.85, P<0.000001). We conclude that the in vitro antileukemic activity of DXM phosphate is median 16-fold higher than that of PRD phosphate, which contrasts to the generally assumed factor of 7. Based on the higher potency of DXM, and its more favorable pharmacokinetics as reported in the literature, DXM may be preferred to PRD as the glucocorticoid in the treatment of ALL.","['Kaspers, G J', 'Veerman, A J', 'Popp-Snijders, C', 'Lomecky, M', 'Van Zantwijk, C H', 'Swinkels, L M', 'Van Wering, E R', 'Pieters, R']","['Kaspers GJ', 'Veerman AJ', 'Popp-Snijders C', 'Lomecky M', 'Van Zantwijk CH', 'Swinkels LM', 'Van Wering ER', 'Pieters R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '752SY38R6C (prednisolone phosphate)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Coloring Agents', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/08/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/08/01 00:00'],"['1996/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1996 Aug;27(2):114-21. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199608)27:2<114::AID-MPO8>3.0.CO;2-I.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199608)27:2<114::AID-MPO8>3.0.CO;2-I [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-911X(199608)27:2<114::AID-MPO8>3.0.CO;2-I [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following promising clinical results with investigational formulations, three industrial compounds have been developed: AmBisome, Amphocil (Amphotericin B Colloidal Dispersion) and Amphotericin B Lipid Complex (ABLC, Abelcet). These three formulations differ significantly in composition and pharmacokinetics. AmB serum levels after ABLC and Amphocil administration are low, but after AmBisome much higher. However, the interpretation of the pharmacokinetic data is hampered by the inability to separate free AmB fractions from tissue-, protein- and lipid carrier bound fractions. All three compounds share a considerable reduction of nephrotoxicity. However, the acute reaction rates differ among these compounds. Amphocil showing the highest and AmBisome the lowest rate. Unfortunately, efficacy data of ongoing trials comparing these formulations with conventional AmB are scarce. Therefore, for the moment we can recommend these compounds only in cases of intolerance to or failure on AmB therapy. The optimal therapeutic dosages have not been established, but dosages as low as 1 mg/kg should be avoided in the initial treatment of fulminant fungal infections, since efficacy may be inferior to equal doses of conventional AmB.","['de Marie, S']",['de Marie S'],"['University Hospital Rotterdam/Dijkzigt, Dept Bacteriology, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '7XU7A7DROE (Amphotericin B)']",IM,"['Amphotericin B/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*chemistry', 'Animals', 'Antifungal Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*chemistry', 'Chemistry, Pharmaceutical', 'Drug Carriers', 'Humans', 'Liposomes']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jun;10 Suppl 2:s93-6.,34,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it has been known for years that a variety of agents, including retinoids, could induce leukemic cells to differentiate in vitro, it was not until the initial report from Shanghai in 1988 that laboratory studies translated into clinical activity and benefit in patients. Since this initial report, a number of studies have confirmed that the majority of patients with both newly diagnosed and previously chemotherapy-treated patients with APL achieve complete remission (CR) with ATRA. In addition, the characteristic life-threatening coagulopathy resolves quickly. Several limitations to this approach have emerged, including the development of retinoid resistance, hyperleukocytosis and the retinoic acid syndrome, a constellation of findings including unexplained fever, fluid retention, pleuropericardial effusions and pulmonary infiltrates. Although ATRA is very effective in inducing CR, its benefits compared to conventional chemotherapy are only now being addressed. The first prospective randomized trial comparing ATRA plus chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone was terminated early because of an improved event-free survival for patients receiving ATRA. The benefit was attributable to a difference in relapse rate. A large, intergroup, prospective, randomized trial comparing conventional chemotherapy to ATRA for induction and ATRA to observation for maintenance has recently completed accrual and will provide insight into the emerging role of ATRA in patients with APL. ATRA represents the first example of a specific form of antileukemic therapy targeting a specific genetic abnormality and may serve as a paradigm for the development of differentiating therapy for patients with other hematologic malignancies.","['Tallman, M S']",['Tallman MS'],"['Northwestern University Medical School, Robert H.

The collection of Ph-negative precursor cells occurred in 13/19 (68%) patients mobilized within the first year from diagnosis and not previously treated with interferon alpha (IFN-alpha). Fourteen out of 42 patients (33%) achieved Ph-negative precursors beyond 1 year from diagnosis. Eleven patients mobilized early after diagnosis were subsequently autografted with Ph-negative precursor cells. All patients are alive in hematologic remission and five of them maintain Ph-negativity in the marrow 7-15 months post-autograft. Four patients showed recurrence of Ph-positive cells (5 to 40%) within 4 to 8 months after autografting. Two patients became progressively Ph-positive after 6 months and are now 100% Ph-positive and in stable chronic phase. In the early stage of the disease the mobilization/transplantation procedure is safe and associated with very good compliance. However, occasional restoration of Ph-negative hematopoiesis could occur up to 45 months after autograft in patients undergoing the procedure beyond 1 year from diagnosis, and highly pretreated with IFN-alpha, but most patients revert to Ph-positive hematopoiesis. In an attempt to control the Ph-negative status and to prevent cytogeneic relapse, we are currently treating autografted patients with low doses of IFN-alpha and interleukin-2 (IL-2). Whether and for how long Ph-negative status can be maintained is a matter for future observation and effort.","['Frassoni, F', 'Carella, A M']","['Frassoni F', 'Carella AM']","['Dipartimento Ematologia, Ospedale San Martino, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage', '*Leukapheresis', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Jun;10 Suppl 2:s30-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the transforming viruses cause tumors by transduction of oncogenes, the leukemia retroviruses, lacking oncogenes, employ other mechanisms, including promoter insertion and enhancer activation. Although these two mechanisms occur in many tumors induced by leukemia viruses, a substantial proportion of such tumors do not show site-specific proviral insertions. Thus, other, unidentified virus-driven mechanisms may participate in tumorigenesis. In these studies, we show that infection of cells by M-MuLV activates expression of Rel family transcription factors. In murine cells chronically infected with M-MuLV, gel shift analyses with kappaB DNA-binding motifs from the murine immunoglobulin kappa light chain enhancer demonstrated induction of at least two distinct kappaB enhancer-binding complexes. Supershifting and immunoblotting analyses defined p50, p52, RelB, and c-Rel subunits as constituents of these virus-induced protein complexes.

Reporter constructs also showed strong synergy between both stimuli and showed that Tax and the PMA-Ca2+ ionophore act through different regions of the IL-2 and GM-CSF genes. Furthermore, the Tax-responsive regions (TxRR) from both GM-CSF and IL-2 respond to costimulation through the CD28 surface receptor. The GM-CSF and IL-2 TxRRs showed significantly higher levels of NF-kappaB/rel binding, following induction by Tax, compared with that of the PMA-Ca2+ ionophore with only Tax capable of inducing c-Rel binding to a Consensus kappaB element within the GM-CSF TxRR. Tax protein mutants, however, showed that a pathway(s) other than NF-kappaB/rel induction could also cooperate with the PMA-Ca2+ ionophore to activate the GM-CSF and IL-2 genes.

Infection of mice by Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), which induces lymphocytic leukemia, results in a mixed viral infection composed of the inoculated ecotropic M-MuLV and polytropic MuLVs generated by recombination of M-MuLV with endogenous retroviral sequences. In this report, we describe pseudotyping which occurred among the polytropic and ecotropic MuLVs in M-MuLV-infected mice. Infectious center assays of polytropic MuLVs released from splenocytes or thymocytes of infected mice revealed that polytropic MuLVs were extensively pseudotyped within ecotropic virions. Late in the preleukemic stage, a dramatic change in the extent of pseudotyping occurred in thymuses. Starting at about 5 weeks, there was an abrupt increase in the number of thymocytes that released nonpseudotyped polytropic viruses. A parallel increase in thymocytes that released ecotropic M-MuLV packaged within polytropic virions was also observed. Analyses of the clonality of preleukemic thymuses and thymomas suggested that the change in pseudotyping characteristics was not the result of the emergence of tumor cells. Examination of mice infected with M-MuLV, Friend erythroleukemia virus, and a Friend erythroleukemia virus-M-MuLV chimeric virus suggested that the appearance of polytropic virions late in the preleukemic stage correlated with the induction of lymphocytic leukemia. We discuss different ways in which pseudotypic mixing may facilitate leukemogenesis, including a model in which the kinetics of thymic infection, modulated by pseudotyping and viral interference, facilitates a stepwise mechanism of leukemogenesis.","['Lavignon, M', 'Evans, L']","['Lavignon M', 'Evans L']","['Laboratory of Persistent Viral Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Hamilton, Montana 59840, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Genome, Viral', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*pathogenicity', 'Preleukemia/etiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*etiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*etiology', '*Viral Interference']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Jun;70(6):3852-62. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.6.3852-3862.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.6.3852-3862.1996 [doi]'],,,,PMC190262,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we present evidence to the contrary. At various times after primary infection, we superinfected T cells in vitro by exposure to a genetically distinct viral clone or to a virus carrying the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene. Replication of each virus strain was determined by restriction enzyme analysis of total cellular DNA, by PCR amplification of viral DNA, or by assay of cell extracts for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. We found that efficient viral interference is established within 24 h of infection at a multiplicity of infection of 1. At that time, expression of viral structural proteins was low and infected cells displayed undiminished levels of surface CD4 and were fully susceptible to virus binding and fusion. Superinfection by either cell-free HIV-1 or cocultivation was blocked. Cells resistant to superinfection by HIV-1 remained susceptible to Moloney murine leukemia and vaccinia viruses. No interference was observed 4 h after primary infection or in cells infected with either UV-inactivated HIV-1 or a mutant virus defective in virus-cell fusion activity, indicating that binding of primary virus to CD4 is insufficient to prevent superinfection. The minimum viral requirements for this interference are that HIV-1 must be able to enter cells and synthesize viral DNA; Tat-mediated transcription is dispensable. Our results support the existence of a novel pathway to interference to HIV-1 infection, which we term postentry interference, which blocks superinfection during intracellular phases of the virus life cycle.","['Volsky, D J', 'Simm, M', 'Shahabuddin, M', 'Li, G', 'Chao, W', 'Potash, M J']","['Volsky DJ', 'Simm M', 'Shahabuddin M', 'Li G', 'Chao W', 'Potash MJ']","[""Molecular Virology Laboratory, St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, New York 10019, USA. djv4@columbia.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'CD4 Antigens/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Down-Regulation', 'HIV-1/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', '*Viral Interference']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Jun;70(6):3823-33. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.6.3823-3833.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.6.3823-3833.1996 [doi]'],"['CA37465/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL43628/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC190259,,,,,,,,,,,

The fusogenic activities of CHO cell clones increase much more strongly with levels of receptor expression than do their susceptibilities to infection, suggesting that the assembly of receptor clusters may limit syncytium formation. However, other cell lines are not fusogenic, even if they express larger amounts of receptors. Our results suggest that a factor that is relatively abundant or active in CHO cells may functionally interact with rRAM-1 and mCAT-1 in a pathway that enables receptor-bearing membranes to fuse with membranes that contain viral envelope glycoproteins. In the case of CHO/rRAM-1 cells, syncytia form at foci of amphotropic 4070A virus infection by fusion-from-within of infected with uninfected cells. This fusogenic propensity is a sole property of the uninfected CHO/rRAM-1 cells, which fuse in cocultures with any cells infected with 4070A virus. With CHO/mCAT-1 cells, fusogenicity is even greater and involves fusion-from-without by ecotropic virion particles. In contrast to infection, which behaves as expected for a process limited by ecotropic virus attachment to single receptors, fusion-from-without increases dramatically for cells that express the highest levels of mCAT-1. We propose that infection and syncytium formation are limited at distinct steps of a common pathway that requires virus binding to a single receptor, assembly of multivalent virus-receptor complexes, structural changes in viral envelope glycoproteins, and membrane fusion. The limiting step in syncytium formation is a cellular process that depends on receptor clustering and is relatively active in CHO cells.","['Siess, D C', 'Kozak, S L', 'Kabat, D']","['Siess DC', 'Kozak SL', 'Kabat D']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland 97201-3098, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Phosphate Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Symporters)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', '*Membrane Fusion', '*Phosphate Transport Proteins', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', '*Symporters']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Jun;70(6):3432-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.6.3432-3439.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.6.3432-3439.1996 [doi]'],['CA25810/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC190216,,,,,,,,,,,

Nucleophilic aromatic displacement was a key reaction in the syntheses. Ten of the new compounds were more potent than the unsubstituted compound, azonafide, in a panel of tumor cells including human melanoma and ovarian cancer and murine sensitive and MDR L1210 leukemia. They also were less cardiotoxic in cell culture. Four of these compounds were not cross-resistant with the MDR leukemia, and one of them, 6-ethoxyazonafide, was nearly as potent against solid tumor cells as leukemia cells. These compounds also had good potency against human breast, colon, and lung cancer cells, including doxorubicin and mitoxantrone resistant cell lines. Advantages of the new analogues over azonafide were less in vivo, but 6-ethoxyazonafide was more effective against L1210 leukemia and subcutaneous B16 melanoma in mice. Although correlations of antitumor potency in cells and physicochemical properties of substituents were not found, there were statistically significant correlations of DNA melt transition temperature (delta Tm) with potency in solid tumor cells and sensitive and MDR resistant L1210 leukemia cells for 6-substituted azonafides and with solid tumors for 7-substituted azonafides.","['Sami, S M', 'Dorr, R T', 'Solyom, A M', 'Alberts, D S', 'Iyengar, B S', 'Remers, W A']","['Sami SM', 'Dorr RT', 'Solyom AM', 'Alberts DS', 'Iyengar BS', 'Remers WA']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Arizona, Tucson, 85721, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoquinolines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/*chemical synthesis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/12 00:00,1996/04/12 00:01,['1996/04/12 00:00'],"['1996/04/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/12 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/12 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med Chem. 1996 Apr 12;39(8):1609-18. doi: 10.1021/jm950742g.,,"['10.1021/jm950742g [doi]', 'jm950742g [pii]']","['CA119875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM52795/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: We systematically examined 156 children with cancer and indwelling catheters for the presence of a right atrial thrombus when they underwent routine screening of cardiac function by two-dimensional echocardiography. RESULTS: Thirteen children (8.8%) had right atrial thrombi. Of the 13 children, 6 had thrombi adherent to the right atrial wall, and in 5 of these 6 children the clots were considered large enough to require intervention: 2 children with obstruction of venous or tricuspid valve inflow underwent right atriotomy and thrombus removal; they recovered and remained well. The other 3 children had moderate-sized thrombi and were treated with oral anticoagulants; their clots stabilized (2 children) or regressed (1 child). The remaining 7 children had thrombus on the tip of the catheter: 5 of these children were observed; the thrombi spontaneously resolved in 2 of them and did not change in size in the other 3. In the sixth child, the catheter malfunctioned 2 weeks after discovery of the clot and the catheter was removed. The seventh child was treated with warfarin and the clot decreased in size. Thrombi were detected in a greater proportion of children with catheter tips in the right atrium versus the superior vena cava, and in a greater proportion of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia versus other diagnoses. There was no association between the presence of a clot and duration of time the catheter was in place, the number of catheters placed, treatment with asparaginase, or treatment with total parenteral nutrition. CONCLUSION: The incidence of right atrial thrombi in children with indwelling catheters may be higher than was previously appreciated.","['Korones, D N', 'Buzzard, C J', 'Asselin, B L', 'Harris, J P']","['Korones DN', 'Buzzard CJ', 'Asselin BL', 'Harris JP']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester School of Medicine, New York 14642, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Catheters, Indwelling', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Echocardiography', 'Female', 'Heart Atria/*diagnostic imaging', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Parenteral Nutrition, Total', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombosis/*diagnostic imaging/therapy']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1996 Jun;128(6):841-6. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(96)70338-4.,,"['S0022-3476(96)70338-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(96)70338-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Challenges that currently face radioimmunotherapy include circulating free antigen, binding of antibodies to nonspecific Fc receptors, insufficient tumor penetration, antigenic heterogeneity and insufficient antigen expression, antigenic modulation, and development of human antimouse antibodies. Possible approaches to these challenges, including high-dose radioimmunotherapy and chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation, the use of radionuclides such as yttrium 90 (90Y) and copper 67 (67Cu), and the development of humanized and bifunctional antibodies, are under investigation. CONCLUSION: Although radioimmunotherapy is a relatively new field, substantial progress has been made. Additional research will ultimately resolve many of the challenges that currently face radioimmunotherapy and hopefully lead to the cure of some currently incurable malignancies.","['Wilder, R B', 'DeNardo, G L', 'DeNardo, S J']","['Wilder RB', 'DeNardo GL', 'DeNardo SJ']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of California Davis School of Medicine, Sacramento, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Radioisotopes)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma/radiotherapy', 'Neoplasms/immunology/*radiotherapy', '*Radioimmunotherapy/adverse effects/methods/trends', 'Radioisotopes/therapeutic use', 'Radiotherapy Dosage']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Apr;14(4):1383-400. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1383.,209,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1383 [doi]'],['CA47829/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this review is to evaluate critically the safety and efficacy of the CSFs, primarily granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), in the treatment of patients with AML. METHODS: All phase III trials that have either been presented or published that used CSFs during and/or following induction chemotherapy in patients with de novo AML are discussed. Relevant background information and future directions are also addressed. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: There have been six phase III trials that used either GM-CSF or G-CSF in induction therapy in patients with AML. It is difficult to compare these trials due to differences in patient age, induction therapy administered, disease characteristics, whether leukemia response or documentation of marrow hypoplasia was required before cytokine use, and the different cytokines administered during the study. In particular, the timing of CSF administration in relation to the chemotherapy may be important due to the different biologic effects these agents may have on leukemia cells, such as leukemia cell recruitment. Most of these studies administered either GM-CSF or G-CSF before or during induction therapy, as well as following completion of chemotherapy until neutrophil recovery. Only one of six trials required documentation of marrow hypoplasia before CSF use. Despite these differences, administration of either GM-CSF or G-CSF was found to be safe without an increase in acute toxicity or an increase in relapse rates. In addition, most trials demonstrated a significant improvement in neutrophil recovery, with several trials demonstrating an improvement in complete remission and overall survival rates. Therefore, the use of selected CSFs may be of benefit following induction chemotherapy in those patients with AML who are at increased risk for early morbidity and mortality.","['Geller, R B']",['Geller RB'],"['Department of Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cytokines)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Cytokines/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Apr;14(4):1371-82. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1371.,65,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1371 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Implicit and explicit reasons for including eligibility criteria in clinical trials are reviewed. Safety concerns and sample size issues receive special attention. The types of problems restrictive eligibility criteria cause with respect to scientific interpretation, medical applicability, complexity, costs, and patient accrual are described. RESULTS: A list of three items that each eligibility criterion should meet in order to be included is proposed and applied to a recent trial in acute lymphocytic leukemia. CONCLUSION: Phase III clinical trials in cancer should have much broader eligibility criteria than the traditionally restrictive criteria commonly used. Adoption of less restrictive eligibility criteria for most studies would allow broader generalizations, better mimic medical practice, reduce complexity and costs, and permit more rapid accrual without compromising patient safety or requiring major increases in sample size.","['George, S L']",['George SL'],"['Division of Biometry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['*Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Patient Selection', '*Research Design', 'Sample Size']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Apr;14(4):1364-70. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1364.,24,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1364 [doi]'],"['CA14236/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Catalan Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation.,1353-63,"PURPOSE: To evaluate prospectively the feasibility and results of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) after induction and intensification chemotherapy (CT) in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 159 patients less than 51 years of age were treated. Induction CT consisted of daunorubicin 60 mg/m2 for 3 days, cytarabine (ARA-C) 100mg/m2 for 7 days, and etoposide 100 mg/m2 for 3 days. The first intensification therapy included mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 for 3 days and ARA-C 1.2 g/m2 every 12 hours for 4 days. Amsacrine (100 or 150 mg/m2 for 3 days) and ARA-C (1.2 g/m2 every 12 hours for 2 or 4 days) were given as the second intensification therapy. Depending on the availability of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling, the intention of treatment after CT was allogeneic BMT (allo-BMT) or autologous BMT (ABMT). RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 120 patients (75%) and partial remission (PR) in 11 (7%), while 15 patients (10%) were refractory and 13 (8%) died during induction. There was a trend for better leukemia-free survival (LFS) at 4 years for patients assigned to the ABMT group (50% +/- 6%) compared with the allo-BMT group (31% +/- 7%) (P = .08). This difference in LFS reached statistical significance when considering only transplanted patients (63% +/- 3% at 4 years after ABMT and 38% +/- 11% after allo-BMT, P = .02). The favorable results in patients who received ABMT (no toxic deaths and 37% +/- 7% probability of relapse at 4 years) contrast with the poor outcome of allografted patients (11 patients with transplant-related mortality). CONCLUSION: Our study reflects the difficulties in the completion of a therapeutic strategy that include BMT and suggests that intensification before BMT may be useful in the setting of ABMT, but this approach was associated with a high mortality rate in allo-BMT patients.","['Sierra, J', 'Brunet, S', 'Granena, A', 'Olive, T', 'Bueno, J', 'Ribera, J M', 'Petit, J', 'Besses, C', 'Llorente, A', 'Guardia, R', 'Macia, J', 'Rovira, M', 'Badell, I', 'Vela, E', 'Diaz de Heredia, C', 'Vivancos, P', 'Carreras, E', 'Feliu, E', 'Montserrat, E', 'Julia, A', 'Cubells, J', 'Rozman, C', 'Domingo, A', 'Ortega, J J']","['Sierra J', 'Brunet S', 'Granena A', 'Olive T', 'Bueno J', 'Ribera JM', 'Petit J', 'Besses C', 'Llorente A', 'Guardia R', 'Macia J', 'Rovira M', 'Badell I', 'Vela E', 'Diaz de Heredia C', 'Vivancos P', 'Carreras E', 'Feliu E', 'Montserrat E', 'Julia A', 'Cubells J', 'Rozman C', 'Domingo A', 'Ortega JJ']","['Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Apr;14(4):1353-63. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1353.,,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1353 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients received mitoxantrone 10 mg/m2 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1 to 5. Complete remitters received a single course of cytarabine 0.5 mg/m2 every 12 hours on days 1 to 6. Cytogenetic and immunophenotyping studies were performed at diagnosis and were examined for prognostic importance. The Functional Living Index-Cancer (FLI-C) was used in the longitudinal assessment of quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 37 (55%) of 67 eligible patients achieved remission, 34 (92%) of whom did so with a single course. The induction mortality rate was 12%. The median disease-free and overall survival times were 8.4 and 9.2 months, respectively. CD34 stem-cell phenotype, poor performance status, and high cytogenetic complexity score were independent covariates of failure to achieve remission. Very complex karotype combined with CD34 stem-cell phenotype to predict induction death in 67% of cases (P = .0003). Cytotoxic therapy-related gut epithelial damage was maximal during weeks 2 and 3 of therapy. Complete remitters and partial responders exhibited significantly improved global FLI-C scores following completion of therapy. CONCLUSION: Mitoxantrone plus etoposide was an effective and well-tolerated first-line induction regimen for AML in the elderly that should be studied further in comparison to the standard cytarabine/anthracycline-based therapy.","['Bow, E J', 'Sutherland, J A', 'Kilpatrick, M G', 'Williams, G J', 'Clinch, J J', 'Shore, T B', 'Rubinger, M', 'Schacter, B A']","['Bow EJ', 'Sutherland JA', 'Kilpatrick MG', 'Williams GJ', 'Clinch JJ', 'Shore TB', 'Rubinger M', 'Schacter BA']","['Department of Medicine, University of Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Quality of Life', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Apr;14(4):1345-52. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1345.,,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1345 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro incubation of acute myelogenous leukemia with OL(1)p53, a 20-mer phosphorothioate oligonucleotide complementary to p53 mRNA, results in leukemic cell death. A phase I dose-escalating trial was conducted to determine the toxicity of OL(1)p53 following systemic administration to patients with hematologic malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixteen patients with either refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (n = 6) or advanced myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 10) participated in the trial. Patients were given OL(1)p53 at doses of 0.05 to 0.25 mg/kg/h for 10 days by continuous intravenous infusion. RESULTS: No specific toxicity was directly related to the administration of OL(1)p53. One patient developed transient nonoliguric renal failure. One patient died of anthracycline-induced cardiac failure. Approximately 36% of the administered dose of OL(1)p53 was recovered intact in the urine. Plasma concentrations and area under the plasma concentration curves were linearly correlated with dose. Leukemic cell growth in vitro was inhibited as compared with pretreatment samples. There were no clinical complete responses. CONCLUSION: A phosphorothioate oligonucleotide, OL(1)p53, can be administered systemically without complications. This type of modified oligonucleotide can be administered without complete degradation, as it was recovered from the urine intact. This oligonucleotide may be useful in combination with currently available chemotherapy agents for the treatment of malignancies.","['Bishop, M R', 'Iversen, P L', 'Bayever, E', 'Sharp, J G', 'Greiner, T C', 'Copple, B L', 'Ruddon, R', 'Zon, G', 'Spinolo, J', 'Arneson, M', 'Armitage, J O', 'Kessinger, A']","['Bishop MR', 'Iversen PL', 'Bayever E', 'Sharp JG', 'Greiner TC', 'Copple BL', 'Ruddon R', 'Zon G', 'Spinolo J', 'Arneson M', 'Armitage JO', 'Kessinger A']","['University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', 'CI002S7WH8 (OL(1)p53)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy', '*Oligodeoxyribonucleotides, Antisense', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Thionucleotides/administration & dosage/*adverse effects/*pharmacokinetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Apr;14(4):1320-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1320.,,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1320 [doi]'],,['J Clin Oncol. 1997 Jan;15(1):408.

In an earlier pilot study, the combination of bone marrow and blood did not produce severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We now report the results of a phase II study using blood stem cells alone in 19 patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The median age was 40 years. All patients had hematopoietic malignancies and received transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors. GVHD prophylaxis consisted of cyclosporine plus prednisone. Posttransplant colony-stimulating factors were not administered. Donors were mobilized with subcutaneous granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; 16 microg/kg/d) for 5 days. Apheresis was performed on 2 consecutive days. RESULTS: The median cell content of the two apheresis was 11.9 x 10(8) WBC/kg, 3.2 x 10(8) CD3/kg, and 8.3 x 10(6) CD34/kg. The median time to achieve an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) > or = 500/microL was 13 days, and 14 days to a platelet count > or = 50,000/microL. All patients engrafted. Platelet recovery was faster in marrow historic control groups. Blood cells in all tested cases contained more than 95% donor cells on day 30. The actuarial incidence of acute GVHD was 37%, and 13% for grade II-IV GVHD. Limited, corticosteroid responsive, chronic GVHD developed in 33% of assessable patients. At a median follow-up of 192 days, actuarial survival was 75%. CONCLUSION: Transplantation of a high number of stem cells may lead to rapid engraftment without the use of posttransplant colony-stimulating factors. GVHD does not appear to be more severe than in similarly treated patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation. For allogeneic transplantation, mobilized blood cell collections are an alternative to bone marrow collections.","['Rosenfeld, C', 'Collins, R', 'Pineiro, L', 'Agura, E', 'Nemunaitis, J']","['Rosenfeld C', 'Collins R', 'Pineiro L', 'Agura E', 'Nemunaitis J']","['Texas Oncology, Professional Association, Dallas, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Apr;14(4):1314-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1314.,,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.4.1314 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1986 to October 1992, 133 eligible patients were enrolled: 74 with B-cell (surface immunoglobulin-positive [Slg+] acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and 59 with stage IV small noncleaved-cell lymphoma (SNCCL). The median age was 8 years; there were 103 males and 30 females. Abdominal tumor masses were prominent in 63 cases (33 B-ALL and 30 stage IV SNCCL). RESULTS: Complete remission (CR) was achieved in 66 B-ALL and 57 stage IV patients (93% overall). At 4 years, the estimated event-free survival (EFS) rate is 65% +/- 8% for patients with B-ALL and 79% +/- 9% for those with stage IV SNCCL. Among patients with CNS involvement, 23 of 36 remain in CR (4-year EFS rate, 64% +/- 13%). Relapses occurred early; only 3 patients relapsed after completion of therapy. Thirteen relapses occurred in the marrow, three in the CNS, and six in other sites. Of 11 CNS-positive patients who relapsed, only two recurred primarily in the CNS.

Role of CD8 T cells.,4757-63,"The murine-acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (MAIDS) is caused by a mixture of murine leukemia viruses (LP-BM5 MuLV). The influence of perinatal contact with retroviruses or their Ags on the response to infection was tested by infecting with LP-BM5 (MuLV) the adult offspring of mice with MAIDS. These offspring were resistant to disease after virus challenge. Most of them were free of defective viral DNA, and even those with molecular evidence of infection had lymphoid cells with a lower infectious capacity to cause MAIDS in naive recipients. No ecotropic, xenotropic, or mink cell focus-forming (MCF) virus expression was found at the age of 5 wk, which is the time of LP-BM5 (MuLV) challenge. However, at 22 wk of age, one-half of the offspring from MAIDS mothers had ecotropic virus-expressing cells in their spleens. At the time of suckling, offspring from infected mothers had enhanced percentages of B cells and CD4 and CD8 T cells in the spleen, possibly followed by a slight persistent splenomegaly. These results suggest that immune reactivity, rather than tolerance to the virus, is responsible for resistance to disease after challenge. The offspring of MAIDS mice could clear the virus after challenge. This clearance was mediated by CD8 T cells, as continuous CD8 T cell depletion initiated at the time of viral challenge abrogated the resistance of these mice to MAIDS.","['Pavlovitch, J H', 'Hulier, E', 'Rizk-Rabin, M', 'Marussig, M', 'Mazier, D', 'Joffret, M L', 'Hoos, S', 'Papiernik, M']","['Pavlovitch JH', 'Hulier E', 'Rizk-Rabin M', 'Marussig M', 'Mazier D', 'Joffret ML', 'Hoos S', 'Papiernik M']","['CNRS URA 583, Necker Hospital, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'CD8 Antigens/immunology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Defective Viruses', 'Female', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/analysis', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*immunology/pathogenicity', 'Male', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Murine Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'Proviruses/chemistry', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Virus Replication']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jun 15;156(12):4757-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubating SO4 cells with anti-CD95 IgM mAb caused concentration-dependent cell death. On the contrary, R-SO4 cells did not die even at 1000 ng/ml of anti-CD95 IgM mAb. The levels of CD95 expression on R-SO4 cells were one-third of those on SO4 cells. However a blocking Ab, anti-CD95 IgG mAb, did not induce complete resistance of SO4 cells to anti-CD95 IgM mAb as R-SO4 cells. As CD95 and TNF receptor are similar, and TNF/TNF receptor binding induces oxygen radicals, the involvement of oxidant and antioxidant systems in CD95-mediated apoptosis has been examined. The addition of anti-CD95 IgM mAb resulted in formation of intracellular oxygen radical species in the SO4 cells as measured using 2',5',-dichlorofluorescein as substrate. The oxygen radical production induced DNA damage as determined by formation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine. No increase in the formation of oxygen radicals was observed in R-SO4 cells. Concentrations of the intracellular antioxidant, glutathione, and the key enzyme for its synthesis, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, were 150% increased in R-SO4 cells in comparison with that of SO4 cells. Moreover, glutathione ester decreased the formation of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine. These results suggested that apoptosis mediated by CD95 in ATL cells is related to the production of oxygen radical species and cellular antioxidant systems, especially, glutathione synthesis.","['Kohno, T', 'Yamada, Y', 'Hata, T', 'Mori, H', 'Yamamura, M', 'Tomonaga, M', 'Urata, Y', 'Goto, S', 'Kondo, T']","['Kohno T', 'Yamada Y', 'Hata T', 'Mori H', 'Yamamura M', 'Tomonaga M', 'Urata Y', 'Goto S', 'Kondo T']","['Department of Hematology, Atomic Disease Institute, Nagasaki School of Medicine, Nagasaki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (fas Receptor)', 'EC 6.3.2.2 (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'DNA Damage', 'Gene Expression', 'Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/genetics/metabolism', 'Glutathione/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Oxidative Stress', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'fas Receptor/*physiology']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jun 15;156(12):4722-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Susceptibility to this resistance is controlled by MHC-linked genes in a recessive manner. Several distinct specificities could be postulated to explain the strain-dependent pattern of resistance. These presumptive specificities for recognition are H-2 haplotype dependent, but the correspondence is not one-to-one. For example, resistance of H-2d or H-2b/d host to H-2 b graft operationally defines specificity-1, establishing its link with haplotype H-2b. To examine the molecular basis of specificity-1, spontaneous Dd-loss mutant clones were isolated from H-2b/d and H-2d hemopoietic cell lines, i.e., 416B of (C57BL/6 x DBA/2)F1 (B6D2F1) origin and L1210 of DBA/2 origin, both of which lack specificity-1. The expression of specificity-1 in the mutant clones was examined in vivo and in vitro. The results indicate that Dd-loss clones of 416B and L1210 lines express specificity-1. These data suggest that murine NK cell allospecificity-1 is defined primarily by the absence of the Dd molecule or other class I molecules sharing the protective motifs; no H-2b-associated genes play a relevant role. This conclusion is consistent with the missing self hypothesis of NK cell reactivity, and is in agreement with the observation that lysis of B6 targets by B6D2F1 NK cells is mediated mostly by cells that express Ly-49A and/or Ly-49G2.","['Zheng, W P', 'Kiura, K', 'Milisauskas, V K', 'DeNardin, E', 'Nakamura, I']","['Zheng WP', 'Kiura K', 'Milisauskas VK', 'DeNardin E', 'Nakamura I']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, State University of New York at Buffalo, NY 14214, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/*immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Ligands', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Transfection']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jun 15;156(12):4651-5.,,,"['CA 52519/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK 13969/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the regulation of CREB/ATF transcription factors during lymphocyte activation, studies were pursued in primary cultures of resting murine splenic T and B lymphocytes stimulated via the Ag receptor. Using consensus/CRE and proliferating cell nuclear Ag (PCNA)/CRE as probes in the DNA binding assay, we showed that a marked induction of CRE binding is associated with activation of splenic T lymphocytes with anti-CD3 Ab. CRE binding was markedly induced after 48 h; it gradually declined at 72 h, but remained elevated above control levels after 120 h. Most significant, activation by anti-CD3 was associated with a marked induction of cAMP levels that preceded the onset of DNA synthesis and the induction of IL-2 secretion and reached a peak after 48 h (9.5- to 11-fold), concomitant with the peak in CRE binding. Rapamycin, a potent immunosuppressant, inhibited the induction of cAMP levels by anti-CD3 concomitant with inhibition of CRE binding activity and arrest of DNA synthesis. A marked induction in CRE binding after 48 h was also found in splenic B lymphocytes stimulated by LPS and anti-Ig and was correlated with a 3- to 4-fold increase in the intracellular levels of cAMP. Two inducible CRE complexes were found to bind to consensus/CRE and PCNA/CRE; the major complex contained primarily CREB homodimers and was constitutively expressed in resting lymphocytes. Conversely, stimulation of lymphocytes was associated with formation of a new, slow migrating CRE complex that demonstrated high inducibility in both consensus/CRE and PCNA/CRE. We show that this de novo inducible CRE complex contains CREB and ATF2, but not ATF1. Taken collectively, these results suggest that recruitment of CREB and ATF2 to the promoter of genes is tightly regulated during activation of T and B lymphocytes and implicate a cross-talk of cAMP and non-cAMP pathways in the regulation of transcriptional processes at late stages of activation in T and B lymphocytes stimulated via the Ag receptor.","['Feuerstein, N', 'Firestein, R', 'Aiyar, N', 'He, X', 'Murasko, D', 'Cristofalo, V']","['Feuerstein N', 'Firestein R', 'Aiyar N', 'He X', 'Murasko D', 'Cristofalo V']","['Center for Gerontologic Research, Medical College of Pennsylvania and Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, PA 19129, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Activating Transcription Factors)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Polyenes)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",IM,"['Activating Transcription Factors', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Blood Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/*physiology', 'Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polyenes/pharmacology', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*physiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Sirolimus', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism']",1996/06/15 00:00,1996/06/15 00:01,['1996/06/15 00:00'],"['1996/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1996 Jun 15;156(12):4582-93.,,,"['AG00378/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AG08659/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This antibody reacts with a denatured epitope of TRAcP and requires enhancement methods to promote antigenicity in paraffin-embedded tissues. We used this antibody to systematically examine proteolytic digestion and heat denaturation conditions for epitope enhancement in both paraffin sections and fixed smears. The goal was to increase the sensitivity of the immunohistochemical stain for TRAcP. Optimal conditions for proteolytic digestion were established. Denaturation in a conventional boiling water bath was compared to microwave irradiation in several commonly used solutions. Immunohistochemistry was compared directly to TRAcP cytochemistry in fixed smears from hairy cell leukemia specimens to gauge the level of sensitivity of our improved method. Attempts were made to ""retrieve"" the 9C5 epitope from overfixed tissues and aged smears. Maximal immunoreactivity of TRAcP was achieved by microwave irradiation in a citrate or Tris buffer of pH 6.0-8.0 without the need for a subsequent protease digestion step. With this method of epitope enhancement, immunohistochemistry with antibody 9C5 was as sensitive as direct cytochemical staining of TRAcP activity. However, once a tissue specimen had been overfixed or a smear stored for a year or more, the 9C5 epitope was no longer retrievable. The key element in epitope enhancement for 9C5 immunohistochemistry is heat denaturation of the target epitope.

As a manifestation of the leukemic process, these erythroblasts are blocked in their ability to terminally differentiate. However, this block is reversible as a variety of different agents are capable of inducing differentiation of these malignant erythroblasts. The mechanisms by which these agents cause differentiation remains unknown. We report here that 5,6-dichlorobenzimidazole (DRB), which inhibits RNA polymerase II by causing premature termination of transcription, induces differentiation of these cells, including the transcriptional activation of erythroid genes. The effects of DRB on nonerythroid gene expression and on cell growth are substantially different than that of the commonly used inducer, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The shared ability of DMSO, DRB, and other unrelated agents to induce erythroid gene expression in MEL cells while having differing effects on nonerythroid gene expression and on cell growth suggests that expression of the terminally differentiated phenotype represents a common pathway that can be triggered by different mechanisms.","['Hensold, J O', 'Barth, D', 'Stratton, C A']","['Hensold JO', 'Barth D', 'Stratton CA']","['University/Ireland Cancer Center, Department of Medicine, Cleveland, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (IP25 chromosomal protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)', '53-85-0 (Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (RNA Polymerase II)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone/metabolism', 'Dichlororibofuranosylbenzimidazole/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoiesis/*drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Genes, myc', 'Globins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'RNA Polymerase II/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', '*Trans-Activators', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/07/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1996 Jul;168(1):105-13. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199607)168:1<105::AID-JCP13>3.0.CO;2-6.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199607)168:1<105::AID-JCP13>3.0.CO;2-6 [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-4652(199607)168:1<105::AID-JCP13>3.0.CO;2-6 [doi]']",['DK43414/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Addition of 5 microM D-e-MAPP to HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells resulted in a concentration- and time-dependent growth suppression accompanied by an arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle; thus mimicking the action of exogenous ceramides. Its enantiomer L-e-MAPP was without effect. Two lines of evidence suggested that D-e-MAPP may not function as a direct analog of ceramide. First, D-e-MAPP possesses a stereochemical configuration opposite to that of D-erythro-ceramide. Second, D-e-MAPP failed to activate ceramide-activated protein phosphatase in vitro. Therefore, we examined if D-e-MAPP functioned indirectly by modulating endogenous ceramide levels. The addition of D-e-MAPP to cells, but not L-e-MAPP, caused a time- and concentration-dependent elevation in endogenous ceramide levels reaching greater than 3-fold over baseline following 24 h of treatment. Both D-e-MAPP and L-e-MAPP underwent similar uptake by HL-60 cells. D-e-MAPP was poorly metabolized, and remained intact in cells, whereas L-e-MAPP underwent a time- and concentration-dependent metabolism; primarily through N-deacylation. In vitro, L-e-MAPP was metabolized by alkaline ceremidase to an extent similar to that seen with C16-ceramide. D-e-MAPP was not metabolized. Instead, D-e-MAPP inhibited alkaline ceramidase activity in vitro with an IC50 of 1-5 microM. D-e-MAPP did not modulate the activity of other ceramide metabolizing enzymes in vitro or in cells, and it was a poor inhibitor of acid ceramidase (IC50>500 microM). Finally, D-e-MAPP inhibited the metabolism of L-e-MAPP in cells. These studies demonstrate that D-e-MAPP functions as an inhibitor of alkaline ceramidase in vitro and in cells resulting in elevation in endogenous levels of ceramide with the consequent biologic effects of growth suppression and cell cycle arrest. These studies point to an important role for ceramidases in the regulation of endogenous levels of ceramide.","['Bielawska, A', 'Greenberg, M S', 'Perry, D', 'Jayadev, S', 'Shayman, J A', 'McKay, C', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Bielawska A', 'Greenberg MS', 'Perry D', 'Jayadev S', 'Shayman JA', 'McKay C', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Myristates)', '0 (Propanolamines)', '60847-25-8 (2-(N-myristoylamino)-1-phenyl-1-propanol)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)', 'EC 3.5.- (Amidohydrolases)', 'EC 3.5.1.23 (ACER1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.23 (ACER2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.23 (ASAH1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.23 (Acid Ceramidase)', 'EC 3.5.1.23 (Alkaline Ceramidase)', 'EC 3.5.1.23 (Ceramidases)']",IM,"['Acid Ceramidase', 'Alkaline Ceramidase', 'Amidohydrolases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Ceramidases', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Myristates/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/metabolism', 'Propanolamines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/24 00:00,1996/05/24 00:01,['1996/05/24 00:00'],"['1996/05/24 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/24 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/24 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1996 May 24;271(21):12646-54. doi: 10.1074/jbc.271.21.12646.,,"['10.1074/jbc.271.21.12646 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(18)95464-5 [pii]']","['DK45067/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'GM43825/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among these mechanisms the functional inactivation of two important tumor suppressor genes, namely RB1 and p53, has been widely recognized as a pivotal step in human cancerogenesis. In addition to such well-known genes, a new tumor suppressor gene, mapping on chromosome 9p21, has recently been identified and cloned. Several findings suggest that its loss of function is involved in the initiation and/or progression of an enormous number of different malignancies. This gene, named p16INK4, codifies for a small protein capable of binding to, and thus of inhibiting, some specific cyclin-dependent threonine-serine kinases that represent key enzymatic activities essential for the G1-S transition in mammalian cells. This review will summarize some aspects of the cell cycle control mechanisms, with major emphasis devoted to the role played by this recently characterized inhibitor and to the possible linkage between its inactivation and cancer formation. In particular, we will discuss these aspects in the light of the role of p16INK4 gene inactivation in the development of human acute lymphoblastic leukemias. Indeed this gene seems to be the first, and so far the only tumor suppressor gene consistently altered in specific acute hematological malignancies.

Therefore bcl-2 oncogene expression could be a key parameter for investigating the molecular mechanisms involved in the apoptosis of normal and neoplastic hematopoietic cells. METHODS: In order to evaluate bcl-2 expression in both follicular B-lymphomas carrying or not carrying the 14;18 translocation and in lymphatic leukemias, we optimized an internal standard-based method of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the rapid quantitation of bcl-2 mRNA cellular levels. A simple purification of the reverse transcription products resulted in very high PCR efficiency, so that radioactive labelling of the amplification products was avoided. RESULTS: bcl-2 mRNA levels proved to be higher in t(14;18) than in t(14;18) negative cell lines, and higher in primary leukemia pre-B cells than in early-B cells.

The NPCF have been used to predict the potential efficacy of interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) treatment in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) [Nicolson et al., Gene 159 (1995) 105-111]. Here the NPCF were probed for the presence of tightly bound c-abl, p53 and bcl-2 genes. We found that the NPCF isolated from the nuclei of leukocytes of normal individuals rarely contained detectable quantities of tightly-bound c-abl, p53 or blc-2 genes or gene sequences, whereas in CML nuclei these genes were often found in tight association with multiple NPCF. Examination of NPCF isolated from the leukocyte nuclei from patients with highly progressive CML for the presence of the three genes revealed that more NPCF contained the three tightly-bound genes than leukocyte NPCF from patients with stable or less progressed CML. These data suggest that as CML progresses to more malignant states, oncogenes, suppressor genes and apoptosis-associated genes become tightly associated with NPCF.","['Nicolson, N L', 'Talpaz, M', 'Nicolson, G L']","['Nicolson NL', 'Talpaz M', 'Nicolson GL']","['Department of Tumor Biology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Nucleoproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/genetics', 'Chromatin/chemistry/genetics', 'DNA, Complementary', 'Disease Progression', '*Genes, abl', '*Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Leukocytes/chemistry/*physiology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Nucleoproteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/03/09 00:00,1996/03/09 00:01,['1996/03/09 00:00'],"['1996/03/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/09 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/09 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene. 1996 Mar 9;169(2):173-8. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(96)88650-1.,,"['0378111996886501 [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(96)88650-1 [doi]']","['CA1630/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA44352/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63045/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This novel small Mr HMG1 protein has been expressed in prokaryotic cells and tested to establish similarities and differences in activity compared to the homologous higher Mr HMG1 protein. It has been found that the low Mr HMG1 form is not released from MEL cells following induction to erythroid differentiation, but is still effective, although with much less efficiency, when added to the external medium, in promoting acceleration in the rate of MEL cell differentiation as well as in activation of alpha-protein kinase C. Altogether these results provide evidence for the presence in MEL cells of a multigene family that encodes at least two different HMG1-type sequences most presumably involved, at distinct cellular sites, in different functions although commonly related to the promotion of cell differentiation.

Highly enriched Lin-Sca+FU2d BM cells were cultured in methylcellulose in the presence of Steel factor (SF), interleukin-7 (IL-7), and pokeweed mitogen stimulated spleen cell conditioned medium (PWM-SCM). Primary mixed myeloid colonies were replated after 8-11 days into secondary cultures containing SF and IL-7, which supported the generation of B220+sIgM- pre-B cell colonies. A number of growth factors, including IL-6, IL-11, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and IL-12 were shown to be capable of substituting for PWM-SCM to support the B lymphoid potential of primary colonies. B lymphoid potential was not supported, however, in SF + IL-3 or in SF + IL-3 plus any single growth factor (IL-1 to -12, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], G-CSF, erythropoietin [Epo], leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF], tumor necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-alpha], transforming growth factor-beta [TGF-beta], gamma interferon [IFN-gamma], or insulin-like growth factor-1 [IGF-1]), but was supported in SF + IL-3 + 5% PWM-SCM. Experiments were designed to identify the factor or factors in PWM-SCM that reverse the inhibitory effects of IL-3 on B lymphoid potential. By substituting various cytokine combinations for PWM-SCM, we determined that combinations of IL-4 + IL-6 or IL-4 + IL-11, but not IL-4 alone, can substitute for PWM-SCM to reverse the inhibitory effect of IL-3 on B lymphoid potential. Neutralizing antibodies to IL-4 completely eliminated the activity in PWM-SCM, but antibodies to IL-6 only partially inhibited the activity. IL-11 was not detected in PWM-SCM, and the activity co-purified with IL-4, but not with IL-6. Thus, IL-4 plus IL-6, IL-11, or one or more unidentified growth factors in PWM-SCM can reverse the inhibitory effects of IL-3 on early B lymphocyte development in culture.","['Neben, S', 'Donaldson, D', 'Fitz, L', 'Calvetti, J', 'Neben, T', 'Turner, K', 'Hirayama, F', 'Ogawa, M']","['Neben S', 'Donaldson D', 'Fitz L', 'Calvetti J', 'Neben T', 'Turner K', 'Hirayama F', 'Ogawa M']","['Genetics Institute, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Culture Media, Conditioned)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Pokeweed Mitogens)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Culture Media, Conditioned/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', 'Interleukin-11/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Pokeweed Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Jun;24(7):783-9.,,,['DK32294/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The CD28 signals required for induction of cytotoxicity have yet to be described. To investigate further the biochemical signaling pathways associated with CD28-dependent cytotoxicity, we have studied the human thymic leukemia cell line, YT. YT cells kill B7+ targets in a non-major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted, CD28-dependent manner. CD28 ligation on the surface of YT cells caused a rapid increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of four major cellular substrates with masses estimated to be 110, 95, 85, and 44 kDa. The 110 and 85 kDa substrates were identified as the catalytic and regulatory subunits, respectively, of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K). Engagement of CD28 caused the rapid receptor association and activation of PI3-K but did not activate phospholipase C gamma. CD28-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3-K activation was independent of p56lck protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) activity (previously reported to be associated with CD28) and was insensitive to inhibition by the PTK inhibitor herbimycin A. Two structurally and mechanistically dissimilar inhibitors of PI3-K, wortmannin and 2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one (LY294002) also failed to block CD28-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation events or the association of PI3-K with the CD28 receptor. However, both drugs inhibited CD28-dependent cytotoxicity and CD28 receptor associated PI3-K activity with IC50 values similar to the reported IC50 values for PI3-K inhibition. Although herbimycin A did not significantly block the observed CD28-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation or PI3-K activation, herbimycin did block CD28-dependent cytotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. These data support a role for PI3-K activation in the CD28-dependent initiation of cytotoxic effector function and suggest that a herbimycin sensitive step(s) is either CD28-independent, resides within a PI3-K-independent CD28 signaling pathway, or is downstream of CD28-dependent PI3-K activation.","['Lu, Y', 'Rodriguez, R', 'Bjorndahl, J', 'Phillips, C A', 'Trevillyan, J M']","['Lu Y', 'Rodriguez R', 'Bjorndahl J', 'Phillips CA', 'Trevillyan JM']","['Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Amarillo, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (CD28 Antigens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Quinones)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Benzoquinones', 'CD28 Antigens/*physiology', 'Calcium', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor)/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Phosphotyrosine/metabolism', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Wortmannin', 'src-Family Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1996 Jun;26(6):1278-84. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830260615.,,['10.1002/eji.1830260615 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we isolated the Fas-resistant variant CEM2D1R from CCRF-CEM. All of the variants were Fas+ but resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Further biochemical analysis revealed that the intracellular glutathione (GSH) content of the Fas-resistant variants was higher than in the original cells. When the Fas-resistant variants were incubated with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) or in GSH-free/cysteine-free medium to deplete GSH, Fas resistance was reversed. Incubation of the cells with cycloheximide also decreased intracellular GSH and reversed the Fas resistance. Furthermore, incubation of activated peripheral blood lymphocytes with BSO enhanced Fas-mediated apoptosis. When the Fas-sensitive cells were incubated with N-acetylcysteine (NAC), intracellular GSH was increased and Fas-mediated apoptosis was blocked. In contrast, Fas-resistant variants, as well as Fas-sensitive cells pre-treated with NAC remained susceptible to allogeneic lymphokine-activated killer cells, most likely due to perforin-dependent killing.

The decrease in the rate of replicon initiation is affected differently by different agents such as cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), cycloheximide, staurosporine, and 3-aminobenzamide.

These data indicate that the model of differentiated HL-60 cells currently used for the study of resistance to growth inhibition is inappropriate. HL-60 cells can be used to measure growth inhibition and at higher doses cytotoxicity. However, the differentiated, nonproliferative, cells can only be used to measure direct cytotoxicity. Therefore, the results of studies directly comparing the effects of ET-18-OCH3 in proliferative HL-60 cells and quiescent DMSO-treated HL-60 cells should be reevaluated. An evaluation of the effects of low concentrations of ET-18-OCH3 (0.5-1.5 microM) in proliferative HL-60 cells indicated that ET-18-OCH3 was an effective cytostatic agent at nontoxic concentrations.

The two types of agents are thought to be synergistic in their actions against malignant blasts but the mechanism for this synergism is incompletely described. This study sought to determine whether the combination of two rather than one anti-metabolite with the topo II-reactive intercalator mitoxantrone would be greater than the effect of the single antimetabolite ara-C on mitoxantrone's cytotoxic actions. We also aimed to determine a mechanism for synergism should it occur. The model system used was K562 human leukemia cells. The second anti-metabolite selected was F-ara-A, the active form of fludarabine. The resultant combination (F-ara-A, ara-C, and a topo II reactive drug) is one currently being tested against acute myelogenous leukemia in clinical trials. F-ara-A itself had little effect on the cytotoxicity or the topo II-mediated DNA cleaving actions of mitoxantrone, while ara-C potentiated these actions as it does those of other topo II-reactive drugs. Surprisingly F-ara-A enhanced the actions of ara-C on mitoxantrone-associated cytotoxicity by at least an order of magnitude. The effect of the addition of F-ara-A to ara-C on mitoxantrone-induced DNA cleavage was considerably smaller, but present. Antimetabolite treatment did not increase the amount of topo II within cells measured directly by immunoblotting or indirectly by quantifying the maximum number of topo II-DNA complexes stabilized by mitoxantrone. Rather, the anti-metabolites altered the distribution of the cells in the cell cycle. Antimetabolite treatment caused a large increase in S-phase cells, a phase in which cells are more sensitive to topo II-reactive drugs than the associated topo II-mediated DNA cleavage would predict. Therefore, it is likely that this shift in the distribution of the cells within the cell cycle accounts for both the enhanced cytotoxicity of mitoxantrone in antimetabolite pretreated cells and the discrepancy between the magnitude of antimetabolite action on topo II-mediated DNA cleavage.","['Loughlin, S', 'Gandhi, V', 'Plunkett, W', 'Zwelling, L A']","['Loughlin S', 'Gandhi V', 'Plunkett W', 'Zwelling LA']","['Department of Clinical Investigation, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Mitoxantrone/*toxicity', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Vidarabine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;38(3):261-8. doi: 10.1007/s002800050480.,,['10.1007/s002800050480 [doi]'],"['CA28596/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA57629/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A model targeting high-dose topoisomerase II poisons to CNS tumors.,203-9,"The catalytic cycle of topoisomerase II is the target of some of the most successful antitumor agents used today, e.g. etoposide (VP-16), in the treatment of testicular cancer and small-cell lung cancer. The cell kill mediated by topoisomerase II poisons can be antagonized by distinct drug types. Thus, we have demonstrated etoposide antagonism with the type-II anthracycline aclarubicin, the antimalarial drug chloroquine, and the cardioprotective agent ICRF-187. In other setups, combinations of agonist and antagonists have led to high-dose regimens for counteracting drug resistance. Thus, the exploitation of folinic acid rescue for methotrexate toxicity and the use of mesna to protect against cyclophosphamide toxicity have enabled the use of high-dose methotrexate and cyclophosphamide protocols. Using a similar approach, we have studied possible ways to apply antagonists to topoisomerase II poisons. NDF1-hybrid female mice were treated with the various drugs and drug combinations. Lethality (LD10 and LD50 values) was computed by use of the maximum-likelihood method, and the antitumor effect of the drugs was compared in mice inoculated i.p. with either L1210 cells or Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. In addition, the compounds were tested on L1210 cells inoculated intracranially. The toxicity of the various drugs was evaluated by weight and leukocyte counts. ICRF-187 rescues healthy mice from lethal doses of topoisomerase II poisons. In mice the ICRF-187 LD10 was 500 mg/kg. Within a wide non-toxic dose range (50-250 mg/kg) of ICRF-187 we found protection against m-AMSA and etoposide lethality. Thus, the LD10 of etoposide increased from 34 mg/kg for the single agent to 122 mg/kg for its combination with ICRF-187, corresponding to a 3.6-fold etoposide dose escalation. In contrast, ICRF-187 did not protect against lethal doses of the non-topoisomerase II-directed drug paclitaxel. We further investigated the anti-tumor effect of equitoxic schedules in mice inoculated i.p. with L1210 or Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. The L1210-bearing mice appeared to obtain a larger increase in life span from the etoposide and ICRF-187 combination as compared with etoposide alone, whereas this was not the case in mice inoculated with Ehrlich ascites tumor cells. As the hydrophilic ICRF-187 is not expected to cross the blood-brain barrier, in contrast to the lipophilic etoposide, we investigated the effect of the drug combination in mice inoculated intracranially with L1210 cells. We obtained a significant increase in life span in mice treated with ICRF-187 + etoposide as compared with mice treated with an equitoxic dose of etoposide alone. Thus, there appear to be potential routes by which one can benefit from this antagonism. ICRF-187 is a powerful nontoxic protector against the lethality of the topoisomerase II-directed drugs etoposide and m-AMSA in vivo. A brain tumor model demonstrates the superiority of high-dose etoposide treatment with ICRF-187 protection as compared with etoposide treatment alone. This implies that tumors in the brain can be reached by cytotoxic drug doses and that normal tissues can be protected due to differences in drug transport across the blood-brain barrier. ICRF-187 is therefore a promising lead compound for the development of schedules using high-dose topoisomerase II poisons in the treatment of brain tumors and metastases.","['Holm, B', 'Jensen, P B', 'Sehested, M']","['Holm B', 'Jensen PB', 'Sehested M']","['Department of Oncology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '5AR83PR647 (Razoxane)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Blood-Brain Barrier/drug effects', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/drug therapy/pathology', 'Central Nervous System Neoplasms/drug therapy/*enzymology/mortality', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*drug effects', 'Etoposide/*antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Female', 'Injections, Intraperitoneal', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia L1210/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Paclitaxel/antagonists & inhibitors/toxicity', 'Razoxane/administration & dosage/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1996;38(3):203-9. doi: 10.1007/s002800050472.,,['10.1007/s002800050472 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our case supports the speculation that #3 abnormalities with breakpoints q21 and q26 affect a pluripotent stem cell and suggests that megakaryocytic involvement may not be pathognomonic in hematologic abnormalities with t(3;3)(q21;26).","['Madahar, C J', 'Levin, M', 'Roy, J', 'Conti, M']","['Madahar CJ', 'Levin M', 'Roy J', 'Conti M']","['Clinical Cytogenetics Laboratory, Staten Island University Hospital, NY 10309, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,,IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Erythropoiesis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Thrombocytopenia/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 Mar;87(1):11-3. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(95)00219-7.,,"['0165460895002197 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(95)00219-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Childrens Cancer Group/National Institutes of Health Report.,169-76,"BACKGROUND: It is not known if therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) during childhood increases the risk of birth defects in the offspring of adult survivors. The Childrens Cancer Group (CCG), in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults successfully treated for childhood ALL to determine if their offspring had an increased incidence of birth defects compared with the offspring of their sibling controls. METHODS: Study subjects were patients who had been enrolled on CCG ALL protocols, who were treated for ALL prior to age 20, who survived at least 2 years, and who were at least age 18. Survivors (N=593) and sibling controls (N=409) were interviewed by telephone. RESULTS: The mean age of survivors was 22.6 years; the mean age of controls was 25.2 years. Among survivors, 93 (15.7%) had given birth to or fathered a total of 140 live-born offspring, (mean age, 3.4 years), and 122 (29.8%) sibling controls had given birth to or fathered a total of 228 live-born offspring (mean age, 5.9 years). There was no difference in the rate of birth defects between offspring of survivors and offspring of controls (3.6% [5 of 140] vs. 3.5% [8 of 228]; relative risk, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.34, 3.05). No specific ALL therapy was associated with an increased rate of birth defects. Only female survivors reported offspring with birth defects (P=0.0735). CONCLUSIONS: Adult survivors of childhood ALL in our study were not at greater risk for having offspring with birth defects compared with sibling controls. Although this is the largest group of ALL survivors studied to date, the number of offspring is still not large enough to detect small but significant differences in rare events such as birth defects. Studies following this cohort into later adulthood and studies of additional ALL survivors are necessary to adequately quantify the risks.","['Kenney, L B', 'Nicholson, H S', 'Brasseux, C', 'Mills, J L', 'Robison, L L', 'Zeltzer, L K', 'Meadows, A T', 'Reaman, G H', 'Byrne, J']","['Kenney LB', 'Nicholson HS', 'Brasseux C', 'Mills JL', 'Robison LL', 'Zeltzer LK', 'Meadows AT', 'Reaman GH', 'Byrne J']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's National Medical Center, Washington, DC, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Congenital Abnormalities/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', '*Survivors']",1996/07/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/07/01 00:00'],"['1996/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1996 Jul 1;78(1):169-76. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960701)78:1<169::AID-CNCR23>3.0.CO;2-X.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960701)78:1<169::AID-CNCR23>3.0.CO;2-X [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19960701)78:1<169::AID-CNCR23>3.0.CO;2-X [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These recombinant virions were used to infect a human erythroleukemia cell line which normally does not express the beta-globin gene (K562), or a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (KB). Cell populations resistant to G418, a neomycin analogue, were obtained following infections with the recombinant virions, indicating high-efficiency transduction of the chimeric gene as well as functional activity of the transduced neo gene in both cell types. Southern blot analysis using a human beta-globin DNA probe substantiated stable integration of the exogenous beta-globin allele in these cells. There was no expression of the transduced beta-globin gene in K562 or KB cells infected with the v beta m-globin virus. High-level expression of the transduced beta-globin gene occurred only in the vHS2-beta m-globin virus-infected K562 cells, but not in KB cells, as determined by Northern blot as well as RNase protection analyses. Expression of the human beta-globin protein could also be detected in approximately 10-20% of the vHS2-beta m-globin virus-infected K562 cells.

Numerous studies performed to date have demonstrated significant benefits from the use of these cytokines. The side effect profiles, particularly for ""later acting"" growth factors, indicate that they are generally well tolerated by most patients. The table summarizes the potential indications for hematopoietic growth factor use as discussed in this article, as justified by current evidence of benefit, harm, and cost effectiveness resulting from their use in various clinical settings. It has been clearly demonstrated in standard-dose chemotherapy regimens that these agents shorten the duration of myelosuppression, reduce the incidence of significant infection, can shorten hospital stay, and reduce antibiotic use for most patients, although the cost/benefit ratio for growth factors such as G-CSF makes this a cost-effective approach only for regimens with a high (40 percent or more) incidence of febrile neutropenia. Limited indirect evidence supports the use of growth factors in patients with a prior episode of fever and neutropenia. The suppressive approach to growth factor use could potentially benefit patients with documented infection or clinical deterioration, but it has not otherwise been shown to be a particularly effective or cost-effective approach. Administration of hematopoietic growth factors has been instrumental in facilitating both autologous and allogeneic peripheral progenitor cell mobilization and techniques such as ex vivo expansion. There is an increasing body of data supporting the use of high-dose chemotherapy regimens with progenitor cell rescue for a number of malignancies and limited data supporting the benefits of maintaining dose-intensity for certain malignancies in standard-dose settings. Although of continuing concern, clinically significant evidence of disease stimulation and recurrence has not been unequivocally demonstrated in studies to date. A comprehensive set of evidence-based guidelines has recently been published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology. As often is the case, current studies have perhaps generated more questions than answers. Future investigation will undoubtedly focus on use of hematopoietic growth factors in conjunction with other techniques, such as outpatient-based treatment of febrile neutropenia, CD34-positive stem cell selection in autologous transplantation, selective manipulation of T-cell subsets (to decrease the incidence of severe graft-versus-host disease) in allogeneic transplantation, and high-dose therapy with stem cell transplantation.","['Bociek, R G', 'Armitage, J O']","['Bociek RG', 'Armitage JO']","['University of Ottawa, Department of Medicine, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,CA Cancer J Clin,CA: a cancer journal for clinicians,0370647,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'J27WDC343N (Mesothelin)']",IM,"['Anemia/etiology/therapy', 'Animals', 'Erythropoietin/physiology/therapeutic use', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/physiology/therapeutic use', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/physiology/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/adverse effects/physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mesothelin', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Neoplasms/complications/*therapy', 'Proteins/physiology/therapeutic use']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,CA Cancer J Clin. 1996 May-Jun;46(3):165-84. doi: 10.3322/canjclin.46.3.165.,138,['10.3322/canjclin.46.3.165 [doi]'],,['CA Cancer J Clin. 1996 May-Jun;46(3):131-3.

Relapse of the underlying disease is the major cause for failure of ABMT. Relapse can result fom tumor cells either surviving in the patient or reinfused in the autograft. Genetic marking of autografted cells has demonstrated that transplanted cells contribute to relapse. This finding supports the use of purged autografts. Several purging techniques have been used. Immunologic purging using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) PM-81 (anti-CD15) has been used by our center with a long-term DFS in 50% of AML patients. PM-81 reacts with 90% of AML patients, and we have used it for over 10 years. We have investigated a two-stage purging technique involving initial selection for CD34+ cells followed by mAb purging in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvests. This method achieved up to a 7 log diminution in leukemic cells and 1-4 log reduction in CD15+ cells, without a significant loss of hematopoietic progenitor cells. This double-purging technique has the advantages of cytoreduction, elimination of CD34- leukemic cells, and possible improvement in the clinical efficacy of purging by concentrating for CD34+ cells. Cytoreduction by CD34 enrichment followed by purging may facilitate the use of PBSC transplants in AML.","['Nimgaonkar, M', 'Kemp, A', 'Lancia, J', 'Ball, E D']","['Nimgaonkar M', 'Kemp A', 'Lancia J', 'Ball ED']","['Department of Medicine, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, PA 15213, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Hematother,Journal of hematotherapy,9306048,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Complement System Proteins/*physiology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/therapy', 'Lewis X Antigen/*immunology', 'Reference Values', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Hematother. 1996 Feb;5(1):39-48. doi: 10.1089/scd.1.1996.5.39.,,['10.1089/scd.1.1996.5.39 [doi]'],['CA1888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Task Force is a small group appointed in 1994 by the regional Medical Association and the state's ministry of social affairs. It includes five professionals from the fields of environmental toxicology and hygiene, Public Health, epidemiology and cancer pathology. In agreement with the local Public Health administration and the ministry the Task Force organized a retrospective screening of all incident leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma cases (ICD-9 codes 200-208) within a (5-10 km) around the small community (population on December 31st 1993: 72000) that had occurred after January 1st 1990. Any practising physician (response rate 78%), hospital (100 %), oncological centre (100%), and tumour registry (100%) serving the region were asked to notify all relevant cases to the Task Force. Additionally spontaneous case reports were elicited, and all death certificates from the a.m. time period were screened for by two Public Health administrations. We identified 202 single cases for further analysis. Comparative data for the entire region and single communities came from two cancer registries, the Danish and that of the state of Saarland/FRG, and allowed for calculating the expected number of cases by indirect standardisation. While Hodgkin's lymphomas and myelomas were (insignificantly) less frequent than expected, an excess of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and leukaemias (all types combined) was observed. Standardised incidence ratios for the whole region varied between 1.54 and 1.68 with significant and consistent increases only for the group of leukaemias among adults (aged 15+). All results were reported to both the public and administrative/professional bodies together with specific recommendations. The reactions showed a good acceptance of the Task Force and its work.","['Raspe, H', 'Kohlmann, T', 'Peters, R']","['Raspe H', 'Kohlmann T', 'Peters R']",['Institut fur Sozialmedizin der Medizinischen Universitat Lubeck.'],['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Gesundheitswesen,Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany)),9204210,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/epidemiology/etiology', 'Registries/statistics & numerical data', 'Risk Factors']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gesundheitswesen. 1996 Mar;58(3):138-46.,,,,,Ein Leukamiecluster im Landkreis Pinneberg?

Based on the morphological and histochemical examination, the leukemic cells were classified primarily as FAB type M4. However, 2 years later, in relapse, the cells changed their morphology and were hence specified as FAB type M2 (slightly positive for acid phosphatase and Sudan black). The cells established have now been in culture for approximately 11 months and display nearly 100% CD4/5/7/15/25/71/120a,b at varying densities. Some of them spontaneously and reversibly become either CD34 + /38- or CD34 - /38+, yet the majority of the cells remain negative for both. All attempts to separate the cells with a distinct phenotype by limiting dilution or sorting through a flow cytometer failed repeatedly. The subsets, enriched up to 98% (regardless of their primary immunophenotype CD34 - / 38-, CD34 + /38-, or CD34 - /38+), soon displayed a phenotypical constellation similar to that before sorting. The ratio of CD34- to CD34+ seems to be influenced by the cell density: The greater the cell-to-cell contact, the lower the percentage of CD34-expressing cells. Some of the cells apparently differentiate into T-cell phenotype and acquire CD3 and T-cell receptor (TCR) alpha/beta molecules. While the quantity of CD34-expressing cells significantly increased in the presence of dexamethasone (10(-7) M), and some of them additionally acquired CD33 antigen, the percentage of CD3-positive cells was enhanced by adding 1% DMSO in medium. In contrast, cytokines such as IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, G-CSF, GM-CSF, or SCF (c-kit ligand) altered neither the proliferation capacity nor the phenotypical constellation of LW/SO cells (each tested alone). Although normal karyotype was obtained from the bone marrow cells, the LW/SO cells revealed a homogeneous chromosomal composition of 45, X, -X, der(9) inv(9) (p12q13) del(9) (p22?). These data suggested that LW/SO cells might be the leukemic counterpart of putative pre-CD34-positive progenitors. In order to substantiate this assumption, we analyzed the expression of other so-called T-cell markers on CD34+ cells from peripheral blood stem cell aphereses of five patients who later underwent high-dose chemotherapy and subsequent stem cell retransfusion. These data clearly revealed that a considerable amount of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors co-express CD2/4/(5)/(7)/25 at an early stage of differentiation, and support the notion that CD34-negative LW/SO cells with the surface markers CD4/5/7/25 are probably phenotypical representatives of pluripotent stem cell. Hence, not all CD34-negative populations with so-called T-cell surface markers should be considered T-cells; some may constitute the ancestor of CD34 antigen-expressing progenitors.","['Oez, S', 'Trautmann, U', 'Smetak, M', 'Birkmann, J', 'al salemeh, S', 'Gebhart, E', 'Gallmeier, W M']","['Oez S', 'Trautmann U', 'Smetak M', 'Birkmann J', 'al salemeh S', 'Gebhart E', 'Gallmeier WM']","['Medical Clinic 5, Klinikum der Stadt Nurnberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase)', 'EC 3.2.2.5 (CD38 protein, human)', 'EC 3.2.2.6 (ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1)']",IM,"['ADP-ribosyl Cyclase', 'ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1', 'Acid Phosphatase/analysis', '*Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Cell Communication', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*immunology/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Middle Aged', 'N-Glycosyl Hydrolases/analysis', 'Periodic Acid-Schiff Reaction', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1996 May;72(5):307-16. doi: 10.1007/s002770050177.,,['10.1007/s002770050177 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was designed to analyze how far groups defined according to common cytogenetic features correlated with their position in either the Kiel (KC) or the REAL classification. Cytogenetic analyses were performed on material from 175 patients with lymphoid neoplasms (LN). Samples were prepared from peripheral blood and bone marrow in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), from bone marrow in multiple myeloma (MM), and from lymph node biopsies in lymphomas. The results of this study support the inclusion of ALL, MM, and extranodal lymphomas into a comprehensive classification, because their chromosomal aberrations were always characteristic for LN. From the cytogenetic point of view, a subgroup of ALL appears as a leukemic manifestation of lymphoblastic lymphoma. MM have structural aberrations of chromosomes 1, 11, and 14 and secondary aberrations of chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 12, 13, and 18, all of which are characteristic for lymphatic disease. The groups with follicle center cell lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma correlate well with our results both in the low-grade subtype and in the blastic variant type, the majority of cases demonstrating t(14; 18) and its variants and t(11; 14), respectively. In contrast, the group of diffuse large B-cell (DLB) lymphomas proved to be heterogeneous on the basis of our cytogenetic results. Accordingly, we would suggest keeping the immunoblastic lymphoma (IB) subtype defined by the KC. IB demonstrates no stem line aberration in common with any other group and seems to be characterized by stem line aberrations involving chromosomes 3 and 6. As some DLB lymphomas have a t(14;18) or variant translocations involving chromosome 18, they should either be separated as a subgroup or included into the group of follicle center lymphomas.","['Nowotny, H', 'Karlic, H', 'Gruner, H', 'Hirsch, J', 'Vesely, M', 'Nader, A', 'Heinz, R']","['Nowotny H', 'Karlic H', 'Gruner H', 'Hirsch J', 'Vesely M', 'Nader A', 'Heinz R']","['Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Leukemia Research and Hematology, Hanusch Hospital, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymph Nodes/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/classification/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/classification/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1996 May;72(5):291-301. doi: 10.1007/s002770050175.,,['10.1007/s002770050175 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Keto and liaro did not markedly potentiate the activity of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 or its analogs in MG-63 or HL-60 cells.

The unregulated deposition of cholesteryl esters, as lipid droplets within the cytoplasm of these cells, is responsible for the formation of foam cells; this process is thought to be regulated by the balance between cholesterol esterification, by acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), and hydrolysis, by neutral cholesteryl ester hydrolase (nCEH). This study examines the importance of the balance between these two enzymes in determining the efflux of cholesterol from human (THP-1) macrophages. The presence of modified lipoprotein, or of 25-hydroxycholesterol, markedly increased cholesterol esterification in these cells and these effects were potently inhibited by the presence of the ACAT inhibitor, 447C88. In the absence of HDL, an acceptor particle, there was little or no hydrolysis of the cholesteryl ester pool and no efflux of cholesterol to the extracellular milieu; addition of HDL led to a partial (36%) reduction in cholesteryl esters, an effect which was not enhanced by the inhibition of ACAT. This suggested that the stored cholesteryl esters in human (THP-1) macrophages, unlike those in mouse peritoneal macrophages, were relatively resistant to removal by efflux to HDL. Efflux of newly synthesised free cholesterol from these macrophages was increased by HDL in a saturable manner, suggesting that the lack of reduction of stored cholesteryl esters was due to impaired mobilisation of cholesteryl esters to free cholesterol via nCEH. Indeed, nCEH activity in these macrophages was much lower than in mouse peritoneal macrophages, and appeared to be down-regulated in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol or modified lipoproteins; this loss of nCEH activity was prevented by the ACAT inhibitor 447C88. The efflux of stored cholesteryl esters from THP-1 macrophages therefore appears to be limited by the activity of nCEH.","['Graham, A', 'Angell, A D', 'Jepson, C A', 'Yeaman, S J', 'Hassall, D G']","['Graham A', 'Angell AD', 'Jepson CA', 'Yeaman SJ', 'Hassall DG']","['Biology Division, Wellcome Research Laboratories, Kent, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Atherosclerosis,Atherosclerosis,0242543,"['0 (447C88)', '0 (Cholesterol Esters)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxycholesterols)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '767JTD2N31 (25-hydroxycholesterol)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.3.1.26 (Sterol O-Acyltransferase)', 'EC 3.1.1.13 (Sterol Esterase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cholesterol/*metabolism', 'Cholesterol Esters/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Esterification', 'Female', 'Foam Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrolysis', 'Hydroxycholesterols/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Lipoproteins/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Macrophages, Peritoneal/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology', 'Sterol Esterase/*metabolism', 'Sterol O-Acyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Atherosclerosis. 1996 Feb;120(1-2):135-45. doi: 10.1016/0021-9150(95)05695-5.,,"['0021-9150(95)05695-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0021-9150(95)05695-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapy by BCNU and DTIC is reduced by dose-limiting hematological toxicity as a result of low MGMT repair activity in bone marrow cells. In this study, we have constructed a Moloney murine leukemia virus retroviral vector containing the human mgmt gene. High-titer retrovirus producer cells lines have been generated. Retroviral-mediated transfer of the human mgmt gene into murine multi-potent hematopoietic stem cells, FDCP-1, resulted in the expression of a high level of MGMT activity. In comparison with the control cells that were transduced with the parent vector, the MGMT-expressing clones were considerably more resistant to the cytotoxicity of the methylating agents, such as N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, N-nitroso-N-methyl-urea, and temozolomide, as well as the chloroethylating agents 1-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea and BCNU.

Thiopurine methylation occurs to a large extent in vivo and in vitro. In this reaction, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), produced from methionine and ATP, is converted into S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (AdoHcy) which, in turn, is hydrolyzed into homocysteine. Remethylation of homocysteine into methionine is inhibited by methotrexate (MTX). In cultured lymphoblasts, AdoMet: AdoHcy ratio and DNA methylation decrease after incubation with 6MP. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of high-dose 6MP on the methylation capacity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Five patients received 4 courses with high-dose intravenous MTX (5' g.m-2 in 24 hr) immediately followed by high-dose 6MP (1300 mg.m-2 in 24 hr). Five control patients received high-dose MTX and oral 6MP (25 mg.m -2 daily for 8 weeks). Leucovorin rescue was started at 36 hr in both groups. In the intravenous 6MP group, 6-methylmercaptopurine, its riboside, and 6-methylmercapto-8-hydroxypurine were detectable in plasma in concentrations of 0.3-2.6 muM (6MP steady state levels: 11.6 muM). In red blood cells, mean methylthioinosine nucleotide levels were one third of those of ATP (13.1 nmol/10(8)). AdoHcy levels (10 pmol/10(8)) remained constant in both groups and AdoMet was not detectable ( < 20 pmol/10(8)). In both groups, plasma homocysteine increased and methionine decreased following administration of MTX. The delay in the recovery of methionine in the intravenous 6MP group after MTX infusion is probably the result of an increased demand on methyl groups during 6MP infusion.","['Keuzenkamp-Jansen, C W', 'De Abreu, R A', 'Blom, H J', 'Bokkerink, J P', 'Trijbels, J M']","['Keuzenkamp-Jansen CW', 'De Abreu RA', 'Blom HJ', 'Bokkerink JP', 'Trijbels JM']","['Laboratory of Pediatrics, University Hospital St. Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0LVT1QZ0BA (Homocysteine)', '7LP2MPO46S (S-Adenosylmethionine)', '979-92-0 (S-Adenosylhomocysteine)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Homocysteine/blood', 'Humans', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Methionine/blood', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Methylation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Purine Nucleotides/blood', 'S-Adenosylhomocysteine/blood', 'S-Adenosylmethionine/blood']",1996/05/03 00:00,1996/05/03 00:01,['1996/05/03 00:00'],"['1996/05/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/03 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/03 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1996 May 3;51(9):1165-71. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(96)00032-9.,,"['0006-2952(96)00032-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(96)00032-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The activity of HIV promoter induced by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate was suppressed by the addition of tannic acid. On the other hand, HTLV-1 promoter activity induced by the p40(tax) expression plasmid was not affected by tannic acid treatment. Deletion analysis of the HIV promoter revealed that a 30-bp element located immediately upstream of NF-kappa B motifs was responsible for the suppressive effect of tannic acid.

Its effects are mediated by its nuclear receptor (VDR). Efficient gene activation requires the heterodimerization of VDR with Retinoid X Receptors (RXR). In the present study using specific antibodies, we analyzed the expression of the RXR alpha protein in blood mononuclear cells from acute myeloid patients (AML) (10 cases) and from myelomonocytic cell lines arrested at different stages of differentiation. We observed that the RXR alpha expression increased during myelomonocytic differentiation, since the highest levels were found in AML samples and in myelomonocytic cell lines having the highest amounts of monocytic precursors. We also demonstrated that fresh leukemic cells, whatever their stage of differentiation, as well as myelomonocytic cell lines, respond to VD by an increase in RXR alpha levels. Combinations of all-trans retinoic acid (RA) and VD, in some cases, increased this effect. This response suggests the involvement of RXR alpha in monocytic differentiation upon VD treatment.","['Defacque, H', 'Commes, T', 'Legouffe, E', 'Sevilla, C', 'Rossi, J F', 'Rochette-Egly, C', 'Marti, J']","['Defacque H', 'Commes T', 'Legouffe E', 'Sevilla C', 'Rossi JF', 'Rochette-Egly C', 'Marti J']","['INSERM U431, Laboratoire de Biologie Cellulaire, Universite de Montpellier II, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,"['0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*metabolism', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/18 00:00,1996/03/18 00:01,['1996/03/18 00:00'],"['1996/03/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/18 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/18 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1996 Mar 18;220(2):315-22. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.1996.0403.,,"['S0006-291X(96)90403-9 [pii]', '10.1006/bbrc.1996.0403 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of iron in erythroid cell heme synthesis.,289-94,"K562 cells were used to investigate the factors that control hemoglobin (Hb) synthesis. Treatment with sodium butyrate enhanced Hb synthesis and glycophorin A expression. delta-Aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) activity and Hb levels simultaneously increased to a similar extent and with a similar time course, and the increases were dependent on the concentration of diferric transferrin (FeTf) in the culture medium. Addition of exogenous delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in Hb content. Hb synthesis was inhibited 50% after addition of succinylacetone (SA), a potent inhibitor of delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase. These findings suggest that ALAS is a key enzyme in the eight steps of de novo heme synthesis and that iron, including FeTf, plays a central role in Hb synthesis through control of ALAS activity in erythroid differentiating cells. On the other hand, erythropoietin (EPO) treatment had no effect on Hb synthesis and slightly suppressed glycophorin A expression. Hemin enhanced Hb synthesis in the K562 cells but not glycophorin A expression. The addition of ALA, SA, or FeTf to hemin-treated cells caused no significant changes in Hb synthesis. Butyrate, EPO, and hemin acted on the K562 cells in different ways and caused different biochemical changes in the Hb synthesis process.","['Kawasaki, N', 'Morimoto, K', 'Tanimoto, T', 'Hayakawa, T']","['Kawasaki N', 'Morimoto K', 'Tanimoto T', 'Hayakawa T']","['Division of Biological Chemistry and Biologicals, National Institute of Health Sciences, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (Transferrin)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)']",IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Aminolevulinic Acid/pharmacology', 'Butyrates/pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Glycophorins/biosynthesis', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'Heptanoates/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Transferrin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/15 00:00,1996/04/15 00:01,['1996/04/15 00:00'],"['1996/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1996 Apr 15;328(2):289-94. doi: 10.1006/abbi.1996.0175.,,"['S0003-9861(96)90175-7 [pii]', '10.1006/abbi.1996.0175 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It eventually transforms into accelerated and blastic phases, which are generally fatal. CML was one of the first diseases in which a specific chromosomal abnormality was identified, a t(9;22)(q34;q11) or Philadelphia chromosome. CML had been traditionally treated with conventional chemotherapy with hydroxyurea or busulfan. Although these agents can achieve hematologic remissions in most patients, no evidence of sustained disappearance of the chromosomal abnormality was evident. Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) has been able to achieve hematologic and cytogenic remissions in a significant number of patients, and recent studies show a survival advantage for patients treated with IFN-alpha compared with those treated with conventional chemotherapy. The results of these studies are discussed, and the reasons for discordance among different investigators analyzed in this review. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) may be curative in some patients with CML. The benefits and limitations of this approach in the treatment of CML are also discussed and the results of different alternatives compared. Other alternatives of therapy, including newer chemotherapeutic agents, combinations of IFN-alpha with other agents, and autologous BMT, are presented.

We carried out investigations of autoantibodies against Tcr peptide-defined epitopes in retroviral infections of humans (HIV-1) and mice (LP-BM5 strain of murine leukemia virus) to determine whether infection with these agents disrupted the regulation of the production of these antibodies. Retroviral infection in humans resulted in increased levels of autoantibody production against putative immunoregulatory regions of the Tcr beta chain (V beta CDR1 and Fr3), a result reflecting a disruption of regulation. In addition, antigenic mimicry was observed with a cross-reaction shared between the common portion of the V3 neutralizing loop of the HIV-1 gp120 molecule and the joining segment of T-cell receptors (J beta). Infection of mice with the defective retrovirus resulted in the induction of antibodies directed particularly against V beta CDR1 peptide-defined determinants. Analysis of the virally induced response to a set of 8 CDR1 peptide epitopes indicated a selectivity to the process. It was possible to partially reverse aberrant cytokine changes correlated with the onset of murine MAIDS by administration of T-cell receptor peptides in saline. These results show that retroviral infection in humans and mice has a profound dysfunctional effect on the regulation of autoantibodies to T-cell receptors. The function of these autoantibodies in the immunopathogenesis of acquired immunodeficiency remains to be determined.","['Marchalonis, J J', 'Lake, D F', 'Schluter, S F', 'Dehghanpisheh, K', 'Watson, R R', 'Ampel, N M', 'Galgiani, J N']","['Marchalonis JJ', 'Lake DF', 'Schluter SF', 'Dehghanpisheh K', 'Watson RR', 'Ampel NM', 'Galgiani JN']","['University of Arizona, Tucson, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/immunology', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Autoantibodies/biosynthesis/*immunology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'HIV-1', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Mimicry', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/*immunology', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell', 'Retroviridae Infections/*immunology']",1995/01/01 00:00,1995/01/01 00:01,['1995/01/01 00:00'],"['1995/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1995/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1995/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 1995;383:211-22. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4615-1891-4_22.,,['10.1007/978-1-4615-1891-4_22 [doi]'],['GM-45832/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Allogeneic BMT using the marrow of an HLA-identical family member still provides the most effective method of BMT. Conventional indications for this form of BMT are chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute leukemias presenting with adverse risk factors, myelodysplastic syndromes and severe aplastic anemia. If performed early in the disease course (e.g. during the chronic phase of CML or first remission of acute leukemia and MDS) allogeneic BMT cures 50 to 60% of patients. About 20% die of therapy related complications, e.g. graft versus host disease (GvHD), fatal infections or venoocclusive disease of the liver (VOD) and about 20% of patients succumb to relapse of their hematologic disorder. 80% presenting with severe aplastic anemia can be cured, if allogeneic BMT is performed soon after diagnosis without previous immunosuppressive therapy and blood transfusions. BMT with the marrow of a matched unrelated donor or autologous BMT are increasingly used as alternative procedures. A rate of lethal complications as high as 50% hinders rapid extension of BMT with unrelated donors. Therefore, this form of BMT should be restricted to young patients with leukemias, who cannot achieve long-term remission with conventional chemotherapy (in case of acute leukemias) or alpha-interferon (in case of CML). Reconstitution of hematopoiesis is more rapid after peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) compared with autologous BMT. Therefore, PBSCT will replace autologous BMT in most cases. Most favourable results of PBSCT have been reported in patients with malignant lymphomas after relapse or inferior response to primary induction therapy. Due to the higher relapse rate autologous BMT is inferior to allogeneic BMT in leukemia patients. Trials are required to clarify the potential role of myeloablative therapy with stem cell support in the treatment of patients with solid tumors. Many of the preliminary results already published are unsatisfactory and data of larger trials are still lacking. Therefore, BMT or PBSCT cannot be recommended generally for the therapy of patients with solid tumors.","['Heyll, A', 'Sohngen, D', 'Minning, H', 'Meckenstock, G', 'Aul, C', 'Schneider, W']","['Heyll A', 'Sohngen D', 'Minning H', 'Meckenstock G', 'Aul C', 'Schneider W']","['Klinik fur Hamatologie, Universitat Dusseldorf.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Praxis (Bern 1994),Praxis,101468093,,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphoma/therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy']",1996/03/19 00:00,1996/03/19 00:01,['1996/03/19 00:00'],"['1996/03/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Praxis (Bern 1994). 1996 Mar 19;85(12):378-86.,26,,,,"Indikationen, Durchfuhrung und Risiken der Knochenmarktransplantation Im Erwachsenenalter.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Particularly, nodules and/or wedge-shaped lesions with a ground-glass halo are a useful early feature, best detected by HRCT. Early therapy with amphotericin B may improve survival chances. Therefore, in neutropenia patients we decided, when possible, to perform high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) as soon as fever appears. This was feasible in 8 of 32 patients with invasive aspergillosis examined with HRCT. Immediate treatment with amphotericin B in one such patient showing a nodule with the halo sign allowed the lesion to completely disappear. The authors describe the frequency of different radiologic signs in 32 patients, as observed in 54 HRCT exams; the results are compared with those obtained with conventional CT and chest X-ray.

Some activist groups believe the hazard to be so great that they are calling for closure of schools and other public facilities near power lines and restructuring of the entire electric power delivery system. Some utilities, with equally strong beliefs, claim that there is no proof of risk. They argue that the science is sufficient to confirm the alleged associations and that no action is warranted. This article provides a broad overview of the current scientific data on the association between magnetic fields and disease, providing summary risk estimates and highlighting the uncertainties in the data. Building on this information, three complementary policy perspectives are presented. From a fiscally conservative perspective, the cost of mitigation already instituted far exceeds the health protection offered and mitigation of other environmental risks is more important. From a cost-benefit view, only limited, low-cost mitigation should be considered. These measures, however, would substantially reduce many exposures. From an aggressive exposure reduction perspective, much can be done to reduce exposure by personal and societal actions. If the suggested association is validated, substantially reducing magnetic field exposure could lower health risks.","['Wartenberg, D']",['Wartenberg D'],"['Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, USA. dew@EOHSI.Rutgers.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Public Health Rep,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",9716844,,IM,"['Animals', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Public Policy', 'Risk Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Public Health Rep. 1996 May-Jun;111(3):204-17.,81,,,,,PMC1381761,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve immunocompromised patients illustrating three patterns of infection were treated recently at the Duke University Medical Center. These groups comprised (I) locally aggressive infections, (II) indolent infections, and (III) cutaneous manifestations of systemic infection. Patient diagnoses included organ transplant, leukemia, prematurity, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Time from immunosuppression to biopsy ranged from 5.5 to 31 weeks. Organisms included Aspergillus, Rhizopus, Fusarium, Paecilomyces, Exophiala, and Curvularia. Patients presented with necrotic ulcerations or nodules. Surgical treatment ranged from radical debridement to excisional biopsy to none. Antifungal chemotherapy also was employed in some cases. The mortality rate was 33 percent, two patients dying without evidence of fungal infection. Six of the eight survivors cleared their infections. Necrotic skin lesions with surrounding erythema in this population call for prompt examination, biopsy, and culture. Group I lesions mandate radical excision with rapid intraoperative microscopic control and systemic antifungal medication. Group II requires surgical control with or without antifungal therapy. Group III requires systemic antifungal therapy for metastatic infection. In our opinion, treatment of fungal soft-tissue infection should be tailored to infection type and requires a team approach of surgeon and expert infectious disease consultation.","['Heinz, T', 'Perfect, J', 'Schell, W', 'Ritter, E', 'Ruff, G', 'Serafin, D']","['Heinz T', 'Perfect J', 'Schell W', 'Ritter E', 'Ruff G', 'Serafin D']","['Division of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C., USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Plast Reconstr Surg,Plastic and reconstructive surgery,1306050,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aspergillosis/surgery', 'Debridement', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Fusarium', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/immunology/*surgery', 'Soft Tissue Infections/immunology/microbiology/*surgery', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Plast Reconstr Surg. 1996 Jun;97(7):1391-9. doi: 10.1097/00006534-199606000-00011.,,['10.1097/00006534-199606000-00011 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDS1 has been identified as a single gene as well as a previously unreported exon(s) of EVI1 We have analyzed the relationship between MDS1 and EVI1 to determine whether they are two separate genes. In this report, we present evidence indicating that MDS1 exists in normal tissues both as a unique transcript and as a normal fusion transcript with EVI1, with an additional 188 codons at the 5' end of the previously reported EVI1 open reading frame. This additional region has about 40% homology at the amino acid level with the PR domain of the retinoblastoma-interacting zinc-finger protein RIZ.

Subcellular localizations of the wild-type CBFbeta and the CBFbeta-SMMHC fusion protein were determined by immunofluorescence of NIH 3T3 cells that overexpress wild-type or fusion protein. Normal CBFbeta showed an unexpected perinuclear pattern consistent with primary localization in the Golgi complex. The CBFbeta-SMMHC fusion protein had a very different pattern. Nuclear staining included rod-like crystalline structures as long as 11 microm. The heterodimeric partner of CBFbeta, CBFalpha, formed part of this complex. Cytoplasmic staining included stress fibers that colocalized with actin, probably as a consequence of the myosin heavy chain component of the fusion protein. Deletion of different regions of the CBFbeta portion of the fusion protein showed that binding to CBFalpha was not required for nuclear translocation. However, deletion of parts of the SMMHC domain of the fusion protein involved in myosin-mediated filament formation resulted in proteins that did not form rod-like structures. These observations confirm previous indirect evidence that the CBFbeta-SMMHC fusion protein is capable of forming macromolecular nuclear aggregates and suggests possible models for the mechanism of leukemic transformation.","['Wijmenga, C', 'Gregory, P E', 'Hajra, A', 'Schrock, E', 'Ried, T', 'Eils, R', 'Liu, P P', 'Collins, F S']","['Wijmenga C', 'Gregory PE', 'Hajra A', 'Schrock E', 'Ried T', 'Eils R', 'Liu PP', 'Collins FS']","['Laboratory of Gene Transfer, National Center for Human Genome Research, Bethesda, MD 20892-4470, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.6.4.1 (Myosin Heavy Chains)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Actin Cytoskeleton/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism/*ultrastructure', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 16/ultrastructure', 'Core Binding Factors', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Golgi Apparatus/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Myosin Heavy Chains/genetics/*metabolism', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection']",1996/02/20 00:00,1996/02/20 00:01,['1996/02/20 00:00'],"['1996/02/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/20 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 Feb 20;93(4):1630-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.4.1630.,,['10.1073/pnas.93.4.1630 [doi]'],,,,PMC39993,,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 1996 Dec 24;93(26):15522'],,,,,,,,

PML is normally a component of a nuclear multiprotein complex which is disrupted in the APL disease state. Here, two newly defined cysteine/histidine-rich protein motifs called the B-box (B1 and B2) from PML have been characterized in terms of their effect on PML nuclear body formation, their dimerization, and their biophysical properties. We have shown that both peptides bind Zn2+, which induces changes in the peptides' structures. We demonstrate that mutants in both B1 and B2 do not form PML nuclear bodies in vivo and have a phenotype that is different from that observed in the APL disease state. Interestingly, these mutations do not affect the ability of wild-type PML to dimerize with mutant proteins in vitro, suggesting that the B1 and B2 domains are involved in an additional interaction central to PML nuclear body formation.

We used the rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL-2H3-hm1 stably transfected with the human muscarinic m1 receptor cDNA. We microinjected antisense oligonucleotides into the nuclei of the cells to inhibit selectively the expression of G protein subunits; 48 hr later muscarinic receptors were activated by carbachol, and the increase in free cytosolic calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) was measured. Antisense oligonucleotides directed against the mRNA coding for alpha(q) and alpha11 subunits both suppressed the carbachol-induced increase in [Ca2+]i. In cells injected with antisense oligonucleotides directed against alpha(o1) and alpha14 subunits, the carbachol effect was unchanged. A corresponding reduction of Galpha(q), and Galpha11 proteins by 70-80% compared to uninjected cells was immunochemically detected 2 days after injection of a mixture of alpha(q) and alpha11 antisense oligonucleotides. Expression of Galpha(q) and Galpha11 completely recovered after 4 days.

In this study, we examine the relationship between the ceramide-mediated pathway of growth suppression and the bcl-2 protooncogene. In ALL-697 leukemia cells, the addition of the chemotherapeutic agent vincristine resulted in a time-dependent growth suppression characterized by marked apoptosis. The effects of vincristine on cell death were preceded by a prolonged and sustained accumulation of endogenous ceramide levels reaching -10.4 pmol ceramide/nmol phospholipids at 12 hr following the addition of vincristine--an increase of 220% over vehicle-treated cells. Overexpression of bcl-2 resulted in near total protection of cell death in response to vincristine. However, the ceramide response to vincristine was not modulated by overexpression of bcl-2, indicating that bcl-2 does not interfere with ceramide formation. Overexpression of bcl-2 prevented apoptosis in response to ceramide, suggesting that bcl-2 acts at a point downstream of ceramide. On the other hand, bcl-2 did not interfere with the ability of ceramide to activate the retinoblastoma gene product or to induce cell cycle arrest, suggesting that the effects of ceramide on cell cycle arrest can be dissociated from the effects on apoptosis. These studies suggest that ceramide and bcl-2 partake in a common pathway of cell regulation. The results also cast ceramide as a gauge of cell injury rather than an ""executor"" of cell death with clearly dissociable biological outcomes of its action depending on downstream factors.","['Zhang, J', 'Alter, N', 'Reed, J C', 'Borner, C', 'Obeid, L M', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Zhang J', 'Alter N', 'Reed JC', 'Borner C', 'Obeid LM', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Ceramides)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retinoblastoma Protein)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Ceramides/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Retinoblastoma Protein/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1996/05/28 00:00,1996/05/28 00:01,['1996/05/28 00:00'],"['1996/05/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/28 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 May 28;93(11):5325-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.11.5325.,,['10.1073/pnas.93.11.5325 [doi]'],,,,PMC39244,,,,,,,,,,,

This cassette contains all of the necessary components previously described by others on two separate plasmids that are introduced sequentially over a period of months [Gossen, M. & Bujard, H. (1992) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 89, 5547-5551]. The cassette is introduced using a retrovirus, allowing transfer into cell types that are difficult to transfect. Thus, populations of thousands of cells, rather than a few clones, can be isolated and characterized within weeks. To avoid potential interference of the strong retroviral long terminal repeat enhancer and promoter elements with the function of the tet-regulated cytomegalovirus minimal promoter, the vector is self-inactivating, eliminating transcription from the long terminal repeat after infection of target cells. Tandem tet operator sequences and the cytomegalovirus minimal promoter drive expression of a bicistronic mRNA, leading to transcription of the gene of interest (lacZ) and the internal ribosome entry site controlled transactivator (Tet repressor-VP16 fusion protein). In the absence of tet, there is a progressive increase in transactivator by means of an autoregulatory loop, whereas in the presence of tet, gene expression is prevented. Northern blot, biochemical, and single cell analyses have all shown that the construct yields low basal levels of gene expression and induction of one to two orders of magnitude. Thus, the current cassette of the retroviral construct (SIN-RetroTet vector) allows rapid delivery of inducible genes and should have broad applications to cultured cells, transgenic animals, and gene therapy.","['Hofmann, A', 'Nolan, G P', 'Blau, H M']","['Hofmann A', 'Nolan GP', 'Blau HM']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305-5332, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comment', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (tetracycline resistance-encoding transposon repressor protein)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytomegalovirus/drug effects/*genetics', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Herpes Simplex Virus Protein Vmw65/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Muscles', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*metabolism', '*Retroviridae', 'Tetracycline/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'beta-Galactosidase/*biosynthesis']",1996/05/28 00:00,1996/05/28 00:01,['1996/05/28 00:00'],"['1996/05/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/28 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 May 28;93(11):5185-90. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.11.5185.,,['10.1073/pnas.93.11.5185 [doi]'],"['AG09521/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AI35304/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59717/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC39219,,['Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 May 28;93(11):5173-6.

In this report we demonstrate that AML-1 (acute myeloid leukemia-1), a DNA-binding protein whose genes are disrupted by chromosomal translocations in several human leukemias, interacts with a sequence essential for enhancing tissue-restricted expression of the rOC gene. Deletion analysis of rOC promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs demonstrates that an AML-1-binding sequence within the proximal promoter (-138 to -130 nt) contributes to 75% of the level of osteocalcin gene expression. The activation potential of the AML-1-binding sequence has been established by overexpressing AML-1 in osteoblastic as well as in nonosseous cell lines. Overexpression not only enhances rOC promoter activity in osteoblasts but also mediates OC promoter activity in a nonosseous human fibroblastic cell line. A probe containing this site forms a sequence specific protein-DNA complex with nuclear extracts from osteoblastic cells but not from nonosseous cells. Antisera supershift experiments indicate the presence of AML-1 and its partner protein core-binding factor beta in this osteoblast-restricted complex. Mutations of the critical AML-1-binding nucleotides abrogate formation of the complex and strongly diminish promoter activity. These results indicate that an AML-1 related protein is functional in cells of the osteoblastic lineage and that the AML-1-binding site is a regulatory element important for osteoblast-specific transcriptional activation of the rOC gene.","['Banerjee, C', 'Hiebert, S W', 'Stein, J L', 'Lian, J B', 'Stein, G S']","['Banerjee C', 'Hiebert SW', 'Stein JL', 'Lian JB', 'Stein GS']","['Department of Cell Biology and Cancer Center, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester, 01655, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, rat)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '104982-03-8 (Osteocalcin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA/*genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Osteoblasts/metabolism', 'Osteocalcin/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1996/05/14 00:00,1996/05/14 00:01,['1996/05/14 00:00'],"['1996/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 May 14;93(10):4968-73. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.10.4968.,,['10.1073/pnas.93.10.4968 [doi]'],"['AR33920/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR39588/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR42262/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC39389,,,,,,,,,,,

Abnormalities in this developmental program lead to blood cell diseases including leukemia. The establishment of a cell culture system for the clonal development of hematopoietic cells made it possible to discover proteins that regulate cell viability, multiplication and differentiation of different hematopoietic cell lineages, and the molecular basis of normal and abnormal blood cell development. These regulators include cytokines now called colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) and interleukins (ILs). There is a network of cytokine interactions, which has positive regulators such as CSFs and ILs and negative regulators such as transforming growth factor beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). This multigene cytokine network provides flexibility depending on which part of the network is activated and allows amplification of response to a particular stimulus. Malignancy can be suppressed in certain types of leukemic cells by inducing differentiation with cytokines that regulate normal hematopoiesis or with other compounds that use alternative differentiation pathways. This created the basis for the clinical use of differentiation therapy. The suppression of malignancy by inducing differentiation can bypass genetic abnormalities that give rise to malignancy. Different CSFs and ILs suppress programmed cell death (apoptosis) and induce cell multiplication and differentiation, and these processes of development are separately regulated. The same cytokines suppress apoptosis in normal and leukemic cells, including apoptosis induced by irradiation and cytotoxic cancer chemotherapeutic compounds. An excess of cytokines can increase leukemic cell resistance to cytotoxic therapy. The tumor suppressor gene wild-type p53 induces apoptosis that can also be suppressed by cytokines. The oncogene mutant p53 suppresses apoptosis. Hematopoietic cytokines such as granulocyte CSF are now used clinically to correct defects in hematopoiesis, including repair of chemotherapy-associated suppression of normal hematopoiesis in cancer patients, stimulation of normal granulocyte development in patients with infantile congenital agranulocytosis, and increase of hematopoietic precursors for blood cell transplantation. Treatments that decrease the level of apoptosis-suppressing cytokines and downregulate expression of mutant p53 and other apoptosis suppressing genes in cancer cells could improve cytotoxic cancer therapy. The basic studies on hematopoiesis and leukemia have thus provided new approaches to therapy.","['Sachs, L']",['Sachs L'],"['Department of Molecular Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors', 'Cytokines/physiology/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/pathology/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/physiology']",1996/05/14 00:00,1996/05/14 00:01,['1996/05/14 00:00'],"['1996/05/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/14 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/14 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1996 May 14;93(10):4742-9. doi: 10.1073/pnas.93.10.4742.,123,['10.1073/pnas.93.10.4742 [doi]'],,,,PMC39349,,,,,,,,,,,

The influx and efflux of drugs across the cell membrane are in large part responsible for their intracellular concentrations, and in the search for new compounds able to overcome MDR, it is of prime importance to determine the molecular parameters whose modification would lead to an increase in the kinetics of uptake and/or to a decrease in the P-glycoprotein-medicated efflux. Four anthracycline derivatives, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, 8-(S)-fluoroidarubicin, and idarubicin, which have the same amino sugar, were used to analyze the respective contribution of the kinetics of uptake and the P-glycoprotein-mediated efflux in their impaired accumulation in MDR cells. The kinetics of uptake of the four drugs vary over a very large range: the kinetics of uptake of daunorubicin, 8-(S)-fluoroidarubicin, and idarubicin are 16, 200, and 400 times higher than that of doxorubicin, respectively. However, the four drugs are extruded by P-glycoprotein at comparable rates. The apparent Km values for P-glycoprotein-mediated transport, the intracellular free cytosolic drug concentrations at half-maximal velocity for the cell lines used, were approximately 2.2 microM for daunorubicin and and approximately 1 microM for idarubicin and 8-(S)-fluoroidarubicin.","['Mankhetkorn, S', 'Dubru, F', 'Hesschenbrouck, J', 'Fiallo, M', 'Garnier-Suillerot, A']","['Mankhetkorn S', 'Dubru F', 'Hesschenbrouck J', 'Fiallo M', 'Garnier-Suillerot A']","['Laboratoire de Physicochimie Biomoleculaire et Cellulaire, Universite Paris Nord, Bobigny, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (8-fluoroidarubicin)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacokinetics', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacokinetics', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1996 Mar;49(3):532-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of pediatric oncology programs becomes appropriate as deaths from malnutrition and infections decrease and cancer emerges as an important cause of childhood mortality. In the absence of such services, the worldwide war against pediatric cancer will ultimately be lost because of the rapidly growing pediatric populations in developing countries that now lack the facilities and expertise to treat childhood malignancies. We believe that the development of pediatric cancer centers in many of these countries is both appropriate and feasible. Partnerships in which established pediatric oncology centers work with the governments and private sectors of developing nations to implement key facilities are an efficient and cost-effective way to introduce such services.

The results revealed that rhIL-1ra decreased the number and the proportion of CFU-GM in the S phase in regenerating bone marrow. As concerning erythroid progenitors, rhIL-1ra treatment suppressed BFU-E and enhanced CFU-E-derived colony growth, indicating that the biological effects of IL-1 might be different depending on the stage of differentiation.

Leukemic cells engrafted in all but one mouse, with major differences observed in the growth and aggressiveness of the leukemias. Recipient mice of cells derived from all patients at relapse died more rapidly in overt leukemia than those which were injected with cells obtained prior to induction treatment (P=0.0002). SCID mice that received cells from one patient at the time of diagnosis also died in terminal leukemia. Other SCID mice however, that received cells from the remaining three patients prior to treatment developed occult leukemia that was detectable in the blood or bone marrow with the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or flow cytometry only. Leukemic cells recovered from mice with terminal leukemia exhibited a larger proliferating fraction than cells originally injected (P=0.004).

Transfectants expressing a tyk2 construct missing the carboxy-terminal 22 amino acids cloned with a greatly reduced efficiency in soft agar and displayed a partial decrease in the ability to form tumors in athymic mice. In addition, transfectants producing a kinase deficient version of tyk2 show an increase in both growth rate and agar cloning efficiency, suggesting that the inactive kinase can act in a dominant-negative manner. Surprisingly, the carboxyl-terminal deleted protein lacks both auto-kinase activity, and activity towards a putative substrate, even though it induces a phenotype which is precisely the opposite of that produced by another kinase-deficient tyk2 mutant containing an altered ATP binding site.

In IL-3-dependent cells grown in medium containing optimum amounts of IL-3, the IL-3R complex was detected at low levels indicating that the receptor was down-regulated in response to IL-3. However, upon depletion of IL-3, IL-3R levels increased documenting that its expression correlated inversely with the concentration of IL-3 provided. In contrast, more IL-3 receptors were observed constitutively in autocrine-transformed derivative lines, which secreted suboptimal amounts of IL-3. To examine the effects of activated oncogenes on IL-3R expression in autocrine-transformed cells, the cells were infected with retroviral vectors containing various oncogenes. Decreased levels of IL-3R expression were observed in the oncogene-infected cells. These studies imply that important regulatory cross-talk occurs between ligands and their cognate receptors in cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cells. Deregulation of this ligand-receptor interaction in the oncogene-infected cells may be a consequence of the cells using modified signal transduction pathways which bypass the IL-3:IL-3R interaction. To determine the effects of IL-3 receptor overexpression on the cytokine dependency of hematopoietic cells, IL-3R alpha and beta cDNAs were inserted into retroviral vectors. Overexpression of either the alpha or beta chains did not directly relieve factor dependency, however, constitutive expression of the IL-3R alpha allowed the cells to proliferate in suboptimal concentrations of IL-3. Moreover, factor-independent transformants were subsequently isolated from pools of cells infected with viruses containing either the alpha or beta receptor cDNAs at a frequency of approximately 1 in 10(3) to 10(4) cells whereas such cells were not recovered from control cells. Deregulation of IL-3 receptor chain gene expression may provide a proliferative advantage to hematopoietic cells growing under conditions in which the cytokine is limiting and allow the development of a leukemia.","['Steelman, L S', 'Algate, P A', 'Blalock, W L', 'Wang, X Y', 'Prevost, K D', 'Hoyle, P E', 'McCubrey, J A']","['Steelman LS', 'Algate PA', 'Blalock WL', 'Wang XY', 'Prevost KD', 'Hoyle PE', 'McCubrey JA']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University School of Medicine, Greenville, North Carolina 27858, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', '*Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/genetics/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Mar;10(3):528-42.,,,['R01 CA51025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether hematologic changes in vitro were detectable, long-term marrow cultures (LTBMCs) were established from the right and left hind limbs of 11 individual control and 11 CBA/B mice 100-114 days after 200 cGy total body irradiation. Individual cultures were studied weekly for cumulative production of nonadherent cells and colony-forming, hematopoietic progenitor cells. Control cultures produced significantly more nonadherent cells over 25 weeks in long-term marrow culture compared to those from irradiated (treated) mice. Permanent stromal cell lines were established from control and irradiated CBA/B mouse LTBMCs and clonal sublines were established. The stromal cell lines from LTBMCs of in vivo irradiated CBA/B mice had uniformly lower plating efficiencies, and only one formed a permanent clonal subline at 100-fold lower frequency compared to stromal cell lines from control mouse LTBMCs. The irradiation sensitivity of both uncloned and clonal sublines was similar by single-hit, multi-hit or by linear quadratic formula. Cocultivation of an IL-3 dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell line established from a control CBA/B, LTBMC with control of irradiated stromal cell lines derived from either a control (CC3) or the one successfully cloned in vivo irradiated (CT4) LTBMC, produced few cobblestone islands in the presence of IL-3.

Retrovirus-mediated gene transfer of the human c-fos gene was used here for immortalizing nine mouse bone marrow cell lines which were studied in detail. However, due to low expression of the ectopic c-fos gene, none of them showed characteristics of transformation as assayed by dependence upon serum for growth, the inability to form colonies in agar and contact inhibition. All of them displayed a fibroblastoid phenotype, as deduced from morphological observation and analysis of several differentiation markers. They mostly supported the granulocytic differentiation of bone marrow myeloid precursors in a GM-assay, as did c-fos-expressing primary stromal cells. Their potential for supporting myeloid progenitor proliferation was however significantly lower than that of the whole adherent layer of the Dexter-type long-term bone marrow culture they derived from (STNT cells). They showed significant variations with respect to their cytokine gene expression analyzed at the RNA level in keeping with the notion of stromal cell heterogeneity in the bone marrow. Interestingly, none of them secreted GM-CSF, SCF or IL-3, which are cytokines reputed for their ability to stimulate hematopoietic progenitors, and strikingly, only two of them were able to produce detectable levels of G-CSF in culture supernatants despite the propensity of all of them to favor granulocyte differentiation.

Using the membrane intercallating fluorochrome, PKH-26, we demonstrated that significantly less LTC-IC plated for 14 days in stroma-contact cultures proliferated than in stroma-noncontact cultures (16+/-7 vs 50+/-10%). Furthermore, when LTC-IC were sorted singly in stroma-contact cultures for 2 weeks, only 25+/-4% of individual LTC-IC progeny could initiate two secondary stromal cultures and had therefore proliferated, whereas 45+/-6% of single sorted LTC-IC progeny proliferated when cultured in stroma-conditioned medium without stromal feeder.

Here, the 'CD40 system' has also been used to culture intermediate and high grade malignancies. Proliferation was measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation and cell counting after culture. Time curves showed that at day 7 most cultures were optimal. By flow cytometry, morphology and assessment of light chain restriction the monoclonal nature of the cultured B cells was proven. We confirmed that B cell malignancies with a more slowly evolving course, such as CLL (n=11), PLL (n=5), and low-grade NHL (immunocytoma and follicular cb/cc n=9), could successfully be cultured in the 'CD40 system'.

MDS cells, like normal marrow, expressed the full length EPO-R.

Immunoblot analysis of Bcl-2 protein revealed interpatient variability with nine of 42 (21%) cases demonstrating similar or greater expression than a t(14;18) containing lymphoma cell line and 18 of 42 (43%) cases demonstrating a level of expression similar to or less than that seen in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Bcl-2 expression did not correlate with clinical features, or with apoptosis, as measured by an in vitro DNA fragmentation assay. However, analysis of survival in the 33 untreated patients revealed significant differences based on the level of Bcl-2 expression, with higher expression being an adverse feature (P<0.02). This data suggests that Bcl-2 is important in the pathogenesis and progression of CLL and that quantitation of Bcl-2 protein may provide useful prognostic information.","['Robertson, L E', 'Plunkett, W', 'McConnell, K', 'Keating, M J', 'McDonnell, T J']","['Robertson LE', 'Plunkett W', 'McConnell K', 'Keating MJ', 'McDonnell TJ']","['Department of Hematology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Mar;10(3):456-9.,,,"['CA 32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 62597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This treatment was used to overcome any contribution of P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance to the responses of the CEM/VCR R cells. Following serum withdrawal both cell lines exhibited typical apoptotic responses including morphological changes and nucleosomal cleavage of the DNA. However, using several different assays for cell death the CEM/VCR R cell line was shown to undergo apoptosis at a slower rate than the parental CCRF-CEM cell line. Expression of c-Myc, Bcl-2 and p53 was found to be similar in both cell lines, discounting involvement of these proteins in the observed difference in apoptotic response. Given our previous finding that reorganisation of tubulin is involved in apoptosis, we examined the expression of alpha-, beta- and acetylated alpha-tubulin in the parental and resistant lines. The CEM/VCR R cell line had altered tubulin expression when compared to that of the CCRF/CEM line. Transnuclear microtubule networks were observed in log phase CEM/VCR R cells. In addition, increased expression of the acetylated form of the alpha-tubulin isotype suggested that a more stable microtubule network was present in the CEM/VCR R cells. These findings imply that the drug-resistance phenotype in the CEM/VCR R cells may involve the suppression of apoptosis, and that the development of an altered microtubule network may contribute to this suppression.","['Geyp, M', 'Ireland, C M', 'Pittman, S M']","['Geyp M', 'Ireland CM', 'Pittman SM']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Centre, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Sydney, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microtubules/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/metabolism', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Mar;10(3):447-55.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have produced variants of human DHFR (hDHFR) with these substitutions by directed mutagenesis. Recombinant hDHFR variants expressed in Escherichia coli have greatly decreased inhibition by MTX, but decreased catalytic efficiency, and in one case decreased stability. When a retroviral vector encoding wild-type (wt) hDHFR or one of these variants was introduced into murine fibroblasts or bone marrow progenitors, modest protection from MTX was conferred, even by wt. Relapsed pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who have received multiple courses of high-dose MTX seem most likely to develop such MTX resistance. cDNA was reverse transcribed from blast mRNA from 17 of these patients. However, upon amplification and sequencing of DHFR cDNA, no resistance mutation was found. The explanation for this probably lies in the need for considerable gene amplification to offset lowered catalytic efficiency, and the need for two-base changes for most substitutions, both of which are probably infrequent events.","['Spencer, H T', 'Sorrentino, B P', 'Pui, C H', 'Chunduru, S K', 'Sleep, S E', 'Blakley, R L']","['Spencer HT', 'Sorrentino BP', 'Pui CH', 'Chunduru SK', 'Sleep SE', 'Blakley RL']","[""Department of Molecular Pharmacology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', '*Genes', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/enzymology/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Mar;10(3):439-46.,,,"['P01 CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 31922/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNR-induced apoptosis was characterized by morphology and DNA fragmentation in six leukemic myeloid cell lines which expressed different differentiation phenotypes. In phenotypically mature HL-60 and U937 cells, DNR induced typical apoptosis with characteristic morphological changes and intense internucleosomal DNA fragmentation within a narrow concentration range (0.5-2 microM). When these cells were treated with higher doses of DNR, large DNA fragments (100 kbp), but not internucleosomal fragments, were identified. DNR-induced DNA fragmentation in HL-60 and U937 was inhibited by antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (N-ac) or pyrrolidine-dithiocarbamate (PDTC). In the phenotypically immature KG1a, KG1, HEL and ML1 cell lines DNR induced no characteristic apoptotic morphological features as well as very low levels of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, whereas large DNA fragments (200 kbp) were observed in KG1a treated with 7 microM DNR. Since the latter expressed P-glycoprotein (P-gp), the role of P-gp in the lack of apoptotic response to DNR was investigated. One P-gp inhibitor (verapamil) slightly improved DNR-induced DNA fragmentation in KG1a cells whereas the combination of verapamil and buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO), which depletes glutathion store, further increased internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. In conclusion, DNR induced internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in some but not all AML cells; the magnitude of this process being influenced by both intracellular drug concentration and oxidative balance.","['Quillet-Mary, A', 'Mansat, V', 'Duchayne, E', 'Come, M G', 'Allouche, M', 'Bailly, J D', 'Bordier, C', 'Laurent, G']","['Quillet-Mary A', 'Mansat V', 'Duchayne E', 'Come MG', 'Allouche M', 'Bailly JD', 'Bordier C', 'Laurent G']","[""Laboratoire de Pharmacologie et de Toxicologie Fondamentales, CNRS, the Service d'Hematologie, CHU Purpan, Toulouse, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Free Radical Scavengers)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Pyrrolidines)', '0 (Thiocarbamates)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '25769-03-3 (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamic acid)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 2.7.7.31 (DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Acetylcysteine/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Cell Differentiation', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Nucleotidylexotransferase/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Free Radical Scavengers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Nucleosomes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Pyrrolidines/pharmacology', 'Thiocarbamates/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism/pathology', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Mar;10(3):417-25.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have proposed that down regulation of bcl-2 by ATRA is part of the mechanism of sensitization. The hypothesis is based on reduced expression of bcl-2 mRNA, as seen in Northern blots, after ATRA. Nuclear run on experiments, however, failed to account completely for the effect at the transcriptional level. Accordingly, we looked for post-transcriptional effects of ATRA on bcl-2, using metabolic labelling of the protein to measure stability. We found that the half-life of bcl-2 protein is markedly shortened after treatment with ATRA. Hydrocortisone (HC) protects cells against the toxic effects of Ara-C or DNR when given before drug. HC does not alter bcl-2 expression at the level of mRNA; however, metabolic labelling shows that newly synthesized bcl-2 protein is stabilized in blast cells treated with HC. Response to Ara-C by growth factor responsive blast cells is influenced by the factor in the cultures; cells are more sensitive in cultures with G-CSF and less sensitive when GM-CSF is present. We compared two blast cell lines, OCI/AML-5, primarily responsive to GM-CSF, and OCI/AML-10, primarily responsive to G-CSF. Growth factor did not influence the stability of bcl-2 protein in either line. In contrast, Western blots showed that the amount of bcl-2 protein was greater in cultures with GM-CSF or GM-CSF in combination with G-CSF than in cultures with G-CSF or no added factor. This pattern was seen regardless of the mitogenic response to G-CSF or GM-CSF. We interpret our findings as indicating that bcl-2 protein is transcriptionally activated; that the stability of the protein is decreased after ATRA and increased after HC; that the amount of bcl-2 protein is greater in cultures with GM-CSF than in cultures with G-CSF, regardless of which factor gives the greater mitogenic response. We propose that these post-transcriptional modifications of transcriptionally activated bcl-2 account, in part, for the regulation of drug sensitivity by ATRA, HC and growth factors.","['Hu, Z B', 'Minden, M D', 'McCulloch, E A']","['Hu ZB', 'Minden MD', 'McCulloch EA']","['The Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Mar;10(3):410-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CI-973 was given as a 5-day continuous infusion every 3 to 4 weeks to patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia, at doses ranging from 150 mg/m2 to 1350 mg/m2 per course. Thirty-six patients were treated including 18 patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), four with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and 14 with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blastic phase (CML-BP). Severe gastrointestinal and renal side-effects were the dose-limiting toxicities occurring in four of five patients treated with CI-973 1200 to 1350 mg/m2 per course. At the MTD of 1000 mg/m2 per course, three of 13 patients treated (23%) had moderate to severe nausea and vomiting, three (23%) had moderate diarrhea and one had moderate mucositis. Among 21 patients treated at > or = 1000 mg/m2 (15 AML, 6 CML-BP) no objective complete or partial responses were observed. Twelve of 18 patients (66%) with evaluable marrows on day 14 showed significant suppression of marrow blasts percentage and marrow leukemic infiltrate percentage. Tests for measurement of DNA adduct formation in leukemic cells in vivo after CI-973 therapy, and in vitro following exposure of leukemic cells to CI-973 were developed. This study defined the MTD of CI-973 to be 1000 mg/m2 by continuous infusion over 5 days every 3 to 4 weeks in patients with refractory or relapsed acute leukemia. Gastrointestinal and renal side-effects were dose-limiting. No objective responses were noted in this heavily resistant population. Correlations between CI-973-induced DNA adduct formation and individual patient response to CI-973 will help to define its role in leukemia subsets.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Beran, M', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Robertson, L', 'Siddik, Z', 'Yoshida, M', 'Yang, L Y', 'Rios, M B', 'Keating, M J', 'Meyer, M']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Beran M', ""O'Brien S"", 'Robertson L', 'Siddik Z', 'Yoshida M', 'Yang LY', 'Rios MB', 'Keating MJ', 'Meyer M', 'et al.']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '110172-45-7 (NK 121)', 'BG3F62OND5 (Carboplatin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Blast Crisis/drug therapy', 'Carboplatin/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'DNA Adducts/analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/drug effects']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Mar;10(3):396-401.,,,"['CA32839/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56-887-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of CD26 on the surface of PBMC was decreased in all 20 patients with ATLL compared with those from normal individuals (P < 0.01) and the expression of the CD26 gene transcript was not detectable in seven out of eight patients with ATLL. Then we compared the quantity of viral DNA in CD26-negative (CD26-) and CD26-positive (CD26+) cells obtained from 17 HTLV-I healthy carries by using a polymerase chain reaction method. The CD26-cells had a higher copy number of viral DNA than CD26+ cells.

The incidence rate of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL) is increasing in most Western countries, while trends for the other hematolymphopoietic malignancies are strikingly stable. To formulate hypotheses on the causes of this pattern would require a more appropriate classification of descriptive data. Excesses of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas have been observed in populations exposed to phenoxy-acetic acid herbicides, to insecticides and to organic solvents. Some of these exposures, in particular TCDD, which is a contaminant of phenoxy herbicides, DDT and chlorinated solvents, have been reported to alter cell-mediated immunity. The incidence of NHL is also increased among subjects with HIV infection and subjects undergoing heart or kidney transplantation, all of whom experience immunodeficiency. A hypothesis that has been put forward recently is that the NHL increase is related to increased exposure to sunlight, which has immunosuppressive effects. From a mechanistic point of view, one can hypothesize that NHL is caused by exposures that induce proliferation and immortalization of B-cells, followed by T-cell impairment entailing cell-mediated immune deficiency.","['Vineis, P']",['Vineis P'],"['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Torino, Italy']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,,IM,"['Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Multiple Myeloma/*epidemiology', 'Risk Factors']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Apr;20(4):285-90. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00153-0.,39,"['0145212695001530 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00153-0 [doi]']",['CA-51086/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the specific infectivity of the mutants was approximately 4 x 10(-4) that of wild-type particles.

In the nuclei of EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines EBNA-5 is preferentially targetted to distinct nuclear foci. Previously we have shown (W.Q. Jiang, L. Szekely, V. Wendel-Hansen, N. Ringertz, G. Klein, and A. Rosen, Exp. Cell Res. 197:314-318, 1991) that the same foci also contained the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Using a similar double immunofluorescence technique, we now show that these foci colocalize with nuclear bodies positive for PML, the promyelocytic leukemia-associated protein. Artificial spreading of the chromatin by exposure to the forces of fluid surface tension disrupts this colocalization gradually, suggesting that the bodies consist of at least two subcomponents. Heat shock or metabolic stress induced by high cell density leads to the release of EBNA-5 from the PML-positive nuclear bodies and induces it to translocate to the nucleoli. In addition to their presence in nuclear bodies, both proteins are occasionally present in nuclear aggregates and doughnut-like structures in which PML is concentrated in an outer shell. Nuclear bodies with prominent PML staining are seen in resting B lymphocytes. This staining pattern does not change upon EBV infection. In freshly infected cells EBNA-5 antigens are first distributed throughout the nucleoplasm. After a few days intensely staining foci develop. These foci coincide with PML-positive nuclear bodies. At a later stage and in established lymphoblastoid cell lines EBNA-5 is almost exclusively present in the PML-positive nuclear foci. The colocalization is restricted to EBV-infected human lymphoblasts. The data presented indicate that the distinct EBNA-5 foci are not newly formed structures but the result of translocation of the viral protein to a specialized domain present already in the nuclei of uninfected cells.","['Szekely, L', 'Pokrovskaja, K', 'Jiang, W Q', 'de The, H', 'Ringertz, N', 'Klein, G']","['Szekely L', 'Pokrovskaja K', 'Jiang WQ', 'de The H', 'Ringertz N', 'Klein G']","['Microbiology and Tumor Biology Center, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Chromatin)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Antigens, Viral/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism/virology', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*metabolism', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Mitosis', '*Neoplasm Proteins', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Apr;70(4):2562-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.4.2562-2568.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.4.2562-2568.1996 [doi]'],['2 R01 CA14054-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC190102,,,,,,,,,,,

The recent development of a pseudotyped Moloney murine leukemia virus vector that contains the G envelope protein from the vesicular stomatitis virus allows for efficient concentration of vector and offers hope for potential use of these vectors for gene expression in vivo. A standard amphotropic vector expressing a serum marker protein, human alpha 1-antitrypsin, was infused into regenerating mouse liver and was 10-fold more efficient at achieving stable gene expression than was an equivalent pseudotyped vector. Discrepant results were obtained with cultured hepatocytes infected with an Escherichia coli beta-galactosidase-producing pseudotype and amphotropic vector. High rates of beta-galactosidase-positive cells were detected with the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein vector under culture conditions known to be relatively nonpermissive for retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Subsequent studies demonstrated that beta-galactosidase protein was concentrated and copurified during pseudotype vector preparation, resulting in high rates of protein transfer rather than stable gene transfer, a process referred to as pseudotransduction. The cotransfer of protein with concentrated pseudotyped retroviruses indicates that caution must be used when interpreting gene transduction efficiencies in gene therapy experiments.","['Liu, M L', 'Winther, B L', 'Kay, M A']","['Liu ML', 'Winther BL', 'Kay MA']","['Markey Molecular Medicine Center, Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Gene Transfer Techniques', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', '*Liver/cytology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'beta-Galactosidase/genetics']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Apr;70(4):2497-502. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.4.2497-2502.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.4.2497-2502.1996 [doi]'],['HL53682/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC190094,,,,,,,,,,,

Ligation of the 441 nt in the same site in the inverted orientation also increased the level of the unspliced message, activating the same SD site (between nt 1596 and 1597) and a new SA site just in front of the inserted 441 nt (between nt 4770 and 4771). Deletion or inversion of the 441-nt SA sequence from the wild-type MLV or from int in-frame deletion or int frameshift mutant MLVs of nearly full size resulted in the loss of spliced mRNA and concomitantly in a severe reduction of the unspliced mRNA, particularly at 37 degrees C. Deletion of the 5' SD site did not result in the reduction of the unspliced-mRNA level. When the gag region in G3.6 was replaced with a Neo(r) coding region, the level of expression was high.

In tissues of the central nervous systems of paralyzed moribund FVB/N mice, a major component of the unintegrated viral DNA of ts1 consists of highly mobile physical forms of viral-specific DNA (HM DNA). Previous studies with ecotropic virus-specific polarity probes showed that the gp70-coding region of the env gene in the HM DNA was minus-sense single-stranded DNA. The physical forms of the HM DNA have now been characterized in more detail with additional ecotropic virus-specific probes that hybridized to the p15E-coding region of the env gene and two locations within the U3 region of the long terminal repeat. Two major classes of HM DNA were found: class I molecules consist of short minus-sense single-stranded DNA; class II molecules are partial DNA duplexes that are longer than the class I molecules. The two classes of HM DNA molecules are intermediate products of reverse transcription of the viral RNA of ts1. Since tissues that are infected with cytopathic retroviruses may contain high levels of unintegrated viral DNA, the HM DNA may have a role in inducing neurodegeneration in the central nervous systems of mice that are infected with ts1.","['Szurek, P F', 'Brooks, B R']","['Szurek PF', 'Brooks BR']","['Neurology and Research Services, Williams S.

While B lymphocytes have been shown to be the primary cellular target of BLV, recent studies suggest that some T lymphocytes and monocytes may be infected by the virus. Because virally altered functions of monocytes and/or T cells could contribute to the development of lymphoproliferative disease, we sought to clarify the distribution of the BLV provirus in subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in seropositive cows with and without PL. CD2+ T cells, monocytes, and CD5+ and CD5- B cells were sorted by flow cytometry and tested for the presence of BLV by single-cell PCR. We did not obtain convincing evidence that peripheral blood monocytes or T lymphocytes contain the BLV provirus in seropositive cows with or without PL. In seropositive cows without PL (n=14), BLV-infected CD5+ and CD5- B cells accounted for 9.2% +/- 19% and 0.1% +/- 1.8% of circulating B lymphocytes, respectively. In cows with PL (n=5), BLV-infected CD5+ and CD5- B cells accounted for 66% +/- 4.8% and 13.9% +/- 6.6% of circulating B lymphocytes, respectively. The increase in lymphocyte numbers in cows with PL was entirely attributable to the 45-fold and 99-fold expansions of infected CD5+ and CD5- B-cell populations, respectively. Our results demonstrate that B cells are the only mononuclear cells in peripheral blood that are significantly infected with BLV.

The virus adopts a strategy based on the lack of viral expression in vivo; only very rare BLV-infected B lymphocytes express viral information. When the cells are isolated from animals in persistent lymphocytosis and cultivated ex vivo, a tremendous increase in viral expression occurs. To gain insight into this mechanism, we employed a general approach using chemicals that interfere specifically with cellular pathways involved in signal transduction from the cell membrane to the nucleus. Our data demonstrate that BLV expression is not correlated with the activity of protein kinase A (PKA) and is even inhibited by cyclic AMP (cAMP). The cAMP/PKA pathway is thus apparently not involved in ex vivo viral expression. In contrast, PKC appears to play a key role in this process. Phorbol myristate acetate can directly activate viral expression in B cells (in the absence of T cells). Furthermore, calphostin C, a highly specific inhibitor of PKC, partly decreases ex vivo BLV expression. Our data further demonstrate that calmodulin and calcineurin, a calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, play a key role in the induction of viral expression. The involvement of this calmodulin-dependent pathway could explain the induction of expression that cannot be assigned to PKC. Furthermore, it appears that the activation of viral expression requires a calmodulin but not a PKA-dependent pathway.

HTLV-1 has been shown to bind to and infect a variety of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cells. However, both in vivo and in vitro, the provirus is mostly detected in and preferentially transforms CD4+ T cells. The molecular mechanism that determines the CD4+ T-cell tropism of HTLV-1 has not been determined. Using cocultures of purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with an HTLV-1 producing cell line, we measured viral transcription by using Northern (RNA) blot analysis, protein production by using a p24 antigen capture assay and flow cytometric analysis for viral envelope, and proviral integration by using DNA slot blot analysis. We further measured HTLV-1 long terminal repeat-directed transcription in purified CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by using transient transfection assays and in vitro transcription. We demonstrate a higher rate of viral transcription in primary CD4+ T cells than in CD8+ T cells. HTLV-1 protein production was 5- to 25-fold greater in CD4+ cocultures and mRNA levels were 5-fold greater in these cultures than in the CD8+ cocultures. Transient transfection and in vitro transcription indicated a modest increase in basal transcription in CD4+ T cells, whereas there was a 20-fold increase in reporter gene activity in CD4+ T cells cotransfected with tax. These data suggest that unique or activated transcription factors, particularly Tax-responsive factors in CD4+ T cells, recognize regulatory sequences within the HTLV-1 long terminal repeat, and this mediates the observed enhanced viral transcription and ultimately the cell tropism and leukemogenic potential of the virus.","['Newbound, G C', 'Andrews, J M', ""O'Rourke, J P"", 'Brady, J N', 'Lairmore, M D']","['Newbound GC', 'Andrews JM', ""O'Rourke JP"", 'Brady JN', 'Lairmore MD']","['Center for Retrovirus Research, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Cell Line', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Apr;70(4):2101-6. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.4.2101-2106.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.4.2101-2106.1996 [doi]'],"['CA55185/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'K11 AI01190-02/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC190046,,,,,,,,,,,

Virus-infected p53-/- mice developed tumors significantly faster than uninfected p53-/- or virus-infected p53+/+ littermates. However, the degree of synergy between MoMLV and the p53 null genotype was weaker than the synergy between either of these and c-myc transgenes. A similar range of T-cell tumor phenotypes was represented in all p53 genotype groups, including p53-/- mice, which developed thymic lymphomas as the most common of several neoplastic diseases. Lack of p53 was associated with higher rates of metastasis and the ready establishment of tumors in tissue culture. Loss of the wild-type allele was a common feature of tumors in p53+/- mice and was complete in tumor cells in vitro, but this appeared to occur by a mechanism other than proviral insertion at the wild-type allele. A lower average MoMLV proviral copy number was observed in tumors of the p53 null and heterozygote groups, suggesting that the absence of a functional p53 gene reduced the number of steps required to complete the malignant phenotype. Mink cell focus-forming virus-like proviruses were detected in tumors of all infected mice but were relatively rare in p53 null mice. Analysis of c-myc, pim-1, and pal-1 showed that these loci were occupied by proviruses in some cases but at similar frequencies in p53 wild-type and null mice. In conclusion, while inactivation of p53 in the germ line predisposes mice to tumors similar in phenotype to those induced by MoMLV, it appears that virus-induced tumors generally occur without p53 loss. We speculate that a bcl-2-like function carried or induced by MoMLV may underlie this p53-independent pathway.","['Baxter, E W', 'Blyth, K', 'Donehower, L A', 'Cameron, E R', 'Onions, D E', 'Neil, J C']","['Baxter EW', 'Blyth K', 'Donehower LA', 'Cameron ER', 'Onions DE', 'Neil JC']","['Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow, Bearsden, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Pim1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1)']",IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Genes, myc', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genotype', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Phenotype', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-pim-1', 'Proviruses', 'Retroviridae Infections/genetics/*virology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/*virology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/deficiency/genetics/*physiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/genetics/*virology']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1996 Apr;70(4):2095-100. doi: 10.1128/JVI.70.4.2095-2100.1996.,,['10.1128/JVI.70.4.2095-2100.1996 [doi]'],,,,PMC190045,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies with immunohistochemical, in situ hybridization, and retrograde-tracing methods revealed that many dying cells express Islet proteins and Lim-3 mRNA (motoneuron markers) and send their axons to the somatic region of the embryo before cell death. Together, these data strongly suggest that the dying cells are somatic motoneurons. Cervical motoneurons die by apoptosis and can be rescued by treatment with cycloheximide and actinomycin D. Counts by motoneuron numbers between E3.5 and E10 revealed that, in addition to cell death between E4 and E5, motoneuron death also occur between E6 and E10 in the cervical cord. Studies with [3H]thymidine autoradiography and morphological techniques revealed that in the early cell-death phase (E4-E5), genesis of motoneurons, axonal elongation, and innervation of muscles is still ongoing. However, studies with [3H]thymidine autoradiography also revealed that the cells dying between E4 and E5 become postmitotic before E3.5. Increased size of peripheral targets, treatment with neuromuscular blockade, and treatment with partially purified muscle or brain extracts and defined neurotropic agents, such as NGF, BDNF, neurotrophin-3, CNTF, bFGF, PDGF, S100-beta, activin, cholinergic differentiation factor/leukemia inhibitory factor, bone morphogenetic protein-2, IGF-I, interleukin-6, and TGF-beta 1, were all ineffective in rescuing motoneurons dying between E4 and E5. By contrast, motoneurons that undergo programmed cell death at later stages (E6-E10) in the cervical cord are target-dependent and respond to activity blockade and trophic factors. Experimental approaches revealed that early cell death also occurs in a notochord-induced ectopic supernumerary motoneuron column in the cervical cord. Transplantation of the cervical neural tube to other segmental regions failed to alter the early death of motoneurons, whereas transplantation of other segments to the cervical region failed to induce early motoneuron death. These results suggest that the mechanisms that regulate motoneuron death in the cervical spinal cord between E4 and E5 are independent of interactions with targets. Rather, this novel type of cell death seems to be determined by signals that either are cell-autonomous or are derived from other cells within the cervical neural tube.","['Yaginuma, H', 'Tomita, M', 'Takashita, N', 'McKay, S E', 'Cardwell, C', 'Yin, Q W', 'Oppenheim, R W']","['Yaginuma H', 'Tomita M', 'Takashita N', 'McKay SE', 'Cardwell C', 'Yin QW', 'Oppenheim RW']","['Department of Anatomy, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (LIM-Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Latex)', '0 (Lhx3 protein)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Nicotinic Antagonists)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (insulin gene enhancer binding protein Isl-1)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '8063-06-7 (Curare)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Axons/physiology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Chick Embryo', 'Chickens', 'Curare/pharmacology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA/chemistry', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Deoxyuracil Nucleotides/chemistry', 'Embryo, Nonmammalian/cytology/physiology', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics', 'LIM-Homeodomain Proteins', 'Latex', 'Microspheres', 'Motor Neurons/chemistry/cytology/physiology', 'Mutation/physiology', 'Nerve Growth Factors/pharmacology', '*Nerve Tissue Proteins', 'Nicotinic Antagonists/pharmacology', 'Notochord/cytology/embryology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Quail', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Spinal Cord/*cytology/embryology/transplantation', 'Time Factors', 'Transcription Factors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Neurosci. 1996 Jun 1;16(11):3685-703.,,,"['R01 NS020402/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'NS20402/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC6578838,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a bone marrow reconstitution assay with cells containing retrovirally transduced TAN1 alleles, we analyzed the oncogenic potential of both nuclear and extranuclear forms of truncated TAN1 in hematopoietic cells. Although the Moloney leukemia virus long terminal repeat drives expression in most hematopoietic cell types, retroviruses encoding either form of the TAN1 protein induced clonal leukemias of exclusively immature T cell phenotypes in approximately 50% of transplanted animals. All tumors overexpressed truncated TAN1 of the size and subcellular localization predicted from the structure of the gene. These results show that TAN1 is an oncoprotein and suggest that truncation and overexpression are important determinants of transforming activity. Moreover, the murine tumors caused by TAN1 in the bone marrow transplant model are very similar to the TAN1-associated human tumors and suggest that TAN1 may be specifically oncotropic for T cells.","['Pear, W S', 'Aster, J C', 'Scott, M L', 'Hasserjian, R P', 'Soffer, B', 'Sklar, J', 'Baltimore, D']","['Pear WS', 'Aster JC', 'Scott ML', 'Hasserjian RP', 'Soffer B', 'Sklar J', 'Baltimore D']","['Department of Biology, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Drosophila Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (N protein, Drosophila)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Drosophila', 'Drosophila Proteins', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Receptor, Notch1', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Sequence Deletion', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic', 'Virus Integration']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1996 May 1;183(5):2283-91. doi: 10.1084/jem.183.5.2283.,,['10.1084/jem.183.5.2283 [doi]'],"['5T32HL-07627/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', '7R37AI-2234613/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-38621/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,PMC2192581,,,,,,,,,,,

By immunizing mice with one of such cell lines, we established monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), termed 131 and 315, that recognize a single cell surface antigen (Ag) and inhibit the remaining pathway of the adhesion. These mAbs did not react with normal resting peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or most of the cell lines tested except for two other human T cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I)-infected T cell lines. After stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA), PBMC expressed Ag 131/315 transiently, indicating that these mAbs define a T cell activation Ag. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation revealed that Ag 131/315 has an apparent molecular mass of 50 kD. Expression cloning was done by transient expression in COS-7 cells and immunological selection to isolate a cDNA clone encoding Ag 131/315. Sequence analysis of the cDNA indicated that it is identical to human OX40, a member of the tumor necrosis factor/nerve growth factor receptor family. We then found that gp34, the ligand of OX40, was expressed on HUVECs and other types of vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, it was shown that the adhesion of CD4+ cells of PHA-stimulated PBMC to unstimulated HUVECs was considerably inhibited by either 131 or 315.

These receptors mediate the specification of numerous cell fates during development in invertebrates and vertebrates. The intracellular portion of Notch/TAN-1 contains six ankyrin repeats that are similar to those found in cytoplasmic I kappa B proteins. I kappa B proteins are specific inhibitors of nuclear factor (NF)-kappa B/Rel transcription factors. Here we show that TAN-1 has functional properties of an I kappa B-like regulator with specificity for the NF-kappa B p50 subunit. A recombinant polypeptide corresponding to the cytoplasmic portion of TAN-1 (TAN-1C) specifically inhibited the DNA binding of p50-containing NF-kappa B complexes. When overexpressed in an appropriate cell line, TAN-1C prevented kappa B-dependent transactivation in transient reporter gene assays in a fashion similar to the structurally related protein, Bcl-3. TAN-1C could activate kappa B-dependent gene expression by attenuating the inhibitory effect of an excess of p50 homodimers. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that the TAN-1 from a T cell line is associated with NF-kappa B containing p50 and p65 subunits. These observations indicate that TAN-1C may directly engage NF-kappa B transcription factors and modulate nuclear gene expression.","['Guan, E', 'Wang, J', 'Laborda, J', 'Norcross, M', 'Baeuerle, P A', 'Hoffman, T']","['Guan E', 'Wang J', 'Laborda J', 'Norcross M', 'Baeuerle PA', 'Hoffman T']","['Laboratory of Cell Biology, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RELB protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '147337-75-5 (Transcription Factor RelB)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Humans', 'Invertebrates', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics/immunology/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch1', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Receptors, Notch', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factor RelB', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vertebrates']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1996 May 1;183(5):2025-32. doi: 10.1084/jem.183.5.2025.,,['10.1084/jem.183.5.2025 [doi]'],,,,PMC2192574,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcr/Abl-encoded proteins exhibit elevated kinase activity compared to c-Abl, but the mechanisms of transformation are largely unknown. Some of the biological effects of Bcr/Abl overlap with those of hematopoietic cytokines, particularly interleukin 3 (IL-3). Such effects include mitogenesis, enhanced survival, and enhanced basophilic differentiation. Therefore, it has been suggested that p210Bcr/Abl and the IL-3 receptor may activate some common signal transduction pathways. An important pathway for IL-3 signaling involves activation of the Janus family kinases (JAKs) and subsequent tyrosyl phosphorylation of STAT proteins (signal transducers and activators of transcription). This pathway directly links growth factor receptors to gene transcription. We analyzed JAK activation, STAT protein phosphorylation, and the formation of specific DNA-binding complexes containing STAT proteins, in a series of leukemia cell lines transformed by Bcr/Abl or other oncogenes. We also examined these events in cell lines transformed by a temperature sensitive (ts) mutant of Bcr/Abl, where the kinase activity of Abl could be regulated. STAT1 and STAT5 were found to be constitutively phosphorylated in 32D, Ba/F3, and TF-1 cells transformed by Bcr/Abl, but not in the untransformed parental cell lines in the absence of IL-3. Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT5 was also observed in the human leukemia cell lines K562 and BV173, which express the Bcr/Abl oncogene, but not in several Bcr/Abl-negative leukemia cell lines. Phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT5 was directly due to the tyrosine kinase activity of Bcr/Abl since it could be activated or deactivated by temperature shifting of cells expressing the Bcr/Abl ts mutant. DNA-STAT complexes were detected in all Bcr/Abl-transformed cell lines and they were supershifted by antibodies against STAT1 and STAT5. DNA-STAT complexes in 32Dp210Bcr/Abl cells were similar, but not identical, to those formed after IL-3 stimulation. It is interesting to note that JAK kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and Tyk2) were not consistently activated in Bcr/Abl-positive cells. These data suggest that STATs can be activated directly by Bcr/Abl, possibly bypassing JAK family kinase activation. Overall, our results suggest a novel mechanism that could contribute to some of the major biological effects of Bcr/Abl transformation.","['Carlesso, N', 'Frank, D A', 'Griffin, J D']","['Carlesso N', 'Frank DA', 'Griffin JD']","['Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT1 protein, human)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', '*Milk Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/analysis/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1996 Mar 1;183(3):811-20. doi: 10.1084/jem.183.3.811.,,['10.1084/jem.183.3.811 [doi]'],['R01 DK43904/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,PMC2192351,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between 1980 and 1992, 494 patients were referred to our department for TBI prior to BMT. The mean age was 32 +/- 11 (median: 32, range: 2-63) years and the male to female ratio was 1.6 (304:190). The majority of patients were treated for acute leukemia (lymphoblastic, n = 177, 36%; or nonlymphoblastic , n = 139, 28%); 80 (16%) for chronic myeloid leukemia, 60 (12%) for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 23 (5%) for multiple myeloma, and 15 (3%) for other malignancies. Two hundred and fifty-four (51%) patients were grafted in the first complete remission (CR), 118 (24%) in second CR. Allogenic BMT was performed in 210 (43%) patients, and autologous BMT in 284 (57%). Methotrexate combined to steroids (n = 47, 22%) or to cyclosporine (n = 163, 78%) was administered for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis. In 188 patients (38%), heparin was used in the prevention of veno-occlusive disease (VOD) of the liver. Furthermore, steroid administration was registered in 223 (45%). The conditioning chemotherapy consisted of cyclophosphamide (Cy) alone in 332 (67%) patients. Total-body irradiation was administered either in single dose (STBI; 10 Gy in 1 day, n = 291) or in six fractions (FTBI; 12 Gy over 3 consecutive days, n = 203) before BMT. The mean instantaneous dose rate was 0.0574 +/- 0.0289 Gy/min (0.024-0.1783). It was < 0.048 Gy/min in 157 patients (LOW group), > or = 0.048 Gy/min and <0.09 Gy/min in 301 patients (MEDIUM group), and > or = 0.09 Gy/min in 36 patients (HIGH group). RESULTS: When considering all patients, 42 (8.5%) patients developed cataracts after 13 to 72 months (median: 42 months) with a 5-year estimated cataract incidence (ECI) of 23%. Thirty-three (11.3%) out of 291 patients in the STBI group, and 9 (4.4%) out of 203 patients in the FTBI group developed cataracts with 5-year estimated incidences of 34 and 11%, respectively (p = 0.0004). Seven (19.4%) out of 36 patients in the HIGH group, 33 (10.9%) out of 301 in the MEDIUM group, and 2 (1.2%) out of 157 in the LOW group developed cataracts with respective 5-year cataract incidences of 54%, 30%, and 3.5% (HIGH vs. MEDIUM, p = 0.07; MEDIUM vs. LOW, p = 0.0001; HIGH vs. LOW, p < 0.0001). On the other hand, patients who received heparin as prophylactic treatment against VOD of the liver had less cataracts than those who did not receive (5-year ECI of 16% vs. 28%, respectively; p = 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of 5-year ECI according to age, sex, administration of steroids, GvHD prophylaxis, type of BMT, or previous cranial radiotherapy in children. Multivariate analysis revealed that the instantaneous dose rate (p = 0.001), and the administration of heparin against VOD (p = 0.05) were the two independent factors influencing the cataract incidence, while age, fractionation, and use of steroids were not. Among the 42 patients who developed cataracts, 38 had bilateral extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation, and only 4 (10%) developed secondary cataracts in a median follow-up period of 39 months. CONCLUSION: Among the abovementioned TBI parameters, high instantaneous dose rate seems to be the main risk factor of cataract formation, and the administration of heparin appears to have a protective role in cataractogenesis. On the other hand, ionizing radiation seems to have a protective effect on posterior capsule opacification following extracapsular cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation.","['Belkacemi, Y', 'Ozsahin, M', 'Pene, F', 'Rio, B', 'Laporte, J P', 'Leblond, V', 'Touboul, E', 'Schlienger, M', 'Gorin, N C', 'Laugier, A']","['Belkacemi Y', 'Ozsahin M', 'Pene F', 'Rio B', 'Laporte JP', 'Leblond V', 'Touboul E', 'Schlienger M', 'Gorin NC', 'Laugier A']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Hopital Tenon, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cataract/*etiology', 'Cataract Extraction', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Time Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1996 Apr 1;35(1):53-60. doi: 10.1016/s0360-3016(96)85011-5.,,"['S0360-3016(96)85011-5 [pii]', '10.1016/s0360-3016(96)85011-5 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The PP2A activity determined with myelin basic protein (MBP) as a substrate showed a sharp transient increase at 18 h of incubation of the cells with retinoic acid, whereas during incubation without retinoic acid, the activity remained at the initial level. On DEAE-Sepharose column chromatography of the extracts preparted from the cells incubated without retinoic acid, the PP2A activities determined with MBP were eluted at 0.13 M or 0.23 m NaCl, respectively. The PP2A activity of the cells incubated for 18 h with retinoic acid was much more greatly activated by protamine compared with the activity of the cells incubated without retinoic acid. These results strongly suggest a conversion of PP2A holoenzyme from PP2A1 to PP2A0 during the initial process of the retinoic acid-induced differentiation. On the other hand PP2A activity determined with phosphorylase alpha as a substrate showed a sharp transient decrease at 24 h of incubation of the cells, irrespective of the presence or the absence of retinoic acid in the incubation mixtures. This decrease may be related to the synchronization of the cells at S phase, which also occurred irrespective of the retinoic acid stimulation. PP1 activity determined with MBP was transiently increased between 27 and 36 h of the incubation of cells without retinoic acid.

The latter induced DNA fragmentation in HL60 cells but DNA laddering characteristic of apoptosis was not observed. It had low toxicity to corresponding differentiated cells, neutrophils, in culture, and therefore the cytotoxicity had selectivity for leukaemia cells. The antiproliferative activity of S-(N-phenylethylthiocarbamoyl)cysteine was lost during preincubation with culture medium, attributed to s-thiocarbamoyl transfer to serum proteins, which may decrease its effectiveness in vivo. The antiproliferative activity of S-(N-phenylalkylthiocarbamoyl)cysteine derivatives, by inhibiting tumour growth in pre-clinical development, may contribute to the association of decreased cancer incidence with dietary glucosinolate consumption.","['Adesida, A', 'Edwards, L G', 'Thornalley, P J']","['Adesida A', 'Edwards LG', 'Thornalley PJ']","['Department of Biological and Chemical Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Food Chem Toxicol,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,8207483,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isocyanates)', '1943-82-4 (phenylethyl isocyanate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)']",IM,"['Acetylcysteine/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isocyanates/*metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Food Chem Toxicol. 1996 Apr;34(4):385-92. doi: 10.1016/0278-6915(96)00124-x.,,"['027869159600124X [pii]', '10.1016/0278-6915(96)00124-x [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present study was designed to evaluate prospectively fibrinolytic parameters in leukemic children receiving different E. coli ASP preparations (Kyowa ASP, n = 20; Bayer ASP, n = 20), and to relate changes in the fibrinolytic system to serum ASP activity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples for coagulation studies were obtained together with serum samples for pharmacokinetic monitoring in the same venipuncture (before the first and 6th-7th doses of ASP). RESULTS: Patients receiving Kyowa ASP showed significantly (0.0001) enhanced ASP-activity compared to children treated with the Bayer preparation. Significantly decreased values of fibrinogen (p < 0.001), plasminogen (p < 0.0002) and alpha 2-antiplasmin (p < 0.0003) were found in the Kyowa group, along with significantly enhanced thrombin generation (F1 + 2; p < 0.001), t-P (p < 0.01) and D-dimer levels (p < 0.05).

Results of a crossover study.,121-6,"BACKGROUND: In a recently reported study, low doses of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) were shown to be as effective as high doses in protecting chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients against infections, although a control group was not included. With this background we started a crossover study of low-dose IVIG prophylaxis aimed at investigating its superiority over empirical treatment of infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two CLL patients with hypogammaglobulinemia (IgG < 600 mg/dL) and/or a history of at least one episode of severe infection in the 6 months preceding inclusion in the study were randomly allocated to receive either an infusion of 300 mg/kg IVIG every 4 weeks for 6 months or no treatment. Then they were switched to observation or IVIG for another 12 months; finally, they received IVIG or no therapy for 6 more months. RESULTS: A significantly lower incidence of infectious episodes was observed during IVIG prophylaxis in 30 patients who completed the 6-month period of either observation or IVIG therapy. The same applied to the 17 patients who completed 12 months of either observation or IVIG prophylaxis. Interestingly, the restoration of serum IgG levels obtained in 17 out of 25 patients (mean percent value of IgG increase, 41.8%) did not parallel a decrease in the number of infectious episodes. CONCLUSIONS: A protective effect against infections is demonstrated for low-dose IVIG in the present study. A benefit was shown in patients who completed either 12 or 6 months of IVIG prophylaxis; however, even this low-dose treatment is not a cost effective way to prevent infection in CLL patients.","['Molica, S', 'Musto, P', 'Chiurazzi, F', 'Specchia, G', 'Brugiatelli, M', 'Cicoira, L', 'Levato, D', 'Nobile, F', 'Carotenuto, M', 'Liso, V', 'Rotoli, B']","['Molica S', 'Musto P', 'Chiurazzi F', 'Specchia G', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Cicoira L', 'Levato D', 'Nobile F', 'Carotenuto M', 'Liso V', 'Rotoli B']","['Divisione di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, Catanzaro, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cross-Over Studies', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/*prevention & control']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 1996 Mar-Apr;81(2):121-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, mice with MAIDS exhibited an abnormal histological distribution of fyn PTK in the hippocampus.

We show that in addition to thrombin and thrombin receptor agonist peptide (TRP, SFLLRN), trypsin induced [Ca(2+)]i mobilization in a highly thrombin-sensitive Jurkat T cell clone. Thrombin, TRP, and trypsin were found to induce [Ca(2+)]i release in three different Jurkat T cell clones differing in the level of T cell receptor expression. Similar results were obtained with a prothymocytic leukemic cell line, HPB.ALL, although these cells were much more responsive to trypsin than to thrombin and TRP. Other cell types such as THP1, a myelomonocytic cell line, or CEM, a CD4(+) positive leukemic cell line, were unresponsive to thrombin, TRP, and trypsin. The effect of trypsin was mimicked by SLIGRL, a peptide corresponding to the cleaved amino-terminal sequence of the recently characterized murine trypsin-activated receptor (PAR2). At suboptimal concentrations, the effects of SFLLRN and SLIGRL were additive, whereas saturating doses of peptides did not further increase [Ca(2+)]i mobilization in Jurkat T cells, indicating that both peptides were able to mobilize the same pool of calcium. Northern blot analysis of mRNAs from different leukemic cell lines indicated a remarkable correlation between PAR2 expression in different cell lines and SLIGRL or trypsin responses in the same cells. The expression of the ""trypsin receptor"" was also confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis. Moreover, a 24 h treatment of Jurkat cells by an anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody, a condition known to down-regulate thrombin receptor expression, induced loss of thrombin and TRP responses but only partially affected trypsin stimulation of [Ca(2+)]i release. Finally, after a first stimulation with either thrombin or trypsin, Jurkat cells were still able to respond to trypsin or thrombin, respectively, demonstrating that thrombin and trypsin essentially activated their own receptors. Our data provided evidence that 1) the human T leukemic cell line Jurkat and other T cell lines express at least two different functional protease-activated receptors, the thrombin receptor and a highly sensitive trypsin receptor, likely the human counterpart of the murine PAR2, and 2) at variance with the commonly accepted model, trypsin exerts most of its effect in T leukemic cell lines by thrombin receptor-independent mechanisms.","['Mari, B', 'Guerin, S', 'Far, D F', 'Breitmayer, J P', 'Belhacene, N', 'Peyron, J F', 'Rossi, B', 'Auberger, P']","['Mari B', 'Guerin S', 'Far DF', 'Breitmayer JP', 'Belhacene N', 'Peyron JF', 'Rossi B', 'Auberger P']","['INSERM U343 Faculte de Medecine, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,FASEB J,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,8804484,"['0 (Receptor, PAR-2)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombin)', 'EC 3.4.21.4 (Trypsin)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptor, PAR-2', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/*physiology', 'Receptors, Thrombin/agonists/*physiology', 'Thrombin/*pharmacology', 'Trypsin/*pharmacology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,FASEB J. 1996 Feb;10(2):309-16. doi: 10.1096/fasebj.10.2.8641564.,,['10.1096/fasebj.10.2.8641564 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though this pump-leak cycle appears to be a common property of Ca-storing organelles, little is known about the nature of the leak pathway. Ca homeostasis in thapsigargin-sensitive internal Ca stores of single permeabilized BHK-21 fibroblasts was examined using digital image processing of compartmentalized mag-fura-2 (a low-affinity Ca indicator). It is shown here that the leak of Ca from internal stores is regulated specifically by the cytosolic ATP concentration. The rate of leak was 3.6 times slower in 0.375 mM[ATP] than in 4 mM [ATP] (Na or Mg salt). These effects were observed in the presence of 0 Ca/EGTA, thapsigargin, heparin, and ruthenium red, and therefore appear to be independent of the Ca-ATPase, the InsP(3) receptor and the ryanodine receptor. The ATP-stimulated leak was seen in a variety of cell types, including rat basophilic leukemia cells and mouse pancreatic acinar cells. Other nucleotides (ADP, GTP, CTP, and UTP) and nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs (AMP-PNP and ATPgammaS) did not reproduce the action of ATP. Changes in cellular metabolism and ensuing alterations in [ATP] will be expected to influence the filling state of internal Ca stores through effects on the passive leak pathway, potentially leading to modulation of Ca signaling and organellar function.","['Hofer, A M', 'Curci, S', 'Machen, T E', 'Schulz, I']","['Hofer AM', 'Curci S', 'Machen TE', 'Schulz I']","['II.

Patients achieving complete remission (CR) were administered a second FLAG course as consolidation and were then submitted to an individualized program of post-remission therapy, depending on the patient's age and performance status. CR was achieved in 8/12 evaluable cases (67%). The median CR duration was 22.5 w. CR attainment was significantly related to the co-expression of lymphoid and myeloid antigens. ALL/My+ patients achieved CR in 6/6 evaluable cases vs. 2/6 for ALL/My+. In vitro 3H ara-C incorporation into cellular DNA resulted significantly increased by Fludarabine (in 7/9 tested cases) and, furthermore, by the association of Fludarabine G-CSF in 5 evaluable ALL/My+ cases; in contrast, no effect of G-CSF addition to Fludarabine was observed in 4 ALL/My.

MKs were identified with a fluorescein labelled monoclonal antibody specific for glycoprotein IIIa (GPIIIa) and DNA was stained with propidium iodide. For the 12 healthy volunteers the mean modal ploidy number was 16 N; the 9 patients with RT displayed an identical MK ploidy pattern. The frequency of MKs with a ploidy > or = 32 N was 45% among the patients with essential thrombocythaemia (ET) compared to 32% among the healthy volunteers (p < 0.001). MKs with ploidy number > or = 64 N, comprising approximately 13% of the total number of MKs, was a characteristic finding in the patients with ET. Similar findings were present in 8 patients with polycythaemia vera (PV). In patients with PV 34% and 6% of the MKs displayed ploidies > or = 32 N and > or = 64 N, respectively. In contrast, a distinct shift towards lower ploidy number, with 63% of MKs < or = 8 N, was found among the 4 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). The present results indicate that by using flow cytometric analysis of MK ploidy distribution in patients with thrombocytosis, those with a reactive cause are likely to be discriminated from patients with myeloproliferative thrombocytosis, i.e. PV and ET on one hand and CML on the other hand.

Leukemic cells from acute type ATL patients synthesize IL-4R without stimulation, at levels much higher than normal resting lymphocytes and other types of leukemic cells. Furthermore, leukemic cells from acute type ATL showed higher IL-4R expression than that of chronic type ATL or human T-cell leukemia virus type I carriers. In addition, there was correlation between expression of IL-4R on the cell surface and the proliferative response to IL-4. Both IL-4 and IL-2 induced upregulation of IL-4R on activated normal T cells but not on ATL cells.

Ninety-five patients with hematological malignancies were studied. The incidence of infectious episodes almost doubled after CdA (0.87 vs. 0.47 during the pre-CdA period). The following factors were associated with an increased risk of infection after therapy: a history of previous chemotherapy, infection during the pre-CdA period and a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Age, neutrophil and lymphocyte count at onset of CdA and time interval between diagnosis and therapy with CdA did not correlate with the infectious risk.

However, their efficacy in the treatment of CLL, an indolent lymphoid malignancy suggests additional mechanisms of action. Like cytosine arabinoside (AraC), F1 and 2-CdA gain access to the cell via a specific nucleoside transporter (NST) protein. To investigate the mode of action of these drugs in CLL, we used a fluorescent ligand for the NST (5'-(SAENTA- x8)-fluorescein) and 3-colour flow cytometry to determine NST expression on CD5+/CD19+ B-cells from the peripheral blood (PB) of patients with CLL. NST levels on these cells was found to be not significantly different from normal control lymphocytes (mean = 485 +/- 425) vs. (mean = 553 +/- 178).

The effect of recombinant human interleukin-6 (rhIL-6) on the proliferation of AML-193 cells was investigated. Both granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) and rhIL-3 promoted the DNA synthesis and growth of AML-193 cells in vitro. rhIL-6 alone did not support the growth of AML-193 cells, yet pretreatment of AML-193 cells with rhIL-6 markedly enhanced their proliferative response to subsequent rhGM-CSF or rhIL-3 stimulation. The growth-promoting effect induced by rhIL-6 was attributable in part to the upregulation of GM-CSF receptors on AML-193 cells; treatment of AML-193 cells with rhIL-6 for 24 to 48 hours greatly increased their GM-CSF binding activity, which occurred in a dose-dependent manner. Both the growth-promoting and receptor-upregulating effects induced by rhIL-6 could be blocked by treating AML-193 cells with neutralizing anti-gp130 antibodies (GPX7). Treatment of AML-193 cells with anti-gp130 antibodies alone also led to a notable decline in GM-CSF binding activity, suggesting a possible role of gpl30 in regulating the expression of GM-CSF receptors. When AML-193 cells were starved in cytokine-free medium and then restimulated with rhGM-CSF, a rapid increase (5 minutes) in lyn kinase activity was observed. A similar upregulation of lyn kinase activity by rhIL-6 treatment also was noted in AML-193 cells, but only after a prolonged incubation of the cells with rhIL-6 (>24 hours). These findings show that the growth-promoting effects of rhIL-6 are mediated through the upregulation of GM-CSF receptors on AML-193 cells by mechanisms that appear to involve the activation of both gp130 and lyn kinase.","['Li, Y', 'Valeriote, F', 'Chen, B']","['Li Y', 'Valeriote F', 'Chen B']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (lyn protein-tyrosine kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Up-Regulation/*drug effects', 'src-Family Kinases/metabolism']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Feb;24(2):94-100.,,,"['AI23499/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47424/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To analyze the contribution of the viral cis regulatory elements to the host range determinants within the hematopoietic system, we performed a series of marker gene experiments using both transient transfection and retroviral-mediated stable transduction of indicator cell lines representing distinct developmental stages. According to our data, the U3 region in the long terminal repeat (LTR) of FMCF viruses possesses an enhancer assembly that allows efficient transcription in both early and late myelo-erythroid stem and progenitor cells. Retroviral gene expression, however, is subjected to stage-dependent transcriptional controls during blood cell maturation. We obtained evidence that a repressor element overlapping with the primer binding site in the viral leader region compromises U3-mediated gene expression in a stage-dependent manner, with the strongest restriction observed in the most primitive cells analyzed, FDCP-mix. In addition, our data indicate a second hurdle for retroviral gene expression in early hematopoietic cells that is independent of the primer binding site and most likely related to inefficient utilization of U3-located enhancers. These data shed light on the mechanisms of host range restriction within the hematopoietic system and define a basis for the design of retroviral vectors aimed to overcome transcriptional inefficiency in early hematopoietic cells. Thus, we developed novel retroviral vectors combining FMCF-type U3 regions with a permissive leader from the murine embryonic stem cell virus. These vectors are highly efficient for gene transfer and expression in both early and late myelo-erythroid cells, indicating that they will be of great use for a variety of experimental and therapeutic applications.","['Baum, C', 'Eckert, H G', 'Stocking, C', 'Ostertag, W']","['Baum C', 'Eckert HG', 'Stocking C', 'Ostertag W']","['Heinrich-Pette-Institut fur Experimentelle Virologie and Immunologie, Universitat Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Fibroblasts', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mink Cell Focus-Inducing Viruses/genetics/*physiology', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Feb;24(2):364-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subsequently, the cell suspensions were heat-treated at 43 degrees C for up to 90 minutes. After an exposure of 8 hours to 10(-9) M Goralatide, the number of CFU-GM cells in S phase decreased from 30 to 10%, resulting in an almost 10-fold increase in survival after 90 minutes at 43 degrees C. No effect on the primitive subsets could be detected because of their quiescent cell cycle state in normal bone marrow. To investigate the potential vulnerability of these subsets for Goralatide, bone marrow cells from 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-pretreated mice were used. 5-FU induced increase in proliferative activity of the CFU-S-12 (day-12 colony-forming units-spleen), and the stem cell with marrow repopulating ability could be abolished by an incubation period with 10(-9) M Goralatide for 16 and 24 hours, respectively. Hence, this decrease in proliferative activity confers a decrease in hyperthermic sensitivity for the primitive hematopoietic subsets. The cytotoxic effect of the incubation on the absolute number of the hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells was <10%. Goralatide treatment (10(-8), 10(-9), and 10(-10) M) up to 24 hours had no effect on the growth kinetics and cell cycle distribution and consequently on the hyperthermic sensitivity of L1210 cells. Based on these results, it can be concluded that Goralatide will have a positive effect on the survival of hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells after hyperthermia and may lead to a gain in the therapeutic window of this purging modality.","['Wierenga, P K', 'Konings, A W']","['Wierenga PK', 'Konings AW']","['Department of Radiobiology, University of Groningen, The Netherlands, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', 'H041538E9P (goralatide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Purging/*methods', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Oligopeptides/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Feb;24(2):246-52.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, studies on the commitment to erythroid and megakaryocytic lineages have been hampered by the lack of suitable human leukemic cell lines having this kind of bipotential differentiation capability. We investigated the coexpression of megakaryocytic and erythroid markers in human leukemic cell lines as well as the capability of these cells to further differentiate upon exposure to differentiation-inducing agents. We report that the JK-1 cell line, previously characterized as a typically erythroid cell line with spontaneous differentiation to red cells, actually coexpressed megakaryocytic cell surface antigens and erythroid spectrins. We also report that the JK-1 cells could be induced to differentiate along the megakaryocytic lineage by treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The other cell lines studied variably expressed megakaryocytic and erythroid antigens, the DAMI and CMK cells predominantly megakaryocytic properties and the T-33 and K562 cells some erythroid markers, whereas the HEL cells expressed markers for both lineages of differentiation. Our results suggest that the JK-1 cell line represents an immature cell population that has not yet been committed to either of the two lineages of differentiation. The JK-1 cell line might provide a useful tool for further studies on the transcriptional regulation of erythroid and megakaryocytic phenotypes and for studies on the commitment to these lineages of differentiation. Our results also suggest that the leukemic cell lines show a considerable plasticity in the expression of properties normally specific for distinct lineages of differentiation.","['Tani, T', 'Ylanne, J', 'Virtanen, I']","['Tani T', 'Ylanne J', 'Virtanen I']","['Department of Anatomy, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Cell Adhesion Molecules)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blood Platelets/chemistry', 'Blood Proteins/*analysis', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Erythrocyte Membrane/chemistry', '*Erythrocytes', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', '*Megakaryocytes', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Platelet Endothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule-1', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Feb;24(2):158-68.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Simultaneous addition of IL-10 with IFN-gamma at the start of incubation was necessary for an optimal inhibitory effect. The degree of inhibition was substantially comparable to that of IL-4, and the combination of suboptimal concentrations of IL-10 and IL-4 produced an additive effect. A similar effect was also obtained when viral IL-10 (vIL-10) was used instead of IL-10. The inhibitory effect of IL-10 was accompanied by the reduced accumulation of transcripts for heavy chain subunit of cytochrome b558 (gp9l-phox) and 47-kD cytosolic factor (p47-phox), components of the O2--generating NADPH oxidase system. Reduction of the mRNAs was distinct within 24 hours. On the other hand, the induced O2- production by human monocytic leukemia cell lines (THP-1 and HL60) was not inhibited by IL-10. The amount of gp9l-phox and p47-phox mRNAs remained unchanged even in the presence of excess amount of IL-1O. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-10 inhibits 02- production by downregulation of the gp9l-phox and p47-phox genes in human monocytes.","['Kuga, S', 'Otsuka, T', 'Niiro, H', 'Nunoi, H', 'Nemoto, Y', 'Nakano, T', 'Ogo, T', 'Umei, T', 'Niho, Y']","['Kuga S', 'Otsuka T', 'Niiro H', 'Nunoi H', 'Nemoto Y', 'Nakano T', 'Ogo T', 'Umei T', 'Niho Y']","['The First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (neutrophil cytosol factor 67K)', '11062-77-4 (Superoxides)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 1.6.- (NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (CYBB protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidase 2)', 'EC 1.6.3.- (NADPH Oxidases)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (CYBA protein, human)', 'EC 1.6.3.1 (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1)', 'EC 1.6.99.1 (NADPH Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Depression, Chemical', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Membrane Transport Proteins', 'Monocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'NADPH Dehydrogenase/biosynthesis/genetics', 'NADPH Oxidase 2', 'NADPH Oxidases', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Superoxides/*metabolism']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Feb;24(2):151-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cell cycle duration for HCD-57 cells was approximately 12 hours and was uninfluenced by erythropoietin. Populations of HCD-57 cells synchronized in G1 by centrifugal elutriation were able to pass through one complete cell cycle in the absence of erythropoietin but, thereafter, arrested in G1 as identified by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. Analysis of cell cycle behavior using the metachromic dye acridine orange, however, revealed that HCD-57 cells pass through a G0 cell cycle phase and, like serum-deprived 3T3 cells, actually arrest in G0 when deprived of erythropoietin. Expression of the cell cycle regulatory protein p34cdc2 was invariant throughout the cell cycle in HCD-57 cells. p34cdc2 was constitutively phosphorylated in G0 cells, and this effect was not modified by erythropoietin. Erythropoietin receptor distribution was log normal in HCD-57 cells in each phase of the cell cycle. The affinity of these surface receptors for erythropoietin was essentially invariant throughout the cell cycle, but receptor expression was upregulated in G2M cells as compared with cells in G1 or S phase. Taken together, these data indicate that erythropoietin has an important role in the G0-G1 to S phase transition but, based on receptor expression, is involved in other phases of the cell cycle as well.","['Spivak, J L', 'Ferris, D K', 'Fisher, J', 'Noga, S J', 'Isaacs, M', 'Connor, E', 'Hankins, W D']","['Spivak JL', 'Ferris DK', 'Fisher J', 'Noga SJ', 'Isaacs M', 'Connor E', 'Hankins WD']","['Division of Hematology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Erythropoietin)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2 Protein Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'CDC2 Protein Kinase/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, Erythropoietin/metabolism', 'Resting Phase, Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'S Phase/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Feb;24(2):141-50.,,,['DK16702/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD34+ bone marrow cells from a patient with JCML, unlike normal bone marrow cells, generated a large number of cells in serum-containing liquid culture without additional hematopoietic factors. In serum-deprived culture, only granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) had a modest stimulatory effect on GM colony growth in normal controls. In contrast, stem cell factor (SCF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and interleukin-3 (IL-3), as well as G-CSF, when tested individually, generated significant numbers of GM colonies in some JCML patients. All two-factor combinations generated significantly more GM colonies in JCML compared with normal controls. In particular, GM-CSF plus SCF exerted an interaction equivalent to the all-factor combination in most patients. Significant differences in the size and constituent cells of GM colonies stimulated by GM-CSF plus SCF were also observed. These results suggest that one possible mechanism for the excessive cell production in JCML is the strong proliferation of GM progenitors induced by hematopoietic factors, especially SCF. According to immunofluorescent analysis, however, it is unlikely that this multiplication is due to an increase in the cell surface expression of c-kit receptors on JCML progenitors.","['Sawai, N', 'Koike, K', 'Ito, S', 'Okumura, N', 'Kamijo, T', 'Shiohara, M', 'Amano, Y', 'Tsuji, K', 'Nakahata, T', 'Oda, M']","['Sawai N', 'Koike K', 'Ito S', 'Okumura N', 'Kamijo T', 'Shiohara M', 'Amano Y', 'Tsuji K', 'Nakahata T', 'Oda M']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Child, Preschool', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1996 Feb;24(2):116-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in most cases, the level of proliferation measured was low (stimulation index < 3, n = 37). This was most likely related to the amount of interleukin-10 (IL-10) released into the culture medium by the CML cells, because addition of neutralizing anti_IL-10 serum to MLTC markedly enhanced proliferative responses. In addition, supplementation of media with IL-1 alpha further enhanced proliferative responses and a combination of anti-IL-10 serum and IL-1 alpha was more effective than either agent alone. Only HLA-DR-matched CML cells, but not HLA-DR-mismatched CML cells or matched or mismatched PBMC restimulated proliferation of IL-2-dependent T cell lines derived from MTLC supplemented with IL-1 alpha and anti-IL-10 serum.

When leukaemic PBMC derived from 18 acute myelogenous leukaemia patients were cultured with PHA and cells from a polyclonal T cell line, increased concentrations of the T cell cytokines IFN gamma and IL-4 were detected for all patients. We conclude that T cell activation resulting in proliferation and a broad cytokine response can take place in the presence of excess acute myelogenous leukaemia blasts.","['Bruserud, O', 'Pawelec, G']","['Bruserud O', 'Pawelec G']","['Medical Department B, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigen-Presenting Cells/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*immunology/surgery', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/immunology/physiology/radiation effects', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*physiology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1996 Mar;42(3):133-40. doi: 10.1007/s002620050263.,,['10.1007/s002620050263 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in the level of p18 accumulation and phosphorylation associated with induction of differentiation of leukemic cells suggested a potential role for this phosphoprotein in cellular proliferation and differentiation and possibly in malignant transformation. Recent studies have demonstrated that p18 plays an important role in cell cycle progression by serving as a substrate for p34(cdc2) kinase. These studies showed that inhibition of p18 expression in leukemic cells results in growth retardation and accumulation of cells in G(2)-M. In this study, we explore the potential role of p18 in cellular transformation by investigating the effects of inhibition of p18 expression on the malignant phenotype of K562 erythroleukemia cells. These studies show that antisense inhibition of p18 expression in leukemic cells results in growth arrest at a lower saturation density, loss of serum independence, and loss of anchorage-independent growth in vitro. In addition, inhibition of p18 expression results in a marked inhibition of tumorigenicity of leukemic cells in vivo in the severe combined immune deficiency mouse model. These studies demonstrate that the high level of p18 expression in leukemic cells is necessary for the maintenance of the transformed phenotype and suggest p18 as a potential target for antileukemic interventions.","['Jeha, S', 'Luo, X N', 'Beran, M', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Atweh, G F']","['Jeha S', 'Luo XN', 'Beran M', 'Kantarjian H', 'Atweh GF']","['Department of Pediatrics, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Antisense)', '0 (Stathmin)', '0 (Stmn1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed/metabolism/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Culture Media/chemistry', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Phenotype', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'RNA, Antisense/*metabolism', 'Stathmin', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/metabolism']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Mar 15;56(6):1445-50.,,,"['HL-42919/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'M01-RR00071/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), trisomy 11 (+11) occurring as a sole abnormality is the third most common trisomy. We have shown that the ALL1 gene, located at 11q23, can be rearranged as a result of a partial tandem duplication in two such cases of AML. To test the hypothesis that the partial tandem duplication of ALL1 is the recurrent molecular defect in cases of AML presenting with +11 as a sole cytogenic abnormality, we performed Southern analysis and PCR for defects of ALL1 in 17 cases of AML and one case of myelodysplastic syndrome with +11 or +11q but without cytogenic evidence of a structural abnormality involving 11q23. Twelve cases (67%) had rearrangement of ALL1, including 10 of 11 patients (91%) with +11 as a sole abnormality and 2 of 7 cases (29%) with +11 and other aberrations; all were classified as FAB M1 or M2. In 10 of the 12 cases, material was available for additional characterization; a partial tandem duplication of ALL1 was detected in each of these 10 cases (100%). Four cases demonstrated previously unreported duplications, two of which were detectable only by reverse transcription-PCR. Four patients with the ALL1 duplication also displayed a loss of material from 7q, suggesting an association between these two findings. We conclude that the partial tandem duplication of ALL1 is present in most, if not all, cases of AML with +11 as a sole abnormality, and can be found in cases of AML with +11 or +11q accompanied by other cytogenic abnormalities. The duplication is more prevalent in AML than was recognized previously in part because its size and location vary considerably, requiring a variety of molecular probes for detection. Our finding of the ALL1 duplication as a consistent defect in patients with +11 represents the first identification of a specific gene rearrangement associated with recurrent trisomy in human cancer.","['Caligiuri, M A', 'Strout, M P', 'Schichman, S A', 'Mrozek, K', 'Arthur, D C', 'Herzig, G P', 'Baer, M R', 'Schiffer, C A', 'Heinonen, K', 'Knuutila, S', 'Nousiainen, T', 'Ruutu, T', 'Block, A W', 'Schulman, P', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard, J', 'Croce, C M', 'Bloomfield, C D']","['Caligiuri MA', 'Strout MP', 'Schichman SA', 'Mrozek K', 'Arthur DC', 'Herzig GP', 'Baer MR', 'Schiffer CA', 'Heinonen K', 'Knuutila S', 'Nousiainen T', 'Ruutu T', 'Block AW', 'Schulman P', 'Pedersen-Bjergaard J', 'Croce CM', 'Bloomfield CD']","['Division of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Exons/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', '*Trisomy']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Mar 15;56(6):1418-25.,,,"['CA-37027/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-57974/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-65670/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we determined the exon organization of the TEL gene and performed mutational analysis of TEL and KIP1 in 33 childhood ALL patients known to have loss of heterozygosity at this locus.

Lacking pathogenic significance, these events can serve as reporters for assessing environmental genotoxicity. The present molecular analyses of hprt mutations arising spontaneously in normal children show that 30-35% of the genomic hprt changes in children under 5 years of age have approximately 20 Kb deletions encompassing exons 2 and 3. The frequency of these specific changes are dramatically decreased in older children. Sequence analysis of these deletion breakpoint and joining regions reveal the molecular hallmarks of V(D)J recombinase-mediated recombination events. This early childhood hprt mutational spectrum is quite distinct from the adult background spectrum but similar to that reported previously for newborns, as determined in lymphocytes from placental cord blood. The present study also demonstrates that definition of sequences in the hprt deletion joining regions that are analogous to the N-nucleotide insertion hypervariable regions of rearranged T-cell receptor genes allows the same identification of in vivo clonality of mutants as does analysis of the T-cell receptor gene rearrangements themselves. These methods reveal an in vivo clonal amplification of a V(D)J recombinase-mediated hprt mutant clone in one child in the present study. This newly found age-frequency distribution of V(D)J recombinase-mediated hprt mutations correlates with the age-frequency distribution of childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia. A significant number of these malignancies, including acute T-cell leukemia, are also characterized by V(D)J recombinase-mediated recombinations but in critical regions of the genome. hprt, therefore, captures a pathogenic mutagenic mechanism as a harmless mistake which, when it occurs in other genetic regions, may result in malignancy.","['Finette, B A', 'Poseno, T', 'Albertini, R J']","['Finette BA', 'Poseno T', 'Albertini RJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Vermont, Burlington 05401, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/*physiology', 'Exons/*genetics', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Introns/genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', '*T-Lymphocytes', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'VDJ Recombinases']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Mar 15;56(6):1405-12.,,,"['1K11HD01010-01/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30688/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of a toxin gene is dependent on the cell type targeted, the quantity of exogenous protein synthesized, and the mechanisms of growth inhibition and bystander killing. To develop gene therapy for targeting metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, the toxic activity of herpes simplex virus type 1-thymidine kinase, Escherichia coli cytosine deaminase, and human deoxycytidine kinase were investigated in metastatic human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines H1437 and H2122. Cells were transduced stably with retroviral vectors containing the toxin gene cDNA under the control of either a strong [cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate early promotor and enhancer] or an intermediate strength (Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat) promotor. A comparison of toxin gene efficacy was based on the level of specific enzyme activity, the concentration of prodrug required to inhibit cell growth by 50%, and the magnitude of the bystander effect. In lung adenocarcinoma cell lines, cytosine deaminase, driven by the CMV promoter, was superior to thymidine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase in its ability to achieve high levels of specific enzyme activity, to induce growth inhibition, and to affect neighboring cell growth. Therefore, cytosine deaminase expressed from the CMV promotor seems to be the most promising toxin gene for human lung adenocarcinoma gene therapy.","['Hoganson, D K', 'Batra, R K', 'Olsen, J C', 'Boucher, R C']","['Hoganson DK', 'Batra RK', 'Olsen JC', 'Boucher RC']","['Department of Medicine, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 27599-7248, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Prodrugs)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.- (Nucleoside Deaminases)', 'EC 3.5.4.1 (Cytosine Deaminase)', 'P9G3CKZ4P5 (Ganciclovir)']",IM,"['Adenocarcinoma/genetics/secondary/*therapy', 'Antimetabolites/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytomegalovirus/genetics', 'Cytosine Deaminase', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/*biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Induction', 'Ganciclovir/*metabolism', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/genetics/*therapeutic use', 'Lung Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Nucleoside Deaminases/*biosynthesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Pleural Neoplasms/genetics/secondary/*therapy', 'Prodrugs/*metabolism', 'Simplexvirus/genetics', 'Thymidine Kinase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/15 00:00,1996/03/15 00:01,['1996/03/15 00:00'],"['1996/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1996 Mar 15;56(6):1315-23.,,,['HL51818-02/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In combination, these markers were informative among 96% of patients. Minimal residual disease (MRD) was followed up in 23 of these patients with available materials over a period varying from 8 to 54 months with at least one leukemia-specific probe. In most children, MRD was decreased continuously to an ultimately undetectable level within 6 to 12 months after remission induction therapy. One patient exhibited low-level residual leukemic cells for 4 years before the MRD turned negative. Another patient remained in complete remission for 45 months, although a positive signal was detected at 34 months using TCR delta probe, but was negative with a TCR gamma marker which was positive at presentation. In three patients who relapsed, MRD either persisted through the clinical course or became positive and eventually increased 3-11 months before clinical relapse. These data suggested that the combined use of multiple gene markers is a valuable tool for the PCR-based MRD detection, since it can cover most ALL patients. Furthermore, long-term follow-up of MRD is helpful for determining the dosage as well as the period of maintenance chemotherapy and for predicting impending relapse.","['Kuang, S', 'Gu, L', 'Dong, S', 'Cao, Q', 'Xu, C', 'Huang, W', 'Su, X Y', 'Huang, Q H', 'Xie, J X', 'Chen, S J', 'Chen, Z']","['Kuang S', 'Gu L', 'Dong S', 'Cao Q', 'Xu C', 'Huang W', 'Su XY', 'Huang QH', 'Xie JX', 'Chen SJ', 'Chen Z']","['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Rui-Jin Hospital, Shanghai Second Medical University (SSMU), China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Rearrangement, delta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, gamma-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1996 Jun;88(2):110-7. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(95)00286-3.,,"['0165460895002863 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(95)00286-3 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Approximately 15 cases have been reported to the Food and Drug Administration linking cytarabine with pancreas-related toxicities. Previous case reports have been complicated by comorbid illnesses and the coadministration of other drugs associated with acute pancreatitis. METHODS: This report describes the clinical course of a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who developed recurrent pancreatitis associated with cytarabine therapy. RESULTS: A male age 36 years with French-American-British M5B acute myelogenous leukemia received induction cytarabine (200 mg/m2/day) by continuous infusion for 7 days, and subsequently developed acute pancreatitis. The patient was rechallenged with intermittent, bolus, high dose cytarabine (HDAC) (3 g/m2bid administered over 3 hours) during the following intensification treatment, but did not develop clinical acute pancreatitis. Retreatment with continuous infusion cytarabine at a later time resulted in recurrence of acute pancreatitis.

METHODS: We analyzed, retrospectively, the clinical and laboratory features of 159 consecutive patients age >60 years with AML. Ninety-two patients presenting as de novo AML were considered suitable for aggressive chemotherapy according to inclusion criteria not different from those commonly used for younger adults. They belonged to all of the French-American-British classification types except M3, and their median age was 67 years (range: 60-79). Antileukemic treatment consisted of 1 of 3 sequential protocols adopted at the S. Eugenio University Hospital of Rome between 1987 and 1993. The three therapeutic groups were similar in number and presenting characteristics. In addition to arabinosylcytosine, induction schedules included mitoxantrone (Groups I and II) or daunorubicin (Group III), and etoposide (Groups I and III). Once in complete remission (CR), patients were consolidated with two other courses of chemotherapy using reduced dosages of the same drugs given during induction. RESULTS: Induction treatment achieved a 52.2% CR rate, with median remission duration and event free survival (EFS) of 35 and 27 weeks, respectively. Because no significant differences between the results of the three therapeutic groups were observed, all cases were pooled to evaluate the prognostic factors. In univariate analysis, the only presenting characteristic significantly associated with failure of induction treatment was age >67 years (P=0.007). Factors associated with an increased likelihood of shorter remission duration were CD7 expression on leukemic cells (P=0.007) and an abnormal karyotype (P=0.010; those predicting shorter EFS were a chromosomal status other than normal (P=0.002) and detection of CD14 antigen (P=0.008). Logistic regression results identified age and CD14 expression as the variables with independent prognostic impact on CR achievement.

Italian Leukemia Study Group.,2157-61,"BACKGROUND: Very little information is presently available regarding risk factors for essential thrombocythemia (ET). METHODS: A case-control study was performed to study the possible association between ET and selected behavioral, occupational, and environmental exposures. RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients aged 20 years or older and 156 controls were enrolled in 2 Italian Hematology Departments located in Rome and Pavia. Controls were recruited among outpatients seen in the same hospitals and matched 4:1 to the patients after stratification by age and sex. Odds ratio (OR) estimates suggest an association between ET and hair dye use (in particular the use of dark hair dye for periods longer than 10 years: OR - 5.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-19.9), living in houses built with tuff (a material with a high concentration of gamma-emitting radionuclides and radon) for longer than 9 years (OR = 5.1; 95% CI, 1.2-22.1), and selected occupations (electrical worker and shoemaker, OR +infinity and 2.7; 95% CI, 0.5-16 respectively). CONCLUSION: Behavioral exposures such as hair dyes, living in a tuff house, and working as an electrician are significantly associated with ET development.

In the present study, we determined whether Ca2+ signals and the activity of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) were required for the induction of c-jun in Jurkat cells stimulated with cross-linked anti-T cell receptor/CD3 antibodies or exposed to oxidative stress in the form of micromolar concentrations of H2O2. Jurkat cells exhibited rapid elevations in intracellular calcium [Ca2+]i levels in response to H2O2 and cross-linked anti-CD3 antibodies that mainly reflected the influx of extracellular Ca2+. The Ca2+ flux in response to oxidative signals was distinguished by an exquisite sensitivity to inhibition with Ni2+, suggesting the involvement of cation channels. PTK activity was needed for [Ca2+]i elevations in response to both oxidative and anti-CD3 signals, although H2O2 induction of [Ca2+]i increases was more resistant to inhibition by genistein than anti-CD3 [Ca2+]i responses. Both oxidative signals and anti-CD3 stimulation induced increased levels of c-jun and c-fos mRNA. The increased expression of c-jun with H2O2 was preceded by [Ca2+]i increases and accompanied by activation of c-Jun aminoterminal kinases (JNKs), as well as increased AP-1 binding activity. Induction of c-jun with oxidative signals and anti-CD3 was also shown to be crucially dependent on [Ca2+]i elevations because the chelation of [Ca2+]i with BAPTA resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of c-jun expression. Furthermore, inhibition studies demonstrated that the optimal induction of c-jun mRNA in response to oxidative signals required PTK as well as protein kinase C (PKC). Thus, these findings suggest that both [Ca2+]i signals and the activity of PTKs are essential for the optimal expression of c-jun in response to TCR/CD3 signals and changes in redox potentials.","['Liu, B', 'Hackshaw, K V', 'Whisler, R L']","['Liu B', 'Hackshaw KV', 'Whisler RL']","['Department of Medical Biochemistry, William H.

Because other cytokines utilizing this receptor subunit stimulate acute-phase protein synthesis, we tested cardiotrophin-1 in in vitro assays of protein synthesis by primary rat hepatocytes, rat hepatoma cells (H35), and human hepatoma cells (HepG2). CT-1 showed a dose-dependent induction of protein synthesis by primary rat hepatocytes, with effective concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 ng/ml. Production of a number of acute-phase proteins, including alpha 1-cysteine proteinase inhibitor ( alpha 1-CPI), alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha 1-Pi), alpha 2-macroglobulin, and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, was markedly increased at 48 and 72 h of cytokine stimulation. In rat H35 cells, CT-1 stimulated alpha 1-Pi and alpha 1-CPI protein production and upregulated alpha 1-CPI mRNA levels with similar potency. Compared with other IL-6-type human cytokines at optimal concentrations in parallel assays, CT-1 induced similar levels of acute-phase proteins as human oncostatin M (OM) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), whereas human IL-6 induced the greatest levels of alpha 1-CPI or alpha 1-Pi production by H35 cells. When tested on human HepG2 cells, murine CT-1 was far less effective, in that it stimulated alpha 1-antichymotrypsin production only at very high concentrations (100 ng/ml) but did not alter haptoglobin or alpha 1-Pi. Human OM and IL-6 were effective at lower concentrations and induced much higher levels of acute-phase protein synthesis, whereas LIF activity was similar to that to CT-1. These results show that murine CT-1 is a strong acute-phase mediator for rat hepatocytes in vitro and its activity is similar to LIF on rat hepatocytes, H35 cells, and HepG2 cells.","['Richards, C D', 'Langdon, C', 'Pennica, D', 'Gauldie, J']","['Richards CD', 'Langdon C', 'Pennica D', 'Gauldie J']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Interferon Cytokine Res,Journal of interferon & cytokine research : the official journal of the International Society for Interferon and Cytokine Research,9507088,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'AJ7U77BR8I (cardiotrophin 1)']",IM,"['Acute-Phase Reaction/*chemically induced', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Liver/cytology/*drug effects', 'Liver Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Interferon Cytokine Res. 1996 Jan;16(1):69-75. doi: 10.1089/jir.1996.16.69.,,['10.1089/jir.1996.16.69 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using a recombinant VCAM-IgG fusion protein (VCAM-Ig) as a soluble ligand for alpha 4 beta 1 we directly demonstrated by fluorescence analysis that the alpha 4 beta 1 receptor can exist in different affinity states on the cell surface, and that a high affinity state is induced by manganese ions or certain activating anti-beta 1 monoclonal antibodies (Jakubowski et al., 1995b). Here we have extended these observations by developing a rapid and reproducible assay using alkaline phosphatase (AP)-coupled VCAM-Ig (VCAM-Ig-AP) which measures the interaction between VCAM1 and alpha 4 integrins in a microtiter plate format. This assay has allowed us to evaluate directly the effects of metal ions, anti-beta 1 mAbs, and different cell types and species on the VCAM1/alpha 4 integrin interaction.

Stable minimal residual disease was associated with clinical and hematologic remission, while a progressive increase of host cells was strictly related with disease relapse. Cytogenetic investigation on the same samples showed recipient cells only in few cases. It was concluded that FISH analysis is useful for: (1) characterizing cases in which standard cytogenetic analysis has failed; (2) detecting host cells in sex-mismatched transplanted patients; and (3) evaluating Ph-negative CML with the BCR/ABL rearrangement. The possibility of detecting chromosome rearrangements in interphase nuclei using FISH analysis improves diagnosis and prediction of disease evolution and prompts earlier therapeutic approaches.","['Palka, G', 'Stuppia, L', 'Di Bartolomeo, P', 'Morizio, E', 'Peila, R', 'Franchi, P G', 'Calabrese, G']","['Palka G', 'Stuppia L', 'Di Bartolomeo P', 'Morizio E', 'Peila R', 'Franchi PG', 'Calabrese G']","['Instituti di Biologia e Genetica, Universita di Chieti, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/pathology/therapy', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chimera', 'Fanconi Anemia/pathology/therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Genes, abl', '*Graft Survival', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogenes', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Remission Induction', 'Sex Chromosomes', 'Thalassemia/pathology/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Feb;17(2):231-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The conditioning regimen consisted of high-dose chemotherapy alone or followed by total body irradiation (TBI). Recombinant G-CSF was given after BPCs infusion on day +8. All patients in ECP not pretreated with IFN-alpha are alive and five of them are Ph-negative in the marrow after autografting. Six of seven patients autografted with Ph-negative BPCs in the group of ECP pretreated with IFN-alpha (<12 months) are alive and two of them are still Ph-negative in the marrow. In the same group, the only patient transplanted with partially Ph-positive BPCs, died of blastic transformation 2 months after reinfusion. Three patients (two patients autografted with Ph-negative BPCs and one patient with Ph-positive BPC) in the group of LCP pretreated with IFN-alpha >12 months are alive but Ph-positive after autografting. The other three patients of the same group died of procedure-related toxicity (two patients) and blastic transformation (one patient). Seventeen patients (10/10 ECP not pretreated with IFN-alpha; 5/7 ECP pretreated with IFN-alpha and 2/6 LCP pretreated with IFN-alpha) of 23 autografted patients were treated with IFN-alpha +/- IL-2. Toxicities after autografting were mostly related to myelosuppression, particularly thrombocytopenia. All patients of the two groups pretreated with IFN-alpha developed febrile episodes during the aplastic phase following BPCs reinfusion. No patient autografted in ECP and those not pretreated with IFN-alpha developed febrile episodes. This is also probably due to the use of i.v. antibiotic and antimicotic prophylaxis when neutrophils were < or = 1 x 10(9)/l after autografting. Greater toxicity was observed in patients pretreated with IFN-alpha, being lethal in two cases in LCF. In conclusion, the ""in vivo' manipulation approach employed in our institution is a safe procedure and it results in a high collection of Ph-negative cells in the blood if the cells are harvested: (1) in early chronic phase; (2) in early phase of recovery after chemotherapy-inducing aplasia; (3) in patients not extensively pretreated with IFN-alpha.

A prospective study from the French Society of Pediatric Hematology and Immunology (SHIP).,191-6,"The objective of this study was to compare allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with high-dose cytarabine containing chemotherapy in children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR). One hundred and seventy-one children were enrolled on the LAME89/91 protocol. Induction chemotherapy was a combination of cytarabine and mitoxantrone. After achieving CR, patients who had an HLA-identical sibling donor underwent allogeneic BMT. Children not eligible for BMT received post remission chemotherapy which included two consolidation courses, the second consolidation consisting of high-dose cytarabine with amsacrine and asparaginase. CR was achieved in 149 children (87%). Thirty-two had an HLA-identical sibling donor and were eligible for BMT. These 32 patients, as well as an additional child who had a one antigen HLA-mismatched father, received BMT during first CR. Consequently, 33 patients were analyzed in the BMT group and 116 in the chemotherapy group. The 4-year probability of relapse was 26 +/- 15% in the BMT group and 47 +/- 10% in the chemotherapy group (P = 0.04). The risk of therapy-related death was 3% for BMT and 7.7% for chemotherapy. Disease-free survival (DFS) was 72 +/- 15% in the BMT group and 48 +/- 10% in the chemotherapy group (p = 0.02). We conclude that allogeneic BMT from a matched sibling donor is the treatment of choice for reducing the relapse risk and for increasing DFS in children with AML in first CR.","['Michel, G', 'Leverger, G', 'Leblanc, T', 'Nelken, B', 'Baruchel, A', 'Landman-Parker, J', 'Thuret, I', 'Bergeron, C', 'Bordigoni, P', 'Esperou-Bourdeau, H', 'Perel, Y', 'Vannier, J P', 'Schaison, G']","['Michel G', 'Leverger G', 'Leblanc T', 'Nelken B', 'Baruchel A', 'Landman-Parker J', 'Thuret I', 'Bergeron C', 'Bordigoni P', 'Esperou-Bourdeau H', 'Perel Y', 'Vannier JP', 'Schaison G']","[""Hopital d'Enfants la Timone, Marseille, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",IM,"['Amsacrine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/mortality', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality/*therapy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Nuclear Family', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1996 Feb;17(2):191-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to investigate its predisposing factors, clinical manifestations and prognostic determinants, a prospective observational study of nosocomial candidemia was undertaken at the hospital. From 1 May 1994 to 30 April 1995, 118 consecutive adult patients with 120 Candida spp blood isolates were analyzed. Clinical presentations included fever (100%) with a median duration of 3 days, diarrhea within 7 days of candidemia (27.9%) and macronodular skin emboli (7.6%). Laboratory studies showed worsening azotemia (35.6%), elevation of aminotransferase (28.3%), leukocytosis (27.1%) and thrombocytopenia (23.3%). Use of multiple antibiotics, retained vascular catheters and parenteral nutritional support were the three most common predisposing factors for candidemia. C. albicans was the most common isolate (50%), followed by C. tropicalis (20%), C. glabrata (14%), C. parapsilosis (9.2%). C. guilliermondii (2.5%), and C. Krusei (1.7%). C. tropicalis was more frequently the cause of candidemia in patients with leukemia and neutropenia, while C. glabrata was more commonly seen in patients receiving fluconazole prophylaxis. A severity scoring system adopted from prospective bacteremia studies proved to be highly predictive of mortality in candidemic patients. The overall case fatality rate was 70/118 (59.3%), and 51/70 (72.9%) were attributable to candidemia. In a multivariate analysis, the prognostic factors adversely influencing outcome were: higher severity scores, no removal of the catheter, persistent candidemia and lack of antifungal therapy.","['Hung, C C', 'Chen, Y C', 'Chang, S C', 'Luh, K T', 'Hsieh, W C']","['Hung CC', 'Chen YC', 'Chang SC', 'Luh KT', 'Hsieh WC']","['Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, ROC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Singapore,J Formos Med Assoc,Journal of the Formosan Medical Association = Taiwan yi zhi,9214933,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Candidiasis/*epidemiology', 'Cross Infection/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Fungemia/*epidemiology', 'Hospitals, University', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Taiwan/epidemiology']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Formos Med Assoc. 1996 Jan;95(1):19-28.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chimeric status was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of simple tandem repeat (STR) sequences (maximal sensitivity, 0.1%). At least two serial samples were examined in 23 patients. Of these, two had evidence of complete donor engraftment at all times and eight showed stable low level mixed chimerism (MC) (<1% recipient hematopoiesis). All 10 of these patients remain in remission with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. By contrast, 13 patients demonstrated a progressive return of recipient hematopoiesis. Five of these relapsed (4 to 9 months post BMT), one died of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis and seven remain in remission with a minimum follow-up of 24 months. Five children were excluded from serial analysis as two serial samples were not collected before either relapse (3) or graft rejection (2). We conclude that as with sibling transplants, ex vivo T depleted UD BMT in children with ALL is associated with a high incidence of MC. Stable donor engraftment and low level MC always correlated with continued remission. However, detection of a progressive return of recipient cells did not universally correlate with relapse, but highlighted those patients at greatest risk.

Associated clinical disorders included T-cell large granular lymphocytic (LGL) leukemia, thymoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Review of bone marrow findings in 40 patients showed absence of erythroid precursors in 14 patients and rare pronormoblasts in 26. None had morphologic evidence of myelodysplasia. T-cell receptor gene rearrangement studies with Southern blot technique in 14 patients showed clonal rearrangements in nine. Karyotypic analyses performed in 28 patients showed clonal abnormalities in four. Overall, 28 of 47 patients (60%) responded to immunosuppressive therapy, but none were the patients with cytogenetic abnormalities. There was a trend toward superior response to immunosuppressive agents in the patients with T-cell LGL leukemia. Cyclophosphamide, with or without corticosteroids, was the most useful treatment agent. Cyclosporine A was effective for refractory disease. Neither the presence of an associated clinical disorder nor the existence of detectable erythroid precursors affected overall survival. We conclude that (1) T-cell LGL leukemia is the disorder most commonly associated with pure red cell aplasia, (2) the presence of clonal cytogenetic abnormality predicts poor response to immunosuppressive therapy, and (3) oral cyclophosphamide and cyclosporine A are effective treatment regimens.","['Lacy, M Q', 'Kurtin, P J', 'Tefferi, A']","['Lacy MQ', 'Kurtin PJ', 'Tefferi A']","['Division of Hematology and Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic and Mayo Foundation, Rochester, MN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytogenetics', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications/*genetics', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/complications/*genetics']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 1;87(7):3000-6.,,['S0006-4971(20)64815-7 [pii]'],,['Blood. 1996 Oct 15;88(8):3244-5.

In these reports, transformed cell lines and drug-selected cells have been used for vaccinations. To determine the effectiveness of B7-1-transduced primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells on the induction of antitumor immunity, we have studied a murine AML model in which primary AML cells were retrovirally transduced with the murine B7-1 cDNA. A defective retroviral producer clone expressing B7-1 and secreting a high titer of virus was used for infection of AML cells. Unselected transduced AML cells, expressing a high level of B7-1, were used for in vivo vaccinations. Our results show that one intravenous (IV) injection of irradiated B7-1-positive (B7-1+) AML cells can provide long-lasting (5 to 6 months) systemic immunity against subsequent challenge with wild-type AML cells. Furthermore, one exposure to irradiated B7-1+ AML cells results in rejection of leukemia by leukemic mice when the vaccination occurs in the early stages of the disease. The antileukemia immunity is CD8+ T-cell-dependent and B7/CD28-mediated, since in vivo treatment of mice with anti-CD8 monoclonal antibody or CTLA-4 Ig leads to abrogation of the specific antileukemia immune response.

Growth activities were measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation of the cells after 24 hours' culture with or without exogenous IL-2. Both autonomous and IL-2-responsive growth activities were higher in the patients than in healthy controls and were significantly correlated with each other (P < .0001, r = .956). Both higher growth activities were significantly associated with shorter survival times (P = .0042, r = .472 and P = .0117, r = .421, respectively). An increased serum LDH value was also significantly associated with shorter survival times (P = .0011, r = .530), but corrected calcium level, sex, white blood cell count, or age were not. These results strongly suggest that both growth activities of primary tumor cells, in addition to the serum LDH value, are prognostic determinants in ATL. We propose a new prognostic classification combining LDH values and autonomous growth activity into three groups: (1) high growth activity and high LDH; (2) high growth activity and low LDH, or low growth activity and high LDH; and (3) low growth activity and low LDH, which showed a significant relationship to survival time (P = .0014; the median survival time for each group was 39, 94, and 340 days, respectively).","['Arima, N', 'Hidaka, S', 'Fujiwara, H', 'Matsushita, K', 'Ohtsubo, H', 'Arimura, K', 'Kukita, T', 'Fukumori, J', 'Tanaka, H']","['Arima N', 'Hidaka S', 'Fujiwara H', 'Matsushita K', 'Ohtsubo H', 'Arimura K', 'Kukita T', 'Fukumori J', 'Tanaka H']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kagoshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 1;87(7):2900-4.,,['S0006-4971(20)64803-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This translocation fuses TEL and AML1, two genes previously cloned from translocation breakpoints in myeloid leukemias. In addition, allelic loss of the TEL gene can be detected in 15% to 22% of childhood ALLs. In the present study, we have sought allelic deletions of TEL and the presence of the t(12;21) in 50 children with B-lineage ALL, using a combination of microsatellite typing, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and analysis of the fusion transcripts resulting from the TEL-AML1 gene fusion. Our results indicate that the association between the t(12;21) and the deletion of the nontranslocated allele of TEL is among the most frequent abnormalities observed in B-lineage ALLs. FISH analysis using several cosmid probes showed that, in one patient with a t(12;21) translocation involving TEL, the second allele had an intragenic deletion. This observation points to TEL as the actual target of 12p12-13 deletions in patients that associate a t(12;21) with a deletion. The TEL-AML1 fusion RNA was found in all patients with the t(12;21) whereas the reciprocal AML1-TEL transcript was only found in a subset of patients, suggesting that only the protein product encoded by TEL-AML1 is likely to play a role in leukemogenesis. The observation that, in two patients with the t(12;21), a deletion of TEL was only present in a subclone indicates that this deletion was a secondary event that occurred after the translocation. The frequent occurrence of TEL deletions in patients with t(12;21) suggests that the deletion of the normal TEL allele subsequent to the t(12;21) provides a further proliferative advantage to leukemic cells.","['Raynaud, S', 'Cave, H', 'Baens, M', 'Bastard, C', 'Cacheux, V', 'Grosgeorge, J', 'Guidal-Giroux, C', 'Guo, C', 'Vilmer, E', 'Marynen, P', 'Grandchamp, B']","['Raynaud S', 'Cave H', 'Baens M', 'Bastard C', 'Cacheux V', 'Grosgeorge J', 'Guidal-Giroux C', 'Guo C', 'Vilmer E', 'Marynen P', 'Grandchamp B']","['Laboratoire de Genetique Moleculaire des Cancers Humains, Nice, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Alleles', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 1;87(7):2891-9.,,['S0006-4971(20)64802-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To elucidate the possible role of erythroid genes of the erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) and the transcription factor GATA-1 in this effect, the regulatory regions of the above genes and human epsilon- and gamma-globin and porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) genes were fused to the firefly luciferase gene. The resulting reporter constructs were tested in a transfection assay of the erythroleukemic cell line K562 stimulated to differentiate by treatment with the anthracycline drugs ACM and DOX or hemin (HEM). The results showed activation of the tested promoters after cell treatment with ACM, but not with DOX or HEM. In contrast to the mouse EpoR gene promoter, the activity of the human EpoR gene promoter (-659/-60) in the reporter construct was not modified by addition of the first intron sequence. In ACM-treated K562 cells, EpoR gene promoter activity completely correlated with EpoR and GATA-1 mRNA levels and the degree of erythroid maturation. In addition, ACM strongly activated the erythroid gene promoters that contain GATA binding sites. Nevertheless, less activation was also observed for the GATA-1 gene promoter (-312/-31) lacking any known GATA binding sites. Insertion of the GATA-1 gene enhancer with two canonic GATA binding sites, stimulated the ACM activation effect for EpoR and GATA-1 promoter-containing constructs. Mutation of the enhancer GATA binding sites abolished this effect. All the regulatory regions tested (except gamma-globin promoter) were completely inactive in nonerythroid COS7 cells. These data indicate that (1) two structurally different anthracycline analogues, DOX and ACM, differ in their differentiation mechanisms, and (2) ACM switches on the erythroid program of K562 cells, at least in part because of interaction with a factor(s) that recognizes the GATA binding sites in the promoter region of erythroid genes leading to their activation.","['Aries, A', 'Trentesaux, C', 'Ottolenghi, S', 'Jardillier, J C', 'Jeannesson, P', 'Doubeikovski, A']","['Aries A', 'Trentesaux C', 'Ottolenghi S', 'Jardillier JC', 'Jeannesson P', 'Doubeikovski A']","['Laboratoire de Biochimie, GIBSA, Faculte de Pharmacie, Reims, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (aclacinomycins)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 1;87(7):2885-90.,,['S0006-4971(20)64801-7 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When 20 different WT1 antisense (AS) oligomers covering from the 5' cap sites of the WT1 gene to the 3' end were examined for the inhibitory effect on the growth of K562 cells expressing WT1, four WT1 AS oligomers inhibited the cell growth, whereas WT1 sense and random sequence oligomers had no effect on the cell growth of K562. Moreover, WT1 AS oligomers significantly inhibited the growth of the clonogenic cells of fresh leukemic cells in six of 14 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, in one of two patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) chronic phase, and in one of one patient with CML blastic crisis. However, these oligomers did not inhibit normal colony-forming unit-granulocyte-macrophage. Western blot analysis clearly demonstrated the significant reduction in the WT1 protein levels in the K562 and fresh leukemic cells that were treated with the WT1 AS oligomers, confirming that the inhibitory effect of the WT1 AS oligomers on the cell growth operates via the reduction in the WT1 protein levels.

Recently, it has become apparent that the MLL gene is very frequently disrupted by chromosomal translocations in patients with secondary leukemias associated with chemotherapeutic regimens incorporating topoisomerase II inhibitors. These secondary leukemias associated with topoisomerase II inhibitors (most commonly teniposide, etoposide, or doxorubicin) have distinct clinical and biologic features which have led to the speculation that they are induced by treatment with topoisomerase II inhibitors. We have identified a site within the MLL breakpoint cluster region (bcr) that is highly sensitive to double-strand DNA cleavage induced by topoisomerase II inhibitors. This finding is quite specific and highly reproducible. Although it was initially discovered in malignant lymphoblasts isolated from a patient receiving multiagent chemotherapy, this site-specific double-strand DNA cleavage can be induced in tissue culture using malignant cell lines as well as peripheral blood from normal individuals. Site-specific cleavage occurs in a significant fraction of cells using a variety of model systems, is both time and dose dependent, and can be induced with either doxorubicin or etoposide. This site-specific cleavage maps to the same region as a consensus topoisomerase II cleavage site within the MLL bcr. These results suggest that site specific cleavage within the MLL bcr induced by topoisomerase II inhibitors may be an early step leading to MLL translocations and secondary leukemia.","['Aplan, P D', 'Chervinsky, D S', 'Stanulla, M', 'Burhans, W C']","['Aplan PD', 'Chervinsky DS', 'Stanulla M', 'Burhans WC']","['Department of Molecular Medicine and Pedriatrics, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Topoisomerase II Inhibitors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Topoisomerase II Inhibitors', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/*drug effects']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Apr 1;87(7):2649-58.,,['S0006-4971(20)64773-5 [pii]'],,['Blood. 1997 Mar 15;89(6):2224-6.

We investigated the potential of CD34+ blood cells for reconstituting hematopoiesis and lymphopoiesis after allogeneic transplantation. HLA-identical sibling donors of 10 patients with hematologic malignancies were treated with G-CSF (filgrastim), 5 microgram/kg subcutaneously twice daily for 5 to 7 days. CD34+ cells were selected from the apheresis concentrates by immunoadsorption, concomitantly the number of T cells was reduced 100- to 1,000-fold. After transplantation, five patients received cyclosporine A for graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) prophylaxis (group I); five patients additionally received methotrexate (group II). G-CSF and erythropoietin were given to all patients. Mean numbers of 7.45 x 10(6) CD34+ and 1.2 x 10(6) CD3+ cells per kilogram were transplanted.

The factors determining the biological activity of the chelators have classically been attributed to the chelators' capacity for binding iron and to their ability to traverse membranes as free chelators and as chelator-iron complexes. We show in this work that the nature of the chelatable pool of cell iron also contributes to the susceptibility of cells to iron chelators. A class of N-terminal (Nt derivatives of desferrioxamine (DFO), (Nt-DFO), is shown here to differentially affect growth and replication of intraerythrocytic parasites (Plasmodium falciparum). Methyl-anthranilic DFO (MADFO), the relatively less hydrophilic member of the Nt-DFOs series, reduced parasite proliferation (48 hour test) with an IC50 of 4 +/- 1 micromol/L and mammalian cell (K562 and HepG2) proliferation with an IC50 > 100 micromol/L. On the other hand, the more hydrophilic Nt-free DFO, displayed IC50 values of 21 +/- 5 micromol/L for parasites and 7 +/- 1 micromol/L for mammalian cells. The selective antiparasitic activity of MA-DFO, as reflected in the speed of action and IC50 values on cell proliferation, is attributed primarily to membrane permeation and iron (III) binding properties of the drug. In contrast, the relatively low antiproliferative activity of the more permeant MA-DFO on mammalian cells, resulted from MA-DFO's reduced capacity for scavenging intracellular iron. This is apparent from MA-DFO reduced effects on: (1) the chelatable iron (II) pool that is associated with the cell cytosol; (2) the cell chelator-extractable iron, and (3) cell ferritin levels. The potent antimalarial efficacy and biological selectivity of MA-DFO relative to the parent DFO, is of importance for improved design of chemotherapeutic agents.","['Glickstein, H', 'Breuer, W', 'Loyevsky, M', 'Konijn, A M', 'Shanzer, A', 'Cabantchik, Z I']","['Glickstein H', 'Breuer W', 'Loyevsky M', 'Konijn AM', 'Shanzer A', 'Cabantchik ZI']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Institute of Life Sciences, Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antimalarials)', '0 (Iron Chelating Agents)', '0 (N-methylanthranilic-desferrioxamine)', '0 (ortho-Aminobenzoates)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antimalarials/*toxicity', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Deferoxamine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Iron Chelating Agents/metabolism/*toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Plasmodium falciparum/*drug effects/physiology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'ortho-Aminobenzoates/metabolism/*toxicity']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 1;87(11):4871-8.,,['S0006-4971(20)63651-5 [pii]'],['AI 20342/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cell adhesion receptors GPIV (CD36) and integrin alpha 4 beta 1 (CD49d/CD29) were previously identified on circulating sickle reticulocytes, and shown to mediate sickle RBC adhesion to the endothelium. The presence of damaged endothelium in these patients suggests that exposed extracellular matrix proteins could provide a potential substrate for sickle RBC adhesion. To determine whether RBC adhesion receptors could mediate adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, we tested their ability to adhere to a variety of immobilized, purified proteins under flow conditions. Neither sickle nor normal RBC adhered to fibronectin, vitronectin, fibrinogen, or collagen. In contrast, we observed substantial adhesion of sickle but not normal RBC to thrombospondin (TSP). The adhesion was not inhibited with known antagonists of the GPIV-TSP interaction, nor by inhibitors of several other known binding domains in TSP. Moreover, the adhesion was resistant to inhibition by soluble TSP, suggesting that immobilization of TSP exposes an adhesive site that is cryptic on TSP in solution. However, the glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate A, and dextran sulfate were potent inhibitors of this adhesion. These results suggest that a mechanism distinct from GPIV is responsible for sickle RBC adhesion to immobilized TSP under flow conditions.","['Joneckis, C C', 'Shock, D D', 'Cunningham, M L', 'Orringer, E P', 'Parise, L V']","['Joneckis CC', 'Shock DD', 'Cunningham ML', 'Orringer EP', 'Parise LV']","['Department of Pharmacology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill 27599-7365, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Aggrecans)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (CD36 Antigens)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Thrombospondins)', '0 (Vitronectin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Aggrecans', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Anemia, Sickle Cell/*blood/pathology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'CD36 Antigens/immunology/*physiology', 'Cell Adhesion/drug effects', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Erythrocytes, Abnormal/*metabolism', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/physiology', 'Lectins, C-Type', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteoglycans/immunology/physiology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/physiology', 'Rheology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thrombospondins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitronectin/metabolism']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 1;87(11):4862-70.,,['S0006-4971(20)63650-3 [pii]'],"['HL28391/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL45923/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00046/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients were evaluated at the University of Washington before specific therapies (n = 21) or at the time of treatment failure in = 16). Evaluation included a medical and drug exposure history, a physical examination, a chest x-ray or computed tomography to rule out thymoma, lymphocyte immunophenotype studies, anti-nuclear antibody and rheumatoid factor determinations, marrow cytogenetics, and marrow progenitor cell cultures. Retrospective Southern analyses to detect human parvovirus B19 was performed in the 27 patients for whom sera was stored. Clinical follow-up was obtained to document therapeutic responses. Normal burst forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) growth (>30 bursts/10(5) marrow mononuclear cells [MMNC]) in culture proved an outstanding predictor of clinical response, as 27 of 29 individuals with normal frequencies of erythroid bursts in culture responded to immunomodulating therapies (sensitivity 96%, specificity 78%, predictive value 93%, P = .0001 with two-tailed chi square analysis). Overall, 28 patients responded to either immunomodulating therapies or drug withdrawal. Twenty-four patients obtained a normal hematocrit (complete response [CR] and 4 additional patients became transfusion independent (partial response). Although responding patients often required several therapies, 20 of 24 (83%) patients who obtained a CR have sustained a normal hematocrit without maintenance therapy at the time of last follow-up (median 5 years). In contrast, of 8 patients with poor in vitro BFU-E growth (<6 bursts/10(5) MMNC), 7 failed to respond to any therapy and all died (median survival time 17 months). Our data suggest that in individuals, from whom BFU-E mature appropriately in culture, immunosuppressive drugs should be used sequentially until a CR is obtained and a durable remission is the expected outcome.","['Charles, R J', 'Sabo, K M', 'Kidd, P G', 'Abkowitz, J L']","['Charles RJ', 'Sabo KM', 'Kidd PG', 'Abkowitz JL']","['Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle 98195, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/complications', 'Autoimmune Diseases/complications', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'HIV Infections/complications', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins, Intravenous/therapeutic use', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications', 'Parvovirus B19, Human/isolation & purification', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Red-Cell Aplasia, Pure/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Remission Induction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Thymoma/complications', 'Thymus Neoplasms/complications', 'Treatment Failure']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 1;87(11):4831-8.,,['S0006-4971(20)63646-1 [pii]'],"['HL31823/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00037/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results are related to the Pgp-expressing KB8 and KB8-5 call lines. The most sensitive assay was the measurement of modulation of the rhodamine 123 (R123) fluorescence by 2 micromol/L PSC833, followed by the modulation of the probe calcein-AM. We also found a good intralaboratory and interlaboratory correlation between the values of the R123/PSC833 assay for fresh as well as thawed samples. In addition, the affects of PSC833 on 3H-daunorubicin (DNR) accumulation, DNR fluorescence, and 3H-vincristine accumulation were very similar. The correlation between the DNR/PSC833 and R123/PSC833 test was r = .86 (N = 51). The modulation of drug accumulation by 8 micromol/L verapamil was the some as the PSC833 effect for DNR (117%, N = 21), but was higher for vincristine in every single case (161% v 121%, N = 22; P< .001), indicating additional verapamil effects, not related to Pgp. The correlation of the staining of viable cells for Pgp with the monoclonal antibody MRK16 was r = .77 (N = 52) for the R123/PSC833 functional test and r = .84 (N = 50) for the DNR/PSC833 test. From these results it could be calculated that a maximal increase of the mean DNR accumulation of about 50% can be achieved by blocking Pgp pump activity with PSC833 in leukemic blast samples with the highest mean Pgp expression. Subpopulations of blast calls with higher Pgp activity are likely to be present. Their relevance has to be studied further. The methods outlined here allow the reliable, quantitative monitoring of the Pgp/MDR1 phenotype in leukemias in multicentered, clinical Pgp modulation studies.","['Broxterman, H J', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Feller, N', 'Ossenkoppele, G J', 'Wahrer, D C', 'Eekman, C A', 'Schoester, M', 'Lankelma, J', 'Pinedo, H M', 'Lowenberg, B', 'Schuurhuis, G J']","['Broxterman HJ', 'Sonneveld P', 'Feller N', 'Ossenkoppele GJ', 'Wahrer DC', 'Eekman CA', 'Schoester M', 'Lankelma J', 'Pinedo HM', 'Lowenberg B', 'Schuurhuis GJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Academisch Ziekenhuis Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*metabolism', 'Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cryopreservation', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Verapamil/pharmacology', 'Vincristine/metabolism/pharmacology']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 1;87(11):4809-16.,,['S0006-4971(20)63643-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With the aim of determining whether this cytokine might be useful in the treatment of patients with ALL, the effects of huIL-4 on human B-cell precursor ALL engrafted in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice were examined. The inhibition of [3H] thymidine uptake of primary ALL cells by huIL-4 was maintained following engraftment and passage of leukemia in SCID mice. Five of seven xenograft leukemias showed significant inhibition in vitro by huIL-4 at concentrations as low as 0.5 ng/mL; furthermore, huIL-4 counteracted the proliferative effects of IL-7. When used to treat two human leukemias engrafted in SCID mice, huIL-4 200 microgram/kg/d, as a continuous 14-day subcutaneous infusion, suppressed the appearance of circulating lymphoblasts and extended survival of mice by 39% and 108%, respectively, the first demonstration of IL-4 activity against human leukemia in vivo. The mean steady-state huIL-4 level in mouse plasma during the infusion was 1.46 ng/mL (SEM +/- 0.14 ng/mL), which was similar to concentrations found to be effective in vitro.

In the present study, the AML1/ETO mRNA could be detected by RT-PCR in bone marrow (BM) and/or peripheral blood (PB) samples from all 18 patients who had been maintaining complete remission for 12 to 150 months (median, 45 months) following chemotherapy or PB stem cell transplantation (PBSCT), whereas it could not be detected in four patients who had been maintaining remission for more than 30 months following allogeneic BM transplantation (BMT). We surveyed the expression of AML1/ETO mRNA in clonogenic progenitors from BM in these cases. Notably, 51 of 2,469 colonies from clonogenic progenitors (2.1%) expressed the AML1/ETO mRNA in 18 cases who were RT-PCR+ in BM and/or PB samples. Expression was observed in various clonogenic progenitors, including granulocyte-macrophage colonies, mixed colonies, erythroid colonies, and megakaryocyte colonies. Furthermore, we analyzed the clonality of these progenitors by X-chromosome inactivation patterns of the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene in four female patients. The AML1/ETO mRNA+ progenitors showed the PGK allele identical to that detected in the leukemic blasts from the time of initial diagnosis. Normal constitutive hematopoiesis was sustained by polyclonal BM reconstitution in these patients. Accordingly, these committed progenitor cells that express AML1/ETO mRNA during remission likely have arisen from common t(8;21)+ pluripotent progenitor cells with at least trilineage differentiation potential. These data strongly suggest that the origin of the clonogenic leukemic progenitors of t(8;21) AML may be multipotent hematopoietic progenitors that acquired the t(8;21) chromosomal abnormality.","['Miyamoto, T', 'Nagafuji, K', 'Akashi, K', 'Harada, M', 'Kyo, T', 'Akashi, T', 'Takenaka, K', 'Mizuno, S', 'Gondo, H', 'Okamura, T', 'Dohy, H', 'Niho, Y']","['Miyamoto T', 'Nagafuji K', 'Akashi K', 'Harada M', 'Kyo T', 'Akashi T', 'Takenaka K', 'Mizuno S', 'Gondo H', 'Okamura T', 'Dohy H', 'Niho Y']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics/*ultrastructure', 'Clone Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Dosage Compensation, Genetic', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/chemistry/metabolism/*pathology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Oncogenes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Remission Induction', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', '*Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 1;87(11):4789-96.,,['S0006-4971(20)63640-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined how integrin function, rather than simple expression, might determine disease behavior in chronic lymphocyte leukemia (CLL). Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and immunoprecipitation, we first established the precise integrin heterodimer expression of a representative group of CLL patients (beta1 consistently present, with variable alpha 3, alpha 4, and alpha 5; alpha 4 beta 7 often expressed; alpha L beta 2 high; alpha V beta 3 absent). Regarding function, we initially examined the ability of CLL cells to interact with endothelium, because such interaction is the initial event determining the entry of CLL lymphocytes into tissues. The abnormal lymphocytes were shown to bind at low levels to unstimulated endothelium via beta 2/intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM). However, when the endothelium was stimulated, markedly enhanced interaction with endothelium was observed in approximately half the cases; in these patients, the neoplastic population expressed alpha 4 beta 1, which conferred the ability to adhere strongly to stimulated endothelium via the alpha 4 beta 1 ligand, vascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). In relation to the migration of CLL cells within tissues, the abnormal lymphocytes showed differential binding to various adhesive proteins; they did not attach to basement membrane components, but displayed variable adhesion to fibronectin (FN). Finally, we examined the role of cell activation in these processes, and showed that activated CLL lymphocyte populations showed an increased capacity to adhere to both endothelium and matrix. Moreover, ex vivo CLL cells showed no capacity to migrate through endothelium/stroma, but were able to do so after cytokine stimulation. These studies show how the constitutive integrin expression/function, the intrinsic activation state of the cell, and the capacity of cytokines to modify integrin-mediated function all combine to determine the different patterns of clinical disease observed in CLL.","['Vincent, A M', 'Cawley, J C', 'Burthem, J']","['Vincent AM', 'Cawley JC', 'Burthem J']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (CD18 Antigens)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Integrin alpha4beta1)', '0 (Integrins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing)', '0 (Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism/pathology', 'CD18 Antigens/physiology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Extracellular Matrix/metabolism', 'Fibronectins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Integrin alpha4beta1', 'Integrins/*physiology', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Receptors, Lymphocyte Homing/*physiology', 'Umbilical Veins', 'Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1/metabolism']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 1;87(11):4780-8.,,['S0006-4971(20)63639-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We now present data on 27 early chronic-phase ([ECP] studied within 1 year after diagnosis) and 23 advanced-phase ([AP] late chronic phase, ie, studied >1 year from diagnosis, or accelerated phase) CML patients. Fluorescence-activated call-sorting (FACS)-selected 34+DR- and 34+DR+ cells were subjected to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence in situ hybridization. These cells were also cultured in long-term bone marrow culture for 1 to 5 weeks to examine the number of LTC-IC and the presence or absence of the BCR/ABL gene rearrangement in progeny of primitive LTC-IC. The number of 34+DR- cells and LTC-IC present in ECP CML marrow was similar to that in normal (NL) marrow, whereas the numbers were reduced in AP CML. Furthermore, 34+DR- cells from more than 80% of ECP CML patients were BCR/ABL mRNA- and Ph-negative and contained only BCR/ABL mRNA- and Ph-negative LTC-IC, whereas 34+DR- cells and LTC-IC from less than 40% of AP CML patients were BCR/ABL mRNA- and Ph-negative. In contrast to NL marrow, 34+DR+ cells from CML marrow, irrespective of clinical stage, contained large numbers of LTC-IC. CML 34+DR+ cells and LTC-IC were BCR/ABL mRNA- and Ph-positive. Since these studies suggested that a population of primitive progenitors that are Ph-negative can be selected from steady-state marrow in some ECP CML patients, we determined if similar results could be obtained when large quantities of marrow sufficient for transplantation are processed. We demonstrate that 1 to 3 x 10(5) BCR/ABL mRNA-negative 34+DR- cells/kg recipient body weight, containing only BCR/ABL mRNA-negative LTC-IC, can be obtained from a 2- to 2.5-L marrow collection by sequential COBE Spectra apheresis (COBE BCT, Lakewood, CO), CD34+ enrichment using the CEPRATE SC Cell-Concentrator (CellPro, Bothell, WA), and high-speed FACS.

This SC assay is linear, cell concentration independent, and the frequency of SC-IC by limiting dilution analysis is lower than primary CFU-blast. The average output of CFU-blast after 2 to 8 weeks by individual SC-IC varied between 2 and more than 100 in individual patients. Leukemic blasts were sorted based on their expression of antigens previously found useful to characterize normal progenitor differentiation, and analyzed for the percentage of CFU-blast SC-IC, and leukemic LTC-IC within each fraction. All of these progenitor types were heterogeneous in their expression of CD45RA and CD33, but expressed uniformly low levels of CD15 and differed from normal primitive progenitors in their high expression of HLA-DR. CFU-blast had a significantly higher expression of CD71 and CD38 as compared with SC-IC or leukemic LTC-IC. In patients with CD34+ blasts, the majority of their SC-IC at 4 weeks were CD34+/CD38-; however, patients with CD34- blasts had at least some CD34- progenitors. These results show that while heterogeneity exists between patients, it is possible to physically separate subpopulations of AML cells with different proliferative potentials. It also provides some support for the concept that quantitation of leukemic cells capable of producing CFU-blast for 4 weeks or more in vitro measures a less frequent leukemic progenitor with higher proliferative potential that may be the only relevant cell for maintaining the leukemic clone in vivo.","['Sutherland, H J', 'Blair, A', 'Zapf, R W']","['Sutherland HJ', 'Blair A', 'Zapf RW']","['Terry Fox Laboratory, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*classification/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 1;87(11):4754-61.,,['S0006-4971(20)63636-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The bulk of the available experimental evidence seems to indicate that hematopoietic progenitors are not susceptible to HIV-1 infection and their defects seem rather the consequence of direct or indirect negative influences of HIV-1-specific soluble proteins released by productively infected accessory cells. We have now shown that in the presence of a concurrent human herpesvirus-6 infection, two hematopoietic (TF-1 [erythromyeloid] and KG-1 [lymphomyeloid]) progenitor cell lines and human CD34+ hematopoietic progenitors isolated from the bone marrow of normal donors, became susceptible to HIV-1 infection and permissive to HIV-1 replication, although with a limited virus yield.

To investigate this problem, we compared the ability of three cloned bone marrow (BM) stromal cell lines to support the growth of primitive Thy-1lo Sca-1+H-2Khi cells isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting from the BM of Ly-5.2 mice treated 1 day previously with 5-fluo- rouracil. Sorted cells were highly enriched in cobblestone area-forming cells (CAFC), but their frequency was dependent on the stromal cell lines used in this assay (1 per 45 cells on SyS-1; 1 per 97 cells on PA6). In the presence of recombinant leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), CAFC cloning efficiency was increased to 1 per 8 cells on SyS-1 and 1 per 11 cells on PA6, thus showing the high clonogenicity of this primitive stem cell population. More primitive stem cells with competitive repopulating potential were measured by injecting the sorted cells into lethally irradiated Ly-5.1 mice together with 10(5) radioprotective Ly-5.1 BM cells whose long-term repopulating ability has been ""compromised"" by two previous cycles of marrow transplantation and regeneration. Donor-derived lymphocytes and granulocytes were detected in 66% of animals injected with 50 sorted cells. To quantitate the maintenance of competitive repopulating units (CRU) by stromal cells, sorted cells were transplanted at limiting dilution before and after being cultured for 2 weeks on adherent layers of SyS-1, PA6, or S17 cells. CRU represented 1 per 55 freshly sorted cells. CRU could be recovered from cocultures supported by all three stromal cell lines, but their numbers were approximately-sevenfold less than on day 0. In contrast, the addition of LIF to stromal cultures improved CRU survival by 2.5-fold on S17 and PA6 cells (approximately two-fold to threefold decline), and enabled their maintenance on SyS-1. LIF appeared to act indirectly, because alone it did not support the proliferation of Thy-1lo Sca-1+H-2Khi cells in stroma-free cultures. Polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed that Interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta) IL-2, IL-6, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, transforming growth factors, LIF, and Steel Factor (SLF) mRNAs were upregulated in SyS-1 within 1 to 6 hours of LIF-stimulation. To determine if increased expression of SLF by LIF-stimulated SyS-1 cells could account for their capacity to support stem cells, sorted calls were cocultured on simian CV-E cells that were transfected with an expression vector encoding membrane-bound SLF, or supplemented with soluble SLF. In both cases, SLF synergized with IL-6 produced endogenously by CV-E cells enabling CAFC growth equivalent to that on LIF-stimulated SyS-1. CAFC development on LIF-stimulated SyS-1 could also be completely abrogated by an anti-SLF antibody. These data provide evidence for a role of LIF in the support of long-term repopulating stem cells by indirectly promoting cytokine expression by BM stroma. Furthermore, we have used quantitative assays to show a maintenance of CRU numbers, with retention of in vivo function following ex vivo culture.","['Szilvassy, S J', 'Weller, K P', 'Lin, W', 'Sharma, A K', 'Ho, A S', 'Tsukamoto, A', 'Hoffman, R', 'Leiby, K R', 'Gearing, D P']","['Szilvassy SJ', 'Weller KP', 'Lin W', 'Sharma AK', 'Ho AS', 'Tsukamoto A', 'Hoffman R', 'Leiby KR', 'Gearing DP']","['Department of Cell Biology, SyStemix, Inc, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Thy-1 Antigens)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Connective Tissue/*drug effects', 'Connective Tissue Cells', 'Fluorouracil/toxicity', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Graft Survival', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'H-2 Antigens/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*drug effects', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Thy-1 Antigens/genetics']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 1;87(11):4618-28.,,['S0006-4971(20)63620-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E2A-hepatic leukemia factor (HLF), a chimeric transcription factor created by the t(17;19), consists of the amino terminal portion of E2A proteins, including two experimentally defined transcriptional activation domains (TADs), fused to the HLF DNA binding and protein dimerization basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain. To understand the mechanisms by which E2A-HLF induces leukemia and the crucial functions contributed by each constituent of the chimera, it is essential to define the normal transcriptional regulatory properties of HLF and related bZIP proteins. To address these questions, we cloned the human homologue of TEF/VBP, a bZIP protein closely related to HLF. Using a binding site selection assay, we found that TEF bound preferentially to the consensus sequence 5'-GTTACGTAAT-3', which is identical to the previously determined HLF recognition site. TEF and HLF activated transcription of consensus site-containing reporter genes in several different cell types with similar potencies. Using GAL4 chimeric proteins, a TAD was mapped to a discrete approximate 40 amino acid region of TEF and HLF within which they share 72% amino acid identity and 85% similarity. The TEF/HLF activation domain (THAD) has a predicted helical secondary structure, but shares no sequence homology with previously reported TADs. The THAD contained most, if not all, of the transcriptional activation properties present in both TEF and HLF and its deletion completely abrogated transcriptional activity of TEF and HLF in both mammalian cells and yeast. Thus, TEF and HLF share indistinguishable DNA-binding and transcriptional regulatory properties, whose alteration in leukemia may be pathogenetically important.","['Hunger, S P', 'Li, S', 'Fall, M Z', 'Naumovski, L', 'Cleary, M L']","['Hunger SP', 'Li S', 'Fall MZ', 'Naumovski L', 'Cleary ML']","['Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Denver, CO, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HLF protein, human)', '0 (LexA protein, Bacteria)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (TEF protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19/genetics/ultrastructure', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers/genetics/*physiology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*physiology', 'Peptide Fragments/chemistry/physiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Sequence Alignment', '*Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Serine Endopeptidases', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 1;87(11):4607-17.,,['S0006-4971(20)63619-9 [pii]'],"['CA09184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['GENBANK/U44059'],,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of thrombopoietin (TPO), the ligand for the receptor encoded by c-mpl proto-oncogene, on the proliferation and differentiation of UT-7 and its sublines. We found that UT-7/GM, which is a subline of UT-7, but neither UT-7 nor UT-7/EPO, can proliferate in response to TPO. The subline, UT-7/TPO, was established from UT-7/GM by culture at lower concentrations of TPO. UT-7/TPO cells had morphologically mature megakaryocytic characteristics such as developed demarcation membrane in the cytoplasm and multinucleated appearance. This was also confirmed by the high expression of platelet factor-4 and glycoprotein IIb at the mRNA levels and by the high level of DNA content. UT-7/TPO can be maintained by TPO alone, with a doubling time of 24 hours in log growth phase. In the absence of TPO, the majority of the cells died within a few days. Thus, UT-7/TPO has an absolute dependence on TPO for growth and survival and has mature megakaryocytic features. The mRNA for c-mpl was detected in UT-7/TPO and, to a lesser degree, in UT-7/GM. The mRNA level of NF- E2 p45, reported to be an erythroid-specific transcription factor, was upregulated in UT-7/TPO, whereas it was down-regulated in the erythroid subline, UT-7/EPO. There were no significant differences in GATA-1 and GATA-2 mRNA levels among UT-7 and its sublines. Not only EPO but also TPO induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 tyrosine kinase and STAT5-related protein. These findings indicate that UT-7/TPO would be a useful model with which to analyze the gene regulation of megakaryocytic maturation-associated proteins and to study the specific actions of TPO.","['Komatsu, N', 'Kunitama, M', 'Yamada, M', 'Hagiwara, T', 'Kato, T', 'Miyazaki, H', 'Eguchi, M', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Miura, Y']","['Komatsu N', 'Kunitama M', 'Yamada M', 'Hagiwara T', 'Kato T', 'Miyazaki H', 'Eguchi M', 'Yamamoto M', 'Miura Y']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit)', '0 (NFE2 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics/metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', '*Milk Proteins', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Ploidies', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Thrombopoietin/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1996/06/01 00:00,1996/06/01 00:01,['1996/06/01 00:00'],"['1996/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 Jun 1;87(11):4552-60.,,['S0006-4971(20)63613-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We conclude that quantification of BCR-ABL transcripts after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) is valuable in predicting relapse: a more rapid BCR-ABL transcript doubling time before relapse might indicate a more aggressive disease.","['Lin, F', 'van Rhee, F', 'Goldman, J M', 'Cross, N C']","['Lin F', 'van Rhee F', 'Goldman JM', 'Cross NC']","['Leukemia Research Fund Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Accelerated Phase/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/genetics', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Treatment Outcome']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 15;87(10):4473-8.,,['S0006-4971(20)63719-3 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All-trans retinoic acid (RA) induces complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) presumably by binding directly to RAR alpha of APL cells. Leukemic blasts from APL patients initially responsive to RA can become resistant to the agent. HL-60 myeloblasts cultured with RA have developed mutations of the ligand-binding region of RAR alpha and have become resistant to RA. Furthermore, insertion of an RAR alpha with an alteration in the ligand-binding region into normal murine bone marrow cells can result in growth factor-dependent immortalization of the early hematopoietic cells. To determine if alterations of the ligand binding domain of RAR alpha might be involved in several malignant hematologic disorders, the mutational status of this region (exons 7, 8, and 9) was examined in 118 samples that included a variety of cell lines and fresh cells from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemias (AML), including 20 APL patients, 5 of whom were resistant to RA and 1 who was refractory to RA at diagnosis, using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis and DNA sequencing. In addition, 7 of the 20 APLs were studied for alterations of the other coding exons of the gene (exons 2 through 6). No mutations of RAR alpha were detected. Although the sensitivity of PCR-SSCP analysis is less than 100%, these findings suggest that alterations of RAR alpha gene are rare and therefore other mechanisms must be involved in the onset of resistance to retinoids and in the lack of differentiation in disorders of the myeloid lineage.","['Morosetti, R', 'Grignani, F', 'Liberatore, C', 'Pelicci, P G', 'Schiller, G J', 'Kizaki, M', 'Bartram, C R', 'Miller, C W', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Morosetti R', 'Grignani F', 'Liberatore C', 'Pelicci PG', 'Schiller GJ', 'Kizaki M', 'Bartram CR', 'Miller CW', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, UCLA School of Medicine 90048, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Exons/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 15;87(10):4399-403.,,['S0006-4971(20)63710-7 [pii]'],"['CA33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42710/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK42792/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a chemoattractant protein constitutively expressed at the mRNA level and released by B-CLL cells. In view of the presence of the IL-8 receptor mRNA and of specific IL-8 binding, confirmed also by Scatchard analysis using 125I-IL-8, the study was extended to evaluate the possible regulatory role of this cytokine on B-CLL cells. IL-8 failed to show any in vitro proliferative effect on leukemic B-CLL cells. By contrast, the propidium iodide (PI) staining of the DNA content showed that IL-8 could prolong the survival of resting B-CLL cells in 11 of 16 cases studied. In the remaining 5 cases, 90.6% +/- 4.39% SD of the cells after culture remained viable and IL-8 could exert a significant death protection action after pretreatment with 10(-4) mol/L hydrocortisone, which reduced the percentage of viable B-CLL cells. The dose range of IL-8 capable of inducing the prolonging survival effect is comparable with the levels of IL-8 released constitutively by B-CLL cells, indicating that the death protection action is exerted at physiologic doses. The in vitro rescue from death induced by IL-8 is reflected by an increased expression of bcl-2 mRNA in B-CLL cases incubated in the presence of IL-8. These findings were further confirmed at the protein level, because in B-CLL cells that displayed a bimodal bcl-2 intracytoplasmatic protein expression IL-8 was capable of upmodulating the bcl-2high expression peak. The potential autocrine regulatory action exerted by IL-8 is supported by the evidence that exogenous IL-8 can upregulate IL-8 mRNA in B-CLL cells. These results, together with the demonstration that antibody-mediated neutralization of endogenous IL-8 could induce a significant in vitro reduction in the number of living cells, further support the hypothesis that, in B-CLL, the physiologic doses of IL-8 released constitutively by the leukemic clone may play an autocrine role in the process of cell accumulation characteristic of this disease.","['Francia di Celle, P', 'Mariani, S', 'Riera, L', 'Stacchini, A', 'Reato, G', 'Foa, R']","['Francia di Celle P', 'Mariani S', 'Riera L', 'Stacchini A', 'Reato G', 'Foa R']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-8A)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-8/blood/genetics/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/blood/genetics/*pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood/genetics/*physiology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-8A', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 15;87(10):4382-9.,,['S0006-4971(20)63708-9 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary cancers, which included 11 solid tumors and eight leukemias, were treated with various combinations of DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, alkylating agents, or irradiation. Leukemic or myelodysplastic marrows were screened for possible mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis of p53 exons 4 to 8. The only observed mutation was an inherited 2-basepair deletion at codon 209 in exon 6 that would shift the open reading frame, create a premature termination codon, and foreshorten the resultant protein. Prior therapy in this patient included DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, alkylating agents, and irradiation. The secondary leukemia presented as myelodysplasia with monosomies of chromosomes 5 and 7 and abnormalities of chromosome 17. Although the primary cancer was an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma and there was a family history of cancer, the case did not fulfill the clinical criteria for Li-Fraumeni syndrome.

Using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to induce apoptosis in the murine myeloid progenitor cell line 32Dcl3, we examined the effect of expression of both v-abl and bcrabl transgenes on apoptosis. v-abl expressing 32Dcl3 cells are sensitive to apoptosis induction, similar to parental 32Dcl3 cells. In contrast, bcrabl expression 32Dcl3 cells are protected from the apoptotic stimulus resulting from DMSO exposure. Analyzing the expression patterns for Bcl-2 and Bax, two proteins known to modulate the apoptotic response, we found a downregulation of Bcl-2 and enhanced expression of Bax in 32Dcl3 cells. In 32Dcl3/v-Abl cells, Bcl-2 expression remained constant while Bax was upregulated, whereas in 32Dcl3 cells expressing bcrabl, there was continuous expression of Bcl-2 at a level greater than observed in v-abl transformed cells.

A total of 14 MPB samples, six from patients in chronic phase (CP) and eight from patients in accelerated phase or blast crisis (AP/BC) were studied. Cytogenetic analysis of MPB collected from AP/BC patients showed that 100% of the cells were Ph+, whereas cells from four of five CP MPB were Ph-. By contrast, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of CP MPB showed a mean frequency of 14.7% Ph+ cells, while AP/BC MPB contained 39.2% Ph+ cells. In an attempt to purify normal HSC, subpopulations of the MPB CD34+ cells were isolated based on expression of the Thy-1 antigen (CDw90).

The frequency of cobblestone area forming cells (CAFC) was used as a means of quantitating the numbers of functional HSC within these cell subpopulations. The mean CAFC frequency was 1 of 19 for the CD34+Thy-1+Lin- cells as compared with 1 of 133 for the Thy-1-fraction indicating a higher frequency of primitive progenitor cells in the Thy-1+ subpopulation. CD34+ cell subsets from two patients were also injected into SCID-hu bone assays to determine the in vivo behavior of these cell populations. After 8 weeks, multilineage donor engraftment was observed in these grafts. FISH analysis of the donor cells within the grafts showed that 55.3% and 60.0% of the cells were Ph+.

Despite a number of molecular tools used thus far in immunophenotypic and karyotypic studies, it has not been possible to establish a single common trait among various Hodgkin (H)-cell lines or primary tumor cells that would allow classification into a particular hematopoietic lineage. With this study, we demonstrate that a characteristic expression pattern of transcription factors provides a unifying principle. Seven different cell lines derived from patients with Hodgkin's disease (HD), as well as primary H/Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells isolated from the pericardial fluid of a patient with HD, were compared with a number of hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell lines for the expression of Oct-2, a tissue-specific transcription factor normally restricted to B cells, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B), an inducible transcription factor. Regardless of the heterogeneous phenotypes and genotypes of the H cell lines, which varied inconsistently between B-cell-, T-cell-, or monocyte-like properties, all H cells tested displayed expression of Oct-2 protein at levels comparable to those seen in B cells. Furthermore, all cell lines showed an abundant constitutive nuclear NF-kappa B activity. Interestingly, anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) cell lines, which have many features in common with H/RS cells, were devoid constitutive nuclear NF-kappa B activity. Unlike the constitutive NF-kappa B activity known for B cells, which mainly consists of the p50 and c-Rel or RelB subunits, we demonstrate by antibody supershifting experiments that H cells contain constitutive nuclear p50 and p65, the dimeric NF-kappa B normally observed only for limited time intervals after stimulation with diverse inducers. Additionally, some H-cell lines also displayed nuclear c-Rel activity, whereas RelB or p52 were not detected as part of the constitutive activity. The expression pattern of Oct-2 and NF-kappa B appears to be a unifying and characteristic property of H cells and might explain the deregulated expression of various cytokines leading to the clinical and pathologic manifestations of HD.","['Bargou, R C', 'Leng, C', 'Krappmann, D', 'Emmerich, F', 'Mapara, M Y', 'Bommert, K', 'Royer, H D', 'Scheidereit, C', 'Dorken, B']","['Bargou RC', 'Leng C', 'Krappmann D', 'Emmerich F', 'Mapara MY', 'Bommert K', 'Royer HD', 'Scheidereit C', 'Dorken B']","['Max Delbruck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin-Buch, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-2)', '0 (POU2F2 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Multigene Family', 'NF-kappa B/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-2', 'Plasmacytoma/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/chemistry/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-rel', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 15;87(10):4340-7.,,['S0006-4971(20)63703-X [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum levels of total LDH, human specific LDH and NMP 41/7 increased progressively over time, reaching total LDH levels as high as 50,000 U/L at day 25 after transplantation. To determine whether the levels of LDH and NMP 41/7 in serum were a reflection of human tumor burden, we studied these serologic markers in SCID mice bearing measurable subcutaneous human neuroblastoma tumors, or compared the serum levels of these markers with the number of human leukemia CD10+ cells in the bone marrow of the SCID mice. The serum levels of total LDH, human specific LDH isoenzymes, and NMP 41/7 correlated well with tumor burden, and they drastically decreased or disappeared from serum after the human leukemia or neuroblastoma cells were selectively killed with a single intravenous (IV) injection of 1 to 3 micrograms diphtheria toxin (DT) (the cellular receptor for DT is present on human cells, but not on mouse cells). Paraplegic mice with central nervous system leukemia completely recovered after DT treatment. We conclude that measurements of serum levels of total LDH, human LDH isoenzymes, and NMP 41/7 are sensitive, quantitative, rapid, and easy to perform serologic methods useful to monitor the engraftment, progression, and treatment response of human leukemia in SCID mice.","['Arguello, F', 'Sterry, J A', 'Zhao, Y Z', 'Alexander, M R', 'Shoemaker, R H', 'Cohen, H J']","['Arguello F', 'Sterry JA', 'Zhao YZ', 'Alexander MR', 'Shoemaker RH', 'Cohen HJ']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', '0 (HBEGF protein, human)', '0 (Hbegf protein, mouse)', '0 (Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (NUMA1 protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Numa1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Nuclear', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Diphtheria Toxin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Heparin-binding EGF-like Growth Factor', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/*blood', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*blood', 'Leukemic Infiltration', 'Meninges/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID/*blood', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neuroblastoma/blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Nuclear Matrix-Associated Proteins', 'Nuclear Proteins/*blood', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/etiology', 'Paraplegia/drug therapy/etiology', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, Cell Surface/drug effects', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Severe Combined Immunodeficiency/complications', 'Species Specificity', '*Transplantation, Heterologous']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 15;87(10):4325-32.,,['S0006-4971(20)63701-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the meaning of loss of CD19 antigen on myeloma cells, we first compared the expression of CD19 and Pax-5 genes among B cells, normal plasma cells, myeloma cell lines, and primary myeloma cells, because the Pax-5 gene was reported to encode the transcriptional factor, B-cell-specific activating protein (BSAP), necessary for CD19 gene expression. Neither CD19 nor Pax-5 mRNA could be detected in those primary myeloma cells and cell lines, whereas normal plasma cells did express both CD19 and Pax-5 mRNA. Furthermore, we could confirm that BSAP-binding activity was not detected in the nuclear extract from CD19- myeloma cell line (KMS-5) but was detected in CD19+ B-cell line (Raji) by gel-shift assay. We further examined the expression of E2A and Id genes, because E2A and Id are considered to be positive and negative regulators in the expression of Pax-5 gene, respectively. However, no significant differences in the expression of these E2A and Id-2 genes could be observed between myeloma cells and normal plasma cells. Therefore, these data suggest that the altered expression of Pax-5, but not E2A or Id, is responsible for the loss of CD19 expression in human myeloma cells, although the underlying mechanism of the altered Pax-5 gene expression remains to be clarified.","['Mahmoud, M S', 'Huang, N', 'Nobuyoshi, M', 'Lisukov, I A', 'Tanaka, H', 'Kawano, M M']","['Mahmoud MS', 'Huang N', 'Nobuyoshi M', 'Lisukov IA', 'Tanaka H', 'Kawano MM']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD19/biosynthesis/genetics/physiology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morphogenesis/genetics', 'Multiple Myeloma/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/15 00:00,1996/05/15 00:01,['1996/05/15 00:00'],"['1996/05/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/15 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1996 May 15;87(10):4311-5.,,['S0006-4971(20)63699-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five hundred and thirty-seven unselected, consecutive patients were studied. HCV infection was investigated through detection of anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA. HCV genotyping was performed on HCV-RNA positive specimens. The risk of being infected by HCV was compared with that of the general population of our area. Among all lymphoproliferative disorders, the prevalence and the relative risk (RR) of being infected by HCV were increased only among B-cell NHL (9%; RR 3.24; p < .0001). Among these, a strong prevalence of HCV was found only in the subgroup of immunocytomas (30%; RR 10.27; P < .0001), while other histotypes were associated with it only occasionally. Because HCV-positive lymphomas clinically behave as essential mixed cryoglobulinemia (EMC), the close association between HCV infection and EMC is confirmed, and evidence is provided that the pathological substrate of EMC corresponds to the immunocytoma. HCV genomic sequences were found in 84% of patients analyzed.

However, the molecular mechanism of 1,25(OH)2 D3 action is still unknown. Prompted by this, we have searched here for the presence of 1,25(OH)2 D3 receptor (VDR) expression in HIMeg cells by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The amplified product showed an identical size to the product amplified from the control human VDR cDNA and hybridized specifically with the digoxigenin-labeled human VDR cDNA fragment. As expected, VDR mRNA is also expressed in HOS-8603, a human osteosarcoma cell line. These results represent the first reported evidence that VDR mRNA is expressed in megakaryoblastic cells. In addition, the regulation of VDR mRNA expression in HIMeg cells was studied by quantitative RT-PCR. It was found that [correction of the] VDR mRNA expression in HIMeg cells could be down-regulated rapidly by 1,25(OH)2 D3 (10 nM) in a time-dependent manner, reaching a maximal reduction to about 15% of control. However, VDR mRNA expression in HOS-8603 cells was not regulated by 1,25(OH)2 D3 at any time-point tested. Treatment of HIMeg cells with forskolin (1 microM), an activator of adenylate cyclase, caused an increase in VDR mRNA levels. Similarly, VDR mRNA expression in HOS-8603 cells was also up-regulated by forskolin. Consistent with the functionality of the VDR in other target cells, we found that the up-regulation of VDR expression in HIMeg cells by forskolin was accompanied by an increased responsiveness of HIMeg cells to 1,25(OH)2 D3 even though forskolin alone had no effects. Exposure to 1,25(OH)2 D3 in combination with forskolin resulted in a much more significant inhibition of cell proliferation than to 1,25(OH)2 D3 alone. Similarly, forskolin could also augment the differentiation induced by 1,25(OH)2 D3 reflected by a more evident morphological change and a higher percentage of development of cells with multilobular nuclei. These alterations were accompanied by a loss of clonogenic capacity and a decrease in the number of cells in the S phase. These data establish that HIMeg cells express functional VDR, which served to mediate actions of its ligand on the proliferation and differentiation of these cells.","['Song, L N']",['Song LN'],"[""Department of Pathophysiology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Calcitriol/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/physiology', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Megakaryocytes/*cytology/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects', 'beta 2-Microglobulin/genetics']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 1996 Mar;57(5-6):265-74. doi: 10.1016/0960-0760(95)00266-9.,,['10.1016/0960-0760(95)00266-9 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Injection of leukaemia cells in a high number (10(6) cells) into syngeneic Balb/c mice (H-2d) invariably led to death with a median survival time of 22 d (A20), 18 d (WEHI-3) and 45 d (PU5-1R). A lower tumour load of A20 (5 x 10(5) cells) was used in some experiments resulting in a leukaemic death rate of 94%. Lethal total-body irradiation followed by syngeneic BMT prolonged survival (P<0.05) for animals bearing the leukaemia A20 and WEHI-3 but was unsuccessful for animals injected with cells from the monocytic leukaemia PU5-1R. Graft-versus-host (GVH)-nonreactive marrow of (C57 x Balb/c)F1 mice (H2bxd) exerted a significant GVL-effect with reduced relapse rate and improved survival in mice receiving the leukaemia cell line A20. In animals with low tumour load a significant reduction of the relapse rate from 82% following syngeneic BMT to 47% following allogeneic, GVH-nonreactive BMT could be achieved. Depletion of natural killer (NK) cells from the GVL-reactive semi-allogenic bone marrow graft enhances the relapse rate of the leukaemia A20 to 65%. In mice bearing the leukaemias WEHI-3 or PU5-1R allogeneic GVH-nonreactive BMT did not improve survival compared to syngeneic BMT. Transplantation of GVH-reactive bone marrow from DBA mice (MHC identical to Balb/c, minor difference) caused only a limited and insignificant reduction of relapse rate for animals with the leukaemia A20. These in vivo data are in close correlation with in vitro natural killer cell (NK) activity of the donor strains against the respective leukaemia targets. Depletion of NK cells from the GVL-reactive (C57 x Balb/c)F1 bone marrow resulted in a significant loss of GVL activity.

The BCR/abl+ cells were detected in all 12 preparations of the freshly adherent A-NK cells tested. In 6/12 the BCR/abl+ cells were no longer detectable by RT-PCR on day 14 of culture. Both proliferation and antileukaemic cytotoxicity were significantly higher (P=0.002 and P=0.029, respectively) in the BCR/abl- cultures than those in the six BCR/abl+ cultures. 5/6 BCR/abl- cultures were highly enriched in A-NK cells on day 14, and 1/6 contained predominantly CD56+CD3+ cells.

Myeloid cells (CD33+) were more frequently detected in the BCR/abl+ than BCR/abl- A-NK cell cultures (P=0.028).

The ATRA-induced increase of leukaemic cell adhesive molecules may be responsible. To explore this we used a functional assay to study the effect of ATRA treatment on the adhesion of blast cells to cultured human endothelial cells (EC), endothelial cell matrix (ECM), and interleukin 1beta-activated EC (IL1 + EC). NB4 cells, a maturation-inducible human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line, were treated with 1 microM ATRA or the vehicle (control), labelled with 51Cr and tested in the adhesion assay. ATRA increased NB4 adhesion to EC (P<0.01), ECM (P<0.001) and IL1 + EC (P=n.s.). An inhibition study with anti-EC adhesion receptors MoAbs indicated that anti-E-selectin, anti-VCAM-1 and anti-ICAM-1 effectively inhibited cell adhesion to IL1 + EC (18+/-7%, 45 +/-6.9% and 29+/-6% inhibition, respectively) and to unstimulated EC. Preincubation of ATRA-treated NB4 cells with MoAbs anti-VLA4 and anti-LFA1, the VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 counter-receptors respectively, resulted in a significant inhibition of adhesion. Cytofluorimetric analysis of the NB4 cell membrane molecules confirmed the increase under ATRA of VLA4, LFA1, MAC1 and ICAM-1. Therefore ATRA increases NB4 cell adhesion to the endothelium and the subendothelial matrix. These findings parallel the increment of NB4 surface adhesive molecules, among which VLA4 and LFA1 appear to play an important part.

Clonal heterogeneity was determined by analysing the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vbeta gene usage and by sequencing the hypervariable regions of the TCR genes. Fluctuations in the V beta gene usage were determined by comparing the TCR Vbeta gene profiles of T-cell lines at different times. We found that a diverse repertoire for HTLV-1 env could be triggered in vitro. Diverse Vbeta genes were used by the same line tested at different times, suggesting that clonal composition of an antigen-specific T-cell line is not constant in vitro. Clones in fact may be up- and down-regulated and clonotypes undetectable at one time point can emerge upon subsequent restimulation. Therefore evaluation of the clonal composition of a T-cell line gives a snapshot of the dominant clones at the time of analysis, and does not tell the whole picture of the antigen-specific ensemble. Furthermore, by sequencing the TCR genes, we identified clones with identical Vbeta gene usage which differed in hypervariable regions (CDR3), indicating their derivation from independent precursors and contributing to overall clonal heterogeneity. If these data can be extended to HTLV-1-infected patients studied in vivo, the Th cell repertoire specific for HTLV-1 env may prove very heterogenous, with important implications for vaccine development.","['Li Pira, G', 'Westby, M', 'Oppezzi, L', 'Ferraris, A', 'Lancia, F', 'Piatti, G', 'Fenoglio, D', 'Saverino, D', 'Arp, J', 'Dekaban, G', 'Dalgleish, A', 'Manca, F']","['Li Pira G', 'Westby M', 'Oppezzi L', 'Ferraris A', 'Lancia F', 'Piatti G', 'Fenoglio D', 'Saverino D', 'Arp J', 'Dekaban G', 'Dalgleish A', 'Manca F']","['Department of Immunology, San Martino Hospital, University of Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/genetics/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes, Helper-Inducer/*immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 May;93(2):287-94. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.4921030.x.,,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.4921030.x [doi]'],['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,"['GENBANK/S82754', 'GENBANK/S82755', 'GENBANK/S82756']",,,,,,,,,,

High levels of RBTN2 have been found in T-cell leukaemias carrying the translocation and in some T-cell ALLs that lack, by cytogenetic and molecular techniques, translocations involving 11p13. In normal murine tissues RBTN2 has been found to be widely expressed, with high levels present in brain and early B cells. Studies carried out in mice lacking RBTN2 have demonstrated the importance of this gene in erythropoiesis. We have investigated the expression of RBTN2 in human leukaemic cells, and in human and murine normal myeloid progenitor cells. RBTN2 is expressed in the leukaemic cells of patients with pre-B ALL, T-ALL and acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML). By cytogenetic and molecular techniques no abnormalities were noted in 11p13. Using clonogenic assays and single cell PCR we found that RBTN2 is expressed strongly in the precursors of mixed erythrocyte/macrophage/mast, erythrocyte, megakaryocyte, neutrophil and macrophage colonies. In contrast, RBTN2 message was low to undetectable in the mature progeny. These findings indicate that RBTN2 is expressed in leukaemias of both the myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Further, these studies show that in normal myeloid and lymphoid cells the expression of RBTN2 is present in progenitor cells and is lost as the cells terminally differentiate. This latter finding further illustrates that the detection of a RNA in a population of cells should not be interpreted to mean that all of the cells in that population express the RNA.","['Dong, W F', 'Billia, F', 'Atkins, H L', 'Iscove, N N', 'Minden, M D']","['Dong WF', 'Billia F', 'Atkins HL', 'Iscove NN', 'Minden MD']","['Department of Medicine and Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/05/01 00:00,1996/05/01 00:01,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1996 May;93(2):280-6. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.5001044.x.,,['10.1046/j.1365-2141.1996.5001044.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The whole assay is performed in a single well, including the quantitative detection of incorporated BrdU, which is performed immunologically using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody and colorometric reading. The system also allows the use of variable amounts of primer. The kinetics and characteristics of the assay using BrdUTP is similar to the use of [3H]dTTP. The sensitivity of the assay can be varied either by altering the duration of RT assay time and/or by prolonging the alkaline phosphatase reaction. Thus the assay can detect < 0.02 pg of recombinant human-immunodeficiency-virus (HIV) type I RT, < 0.005 m unit of avian-myeloblastosis-virus RT or < 0.02 m unit of recombinant Moloney-murine-leukaemia-virus RT. The assay was found to be useful with various types of cell-culture material, and a comparative study of 16 HIV-infected lymphocyte cultures, using 10 microliters of supernatant medium for RT assay and 22.5 microliters for p24 antigen assay showed that the new RT assay was at least 25-fold more sensitive than the p24 antigen assay. The results also show a good correlation between the RT activities found and the p24-antigen level detected, with exception for HIV2 isolates, as they only became positive in the RT assay. The technical performance and the capacity of the test compared with other available RT kits is discussed, as well as its use for other applications.","['Ekstrand, D H', 'Awad, R J', 'Kallander, C F', 'Gronowitz, J S']","['Ekstrand DH', 'Awad RJ', 'Kallander CF', 'Gronowitz JS']","['Department of Medical Genetics, Uppsala University, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biotechnol Appl Biochem,Biotechnology and applied biochemistry,8609465,"['0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '18736-53-3 (bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/*analysis', '*Deoxyuracil Nucleotides', 'HIV/*isolation & purification', 'HIV Infections/enzymology', 'Humans', 'RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/*analysis', 'Reference Standards', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology', 'Templates, Genetic', 'Thymine Nucleotides', 'Titrimetry']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biotechnol Appl Biochem. 1996 Apr;23(2):95-105.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The five Surfeit genes (Surf-1 to -5) that have been previously isolated and characterized do not share any DNA or amino acid sequence homology. These Surfeit genes appear to be housekeeping genes, with the Surf-3 gene encoding the 1.7a ribosomal protein and the Surf-4 gene encoding an integral membrane protein most likely associated with the endoplasmic reticulum. In this work, we have isolated the Surf-6 gene, a sixth member of the Surfeit locus. The Surf-6 gene contains four exons spanning a genomic region of 14 kb and specifies a mRNA of 2,571 bases. Surf-6 has features common to housekeeping genes because its transcript is present in every tissue tested, its 5' end is associated with a CpG-rich island, and its promoter does not contain a canonical TATA box. The Surf-6 long open reading frame encodes a novel highly basic polypeptide of 355 amino acids (28% Arg and Lys). By immunofluorescence and immunoblot analyses, the Surf-6 protein has been found to be located in the nucleolus and by immunocytochemical microscopy to be localized predominantly in the nucleolar granular component, a structure that is involved in ribosome maturation.

Fragmented DNA was isolated by introducing a novel procedure that ensured a complete extraction of the characteristic oligonucleosomal ladder. As the results show, less than 10% of DNA of apoptotic cells is fragmented in this form. The main conclusion from experiments to characterize the nature of fragmented DNA is that spontaneous apoptosis induces a nonrandom cleavage of genomic DNA. The Southern analysis performed with total apoptotic DNA revealed that it is strongly enriched in interspersed repetitive sequences. In situ hybridizations with such DNA showed further than in interphase nuclei these sequences flock together and form clusters spread throughout the whole nuclear area whereas in mitotic chromosomes they are located predominantly at their pericentromeric/peritelomeric ends. Partial cloning and sequencing reinforces the notion that the apoptotic DNA is representative for a heterochromatinic portion of the mouse genome. Support for such an unexpected conclusion is coming also from experiments indicating that this DNA is heavily methylated and poorly transcribed.","['Vodenicharov, M D', 'Markova, D Z', 'Djondjurov, L P']","['Vodenicharov MD', 'Markova DZ', 'Djondjurov LP']","['Department of Cell Proliferation, Institue of Molecular Biology, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, 1113 Sofia, Bulgaria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,DNA Cell Biol,DNA and cell biology,9004522,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Databases, Factual', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', 'Plasmids', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/04/01 00:00,1996/04/01 00:01,['1996/04/01 00:00'],"['1996/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,DNA Cell Biol. 1996 Apr;15(4):287-96. doi: 10.1089/dna.1996.15.287.,,['10.1089/dna.1996.15.287 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structure-activity relationship for antitumour imidazoacridinones and intercorrelations between in vivo and in vitro tests.",73-88,"A study on quantitative relationships between the biological activity and physicochemical properties of antitumour 5-alkylaminoimidazoacridinone derivatives was carried out. The activity was based on the results of several in vitro tests as well as experimental antileukaemic therapy. The capacity factor, log k', determined by the reverse-phase HPLC method, was a measure of lipophilic properties. UV and NMR spectra of the compounds were employed to describe electronic parameters. Values of steric descriptors were calculated as topological indexes. Results obtained by means of principal component analysis (PCA) allow us to group biological tests into two subsets: the lipophilicity-dependent and lipophilicity-independent test groups. The highest intercorrelation, R = 0.92, was shown between the optimal dose, pOD, determined in leukaemia P388-bearing mice and cytotoxicity expressed as pEC50 in leukaemia cells. The equation describing this relationship could be applied to predict the therapeutic doses of imidazoacridinone derivatives which would be effective in experimental antileukaemic therapy. The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study showed that lipophilic properties significantly influence cytotoxicity, pEC50, and antileukaemic potency, pOD, only in the case of 8-hydroxy analogues of imidazoacridinones, whereas the activity of the remaining derivatives is very low and does not depend on lipophilicity. Electronic resonance properties seem to influence this specific impact of lipophilicity on the biological activity of 8-hydroxy derivatives. Hence, it may be possible to improve the antitumour activity of 8-hydroxyimidazoacridinones by obtaining more hydrophilic derivatives, up to the optimal value of the lipophilic parameter.","['Mazerska, Z', 'Augustin, E', 'Dziegielewski, J', 'Cholody, M W', 'Konopa, J']","['Mazerska Z', 'Augustin E', 'Dziegielewski J', 'Cholody MW', 'Konopa J']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Technology and Biochemistry, Technical University of Gdansk, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Anticancer Drug Des,Anti-cancer drug design,8603523,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '78OY3Z0P7Z (Aminacrine)']",IM,"['Aminacrine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/therapeutic use', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anticancer Drug Des. 1996 Jan;11(1):73-88.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Indirect immunohistochemical techniques and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction were utilized to analyze TRX/ADF expression and the presence of EBV, using 6 normal tissues and 23 surgical specimens. The kinetics of expression of TRX/ADF induced by EBV was examined in vitro with peripheral blood B cells from EBV-seronegative donors. RESULTS: Marked expression of TRX/ADF was found in the infiltrating B cells and the epithelial cells of salivary gland tissues from patients with SS (11 of 12 cases), but not in those from patients with other salivary gland inflammatory conditions (0 of 11 cases) or those of normal individuals (0 of 6 cases). In immunohistologic analyses, a striking topographic correlation between TRX/ADF and EBV was found. The coexistence of TRX/ADF messenger RNA and EBV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (r = 0.75, P < 0.01). Peripheral blood B cells from EBV-seronegative donors showed de novo synthesis of TRX/ADF following in vitro infection with EBV. EBV-infected B cell lines all expressed TRX/ADF. TRX/ADF was not detected in non-EBV-infected cells. Tumors in SCID mice reconstituted with mononuclear cells of salivary glands from SS patients, which were composed of human B cells carrying EBV DNA, were positive for TRX/ADF.

Following Keizer and De Young (J. Keizer and G. De Young. Biophys. J. 61: 649-660, 1992), we develop a highly constrained mathematical model for [Ca2+]i oscillations in RBL-2H3 cells, which includes activation of the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) by inositol 1,4,5-trisphospate, indirect Ca2+ activation of the IP3R via Ca2+ -dependent activity of phospholipase C-gamma, slow inhibition of the IP3R by cytosolic Ca2+, refilling of Ca2+ stores by a Ca2+ -ATPase (SERCA)-type pump, and a simple representation of the dependence of plasma membrane (PM) fluxes on experimental conditions. Using this full (open cell) model, we simulate [Ca2+]i responses for protocols in which antigen concentration and external Ca2+ are manipulated and compare out calculations with experimental data. In protocol A, cells are stimulated in the presence of external Ca2+, in protocols B and C, cells are stimulated in the absence of external Ca2+, with external Ca2+ later reapplied in protocol C. We are able to reproduce quantitatively the important features of all three protocols, including the dose response of protocol B, the [Ca2+]i response to thapsigargin, and lag time results, and we provide qualitative explanations for the responses derived from our calculations. We also develop a simplified (closed cell) version of the model in which PM fluxes are neglected and total free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]T) is a slowly varying parameter. This permits us to explain in a simple graphical fashion how PM fluxes may influence [Ca2+]i responses in RBH-2H3 cells through modulation of [Ca2+]T.","['Smith, G D', 'Lee, R J', 'Oliver, J M', 'Keizer, J']","['Smith GD', 'Lee RJ', 'Oliver JM', 'Keizer J']","['Institute of Theoretical Dynamics, Section of Neurobiology, Physiology, and Behavior, University of California, Davis 95616, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Calcium Channels)', '0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 7.2.2.10 (Calcium-Transporting ATPases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Calcium Channels/physiology', 'Calcium-Transporting ATPases/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dinitrophenols/*pharmacology', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/metabolism', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate Receptors', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Mathematics', '*Models, Biological', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/physiology', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1996 Mar;270(3 Pt 1):C939-52. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1996.270.3.C939.,,['10.1152/ajpcell.1996.270.3.C939 [doi]'],['GM-49814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This risk has been estimated to be 1-5.9% with hydroxyurea (HU) therapy. When compared with historical controls, the risk with use of HU does not appear to be statistically significant. The leukemogenic risk of HU therapy in essential thrombocytosis (ET) and in myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (MMM) is unknown. HU remains the main myelotoxic agent in the treatment of PV, ET, and MMM. We studied 64 patients with these three disorders, seen at our institution during 1993-1995. The patients were studied for their clinical characteristics at diagnosis, therapies received, and development of myelodysplasia or acute leukemia (MDS/AL). Forty-two had PV, 15 ET, and 6 MMM, and 1 had an unclassified myeloproliferative disorder. Of the 42 patients with PV, 18 were treated with phlebotomy alone, 16 with HU alone, 2 with p32, 2 with multiple myelotoxic agents, and 2 with interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha). Two patients from the phlebotomy-treated group, one from the HU-treated group, and 1 from the multiple myelotoxic agent-treated group developed MDS/AL. In the larger group, 11 received no treatment or aspirin alone, 18 were treated with phlebotomy alone, 25 with HU, 5 with multiple myelotoxic agents, 2 with p32, 2 with IFN-alpha, and 1 with melphalan. Study of the entire group of 64 patients showed that only one additional patient (total of 5 out of 64) developed MDS/AL. This patient had been treated with HU alone.

In order to clarify whether HTLV-I plays a role as a virus-encoded superantigen in the neoplastic process, we examined the TCR V beta families in the peripheral blood at four different clinical stages: carrier, smoldering leukemia, chronic leukemia, and acute leukemia. An increased number of CD4 T cells was found in each of the four clinical stages. However, we found neither uniform specific losses nor uniform clonal expansion of particular TCR V beta gene families in any case from the four clinical stages. However, a suppression of the random TCR V beta families was found. Our data did not therefore directly suggest the existence of a common superantigen model of HTLV-I which induces an increase in CD4 T cells. The random suppression in the TCR V beta repertoire is most likely caused by the influence of HTLV-I neoplastic pathogenesis rather than by virus-encoded superantigens. In the patients with acute leukemia, one or two families of the V beta repertoires were very strongly expressed, while in chronic leukemia, no such repertoire of strong expression was observed. The immunological reaction of the hosts might thus be different between the above described groups.","['Ohshima, K', 'Suzumiya, J', 'Kikuchi, M', 'Takeshita, M', 'Tashiro, K', 'Kimura, N']","['Ohshima K', 'Suzumiya J', 'Kikuchi M', 'Takeshita M', 'Tashiro K', 'Kimura N']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Deltaretrovirus Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)', '0 (Superantigens)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier State/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', '*Clonal Deletion', 'Deltaretrovirus Antigens/immunology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', '*Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Superantigens/immunology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/*immunology']",1996/05/01 00:00,2000/06/20 09:00,['1996/05/01 00:00'],"['1996/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/06/20 09:00 [medline]', '1996/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1996 May;52(1):1-7. doi: 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199605)52:1<1::AID-AJH1>3.0.CO;2-Z.,,"['10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199605)52:1<1::AID-AJH1>3.0.CO;2-Z [pii]', '10.1002/(SICI)1096-8652(199605)52:1<1::AID-AJH1>3.0.CO;2-Z [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP) score was elevated. Bone marrow aspiration showed myeloid hyperplasia without dysplastic features. Karyotypic and molecular analyses of bone marrow cells showed the absence of Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome and bcr gene rearrangement.

In addition to its association with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), the present case was also characterized by spontaneous remission of CNL during the 12-year follow-up, accompanied by a gradual increase in serum IgG levels up to 3,000 mg/dl. As far as we know, there have been 19 cases of CNL associated with monoclonal gammopathy in the literature. The median survival of these cases was 5 years. Although there have been only 6 cases of CNL associated with MGUS, survival of these cases was particularly favorable. Taken together with the observation that leukocytosis and hepatosplenomegaly in the present case subsided without specific treatment, we speculate that myeloid proliferation in the present case may have been a leukemoid reaction to underlying monoclonal gammopathy.","['Ito, T', 'Kojima, H', 'Otani, K', 'Komeno, T', 'Mitsuhashi, S', 'Hasegawa, Y', 'Kobayashi, T', 'Ninomiya, H', 'Nagasawa, T', 'Abe, T']","['Ito T', 'Kojima H', 'Otani K', 'Komeno T', 'Mitsuhashi S', 'Hasegawa Y', 'Kobayashi T', 'Ninomiya H', 'Nagasawa T', 'Abe T']","['Division of Hematology, University of Tsukuba, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/*complications', 'Male', 'Paraproteinemias/*complications', 'Survival Analysis']",1996/01/01 00:00,1996/01/01 00:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 1996;95(2):140-3. doi: 10.1159/000203863.,24,['10.1159/000203863 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Secondary or reactive thrombocytosis can be observed in a number of clinical circumstances, and may be related to persistent overproduction of some thrombocytopoietic factors acting on megakaryocytes. Several cytokines, including IL-6, IL-1 and IL-4 have been shown to act alone or in concert, to affect various cellular stages of megakaryocytopoiesis in humans. The aim of this study is to assess the serum concentrations of these cytokines in myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) with thrombocythemia and in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with marked reactive thrombocytosis. Twenty-two patients (14 men, 8 women) with MPD and thrombocythemia (platelet counts > 500 x 10(9)/1; range 507-996 x 10(9)/1), 33 RA patients (28 women, 5 men) with marked thrombocytosis (platelet counts > 500 x 10(9)/1; range 500-745 x 10(9)/ 1), 27 RA patients (24 women, 3 men) with normal platelet counts (range 168-399 x 10(9)/1) and 15 healthy volunteers (8 women, 7 men) with normal platelet counts (range 161-385 x 10(9)/1) enrolled in the study.

Of the 22 patients with MPD, 10 had chronic myelogenous leukemia, 5 had polycythemia vera, 6 had essential thrombocytosis and 1 had osteomyelofibrosis. Serum interleukin concentrations in patients with MPD and thrombocythemia were either suppressed or similar to those of normal subjects, whereas IL-6, IL-1 beta and IL-4 levels were increased in RA patients with reactive thrombocytosis.

To examine Arg structure-function relationships we analysed a Gag-Arg fusion protein, analogous to the oncogenic Gag-Abl fusion protein of Abelson Murine Leukaemia Virus and found that in contrast to Gag-Abl, it lacked transforming activity. Three observations indicated that the difference in the transforming activity was mediated by the distinct Arg and Abl C-terminal domains. (1) The analysis of chimeric Gag-Arg/Abl molecules revealed that the Arg C-terminal domain completely abrogated Gag-Abl transforming activity and that the Abl C-terminus conferred transforming activity to Gag-Arg. Substitutions of SH2 and kinase domains did not affect activity. (2) Alterations in the Arg C-terminus were observed in spontaneous foci that developed in transfections of two nontransforming chimera. (3) An engineered Gag-Arg molecule containing a truncation of almost the entire C-terminal domain, including three SH3 domain-binding sites, was oncogenic, whereas a slightly smaller truncation that deleted two of three SH3 domain-binding sites, lacked transforming activity. These observations indicate that the C-terminal domain regulates Arg biological activity in a manner distinct from c-Abl and suggest that this effect may be mediated in part by SH3 domain-binding sites.","['Mysliwiec, T', 'Perego, R', 'Kruh, G D']","['Mysliwiec T', 'Perego R', 'Kruh GD']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Abelson murine leukemia virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Gene Products, gag/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Mammals', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-abl/biosynthesis/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/metabolism', 'Transfection']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Feb 1;12(3):631-40.,,,"['CA-57273/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-60453/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA06927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study we investigated regions of p21 involved in inhibition of the G1/S phase cyclin-dependent kinase, cyclin E/Cdk2, as well as regions of p21 important for binding to this kinase and recombinant PCNA. To perform these studies we synthesized a series of overlapping peptides spanning the entire p21 sequence and used them in in vitro assays with cyclin E/Cdk2-immune complexes and with recombinant p21 and PCNA proteins. One amino-terminal p21 peptide spanning amino acids 15-40, antagonized p21 binding and inhibition of cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase. Antagonism of p21 binding was, however, lost in a similar peptide lacking amino acids 15-20, or in a peptide in which cysteine-18 was substituted for a serine. These results suggest that this peptide region is important for p21 interaction with cyclin E/Cdk2. A second peptide (amino acids 58-77) also antagonized p21-activity, but this peptide did not affect the ability of p21 to interact with cyclin E/Cdk2. A region of p21 larger than 26 amino acids is presumably required for Cdk-inhibition because none of the peptides we tested inhibited cyclin E/Cdk2. We also found that a peptide spanning amino acids 21-45 bound recombinant p21 in ELISA assays, and additional studies revealed a requirement for amino acids 26 through 45 for this interaction. A p21 peptide spanning amino acids 139-164 was found to bind PCNA in a filter binding assay and this peptide suppressed recombinant p21-PCNA interaction. Conformational analysis revealed that peptides spanning amino acids 21-45 and 139-164 tended towards an alpha-helical conformation in trifluoroethanol buffer, indicating that these regions are probably in a coiled conformation in the native protein. Taken together, our results provide an insight into domains of p21 that are involved in cyclin E/Cdk2 and PCNA interaction. Our results also suggest that a potential p21 dimerization domain may lie in the amino-terminus of p21. Continued exploration of these domains could prove useful in assessing p21-mimetic strategies for cancer treatment.","['Chen, I T', 'Akamatsu, M', 'Smith, M L', 'Lung, F D', 'Duba, D', 'Roller, P P', 'Fornace, A J Jr', ""O'Connor, P M""]","['Chen IT', 'Akamatsu M', 'Smith ML', 'Lung FD', 'Duba D', 'Roller PP', 'Fornace AJ Jr', ""O'Connor PM""]","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CDKN1A protein, human)', '0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', '0 (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDC2-CDC28 Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cdk2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', '*CDC2-CDC28 Kinases', 'Cell Line', 'Circular Dichroism', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*metabolism', 'Cyclins/*chemistry/*metabolism', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen/*metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Fast Atom Bombardment', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Feb 1;12(3):595-607.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The human receptor was predicted to consist of 422 amino acids and was found to share 84% identity with the murine protein. In the extra-cellular region it exhibited a single hemopoietin domain with conserved cysteine residues and WSTWS motif. The transmembrane region was followed by a short cytoplasmic tail which did not contain a tyrosine kinase domain. Interaction of the human IL-11R alpha with murine gp130 was demonstrated: expression of the human IL-11R alpha in murine M1 cells which constitutively express murine gp130 (and murine LIF receptor), resulted in the generation of specific high-affinity binding sites for IL-11 (Kd = 250 pM). In addition, expression of the human IL-11R alpha in these cells permitted the induction of macrophage differentiation in response to IL-11. These results suggested that the human IL-11R alpha chain was able to form a functional receptor complex in association with murine gp130. The requirement of gp130 for signalling was confirmed by expression of the human IL-11R alpha in Ba/F3 cells. BaF3 cells that expressed the human IL-11R alpha alone showed binding of radiolabelled IL-11 but no proliferative response. Introduction of human gp130 into these cells resulted in high-affinity IL-11 binding sites and IL-11 dependent cellular proliferation. Thus these results demonstrated the absolute requirement of gp130 for signalling.","['Nandurkar, H H', 'Hilton, D J', 'Nathan, P', 'Willson, T', 'Nicola, N', 'Begley, C G']","['Nandurkar HH', 'Hilton DJ', 'Nathan P', 'Willson T', 'Nicola N', 'Begley CG']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (IL11RA protein, human)', '0 (IL6ST protein, human)', '0 (Il11ra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Il11ra2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/*metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', '*Lymphokines', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Cytokine/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin/biosynthesis/chemistry/*physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', '*Signal Transduction', 'Transfection']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Feb 1;12(3):585-93.,,,['CA 22556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of the gene via retroviral insertion in murine tumors or chromosomal rearrangement in human tumors is associated with myeloid leukemias and myelodysplasias; however, the mechanism by which such overexpression leads to transformation is not clear. It has been postulated that overexpression of evi1 acts to block normal myelopoiesis. In attempts to assess the effect of overexpression of evi1 on myelopoiesis, we chose to utilize the IL-3-dependent murine 32Dcl3 cell line, which has been shown to differentiate in culture in response to G-CSF. Previous experiments with this cell line, which we have confirmed, showed that overexpression of evi1, mediated by retroviral vector transfer, caused a block to G-CSF-induced cell survival and differentiation. We report here that the naive 32Dcl3 cell line contains a rearrangement of the evi1 locus and constitutively overexpresses evi1 mRNA and protein; this expression is downregulated only slightly during G-CSF-induced myeloid maturation. The steady state levels, molecular weight and DNA binding characteristics of the EVI1 protein in these cells is comparable to that seen in NFS 58, a myeloid leukemia cell line with retroviral insertion at evi1. The observed ability of the murine 32Dcl3 cells to fully differentiate in the presence of G-CSF while evi1 continues to be expressed indicates that, at the levels expressed in naive 32Dcl3, evi1 does not block G-CSF-induced survival and differentiation. Thus, retroviral insertions at evi1 may have been selected for in 32Dcl3 cells due to effects other than that on G-CSF-induced cell survival.","['Khanna-Gupta, A', 'Lopingco, M C', 'Savinelli, T', 'Zibello, T', 'Berliner, N', 'Perkins, A S']","['Khanna-Gupta A', 'Lopingco MC', 'Savinelli T', 'Zibello T', 'Berliner N', 'Perkins AS']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT 06520-8023, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein)', '0 (MECOM protein, human)', '0 (Mecom protein, mouse)', '0 (Oligodeoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligodeoxyribonucleotides', '*Oncogenes', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Zinc Fingers']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 1996 Feb 1;12(3):563-9.,,,['DK42347/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, in the presence of antibodies to HCV, as well as of HCV-specific genomes has been reported in the sera of over 37% patients with B-NHL, not associated with MC. Thus, we decided to perform both a serologic and a molecular study to give insights into a possible relationship between HCV infection and neoplastic lymphoproliferations. We used ELISA and RIBA tests to show that anti-HCV antibodies were present in the serum of 29 out of 69 unselected B-NHL patients (42%), while seropositivity in a healthy population was about 1%. The prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was low in definite subsets of B lymphoid disorders, including multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia and monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance. Then, using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, we detected HCV sequences directly in the pathologic lymph node biopsies in 13 out of 34 B-NHL cases, and in particular in six out of eight low-grade lymphomas of MALT type and in five out of eight centroblastic-centrocytic follicular lymphomas. In contrast, the peripheral blood samples from 10 B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients resulted negative for the presence of HCV genomes. Similarly, viral sequences were absent in 10 T cell NHL, while only one out of the 14 Hodgkin's disease cases tested resulted positive. Finally, we used a PCR-based assay to characterize the genotypes (I-IV) present in the positive lymphomatous tissues. The presence of both serologic and molecular markers of HCV infection in a high percentage of certain types of B-NHL, not associated with cryoglobulinemia, and its absence from other lymphoproliferative diseases extends the spectrum of HCV-associated lymphoproliferations arguing in favor of some role of this viral infection in the pathogenesis of the malignant proliferation of definite B lymphoid populations.","['Luppi, M', 'Grazia Ferrari, M', 'Bonaccorsi, G', 'Longo, G', 'Narni, F', 'Barozzi, P', 'Marasca, R', 'Mussini, C', 'Torelli, G']","['Luppi M', 'Grazia Ferrari M', 'Bonaccorsi G', 'Longo G', 'Narni F', 'Barozzi P', 'Marasca R', 'Mussini C', 'Torelli G']","['Centre for Experimental Haematology, Department of Medical Sciences, University of Modena, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Hepatitis C Antibodies)'],IM,"['Cryoglobulinemia/*etiology/immunology/virology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Hepacivirus/genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Hepatitis C/*complications/immunology/virology', 'Hepatitis C Antibodies/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*etiology/immunology/virology', 'Lymph Nodes/virology', 'Lymphoma/*etiology/immunology/virology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/etiology/immunology/virology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):351-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This case demonstrates that secondary chromosome aberrations can determine the clinical course of patients, even if morphologic and immunophenotypic findings fail to predict the poor outcome.","['Tirier, C', 'Zhang, Y', 'Plendl, H', 'Weber-Matthiesen, K', 'Langer, W', 'Heit, W', 'Schlegelberger, B']","['Tirier C', 'Zhang Y', 'Plendl H', 'Weber-Matthiesen K', 'Langer W', 'Heit W', 'Schlegelberger B']","['Department of Hematology/Oncology, Evangelic Hospital Essen-Werden, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 2', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):346-50.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both fresh and cryopreserved cells were used and were injected intravenously, intraperitoneally, or both, after conditioning with cyclophosphamide. In addition, cells derived from a mouse spleen engrafted with human leukemia were passaged into another mouse. The animals were observed daily for signs of disease or appearance of tumors and sacrificed when terminally ill. At intervals blood samples were obtained and analyzed for the presence of human cells or DNA. Human leukemic cells were demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the human DQalpha gene or positive staining for human leukocyte common antigen (LCA). The presence of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive cells was also investigated by PCR analysis. Disseminated tumors developed in most mice inoculated with cells from the first patient, and this was associated with shortened survival times. The methods of administration, use of fresh or frozen samples, or the size of the inoculum had no effect on the development of leukemia. Survival of the mouse receiving passaged cells was similar to mice inoculated with fresh cells. Extensive histologic, immunophenotypic, and DNA studies were performed on organs from mice engrafting with cells from patient 1. PCR analysis for EBV sequences was negative in the mice engrafting from all three cases. The successful engraftment of human CLL-Pro PLL and T cell CLL in SCID mice, and the reproducibility of this effect using frozen cells, will provide a model for exploration of disease biology and for investigations of new drugs or combinations that may be useful in the treatment of CLL.","[""O'Brien, S"", 'Jeha, S', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Pisa, P', 'Jin, G', 'Keating, M', 'Beran, M']","[""O'Brien S"", 'Jeha S', 'Kantarjian H', 'Pisa P', 'Jin G', 'Keating M', 'Beran M']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Animals', 'Chronic Disease', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Graft Survival', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/immunology/*pathology/virology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reproducibility of Results']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):338-44.,,,"['1R55 CA 56887-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-16672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Viewed from a current model of acquired autoimmunity it is perhaps not surprising that such autoimmunity is seen predominantly in patients with monoclonal gammopathy. Thus, a high concentration of cross-reacting polyreactive autoantibodies related to the M-component might be present in these patients. Furthermore, quantitative defects of the immunoglobulins including the hypogammaglobulinemia associated with M-components can presumably give rise to a defect of the anti-idiotypic network's regulation of natural autoantibodies and autoimmune manifestations in vivo. Such autoimmune manifestations, which are easily overlooked in CLL may call for additional treatment with immunosuppression and/or intravenous, polyclonal IgG.","['Jonsson, V', 'Svendsen, B', 'Vorstrup, S', 'Krarup, C', 'Schmalbruch, H', 'Thomsen, K', 'Heegaard, N H', 'Wiik, A', 'Hansen, M M']","['Jonsson V', 'Svendsen B', 'Vorstrup S', 'Krarup C', 'Schmalbruch H', 'Thomsen K', 'Heegaard NH', 'Wiik A', 'Hansen MM']","['Department of Hematology, University of Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/metabolism', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*etiology/immunology', 'Autoimmunity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'POEMS Syndrome/etiology/immunology', 'Paraproteinemias/*etiology/immunology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):327-32.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CD33 is an antigen found on myeloid leukemia blasts as well as myeloid progenitor cells but it is not expressed in detectable amounts on the ultimate hematopoietic progenitor stem cell. Our previous studies indicated that a non-recombinant humanized immunotoxin displayed specific, potent toxicity towards CD33-positive cells but not to CD33-negative cells in vitro. In the current study, a recombinant humanized immunotoxin, HuM195-rGel, was evaluated in vivo in a nude mouse model of human myeloid leukemias. HuM195-rGel was found to target leukemia cells rapidly in vivo and was subsequently internalized into the cells. For trials in vivo, nude mice were injected (ip) with 10(7) log-phase HL60 human leukemia cells 10 days prior to the start of i.p. HuM195-rGel treatments. HuM195-rGel demonstrated significant tumor suppressive activity in this model. While all mice treated with either saline, rGel alone, or HuM195 plus unconjugated rGel (at 10 or 14 days after transplantation) had rapid tumor growth or early deaths, 50% of mice treated with HuM195-rGel failed to develop leukemic tumors for 5 months and the 50% had significantly retarded tumor growth after treatment with HuM195-rGel. Mice treated at later times (28 days after transplantation of leukemia cells) also showed delayed leukemia cell growth, but no cures. These data show that HuM195-rGel can target leukemia cells in vivo and can result in pronounced anti-leukemic effects.","['Xu, Y', 'Xu, Q', 'Rosenblum, M G', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Xu Y', 'Xu Q', 'Rosenblum MG', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cd33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '75037-46-6 (GEL protein, Gelonium multiflorum)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/immunology', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Plant Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/*therapeutic use', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):321-6.,,,['R01CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The immature populations are not autonomous and exhibit a normal quantitative responsiveness to proliferative stimulation by the four colony-stimulating factors. The present studies examined three other candidate regulators of granulocyte formation and showed that max 41 cells exhibit normal quantitative responsiveness to stem cell factor, slightly enhanced responsiveness to IL-6 but reduced responsiveness to Flk-ligand. Serum levels of growth factors were not unusually elevated in max 41 mice before or after the injection of endotoxin nor were excessive levels of the four CSFs or IL-6 produced in cultures of max 41 organs. Responses to injected G-CSF were not unusually high in terms of fold-elevations in max 41 mice.

We examined the expression of MPR on the cell surface of a panel of 43 myelomonocytic, erythroid and megakaryocytic leukemia cell lines and 21 primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases by flow cytometry. With few exceptions MPL was found on all 32 erythroid/megakaryocytic cell lines and on all 11 growth factor-dependent myelomonocytic cell lines, albeit at variable percentages and intensities per cell population (with a 10% cut-off level for positivity still 30/43 cell lines scored as MPL positive). The majority of the primary AML samples (including all seven M6/M7 cases) expressed the MPL protein regardless of the morphological and immunological subtype (13/21 cases had >10% MPL-positive cells). Recombinant TPO overexpressed in hamster cells induced a mitogenic response in seven cell lines (one growth factor-independent and six factor-dependent lines) and in 3/21 AML specimens (two AML M2, one AML M7) as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Expression of MPL clearly did not correlate with response to TPO. For further detailed studies of the interaction of TPO with other cytokines we used the AML M7-derived M-07e cells as an informative indicator cell line for which both murine and human TPO acted as a very potent mitogen in a dose-dependent fashion (3- to 11-fold proliferation increase relative to medium alone). This growth factor-dependent cell line which is normally cultured in conditioned medium containing several cytokines could be grown in long-term culture supplemented only with TPO. Co-incubation of M-07e with various cytokines and TPO showed additive proliferative effects for interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and synergistic responses for stem cell factor (SCF), interferon (IFN)-alpha, and to a lesser extent for IFN-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Erythropoietin (EPO), IL-1, IL-6, IL-11 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), know as megakaryocytic maturation-inducing molecules, were not substantially effective, neither singly nor in combination with TPO, with regard to cell growth. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 antagonized the inductive effect of TPO on M-07e cell growth. Addition of TPO to cultures of megakaryocytic cell lines failed to significantly alter the ploidy distribution and the differentiation marker immunoprofile of the cells indicating a lack of maturation-inducing effects in this model system. In summary, TPO represents an efficient in vitro potentiator of megakaryocytic leukemia proliferation of at least some primary cases or cell lines. While TPO seems to be the major physiological regulator of megakaryocytopoiesis, the present data suggest also some proliferative effects on certain leukemia cells, apparently on non-megakaryocytic leukemia cells as well, thus assigning to TPO a possible pathobiological role in leukemogenesis which would be of clinical relevance. Our data show that the response to TPO is not restricted to cells committed to the megakaryocytic differentiation pathway as we could demonstrate TPO-responsive megakaryocytic and non-megakaryocytic cell lines; thus, these cell lines represent powerful tools in such analyses. Consequently, this new cytokine needs to be properly examined so we can get a clear understanding of the clinical possibilities and dangers.","['Quentmeier, H', 'Zaborski, M', 'Graf, G', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Drexler, H G']","['Quentmeier H', 'Zaborski M', 'Graf G', 'Ludwig WD', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germay.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, Thrombopoietin)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '143641-95-6 (MPL protein, human)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Division', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cricetinae', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Cytokine', 'Receptors, Thrombopoietin', 'Thrombopoietin/*metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):297-310.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptor levels on AML blast cells were extremely variable and were similar to, or less than, those on normal stem and progenitor cells. In general P145(c-kit) expression was higher on cells of immature phenotype (FAB M1 and M2). c-kit mRNA was quantitated by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA) and was shown to be correlated with cell surface protein expression (r=0.76; P<0.001). This indicates that ligand-mediated receptor internalisation or other mechanisms of increased protein turnover are not responsible for variations in the level of P145(c-kit) in AML specimens. Quantitative Southern blotting was used to examine c-kit gene copy number in 25 of these specimens and was found to be normal in all but one. Thus we have found little evidence of over-expression of c-kit in adult AML. mRNA for the c-kit ligand, Steel Factor (SLF) was also quantitated by RPA in these specimens. While SLF message was detectable (limit of detection approximately 10(4) copies per 10 microgram total RNA; equivalent to 1 copy per 100 cells) in 19% of cases, these specimens in general contained low levels of c-kit mRNA.

These results suggest that responses of leukemic progenitors to CSFs were variable but may be predicted by their c-kitR expressions, and that c-kitR(-) cases may have a different disease entity from c-kitR(+) cases.","['Hirakawa, K', 'Kimura, S', 'Chikayama, S', 'Misawa, S', 'Maekawa, T']","['Hirakawa K', 'Kimura S', 'Chikayama S', 'Misawa S', 'Maekawa T']","['Department of Hygiene, Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Division', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):279-87.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agonistic and antagonistic effects of other cytokines.,271-8,"We have previously shown that the growth factor FLT3 ligand (FL) is mitogenic for human primary and continuously cultured myeloid leukemia cells. Despite widespread expression of the receptor FLT3 among the leukemia cell lines from certain cell lineages, only two growth factor-dependent myeloid leukemia cell lines showed a significant proliferative response to FL. In the present study, we examined the proliferative effects of FL on a comprehensive set of growth factor-dependent leukemia cell lines. A significant enhancement of cell growth by FL was seen in 10/12 myelomonocytic cell lines, while all cell lines with predominantly megakaryocytic and/or erythroid characteristics did not respond positively, despite the expression of the receptor. The cytokines interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) could independently enhance the FL-stimulated proliferation in a synergistic fashion. Transforming growth factor-(beta)1 (TGF-(beta)1), in a dose-dependent fashion, partially inhibited the FL-promoted proliferation, but basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), on its own augmenting the response to FL, significantly abrogated the inhibitory effects of TGF-(beta)1. TGF-(beta)1 down-regulated mRNA and protein expression of the FLT3 receptor. Taken together these data suggest that the effects of FL on the growth of normal and malignant hematopoietic cells can be positively and negatively modulated by other cytokines.","['Dehmel, U', 'Quentmeier, H', 'Drexler, H G']","['Dehmel U', 'Quentmeier H', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Membrane Proteins/agonists/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Stem Cell Factor/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):271-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Proliferative response of myeloid leukemia cells.,261-70,"The growth of cells in vitro and in vivo is regulated by several environmental signals among which growth factors (cytokines) figure prominently. FLT3 is a novel cytokine receptor with intrinsic ligand-stimulated (FLT3 ligand, FL) tyrosine kinase activity. Here, using a specific anti-FLT3 monoclonal antibody (McAb) and flow cytometry we determined the expression pattern of the receptor protein in 55 human leukemia-lymphoma cell lines and in 20 primary samples from patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FLT3 receptor surface expression was found predominantly in pre-B cell, myeloid and monocytic cell lines and in pre-B-ALL and AML cells, FL was overexpressed in baby hamster kidney cells producing a recombinant protein that was functional in receptor binding and signaling. Incubation with FL induced 3H-thymidine uptake-measured proliferation in some myeloid cell lines and in 2/9 AML cases. The strongest proliferative response was seen in the two growth factor-dependent myeloid leukemia cell lines MUTZ-2 and OCI-AML-5. Long-term substitution of the commonly used cytokines with FL sustained the continuous proliferation of these two cell lines suggesting that also upon permanent activation FLT2 can function as a mitogenic signaling molecule. Despite the high density of FLT3 receptor expression on cultured and fresh pre-B-ALL cells, no proliferation could be stimulated in any of these specimens. Incubation with the anti-FLT3 McAb had agonistic proliferative effects in MUTZ-2 and OCI-AML-5; and anti-FL reagent blocked FL-stimulated proliferation. To summarize, we demonstrated that FL is effective in inducing proliferation of leukemic myeloid cells and that protein expression does not necessarily indicate an FL-responsive cell. While the present data clearly demonstrate that FL might play a proliferative role in leukemogenesis, further studies are needed to clarify whether the signals provided by FL:FLT3 interaction are confined to a proliferation-inducing function or whether maturational progression could also be elicited in certain cells.","['Dehmel, U', 'Zaborski, M', 'Meierhoff, G', 'Rosnet, O', 'Birnbaum, D', 'Ludwig, W D', 'Quentmeier, H', 'Drexler, H G']","['Dehmel U', 'Zaborski M', 'Meierhoff G', 'Rosnet O', 'Birnbaum D', 'Ludwig WD', 'Quentmeier H', 'Drexler HG']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (flt3 ligand protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cricetinae', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/pathology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):261-70.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The frequent cytogenetic aberrations occurring in several human neoplasms at the level of their codifying genes along with their molecular function strongly suggest that they might be important tumor suppressor genes. We looked for homozygous deletions of p16(INK4A) and p18 genes in 21 cases of childhood T cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Twenty of 21 patients (95%) had homozygous deletions of p16(INK4A) gene while three out of 21 (14%) showed p18 gene biallelic deletion. Loss of heterozygosity studies were performed in 18 of the T cell ALL investigated by means of two highly polymorphic 9p21 markers. The results obtained demonstrated that genetic deletions of different extension occur on the short arms of the 9 chromosome pair. Karyotypic analyses, performed in 13 cases, failed to demonstrate 9p alterations in 12 samples, (92%) thus demonstrating that p16(INK4A) gene homozygous deletions are not restricted to cases with cytogenetically detectable 9p aberrations. The high incidence of p16(INK4A) gene deletions in pediatric T cell lineage ALL suggests that this genetic alteration could represent an early and key event in the development of such a malignancy but it should not have any prognostic value. Conversely, the inactivation of p18 gene, observed in a lower but significant number of cases, could participate in the progression of acute leukemias towards a more aggressive disease. Finally, our results may suggest that p16(INK4A) protein plays a key role in the control of proliferation and/or differentiation of human T lymphocytes.","['Iolascon, A', 'Faienza, M F', 'Coppola, B', 'della Ragione, F', 'Schettini, F', 'Biondi, A']","['Iolascon A', 'Faienza MF', 'Coppola B', 'della Ragione F', 'Schettini F', 'Biondi A']","[""Dipartimento di Biomedicina dell'Eta Evolutiva, Universita di Bari, Italy.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16', 'Female', '*Gene Deletion', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*genetics', '*Homozygote', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):255-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional analysis of five mAbs (SF1 series) revealed that all of them can mimic to variable extents the activity of the FLT3 ligand (FL) upon receptor activation and modulation, while only one mAb weakly inhibited ligand binding. Using flow cytometry, we detected surface expression of FLT3 on cell lines of the myeloid (4/8) and B lymphoid (7/10) lineages. On normal human bone marrow cells, the expression of FLT3 is restricted, in agreement with a presumed function of this receptor at the level of the stem cells and early committed progenitors. Expression of FLT3 was found on a fraction of CD34-positive and CD34-negative cells. Three-color analysis further revealed that most of the CD34 FLT3+ cells coexpress CD117 (KIT) at a high level.

Our previous studies demonstrated subtle differences in the growth, phenotypic and morphologic characteristics of the most primitive subpopulations of primary lin-Ph+ chronic phase CML blasts and comparable primary lin- normal blasts. Recently, in comparing proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine in these cell populations, we reported a prominent 62 kDa phosphotyrosyl (P-tyr) protein constitutively present in primary primitive lin- CML chronic phase blasts which was virtually undetectable in primary primitive lin- normal blasts. In the present studies, we demonstrate that this P-tyr p62 from primary primitive lin- chronic phase CML blasts co-immunoprecipitates with ras-GAP. Furthermore, in addition to the p210 protein, we show in whole cell lysates the presence of other clearly consistent but less prominent P-tyr proteins with molecular weights of approximately 155, 140, 110, 55 and 45 kDa as well as more minor P-tyr proteins of approximately 190, 85, 52, 42 and 39 kDa constitutively present in primary primitive lin- chronic phase CML blasts. In analyzing proteins tyrosine phosphorylated in primary primitive lin- normal blasts in response to various hematopoietic growth factors, we found a striking similarity in the phosphorylation of four major (approximately 140, 110, 62 and 56 kDa) and three minor (approximately 51, 45 and 42 kDa) P-tyr proteins after stimulation with c-kit ligand and the P-tyr proteins constitutively phosphorylated in primary primitive lin- chronic phase CML blasts. Other growth factors tested (ie GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-3, FLT3 ligand and EPO) were much less active or stimulated phosphorylation of other proteins. It is provocative that at least seven proteins rapidly and transiently phosphorylated on tyrosine in the c-kit ligand signal transduction pathway in lin- normal blasts may be constitutive substrates for the p210 activated tyrosine kinase in comparable lin- chronic phase CML blasts. In addition, it is intriguing that some of the biological effects on hematopoietic progenitors attributed to the c-kit ligand may be similar to some of the observed biological consequences of the p210 protein, including survival and expansion of a more mature stem cell population, probably at the time of lineage commitment rather than at the level of the earliest self-renewing stem cell.","['Wisniewski, D', 'Strife, A', 'Berman, E', 'Clarkson, B']","['Wisniewski D', 'Strife A', 'Berman E', 'Clarkson B']","['Sloan-Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, New York, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,"['Cell Lineage', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/metabolism', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/*pharmacology', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):229-37.,,,"['CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA-08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, ALL defined by 51-55 chromosomes appears to be a clinicobiologic entity quite distinct from cases with higher modal numbers.","['Raimondi, S C', 'Pui, C H', 'Hancock, M L', 'Behm, F G', 'Filatov, L', 'Rivera, G K']","['Raimondi SC', 'Pui CH', 'Hancock ML', 'Behm FG', 'Filatov L', 'Rivera GK']","[""Departments of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cohort Studies', '*Diploidy', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):213-24.,,,"['CA20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PCR may help in the diagnosis and in monitoring minimal residual disease. Reversion of PCR to negative is obtained by chemotherapy (CT) alone or in combination with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Here we show a serial PCR study of 10 APL cases. Five cases were studied at the time of diagnosis, and all were PCR positive for the rearranged transcripts (three bcr1 type, two bcr3 type). Seven cases in complete remission (CR) after one cycle of induction CT were persistently PCR negative, one case in CR after ATRA rescue was persistently PCR positive (bcr1 type), one patient (bcr3 type) relapsed 15 months after the PCR-negative CR and one patient died early. Seven patients underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) (five allogeneic, two autologous). One of them died early after take of the allogeneic BMT, the other six cases studied by serial PCR were persistently negative. At a median follow-up of 31 months (range 9-39), none of these six cases had relapsed. PCR data characterize the CR at the molecular level and evaluate the efficacy of different treatments, including BMT. The data may help to define a standardized schedule for PCR follow-up, and are also potentially useful to establish the time required before judging patients with persistently negative PCR to be cured. BMT as post-induction treatment in first CR is also discussed.","['Perego, R A', 'Marenco, P', 'Bianchi, C', 'Cairoli, R', 'Urbano, M', 'Nosari, A M', 'Muti, G', 'Morra, E', 'Del Monte, U']","['Perego RA', 'Marenco P', 'Bianchi C', 'Cairoli R', 'Urbano M', 'Nosari AM', 'Muti G', 'Morra E', 'Del Monte U']","['Institute of General Pathology, University of Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1996 Feb;10(2):207-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FHL Study Group of the Histiocyte Society.,197-203,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare, often fatal, disease of early infancy. The diagnosis of HLH is frequently delayed or made at autopsy because no genetic or biologic marker has been identified. To improve the classification and treatment of HLH, the Histiocyte Society has established an 'International Registry for HLH'. Data collected included family history, clinical and laboratory features at the onset of illness, and treatment outcome. Stringent diagnostic criteria (ie fever, splenomegaly, cytopenia, hypertriglyceridemia, and/or hypofibrinogenemia, and hemophagocytosis without evidence of malignancy) were used for patient selection. One hundred and twenty-two patients (61 males, 61 females) were enrolled from 17 centers in 11 countries. The rate of parental consanguinity was 24%. A positive family history was reported in 49% of cases including two pairs of affected male twins. The median age at disease onset was 2.9 months, with no difference between familial and sporadic cases. Age at onset was similar in affected sibs from 10 of 14 families, but in four up to 3-year differences were observed. Hemophagocytosis was present at diagnosis in 75%. An associated infection (usually by common viral pathogens) was reported in 50 of the 122 (41%) cases, of which 25 had familial disease. Natural killer activity was impaired in 36 of 37 patients studied. Chromosome analysis was normal in all tested patients. A decreased frequency of HLA-B7 and B8 alleles and increased frequency of HLA-B21 and DQ3 were observed. The estimated 5-year survival (SE) was 21% (18.7) for all patients. It was 66% (37.8) for patients who received allogeneic bone marrow transplant and 10.1% (9.6) for patients treated with chemotherapy alone (P=0.0001).

To investigate the effect of HDMP on some other hematopoietic regulatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), gamma-interferon (gamma-INF), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were studied by microplate ELISA technique in 15 chemotherapy-induced neutropenic episodes of 14 children with acute leukemia (eight with ALL and six with AML) in whom HDMP was given alone (30 mg/kg/day po) for 4 days. The absolute neutrophil counts increased significantly in all neutropenic episodes on the fourth day of HDMP treatment.

The Kurloff body is rich in acid phosphatase, esterase and proteoglycans, as are large granular lymphocyte granules. Moreover, the Kurloff body contains lysosomal Asase B, with unusual anionic isoforms. Injection of L2C cells elicited a three-fold increase in KC Asase activity on day 6. The increase in KC Asase activity was correlated with the number of circulating L2C cells. The basic Asase form (pl 8) was lost, and a concomitant increase in anionic isoforms (pl 5-6) was observed on day 6. The role of the latter in cytolysis was investigated by examining their capacity to lyse L2C target cells. We conclude that Asase participates in cytolysis when lysis is mediated by the complete assembly of cytolytic proteins. Changing and increasing KC Asase activity during leukemia development may be a marker for activated KC in vivo. These findings suggest that the cytolytic activation of KC occurs during the preleukemic period.","['Taouji, S', 'Debout, C', 'Izard, J']","['Taouji S', 'Debout C', 'Izard J']","[""Laboratoire d'Histologie et de Biologie Cellulaire, UFR de Medecine, Universite de Caen, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Anions)', '0 (Blood Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.1.6.9 (Chondro-4-Sulfatase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anions', 'Blood Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chondro-4-Sulfatase/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*enzymology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*enzymology', 'Preleukemia/blood/enzymology']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Mar;20(3):259-64. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00152-2.,,"['0145-2126(95)00152-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00152-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The VM-26 induced IW32 cells to differentiate at a non-toxic but cytostatic concentration (0.01 microgram/ml). More than 40% of the cells were induced to synthesize hemoglobin, and cells were arrested in G2/M phase of the cell cycle. Levels of beta-globin mRNA also increased significantly. Cells became committed to erythroid maturation after 16 h of continuous drug exposure. Replacement with fresh VM-26 after 48 h of drug treatment further increased the hemoglobin containing cells to greater than 80%. Unlike other drug induced erythroleukemia cell differentiation, c-myc mRNA expression was not affected by VM-26. Inhibition of topoisomerase II activity was observed during the first 12 h of VM-26 treatment; however, elevated enzyme activity was found thereafter. Northern blot analysis showed significant increase in the expression of topoisomerase IIalpha mRNA at 12 and 24 h after VM-26 addition. These findings indicate that VM-26 inhibited the activity of topoisomerase II and promoted the committed differentiation of IW32 cells along the erythroid pathway. In addition, a parallel increase in mRNA and activity levels of topoisomerase II in differentiated cells suggests that regulation of the enzyme expression occurred in the VM-26 induced erythroid maturation.","['Tan, S K', 'Tang, S J', 'Wang, M C', 'Hwang, J', 'Wang, F F']","['Tan SK', 'Tang SJ', 'Wang MC', 'Hwang J', 'Wang FF']","['Faculty of Medical Technology, National Yang-Ming University, Shih-Pai, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Globins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Mar;20(3):249-57. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00144-1.,,"['0145-2126(95)00144-1 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00144-1 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This combination may be worth testing clinically as a treatment of CML.","['Zheng, A', 'Savolainen, E R', 'Koistinen, P']","['Zheng A', 'Savolainen ER', 'Koistinen P']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Oulu, FInland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Mar;20(3):243-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00148-4.,,"['0145-2126(95)00148-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00148-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acetylcholinesterase is mapped to 7q22, within the critical deleted region presumed to contain a myeloid specific tumour suppressor gene. Butyrylcholinesterase is mapped to 3q26: abnormalities at this region are associated with sub-types of MDS and AML with thrombocytopenia, or with increased platelet counts. Both ACHE and BCHE have been implicated as playing a role in megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis, and these genes have been observed to be co-amplified in acute myeloid leukaemia. Recent findings suggest a more significant role for the ACHE gene in haemopoiesis by regulating multipotent stem cell proliferation, and apoptosis in cells undergoing erythroid and myeloid differentiation. This led us to investigate gene copy-number alterations at these genes in MDS and AML. Samples were screened by slot-blot hybridization, and if changes were observed, by Southern blotting. A total of 42 samples from 31 de novo AML patients, 10 samples from eight cases of post-MDS AML and 85 samples from 67 MDS patients were analysed with probes for ACHE, BCHE, c-MYC, MDR-1 and globin control. Changes in ACHE and/or BCHE were observed in 9/31 de novo AML patients, and in 7/67 MDS patients: 1/37 cases of refractory anaemia (RA), 1/10 cases of refractory anaemia with excess blasts (RAEB) and 5/20 chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) patients. The amplification events observed generated copy numbers no greater than 10, showed normal restriction patterns and had no clear correlation with megakaryopoiesis or thrombopoiesis. Loss of signal at the ACHE locus was observed: haploid signal intensity was seen in seven samples: one RA with thrombocytopenia, three CMML, one AML-M5a (no karyotypic abnormalities of chromosome 7), one AML-M4 (monosomy 7), and one case of AML-M7 (karyotype unknown). Homozygous deletion was observed at relapse of an additional patient with AML-M4. These data reinforce the possibility that ACHE may play a role as a myeloid tumour suppressor gene.","['Stephenson, J', 'Czepulkowski, B', 'Hirst, W', 'Mufti, G J']","['Stephenson J', 'Czepulkowski B', 'Hirst W', 'Mufti GJ']","[""Department of Haematological Medicine, King's College School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (DNA Primers)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.8 (Butyrylcholinesterase)']",IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/*genetics', 'Acute Disease', 'Base Sequence', 'Butyrylcholinesterase/genetics', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'DNA Primers', '*Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics']",1996/03/01 00:00,1996/03/01 00:01,['1996/03/01 00:00'],"['1996/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1996 Mar;20(3):235-41. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(95)00146-8.,,"['0145-2126(95)00146-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(95)00146-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The morphology of the cell lines is characterized by dysplastic features in some or all cell lines. The FAB classification has divided MDS in five subgroups, namely (1) RA (refractory anemia); (2) RARS (refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts); (3) CMML (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia); (4) RAEB (refractory anemia with excess blasts); and (5) RAEB-T (refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation). Myelodysplastic syndrome remains primarily a disease of the elderly. With a reported median age of 74.4 years, patients have a chronic relentless course with complication of cytopenias, and a significant number of MDS patients, especially from the RAEB and RAEB-T categories, end up in acute myeloid leukemic transformation. Cytogenetic abnormalities are present in 40-58% of the cases and can provide not only help in diagnosis, but also understanding regarding the clinical course and prognostic aspect. Management of MDS is quite pragmatic and at this stage far from satisfactory. Various modalities have included use of differentiating agents, aggressive chemotherapy, bone marrow transplant and, more recently, significant interest has been generated in the use of hematopoietic growth factors. Differentiating agent trials have been unrewarding so far; chemotherapy trials have resulted in less benefit and more early toxic deaths, especially in the elderly MDS patients where the disease predominates. Bone marrow transplant appears suitable for some patients who are at a younger age. Salvation from this disease is being searched in the proper usage of hematopoietic growth factors and cytokines. There has been concern, however, that usage of growth factors has led to early and enhanced transformation of these patients to frank acute leukemic states. This concept appears to be somewhat refuted by newer controlled trials with GM-CSF and G-CSF, emphasizing that the acute leukemic transformation is the natural course of the disease and is not hastened by growth factor use. Preliminary studies are also suggesting that a combination of growth factors, especially G-CSF and erythropoietin as compared to chemotherapies, could be more beneficial in prolonging the survival of MDS patients who have progressed to the acute leukemic phase. More studies are needed for the understanding of the pathogenetic mechanism(s) in order to facilitate a more suitable and appropriate management strategy for MDS.","['Saba, H I']",['Saba HI'],"['Leukemia and Lymphoma Center, Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, H.

Equal access and proportional representation of all races/ethnicities is desired. PURPOSE: Our objectives were to evaluate the inclusion of African-Americans, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites in NCI-sponsored treatment trials and to determine if there is proportional racial/ethnic representation. METHODS: During the period of January 1, 1991, through June 30, 1994, 99 495 cancer patients were enrolled in clinical trials and declared themselves as non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, or Hispanic (of any race). In the analysis, participants in NCI treatment trials were subdivided into three age groups: birth to 19 years, 20-49 years, and 50 or more years. The racial/ethnic composition of each of these age groups was compared with the racial/ethnic makeup of the American population with cancer. Estimates of the number of incident cancer cases per year were made for each racial/ethnic group within each age group using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and the 1990 Census. The percentage of all cancer patients who were in each racial/ethnic group were compared with the population that entered clinical trials. Comparisons are also made separately for patients with leukemia and breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers. RESULTS: Among patients 0-19 years old, 20-49 years old, and 50 years old or older there is relatively proportional representation of non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites in trials. It is noted that more than 70% of cancer patients aged 0-19 years are estimated to enter cooperative group clinical trials compared with 4.0% of cancer patients aged 20-49 years and 1.5% of patients aged 50 years or older. CONCLUSIONS: Accrual of American cancer patients to NCI-sponsored treatment trials generally parallels the incident burden of disease among non-Hispanic African-Americans, Hispanics, and non-Hispanic whites. IMPLICATIONS: This study shows that the NCI clinical trials are, as a whole, racially/ethnically representative of the American population and suggests that there is equal access to NCI clinical trials.","['Tejeda, H A', 'Green, S B', 'Trimble, E L', 'Ford, L', 'High, J L', 'Ungerleider, R S', 'Friedman, M A', 'Brawley, O W']","['Tejeda HA', 'Green SB', 'Trimble EL', 'Ford L', 'High JL', 'Ungerleider RS', 'Friedman MA', 'Brawley OW']","[""St. Peter's Medical Center (UMDNJ), Department of Medicine, New Brunswick, NJ 08903-0591, USA.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['African Americans/*statistics & numerical data', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Hispanic or Latino/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'United States', 'Whites/*statistics & numerical data']",1996/06/19 00:00,1996/06/19 00:01,['1996/06/19 00:00'],"['1996/06/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/06/19 00:01 [medline]', '1996/06/19 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1996 Jun 19;88(12):812-6. doi: 10.1093/jnci/88.12.812.,,['10.1093/jnci/88.12.812 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data have been collected since 1988 on 45 children with PPB and their families. All pathologic materials were centrally reviewed. Preliminary molecular genetic analyses were performed when possible. RESULTS: In 12 of 45 patients, an association was found between PPB and other dysplasias, neoplasias, or malignancies in the patients with or in their young relatives. The diseases found to be associated with PPB include other cases of PPB, pulmonary cysts, cystic nephromas, sarcomas, medulloblastomas, thyroid dysplasias and neoplasias, malignant germ cell tumors, Hodgkin disease, leukemia, and Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Abnormalities of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, Wilms tumor suppressor gene (WT1), and the putative second genetic locus for Wilms tumor (WT2) were not found in preliminary investigations. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of PPB appears to herald a constitutional and heritable predisposition to dysplastic or neoplastic disease in approximately 25% of cases. All patients with PPB and their families should be investigated carefully. Further research of this new family cancer syndrome may provide insight into the genetic basis of these diseases.","['Priest, J R', 'Watterson, J', 'Strong, L', 'Huff, V', 'Woods, W G', 'Byrd, R L', 'Friend, S H', 'Newsham, I', 'Amylon, M D', 'Pappo, A', 'Mahoney, D H', 'Langston, C', 'Heyn, R', 'Kohut, G', 'Freyer, D R', 'Bostrom, B', 'Richardson, M S', 'Barredo, J', 'Dehner, L P']","['Priest JR', 'Watterson J', 'Strong L', 'Huff V', 'Woods WG', 'Byrd RL', 'Friend SH', 'Newsham I', 'Amylon MD', 'Pappo A', 'Mahoney DH', 'Langston C', 'Heyn R', 'Kohut G', 'Freyer DR', 'Bostrom B', 'Richardson MS', 'Barredo J', 'Dehner LP']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Children's Health Care, St. Paul, Minnesota 55102, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,,IM,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Exons', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Lung/*pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Pedigree', 'Pulmonary Blastoma/*genetics/pathology']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1996 Feb;128(2):220-4. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(96)70393-1.,,"['S0022-3476(96)70393-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(96)70393-1 [doi]']",,['J Pediatr. 1996 Nov;129(5):773-5.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: From October 1984 to July 1994, 84 patients with malignant hematopoietic diseases received allogeneic BMT after conditioning with high-dose chemotherapy and total-body irradiation (TBI). Seventy-nine patients with normal renal function before conditioning are included in this study. Conditioning included high-dose cyclophosphamide without (n = 46) or with (n = 33) other agents (daunorubicin, busulfan, cytarabine, and thiotepa) followed by TBI. The TBI dose prescribed to the center of the abdomen was 10 Gy for 24 patients, 12 Gy for 32, and 13.5 Gy for 23. In vitro T-cell depletion was undertaken in 48 cases. The post-BMT nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides, vancomycin, amphotericin, and cyclosporine was assessed. Time to renal dysfunction was defined as the time to a persistent increase of serum creatinine (SCr) level greater than 110 mumol/L. The potential influence of sex, age, diagnosis, chimerism, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) on renal dysfunction was also assessed. RESULTS: The 18-month probability of renal dysfunction-free survival (RDFS) for the whole group was 77%. Only TBI dose and presence of GvHD were significantly correlated with renal dysfunction by multivariate analysis. The 18-month probabilities of RDFS were 95%, 74%, and 55% for the patients conditioned with 10, 12, and 13.5 Gy, respectively. The 18-month RDFS probabilities were 88% and 61% for patients without and with GvHD, respectively. Combining both variables, we have defined two risk categories: low-risk (ie, 10 Gy TBI with/without GvHD and 12 Gy TBI without GvHD) and high-risk (ie, 12 Gy TBI with GvHD and 13.5 Gy TBI with/without GvHD). The predicted 18-month RDFS rates were 93% and 52% for the low- and high-risk groups, respectively. CONCLUSION: Renal dysfunction after allogeneic BMT is strongly related to the delivered TBI dose (and dose per fraction) and to the presence of GvHD. Renal shielding should be recommended if a TBI dose greater than 12 Gy (fractionated twice daily over 3 days) is to be prescribed. Furthermore, in those cases with a high risk of developing GvHD (eg, unrelated allogeneic BMT, absence of T-cell depletion), these data suggest that kidney doses greater than 10 Gy should be avoided.","['Miralbell, R', 'Bieri, S', 'Mermillod, B', 'Helg, C', 'Sancho, G', 'Pastoors, B', 'Keller, A', 'Kurtz, J M', 'Chapuis, B']","['Miralbell R', 'Bieri S', 'Mermillod B', 'Helg C', 'Sancho G', 'Pastoors B', 'Keller A', 'Kurtz JM', 'Chapuis B']","['Hopital Cantonal Universitaire, Geneve, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', 'Humans', 'Kidney Diseases/*etiology', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Lymphoma/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Feb;14(2):579-85. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.2.579.,,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.2.579 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four patients developed acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL), which represents a relative risk (RR) of 117 (95% confidence interval [CI], 31.5 to 300) compared with population rates. A fifth patient was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). All five patients with secondary hematologic malignancies subsequently received salvage treatment, with either alkylating agents alone (n = 1) or combined modality therapy (CMT) (n = 4). Overall, eight solid tumors were observed (RR = 2.0; 95% CI, 0.9 to 4.0). The 15-year cumulative risks of all second cancers and secondary ANLL were 37% and 17%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the small number of subjects, a considerable risk of leukemia was observed among patients treated with low-dose TBI in combination with CMT including alkylating agents. Based on these results, approximately eight to nine excess ANLLs might be expected to occur among 100 NHL patients treated with low-dose TBI and salvage treatment and followed-up for 15 years.","['Travis, L B', 'Weeks, J', 'Curtis, R E', 'Chaffey, J T', 'Stovall, M', 'Banks, P M', 'Boice, J D Jr']","['Travis LB', 'Weeks J', 'Curtis RE', 'Chaffey JT', 'Stovall M', 'Banks PM', 'Boice JD Jr']","['National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, United States Department of Health and Human Services, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/etiology', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/*etiology', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/*adverse effects']",1996/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Feb;14(2):565-71. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.2.565.,,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.2.565 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this trial was to assess the efficacy and the toxicity of FAMP in untreated patients with follicular lymphoma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-four untreated patients with advanced follicular lymphoma were treated with intravenous (i.v.) fludarabine at a dose of 25 mg/m2/d during 5 days every 4 weeks, to a maximum of nine cycles. RESULTS: The toxicity of the drug was mild, mainly granulocytic. Granulocytopenia > or = 3 (World Health Organization [WHO]) was observed during 48 of 328 cycles (14.6%) and in 22 of 53 (41%) patients assessable for toxicity. Fludarabine had to be stopped prematurely because of toxicity in nine patients: marrow toxicity in five, peripheral neuropathy in two, and interstitial pneumonitis and hepatitis in one patient each. Among 49 patients assessable for response, the overall response rate was 65% and the complete response (CR) rate 37%. The median progression-free survival interval for all patients was 13.6 months. CONCLUSION: These results confirm that fludarabine is active when used as first-line treatment in patients with follicular lymphoma and has a low toxicity rate. It may be used as single treatment in elderly patients. Associations of fludarabine with other drugs active against follicular lymphoma need to be determined.","['Solal-Celigny, P', 'Brice, P', 'Brousse, N', 'Caspard, H', 'Bastion, Y', 'Haioun, C', 'Bosly, A', 'Tilly, H', 'Bordessoule, D', 'Sebban, C', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Morel, P', 'Dupas, B', 'Plassart, F', 'Vasile, N', 'Fort, N', 'Leporrier, M']","['Solal-Celigny P', 'Brice P', 'Brousse N', 'Caspard H', 'Bastion Y', 'Haioun C', 'Bosly A', 'Tilly H', 'Bordessoule D', 'Sebban C', 'Harousseau JL', 'Morel P', 'Dupas B', 'Plassart F', 'Vasile N', 'Fort N', 'Leporrier M']","[""Groupe d'Etude des Lymphomes de l'Adulte, Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '106XV160TZ (Vidarabine Phosphate)', '1X9VK9O1SC (fludarabine phosphate)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/chemically induced', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine Phosphate/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Feb;14(2):514-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.2.514.,,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.2.514 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We prospectively studied 20 children during initial remission of ALL and 16 children at relapse to assess CSF penetration of etoposide. METHODS: Simultaneous plasma and CSF concentrations were assessed at a median of 2.8 hours (range, 0.4 to 5.3) after an intravenous (i.v.) or oral dose in 41 paired samples. RESULTS: Etoposide given at 300 mg/m2 i.v. to patients during first remission and at 50 or 25 mg/m2 orally to those in relapse resulted in median CSF levels of 0.175 mumol/L (range, .066 to 2.12), 0.011 mumol/L (range, .004 to .032), and 0.007 mumol/L (range, .003 to .014), respectively. The CSF etoposide concentration was > or = 10 nmol/L in 20 of 20, five of 10, and two of 11 courses following 300 mg/m2 i.v., 50 mg/m2 orally, and 25 mg/m2 orally, respectively, and was positively related to both the concurrent etoposide plasma concentration (R2 = .64) and to dose (R2 = .73). The median ratio of CSF to plasma concentration was 0.30% (range, 0.09% to 3.12%), which was not related to dose, plasma concentration, or time postdose at which samples were obtained, but was positively correlated with the CSF protein concentration (R2 = 0.43, P = .006). Both the absolute etoposide CSF concentrations (P = .008) and the ratio of CSF to plasma concentrations (P = .023) were higher among first-remission patients who had CSF leukemic blasts at diagnosis compared with those without CSF blasts. CONCLUSION: Because etoposide concentrations as low as 10 nmol/L may be cytotoxic in vitro, prolonged daily oral low-dose (50 mg/m2) or conventional i.v. doses of etoposide may contribute to successful CNS-directed therapy in children with ALL.","['Relling, M V', 'Mahmoud, H H', 'Pui, C H', 'Sandlund, J T', 'Rivera, G K', 'Ribeiro, R C', 'Crist, W M', 'Evans, W E']","['Relling MV', 'Mahmoud HH', 'Pui CH', 'Sandlund JT', 'Rivera GK', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Crist WM', 'Evans WE']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*administration & dosage/blood/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Child', 'Etoposide/*administration & dosage/blood/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Feb;14(2):399-404. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.2.399.,,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.2.399 [doi]'],"['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The residual lymphoblast percentage was evaluated on day 7 (n = 220) and day 14 (n = 205) during a four- or five-drug induction in patients with poor prognostic factors. The rate of cytoreduction was related to event-free survival (EFS) and other factors. RESULTS: On the New York (NY) regimen, 68%, 14%, and 18%, and on the Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) regimen, 56%, 15%, and 29% of patients had M1 (< 5% blasts), M2 (5-25%), or M3 (> 25%) responses on day 7 (P = .075). On day 14, the corresponding values were 87%, 6%, 7% on NY and 84%, 8%, 8% on BFM. For patients who achieved remission by day 28 and a day-7 marrow rating of M1, M2, or M3, the 6-year EFS rate was 78%, 61%, and 49% (P < .001). The day-14 ratings predicted for a 72%, 32%, or 40% EFS (P < .001). Patients with 5% to 10% blasts day 7 had three times as many events as those with less than 5% and had no better EFS than those with 11% to 25% blasts. Patients with a WBC count more than 200,000/microL at diagnosis and an M1 day 7 marrow had an EFS rate of 69%, while for those with M2 or M3, the EFS rate was 41%. Day-7 marrow had greater prognostic significance than the day-14 evaluation. For slow responders on day 7, the day-14 marrow provided additional information. EFS for patients who achieved M1 by day 14 was 65%. EFS decreased to 20% for those still M2 or M3 on day 14. Day-7 and -14 evaluations had significance for patients of all ages and WBC levels. CONCLUSION: Marrow aspiration on day 7 of therapy provided more useful information than that on day 14. However, day-14 marrow provided additional information for patients with a poor day-7 response. The rate of cytoreduction is a powerful, independent prognostic factor that can identify patients with a slow early response who are at risk for a short remission duration.","['Steinherz, P G', 'Gaynon, P S', 'Breneman, J C', 'Cherlow, J M', 'Grossman, N J', 'Kersey, J H', 'Johnstone, H S', 'Sather, H N', 'Trigg, M E', 'Chappell, R', 'Hammond, D', 'Bleyer, W A']","['Steinherz PG', 'Gaynon PS', 'Breneman JC', 'Cherlow JM', 'Grossman NJ', 'Kersey JH', 'Johnstone HS', 'Sather HN', 'Trigg ME', 'Chappell R', 'Hammond D', 'Bleyer WA']","['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'LSA2-L2 protocol', 'PVDA protocol']",IM,"['*Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/*pathology', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*mortality/pathology/*therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1996/02/01 00:00,1996/02/01 00:01,['1996/02/01 00:00'],"['1996/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1996/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1996/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1996 Feb;14(2):389-98. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.2.389.,,['10.1200/JCO.1996.14.2.389 [doi]'],,"['J Clin Oncol. 1996 Aug;14(8):2403-6.
