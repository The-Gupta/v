The patient had an 18-month history of transfusion-dependent myelofibrosis and moderate chronic renal insufficiency. Admission laboratory findings were remarkable for severe hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia, hyperkalemia, and hypocalcemia with acute deterioration of renal function, consistent with a diagnosis of acute uric acid nephropathy. Treatment, including hemodialysis and allopurinol administration, resulted in clinical improvement with normalization of serum uric acid concentrations and resolution of acute renal failure. With long-term allopurinol therapy, renal function has remained at his previous baseline, and there has been no transformation to acute leukemia. This case represents a rare instance of acute renal failure related to the occurrence of acute uric acid nephropathy associated with myelofibrosis and emphasizes the importance of early recognition and aggressive management, which can lead to recovery of renal function.","['Sile, S', 'Wall, B M']","['Sile S', 'Wall BM']","['Division of Nephrology, Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Memphis, TN 38104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Kidney Dis,American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation,8110075,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Acute Kidney Injury/blood/*etiology', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/blood/*complications']",2001/09/29 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/09/29 10:00'],"['2001/09/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/29 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0272-6386(01)45302-9 [pii]', '10.1053/ajkd.2001.27730 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Kidney Dis. 2001 Oct;38(4):E21. doi: 10.1053/ajkd.2001.27730.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PML contains a RING domain which is required for its growth-suppressive and antiviral properties. Although normally nuclear, in certain pathogenic conditions, including arenaviral infection, PML is relocated to the cytoplasm, where its functions are poorly understood. Here, we observe that PML and arenavirus protein Z use regions around the first zinc-binding site of their respective RING domains to directly interact, with sub-micromolar affinity, with the dorsal surface of translation initiation factor eIF4E, representing a novel mode of eIF4E recognition. PML and Z profoundly reduce the affinity of eIF4E for its substrate, the 5' 7-methyl guanosine cap of mRNA, by over 100-fold. Association with the dorsal surface of eIF4E and direct antagonism of mRNA cap binding by PML and Z lead to direct inhibition of translation. These activities of the RING domains of PML and Z do not involve ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation, in contrast to many RINGs which have been observed to do so. Although PML and Z have well characterized physiological functions in regulation of growth and apoptosis, this work establishes the first discrete biochemical mechanism which underlies the biological activities of their RING domains.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was used to identify mast cell degranulation in both OLP (n = 22) and normal control (n = 14) tissues. OLP lesional T cell lines (n = 5) and HMC-1 (a human leukemia mast cell line) were used to examine the effects of OLP T cell supernatants on mast cell degranulation in vitro. RESULTS: Approximately 60% of mast cells were degranulated in OLP. OLP lesional T cells expressed mRNA for RANTES, and TNF-alpha stimulation upregulated OLP lesional T cell RANTES secretion. OLP lesional T cell supernatants induced degranulation of HMC-1 with release of TNF-alpha and histamine. Human recombinant RANTES similarly induced mast cell degranulation. Anti-RANTES antibody blocked OLP lesional T cell supernatant-induced mast cell degranulation. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to show that OLP lesional T cells produce and secrete RANTES which triggers human mast cell degranulation. Degranulating mast cells release TNF-alpha which upregulates OLP lesional T cell RANTES secretion. Such a cyclical mechanism may underlie disease chronicity and future therapies may include blocking RANTES or TNF-alpha activity in OLP.","['Zhao, Z Z', 'Sugerman, P B', 'Zhou, X J', 'Walsh, L J', 'Savage, N W']","['Zhao ZZ', 'Sugerman PB', 'Zhou XJ', 'Walsh LJ', 'Savage NW']","['School of Dentistry, The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,Oral Dis,Oral diseases,9508565,,"['Antibodies', 'Cell Degranulation/immunology/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Chemokine CCL5/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histamine Release/immunology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Lichen Planus, Oral/immunology/*pathology', 'Mast Cells/immunology/*physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Statistics, Nonparametric', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/*physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology', 'Up-Regulation']",2001/09/29 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/09/29 10:00'],"['2001/09/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/29 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oral Dis. 2001 Jul;7(4):246-51.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Chemokine CCL5)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Associations with leukemia and other malignancies, however, were largely ascribed to tissue-culture contamination, which is now recognized as a significant potential problem in molecular biology circles. A few epidemiological studies, however, continue to raise concern over such a linkage. As well, in vitro data have demonstrated the potential for some mycoplasmas to induce karyotypic changes and malignant transformation during chronic tissue-culture infestation. As cellular and molecular mechanisms for such transformation become studied, a resurgence of interest in this area is inevitable. A role for mycoplasmas in malignancy of any sort is conjectural, but there remains a need to continue with focussed epidemiological and laboratory investigations.","['Cimolai, N']",['Cimolai N'],"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. ncimolai@cw.bc.ca']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Canada,Can J Microbiol,Canadian journal of microbiology,0372707,IM,"['Animals', 'Cricetinae', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Mycoplasma/*pathogenicity', 'Mycoplasma Infections/*complications', 'Neoplasms/*etiology']",2001/09/29 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2001/09/29 10:00'],"['2001/09/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/29 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Can J Microbiol. 2001 Aug;47(8):691-7.,,80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Persistent Ph-negative progenitors co-exist with leukemic cells, both in the marrow and blood of patients, in the early chronic phase of the disease. Despite accumulating knowledge of hemopoiesis and the disease process, CML remains incurable with conventional chemotherapy.

Vital progenitor cells from human bone marrow and blood have a large, bright, unstructured nucleus with a large nucleolus and a narrow rim of cytoplasm (nuclear/cytoplasmic volume ratio = 0.7). Their nuclei are 6-14 micrometer in diameter and double their volume within 8 h. Many (70%) move at a mean speed of 2 micrometer/min, and many (30%) multiply with alpha-2alpha mitoses, generating progenitor cell families. Various disturbances during the course of mitosis lead to the formation of polyploid cells, thereby yielding the megakaryocytic cell line. Some of the progenitor cells undergo asymmetric alpha-alphan mitoses: One of the two initially identical daughter cells remains a progenitor cell in the morphological sense, whereas the other daughter cell - depending on the size of its mother cell - matures in the same culture medium to form a granulocytopoietic, monocytopoietic or erythrocytopoietic cell line. - In acute myeloid leukemias (AML), the blasts and their nuclei are slightly larger than the corresponding progenitor cells and move faster (5 micrometer/min). Symmetric alpha-2alpha mitoses permit unlimited multiplication of the leukemic blasts if contact with cytotoxic lymphocytes does not render them apoptotic. This results in more stromal cells than normal. Granulocytopenia, monocytopenia, and anemia occur due to the genetic impairment of signaling control for asymmetric alpha-alphan mitoses, and thrombocytopenia occurs due to the reduction in polyploidization.","['Boll, I T']",['Boll IT'],"['II.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 29 patients with relapsed (n =17) or refractory (n =12) AML were treated with the Mito-FLAG protocol consisting of mitoxantrone (7 mg/m(2), days 1/3/5), fludarabine (15mg/m(2), every 12 h, days 1-5), cytarabine (Ara-C) as bolus infusion (1000 mg/m(2) over 1 h, every 12 h, days 1-5) (n =15) or as continuous infusion (100-150 mg/m(2) over 24 h, days 1-5) (n =14), and G-CSF (5 mgr;g/ kg/day, day 0 until a neutrophile count of 0.5 x10(9)/l). RESULTS: 17 patients (59%) and 1 patient (3%) achieved complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR), respectively; thus the overall response rate was 62%. Following Mito-FLAG, 5 patients with CR underwent high-dose therapy (HDT) with allogeneic (n = 2) or autologous (n = 3) stem cell transplantation (SCT). With a median follow-up of 28 (range 6-54) months, 4 transplanted patients are alive in CR (n = 2) or in relapse (n = 2). The median duration of event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was 3.2 and 6.8 months, and probabilities of EFS and OS after 1 year were 14 and 34%, respectively. The 1-year rates for EFS and OS in this group were 18 and 53%, respectively. Median duration of WHO grade 4 granulocytopenia and thrombocytopenia was 20 and 23 days, respectively. Nonhematological side effects were moderate, predominantly reaching WHO grades 1-2. Neutropenic fever was seen in 85% of courses, with a median duration of 4 (1-38) days. Four patients (14%) suffered an early death because of aplasia (n = 2), pneumonia (n =1) or progressive AML (1 nonresponding patient). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the Mito-FLAG protocol is feasible and can be safely performed with both schedules of Ara-C. In this study the regimens have shown high efficacy and acceptable toxicity in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. We currently examine the importance of bolus versus continuous infusion of Ara-C as part of the Mito-FLAG regimen in a prospective randomized multicenter trial.","['Hanel, M', 'Friedrichsen, K', 'Hanel, A', 'Herbst, R', 'Morgner, A', 'Neser, S', 'Nicklisch, M', 'Teich, M', 'Ehninger, G', 'Fiedler, F']","['Hanel M', 'Friedrichsen K', 'Hanel A', 'Herbst R', 'Morgner A', 'Neser S', 'Nicklisch M', 'Teich M', 'Ehninger G', 'Fiedler F']","['Abteilung Hamatologie, Klinik fur Innere Medizin III/Kuchwald, Klinikum Chemnitz gGmbH, Chemnitz.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Pilot Projects', '*Salvage Therapy', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives']",2001/09/28 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/28 10:00'],"['2001/09/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['55107 [pii]', '10.1159/000055107 [doi]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 2001 Aug;24(4):356-60. doi: 10.1159/000055107.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

METHOD: Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or bioassays were used to assess the concentrations of leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), tumour necrosis factor, interleukin 11, gamma interferon, progesterone and oestradiol in follicular fluids from preovulatory follicles collected after ovarian stimulation from 15 PCOS patients, 15 infertile control patients with regular cycles, and 8 oocyte donors. RESULTS: LIF and progesterone concentrations were significantly lower in the follicular fluid of PCOS patients (LIF median: 265 pg/ml) compared with controls (LIF median: 816 pg/ml); LIF and progesterone follicular fluid concentrations were correlated (r = 0.720, P = 0.0001). The LH/FSH ratio was negatively correlated with LIF concentrations (r = - 0.714, P = 0.0075). Although the PCOS and control patients did not differ significantly in age, ovarian reserve or IVF indication, the implantation rate was significantly lower among the women with PCOS (IR = 9 versus 21%, P = < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The specific cytokine profile of the PCOS patients is probably related to the lower implantation rate since follicular fluid LIF appears to function as an embryotrophic agent.","['Ledee-Bataille, N', 'Lapree-Delage, G', 'Taupin, J L', 'Dubanchet, S', 'Taieb, J', 'Moreau, J F', 'Chaouat, G']","['Ledee-Bataille N', 'Lapree-Delage G', 'Taupin JL', 'Dubanchet S', 'Taieb J', 'Moreau JF', 'Chaouat G']","['Service de Gynecologie-Obstetrique et Medecine de la Reproduction, Hopital Antoine Beclere, 157 Rue de la Porte de Trivaux, 92140 Clamart, France.

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our surgical experience with pulmonary resection for aspergilloma in 30 patients. Of the 20 patients with complex aspergilloma complicating healed tuberculosis (group 1), 14 were male and six were female with an average age of 54 years (SD 7). The indication for surgery was recurrent haemoptysis in all and there were 17 lobectomies, two pneumonectomies and one bilateral lobectomy. There were ten patients with acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia (group 2), six male and four female with an average age of 26 years (SD 4). Twelve lesions required lobectomy in eight and wedge excision in four. RESULTS: In group 1 there was one post-operative death (5%), in a patient with massive haemoptysis and completely destroyed lungs with bilateral upper lobe aspergilloma secondary to pneumonia. Morbidity accounted for 25% (five patients), two required re-exploration for bleeding, two had prolonged air leak more than 7 days and one developed empyema. The later was treated with drainage and rib resection. One patient had recurrence of haemoptysis during the follow up period (mean 42 months). In group 2 there was no mortality or morbidity and six patients proceeded to bone marrow transplantation with no complication or recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection for pulmonary aspergilloma in selected patients provides the best chance of cure. Pulmonary resection for post-tuberculous complex aspergilloma is associated with higher morbidity than resection for immuno-compromised patients.","['Al-Kattan, K', 'Ashour, M', 'Hajjar, W', 'Salah El Din, M', 'Fouda, M', 'Al Bakry, A']","['Al-Kattan K', 'Ashour M', 'Hajjar W', 'Salah El Din M', 'Fouda M', 'Al Bakry A']","['King Khalid University Hospital, P.O.

Once infected, cattle remain virus carriers for life and start to show a serological reaction within a few weeks after infection. Eradication and control of the disease is based on early diagnostic and segregation of the carriers. The agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID) test has been the serological test of choice for routine diagnosis of serum samples. Nevertheless, in more recent years, the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has replaced the AGID for large scale testing. Although Argentina has over 60 million cattle population, no nationwide studies have been conducted yet to determine the prevalence of the infection. To estimate the rate of BLV infection in dairy cattle in Argentina, a survey for specific antibodies in >10,000 serum samples from animals over 18 months old, belonging to 363 different herds from the largest dairy production areas of the country, was carried out in our laboratory, along 1999. For this purpose, we developed an ELISA to detect serum antibodies against the BLV virus. The cut-off of the ELISA was established over 339 serum samples, using polymerase chain reaction and southern blot (PCR-SB) as confirmatory test. The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA was of 97.2 and 97.5%, respectively, while the local official AGID test showed a sensitivity of 79.7% and specificity of 99.0%. To know the seroprevalence of BLV on dairy herds, and also the incidence of the infection within the herd, the serological survey was based on individual serum samples. The results show that the prevalence of infected individuals is of 32.85%, while the percentage of infected herds, harboring one or more infected animals, is of 84%. These results indicate a medium level of seropositive animals when taken individually, but a high prevalence of infected farms, which has been notoriously increased in the last 15 years as shown when compared with previous data from particular geographic areas, indicating that BLV constitutes a serious sanitary problem for dairy producers in Argentina. They also indicate the poor sensitivity of the official AGID test used in the country.","['Trono, K G', 'Perez-Filgueira, D M', 'Duffy, S', 'Borca, M V', 'Carrillo, C']","['Trono KG', 'Perez-Filgueira DM', 'Duffy S', 'Borca MV', 'Carrillo C']","['Instituto de Virologia, C.I.C.V.yA.

However, few of their substrates are known to have physiological significance in the apoptotic process. We focused our screening for caspase substrates on cytoskeletal proteins. We found that an actin binding protein, filamin, was cleaved from 280 kDa to 170, 150, and 120 kDa major N-terminal fragments, and 135, 120, and 110 kDa major C-terminal fragments when apoptosis was induced by etoposide in both the human monoblastic leukemia cell line U937, and the human T lymphoblastic cell line Jurkat. The cleavage of filamin was blocked by a cell permeable inhibitor of caspase-3-like protease, Ac-DEVD-cho, but not by an inhibitor of caspase-1-like protease, Ac-YVAD-cho. These results suggest that filamin is cleaved by a caspase-3-like protease. To examine whether caspase-3 cleaves filamin in vitro, we prepared a recombinant active form of caspase-3 directly using a Pichia pastoris overexpression system. When we applied recombinant active caspase-3 to the cell lysate of U937 and Jurkat cells, filamin was cleaved into the same fragments seen in apoptosis-induced cells in vivo. Platelet filamin was also cleaved directly from 280 kDa to 170, 150, and 120 kDa N-terminal fragments, and the cleavage pattern was the same as observed in apoptotic human cells in vivo. These results suggest that filamin is an in vivo substrate of caspase-3.","['Umeda, T', 'Kouchi, Z', 'Kawahara, H', 'Tomioka, S', 'Sasagawa, N', 'Maeda, T', 'Sorimachi, H', 'Ishiura, S', 'Suzuki, K']","['Umeda T', 'Kouchi Z', 'Kawahara H', 'Tomioka S', 'Sasagawa N', 'Maeda T', 'Sorimachi H', 'Ishiura S', 'Suzuki K']","['Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, The University of Tokyo, Yayoi, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0032, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Biochem,Journal of biochemistry,0376600,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Contractile Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Filamins', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Microfilament Proteins/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Pichia/genetics', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'U937 Cells']",2001/09/28 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2001/09/28 10:00'],"['2001/09/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a003016 [doi]'],ppublish,J Biochem. 2001 Oct;130(4):535-42. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.jbchem.a003016.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Contractile Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Filamins)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (acetyl-aspartyl-glutamyl-valyl-aspartal)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of a clinical 225Ac/213Bi generator and the preparation of a 213Bi radiolabeled antibody for radioimmunotherapy of leukemia have been reported. The 225Ac decay scheme is complex; therefore a thorough understanding of the impact of both the parent 225Ac and its daughters on radiolabeling, purification, and quantification is necessary for optimal use of the generator system. This paper reports: (i) unique new methods to measure 221Fr, 213Bi, and 209Pb, the prominent daughters of 225Ac; and (ii) a quantitative evaluation of 225Ac/213Bi generator breakthrough and the radionuclidic purity of 213Bi labeled radiopharmaceutical dose formulations. A quantitative multi-dimensional proportional scanning method was employed to distinguish and measure specific daughter radionuclides. This method combines thin layer chromatography in two perpendicular directions with attenuated collimation as a function of time for data collection and analysis. Francium-221 and 213Bi eluted differentially from the generator, and 221Fr contributed minimally to unchelated 213Bi in the reaction and final products. Lead-209 was present in the reaction solution, but not strongly bound by the chelating moiety either (i) under the 213Bi labeling reaction conditions or (ii) following chelated 213Bi decay. As a consequence of incorporating several new procedures to the operation of the generator, 225Ac breakthrough in the final product was further reduced and represented a trivial contaminant in the final drug formulations.","['Ma, D', 'McDevitt, M R', 'Finn, R D', 'Scheinberg, D A']","['Ma D', 'McDevitt MR', 'Finn RD', 'Scheinberg DA']","['Department of Pharmacology and Molecular Therapeutics, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Appl Radiat Isot,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",9306253,IM,"['Actinium/*isolation & purification/therapeutic use', 'Bismuth/*isolation & purification', 'Francium/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Lead Radioisotopes/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Radiochemistry/methods', 'Radioimmunotherapy', 'Radioisotopes/*isolation & purification', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/*isolation & purification/therapeutic use']",2001/09/28 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/28 10:00'],"['2001/09/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0969804301000628 [pii]', '10.1016/s0969-8043(01)00062-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Appl Radiat Isot. 2001 Nov;55(5):667-78. doi: 10.1016/s0969-8043(01)00062-8.,"['0 (Lead Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '15TEQ7D2QF (Francium)', 'NIK1K0956U (Actinium)', 'U015TT5I8H (Bismuth)']",,"['P01CA33049/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA55349/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, somatic hypermutations are considered to be a hallmark of GC B cells and their descendants. Pre-GC B cells(precursor B cells, immature B cells, naive B cells and CD5+ B cells) carry no somatic hypermutations, whereas GC B cells and post-GC B cells(memory B cells and plasma cells) express somatic hypermutations. This phenomenon is useful in identifying the cellular origin of various B-cell neoplasms. Precursor B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma, and most B-CLL originate from pre-GC B cells, and follicular lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and myeloma from GC B cells or post-GC B cells. Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin's disease and most classical types of Hodgkin's disease are derived from GC B cells.

We have earlier reported the extraction of avicins, a family of triterpenoid saponins obtained from the Australian desert tree Acacia victoriae (Leguminosae: Mimosoideae) that inhibit tumor cell growth and induce apoptosis, in part, by perturbing mitochondrial function. These saponins have also been found to prevent chemical-induced carcinogenesis in mice. This study examines the effect of a triterpene mixture (F094) and a single molecular species (avicin G) isolated from the mixture on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced activation of nuclear transcription factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in Jurkat cells (human T cell leukemia). Both F094 and avicin G were found to be potent inhibitors of TNF-induced NF-kappaB. Treatment of Jurkat cells with avicin G resulted in a much slower accumulation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB into the nucleus whereas the degradation of IkappaBalpha was unaffected. Avicin G also impaired the binding of NF-kappaB to DNA in in vitro binding assays. Treatment of cells with DTT totally reversed the avicin G-induced inhibition of NF-kappaB activity, suggesting that sulfhydryl groups critical for NF-kappaB activation were being affected. Avicin G treatment resulted in decreased expression of NF-kappaB-regulated proteins such as inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX-2). Thus, the avicins may prove important for reducing both oxidative and nitrosative cellular stress and thereby suppressing the development of malignancies and related diseases.","['Haridas, V', 'Arntzen, C J', 'Gutterman, J U']","['Haridas V', 'Arntzen CJ', 'Gutterman JU']","['Department of Molecular Therapeutics, University of Texas M.

These results suggest that the transcriptional regulation of bbc3 contributes to the transduction of diverse cell death and survival signals.","['Han, J', 'Flemington, C', 'Houghton, A B', 'Gu, Z', 'Zambetti, G P', 'Lutz, R J', 'Zhu, L', 'Chittenden, T']","['Han J', 'Flemington C', 'Houghton AB', 'Gu Z', 'Zambetti GP', 'Lutz RJ', 'Zhu L', 'Chittenden T']","['ImmunoGen, Inc., 128 Sidney Street, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Consensus Sequence', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/physiology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Genes, p53', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proteins/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism']",2001/09/27 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/27 10:00'],"['2001/09/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.201208798 [doi]', '98/20/11318 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Sep 25;98(20):11318-23. doi: 10.1073/pnas.201208798.,"['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BBC3 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,"['R01 CA063230/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA63230/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['GENBANK/AF411827', 'GENBANK/U89287']",,PMC58727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, previous monitoring methods for ara-CTP were insufficiently sensitive. Here, using our new sensitive method, we evaluated the ara-CTP pharmacokinetics in relation to the therapeutic response in 11 acute myelogenous leukemia patients who received a 2-h infusion of BHAC (70 mg / m(2)) in combination remission induction therapy. ara-CTP could be monitored at levels under 1 mM. BHAC maintained effective levels of plasma ara-C and intracellular ara-CTP for a longer time, even compared with historical values of high-dose ara-C. The area under the concentration-time curve of ara-CTP was significantly greater in the patients with complete remission than in the patients without response. This greater amount of ara-CTP was attributed to the higher ara-CTP concentrations achieved in the responding patients. There was no apparent difference of plasma ara-C pharmacokinetics between the two groups. Thus, for the first time, the ara-CTP pharmacokinetics was evaluated in relation to the therapeutic effect of BHAC, and the importance of ara-CTP was proven.

In contrast to t(14;18)(q32;q21) affecting the 3' region of BCL2, 5'-BCL2 can fuse to not only the heavy chain gene (IGH), but also two light chain gene (IGL) loci. We report here cloning and sequencing of a total of eleven 5'-BCL2 / IGs junctional areas of B-cell tumors, which were amplified by long-distance polymerase chain reaction-based assays. The breakpoints on 5'-BCL2 were distributed from 378 to 2312 bp upstream of the translational initiation site and, reflecting the alteration of regulatory sequences of BCL2, 5'-BCL2 / IGs-positive cells showed markedly higher levels of BCL2 expression than those of t(14;18)-positive cells. In contrast, the breakpoints on the IGs were variable. Two 5'-BCL2 / IGH and two 5'-BCL2 / IGLkappa junctions occurred 5' of the joining (J) segments, suggesting operation of an erroneous variable (V) / diversity (D) / J and V / J rearrangement mechanism. However, two other 5'-BCL2 / IGH junctions affected switch regions, and the kappa-deleting element, which is located 24 kb downstream of the constant region of IGLkappa, followed the 5'-BCL2 in another case. One 5'-BCL2 / IGLkappa and two 5'-BCL2 / IGLlambda junctions involved intronic regions where the normal recombination process does not occur. In the remaining one case, the 5'-BCL2 fused 3' of a Vlambda gene that was upstream of another Vlambda / Jlambda complex carrying a non-producing configuration, indicating that the receptor editing mechanism was likely involved in this rearrangement. Our study revealed heterogeneous anatomy of the 5'-BCL2 / IGs fusion gene leading to transcriptional activation of BCL2, and suggested that the mechanisms underlying the formation of this particular oncogene / IGs recombination are not identical to those of t(14;18).","['Yonetani, N', 'Ueda, C', 'Akasaka, T', 'Nishikori, M', 'Uchiyama, T', 'Ohno, H']","['Yonetani N', 'Ueda C', 'Akasaka T', 'Nishikori M', 'Uchiyama T', 'Ohno H']","['First Division, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8507, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosome Breakage', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18/*genetics/ultrastructure', 'DNA Nucleotidyltransferases/metabolism', 'Exons/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/genetics', 'Introns/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'VDJ Recombinases']",2001/09/27 10:00,2002/02/22 10:01,['2001/09/27 10:00'],"['2001/09/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/22 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01183.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2001 Sep;92(9):933-40. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01183.x.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (DNA Nucleotidyltransferases)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (VDJ Recombinases)']",,,,,,,,PMC5926849,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CLL incidence is estimated from tumor registry reports based on tissue pathology and cancer treatment data. Tumor registry data may underestimate the incidence of CLL substantially because CLL can be diagnosed by flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood cells, and the majority of patients do not require treatment at the time of diagnosis. METHODS: To test the hypothesis that CLL has a higher incidence than estimated from tumor registry data, the authors compared the actual and reported incidence of CLL for a 10-year interval at the Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System (CAVHS). The accuracy of surveillance methods for new diagnoses of CLL was confirmed by reviewing the lymphocyte counts in 45,009 CAVHS patients over a 4-year period. RESULTS: The tumor registry correctly reported 58 of 93 patients with CLL (62.4%) who were diagnosed between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 1999. The tumor registry correctly reported 100% of patients with CLL diagnosed between 1990-1991 but reported only 34.5% of patients with CLL diagnosed between 1998-1999. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of CLL in the CAVHS was 37.6% higher than estimated from tumor registry data due to an increase in the use of peripheral blood immunophenotype as the only diagnostic test for CLL over the time period of the study. These data suggest that the true incidence of CLL may be substantially higher than estimated from tumor registry data.","['Zent, C S', 'Kyasa, M J', 'Evans, R', 'Schichman, S A']","['Zent CS', 'Kyasa MJ', 'Evans R', 'Schichman SA']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Departments of Medicine and Pathology, Central Arkansas Veterans Healthcare System and University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas 72205, USA. zentclives@uams.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/classification/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Population Surveillance', '*Registries', 'United States/epidemiology']",2001/09/26 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0142(20010901)92:5<1325::AID-CNCR1454>3.0.CO;2-E [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010901)92:5<1325::aid-cncr1454>3.0.co;2-e [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Sep 1;92(5):1325-30. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010901)92:5<1325::aid-cncr1454>3.0.co;2-e.,,,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Data in this review came from the published literature and the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center's acute leukemia database. RESULTS: Outcome following standard therapy of AML is so variable that is best to speak of a range of outcomes determined by various prognostic factors. Therapy can (and usually does) fail because of treatment-induced mortality or (more usually) resistance to therapy. Performance status and age are the principal predictors of early death, whereas cytogenetics, a history of abnormal blood counts, and MDR1 expression are predictors of resistance. Using this information, physicians can categorize patients into those in whom 1) standard therapy is indicated, 2) either standard or investigational therapy is appropriate, and 3) investigational therapy is indicated. The majority of even newly diagnosed patients belong to Group 3. The availability of allogeneic or autologous transplantation does not alter this conclusion. Investigational therapies have been developed that are directed against the CD33 surface antigen, the multidrug-resistant MDR1 protein, and other targets. Because of the number of new therapies clinical research in AML should emphasize pilot trials rather than traditionally large Phase III studies. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients with newly diagnosed AML should be offered investigational regimens.","['Estey, E H']",['Estey EH'],"['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas M. D.

To address the role of p53 during erythroleukemogenesis, spi-1 transgenic mice (spi-1-Tg) which develop erythroleukemia were bred with p53-deficient mice. Three classes of spi-1 transgenic mice differing in their p53 functional status (p53(+/+), p53(+/-) and p53(-/-)) were generated. These mice developed a unique pattern of erythroleukemia. In wild-type p53 spi-1-Tg mice, none of the primary erythroleukemic spleen cells displayed autonomous growth in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, in p53(+/-) spi-1-Tg mice, erythroleukemic cells gave rise to growth factor-independent cell lines and generated tumors in vivo. Malignancy was associated with loss of the wild-type p53 allele. The p53(-/-) spi-1-Tg mice developed erythroleukemia with a total incidence and a reduced latency compared to the two other genotypes. Unexpectedly, 50% of p53(-/-) spi-1-Tg erythroleukemic spleens generated cell lines that were strictly dependent upon erythropoietin (Epo) for proliferation, whereas the remainder proliferated independently of cytokines. Moreover, only 70% of these spleen cells were tumorigenic. These findings indicate that p53 germ-line deletion did not confer malignancy to spi-1-transgenic proerythroblasts. Moreover Epo independence and tumorigenicity appear as separable phenotypic characteristics revealing that the spi-1-Tg proerythroblasts progress towards malignancy through multiple oncogenic events.","['Scolan, E L', 'Wendling, F', 'Barnache, S', 'Denis, N', 'Tulliez, M', 'Vainchenker, W', 'Moreau-Gachelin, F']","['Scolan EL', 'Wendling F', 'Barnache S', 'Denis N', 'Tulliez M', 'Vainchenker W', 'Moreau-Gachelin F']","[""Inserm U528, Institut Curie, 26 rue d'Ulm, 75005 Paris, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Blood Cells/cytology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Disease Progression', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Genes, p53', 'Germ-Line Mutation', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Spleen/cytology/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*physiology']",2001/09/26 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2001/05/29 00:00 [revised]', '2001/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204708 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Sep 6;20(39):5484-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204708.,"['0 (Cdkn1a protein, mouse)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p21)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (proto-oncogene protein Spi-1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In murine WEHI3B acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, proviral integration leads to the expression of both HoxB8 and Interleukin (IL-3). Enforced expression of HoxB8 blocks differentiation of factor-dependent myeloid progenitors, while IL-3 co-expression induces autocrine proliferation and overt leukemogenicity. Previously, we demonstrated that HoxB8 binds DNA cooperatively with members of the Pbx family of transcription factors, and that HoxB8 makes contact with the Pbx homeodomain through a hexameric sequence designated the Pbx-interaction motif (PIM). E2a-Pbx1, an oncogenic derivative of Pbx1, both retains its ability to heterodimerize with Hox proteins and arrest myeloid differentiation. This observation prompts the question of whether E2a-Pbx1 and Hox oncoproteins use endogenous Hox and Pbx proteins, respectively, to target a common set of cellular genes. Here, we use four different models of neutrophil and macrophage differentiation to determine whether HoxB8 needs to bind DNA or Pbx cofactors in order to arrest myeloid differentiation. The ability of HoxB8 to bind DNA or to bind Pbx was essential (1) to block differentiation of factor-dependent myeloid progenitors from primary marrow; (2) to block IL-6-induced monocytic differentiation of M1-AML cells; and (3) to block granulocytic differentiation of GM-CSF-dependent ECoM-G cells. However, while DNA-binding was required, the HoxB8 Pbx-interaction motif was unnecessary for preventing macrophage differentiation of ECoM-M cells. We conclude that HoxB8 prevents differentiation by directly influencing cellular gene expression, and that the genetic context within a cell dictates whether the effect of HoxB8 is dependent on a physical interaction with Pbx proteins.","['Knoepfler, P S', 'Sykes, D B', 'Pasillas, M', 'Kamps, M P']","['Knoepfler PS', 'Sykes DB', 'Pasillas M', 'Kamps MP']","['Department of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N., Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/*cytology/metabolism', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/09/26 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2001/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2001/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204710 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Sep 6;20(39):5440-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204710.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (HOXB8 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Hoxb8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Pbx2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,['CA56876/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent reports have described the transduction of CD34+ cells via retrovirus- and lentivirus-based gene transfer vectors and subsequent differentiation into functional DC. Since there is significant apprehension regarding the clinical uses of HIV-based vectors, in this report, we compare a murine leukemia virus (MLV)- and a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-based bicistronic vector for gene transfer into human CD34+ cells and subsequent differentiation into mature DC. Each vector expressed both EGFP and the dominant selectable marker DHFR(L22Y) allowing for the enrichment of marked cells in the presence of the antifolate drug trimetrexate (TMTX). Both MLV-based and HIV-based vectors efficiently transduced cytokine mobilized human peripheral blood CD34+ cells. However, in vitro expansion and differentiation in the presence of GM-CSF, TNF-alpha, Flt-3L, SCF and IL-4 resulted in a reduction in the percentage of DC expressing the transgene. Selection with TMTX during differentiation increased the percentage of marked DC, resulting in up to 79% (MLV vector) and up to 94% (lentivirus-vector) transduced cells expressing EGFP without loss of DC phenotype. Thus, MLV-based vectors and in vitro selection of transduced human DC show great promise for immunotherapy protocols.","['Evans, J T', 'Cravens, P', 'Gatlin, J', 'Kelly, P F', 'Lipsky, P E', 'Garcia, J V']","['Evans JT', 'Cravens P', 'Gatlin J', 'Kelly PF', 'Lipsky PE', 'Garcia JV']","['Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, TX 75390-9113, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['Adult', '*Antigens, CD34', 'CD3 Complex', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Separation', 'Dendritic Cells/*virology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors/*administration & dosage', 'HIV/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",2001/09/26 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/03/23 00:00 [received]', '2001/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301530 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2001 Sep;8(18):1427-35. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301530.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (CD3 Complex)']",,"['5T32CA09082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-39416/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-82055/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Only low numbers of CD45RO memory T-cells, with a restricted TCR-repertoire, are present in the first 6 months post-SCT. The consequence is an increased risk of viral infections and possibly of leukemia relapse. The latter complication can be prevented by enhancing the anti-leukemic immune reactivity shortly after SCT. Different technical approaches were presented, the majority of them still being in the pre-clinical phase. NK-cell reactivity based on KIR-epitope mismatches between donor and recipient are promising for AML- and CML-, not for ALL-patients. The ALL-blasts may be killed by an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, using anti-CD19 antibodies, as was shown to be effective in vitro. Also the generation of leukemia-specific CTL's, making use of differences in minor histocompatibility antigens between donor and recipient, is now operational and may be a highly effective approach in a number of leukemic graft recipients.","['Vossen, J M', 'Handgretinger, R']","['Vossen JM', 'Handgretinger R']","['Department of Haemato-Oncology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Congress'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Child', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/*therapy', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia/prevention & control', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Secondary Prevention']",2001/09/26 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703170 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Aug;28 Suppl 1:S14-5. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703170.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This occurred in a 36-year-old woman who received an allogeneic BMT for acute myeloid leukaemia in relapse. At 15 months after BMT, recipient haematopietic and leukaemic cells were found in the bone marrow, which disappeared on withdrawal of immunosuppression. However, severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) necessitated the continuation of immunosuppression, leading to the occurrence of PTLD in the liver and lung 12 months afterwards. Fluorescence in situ hybridisation showed that the neoplastic cells were of recipient origin. Although the PTLD also responded completely to withdrawal of immunosuppression, the patient finally died from the complications of GVHD. This case of late onset PTLD post-BMT showed features similar to those in solid organ transplantation, in that the tumour was of recipient origin and responded well to the withdrawal of immunosuppression. Of further interest is that recipient lymphoid regeneration had accompanied autologous haematopoietic regeneration and become a target for subsequent neoplastic transformation.","['Au, W Y', 'Lie, A K', 'Lee, C K', 'Ma, S K', 'Wan, T S', 'Shek, T W', 'Liang, R', 'Kwong, Y L']","['Au WY', 'Lie AK', 'Lee CK', 'Ma SK', 'Wan TS', 'Shek TW', 'Liang R', 'Kwong YL']","['Department of Medicine, Queen Mary Hospital, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/mortality', '*Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/09/26 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2001/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703144 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Aug;28(4):417-9. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703144.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At 5 years, recipients of maternal hematopoietic cells had a significantly higher overall survival than patients receiving paternal grafts (60% vs 32%, P = 0.006). Although no significant difference was observed in the occurrence of severe acute GVHD (grade > or =III) and the relapse of malignant diseases between two groups, the probability of non-relapse treatment-related mortality was significantly lower after maternal donor transplants. Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that parental donor type was the only factor significantly associated with overall survival. In conclusion, our analysis indicates superior survival of maternally donated recipients in hematopoietic stem-cell transplantations from biological parents.

Patients were classified into three groups (obese, non-obese, underweight) using body mass index (BMI = kg/m(2)); for each group we analyzed transplant-related toxicity and mortality, overall survival and disease-free survival (OS/DFS). In spite of the relatively small number of patients, in our results high BMI appears a predictive factor for an increase of treatment-related toxicity and mortality. Moreover, 30 (55%) patients are currently alive in continuous CR, and after a median follow-up of 76.5 months (range 14-137) statistically significant differences in OS and DFS were detected between obese and non-obese groups (P = 0.012 and 0.021, respectively).

Prior ex vivo expansion of aliquots of transplanted cord blood (CB) units is being investigated as a procedure to increase engraftment potential, but results are difficult to evaluate due to a lack of markers for assessing the contribution of expanded cells. We transplanted five patients, infusing the best available CB unit and cells from a second donor simultaneously. In two patients, these cells were obtained from another frozen CB unit by CD34(+)positive selection and culture expansion; the other three patients received uncultured highly purified haploidentical CD34(+) cells. The first two patients had DNA from the culture expanded CB cells detected only for a few days around day +11 when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) was >200/microl; thereafter and when the ANC was <500/microl, only donor DNA from the uncultured CB was detected. For the other three patients, DNA analysis showed early and transient granulocyte engraftment of haploidentical cells, progressively replaced by the CB-derived granulocytes. We concluded that: (1) simultaneous infusion of lymphocyte-depleted HLA highly mismatched haematopoietic progenitor cells has not produced unfavourable effects for CBT; (2) the double transplant model is suitable for evaluating the engraftment potential of ex vivocultured CB cells in the clinical setting; (3) the culture conditions used did not result in early recovery of ANC; and (4) co-transplantation of purified uncultured HLA haploidentical CD34(+) cells may reduce the time of neutropenia following CBT.","['Fernandez, M N', 'Regidor, C', 'Cabrera, R', 'Garcia-Marco, J', 'Briz, M', 'Fores, R', 'Sanjuan, I', 'McWhinnie, A', 'Querol, S', 'Garcia, J', 'Madrigal, A']","['Fernandez MN', 'Regidor C', 'Cabrera R', 'Garcia-Marco J', 'Briz M', 'Fores R', 'Sanjuan I', 'McWhinnie A', 'Querol S', 'Garcia J', 'Madrigal A']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Clinica Puerta de Hierro, Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Fetal Blood/*cytology', 'Graft Rejection/*genetics/immunology', 'Haplotypes/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/*cytology/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Family', 'Polymorphism, Genetic/*genetics', 'Transplantation Chimera/genetics']",2001/09/26 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2000/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2001/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703143 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Aug;28(4):355-63. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703143.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ICOS binds to a newly identified ligand on antigen presenting cells different from the CD152 ligands CD80 and CD86. We used soluble ICOSIg and a newly developed murine anti-human ICOS ligand (ICOSL) monoclonal antibody to further characterize the ICOSL during ontogeny of antigen presenting cells. In a previous study, we found that ICOSL is expressed on monocytes, dendritic cells, and B cells. To define when ICOSL is first expressed on myeloid antigen presenting cells, we examined ICOSL expression on CD34(+) cells in bone marrow. We found that CD34(bright) cells regardless of their myeloid commitment were ICOSL(-), whereas ICOSL was first expressed when CD34 expression diminished and the myeloid marker CD33 appeared. However, acute myeloid leukemia cells were ICOSL-negative, whereas among B-cell malignancies only some cases of the most mature tumors such as prolymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia were positive. Next, we investigated purified CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells that did not constitutively express ICOSL but were induced to express ICOSL within 12 h after granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor/tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) stimulation. Interestingly, ICOSL was induced prior to CD80/CD86 induction on CD34(+) cells so that ICOSL was expressed in the absence of CD80/CD86. This suggests that ICOSL is an early differentiation marker along the monocytic/dendritic maturation pathway. Induction of ICOSL was dependent on TNF-alpha and was regulated via NF-kappa B as revealed by use of inhibitors specific for I kappa B alpha phosphorylation such as BAY 11-7082 and BAY 11-7085. The antigen presenting capacity of TNF-alpha stimulated CD34(+) cells was strongly inhibited by ICOSIg fusion proteins or by NF-kappa B inhibition. Thus, TNF-alpha-induced ICOSL expression seemed to be functionally important for the costimulatory capacity of CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor cells.","['Richter, G', 'Hayden-Ledbetter, M', 'Irgang, M', 'Ledbetter, J A', 'Westermann, J', 'Korner, I', 'Daemen, K', 'Clark, E A', 'Aicher, A', 'Pezzutto, A']","['Richter G', 'Hayden-Ledbetter M', 'Irgang M', 'Ledbetter JA', 'Westermann J', 'Korner I', 'Daemen K', 'Clark EA', 'Aicher A', 'Pezzutto A']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, Robert-Rossle-Klinik, Charite, Humboldt University, Lindenberger Weg 80, 13125 Berlin, Germany. guenther.richter@medizin.uni-halle.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Primers', 'Dendritic Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*physiology', 'U937 Cells']",2001/09/26 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M108509200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)37353-3 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Dec 7;276(49):45686-93. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M108509200.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dominant negative JNK1 (APF), in which the phosphorylation sites Thr-Pro-Tyr were changed to Ala-Pro-Phe, was overexpressed in U937 cells. Cell viability and DNA fragmentation were analysed by the erythrosin-B dye exclusion test and by agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. Expression of activated caspase-9, phosphorylated JNK1, JNK2, p38 and HSP27 was examined by Western blotting. JNK1 kinase assay was also performed using c-Jun as a substrate. RESULTS: Loss of viability, activated cleavage form of caspase-9 and DNA fragmentation were rapid in U937 cells after 44 degrees C hyperthermia, while overexpression of dominant negative JNK1 interfered with phosphorylation or activation of JNK1 without affecting that of JNK2 or p38/SAPK, and apparently delayed or reduced cleavage and activation of caspase-9, DNA fragmentation and cell death. Heat-induced phosphorylation of HSP27, observed in parental U937 cells, was suppressed and only slightly detectable in jnk1 mutant cells. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged phosphorylation or activation of JNK1 was considered important for heat-induced apoptosis and JNK1 may control the process possibly through phosphorylation of HSP27 and caspase-9 activation in U937 cells.","['Enomoto, A', 'Suzuki, N', 'Liu, C', 'Kang, Y', 'Zhu, J', 'Serizawa, S', 'Matsumoto, Y', 'Morita, A', 'Ito, M', 'Hosoi, Y']","['Enomoto A', 'Suzuki N', 'Liu C', 'Kang Y', 'Zhu J', 'Serizawa S', 'Matsumoto Y', 'Morita A', 'Ito M', 'Hosoi Y']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku Toyko 113-0033, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int J Radiat Biol,International journal of radiation biology,8809243,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Base Sequence', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Precursors/metabolism', 'HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins', '*Heat-Shock Proteins', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'U937 Cells']",2001/09/26 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/09553000110062512 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol. 2001 Aug;77(8):867-74. doi: 10.1080/09553000110062512.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSPB1 protein, human)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the absence of IL-11, decidualization is markedly retarded and implantation fails. IL-11 acts via a heterodimeric receptor composed of a ligand-specific receptor alpha chain (IL-11R alpha) and the signalling moiety gp130. This study reports the cloning of genes encoding rat IL-11 and IL-11R alpha. RNase protection was used to demonstrate that expression of IL-11 is upregulated in the rat uterus at the initiation of implantation at 5.5 days after mating. Expression of the genes encoding the two receptor components, IL11Ra and gp130, did not change throughout the peri-implantation period. In situ hybridization studies revealed that, as in mice, expression of IL-11 was high in the primary decidual zone at the time of the attachment reaction, whereas IL11Ra was expressed throughout primary and secondary decidua. Conservation of the temporal and spatial expression of IL-11 and IL-11R alpha in the uterus of the mouse and rat during the peri-implantation period will facilitate future studies investigating the role of IL-11 in fertility.","['Li, R', 'Hartley, L', 'Robb, L']","['Li R', 'Hartley L', 'Robb L']","['The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and the Cooperative Research Centre for Cellular Growth Factors, PO Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria 3050, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Decidua/metabolism', '*Embryo Implantation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization/methods', 'Interleukin-11/*genetics', 'Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Mice', 'Molecular Chaperones/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Morpholines/analysis', '*Proteins', 'Rats', 'Rats, Wistar', 'Receptors, Interleukin/*genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-11', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Uterus/*metabolism']",2001/09/26 10:00,2002/06/26 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1530/rep.0.1220593 [doi]'],ppublish,Reproduction. 2001 Oct;122(4):593-600. doi: 10.1530/rep.0.1220593.,"['0 (IL11RA protein, human)', '0 (Il11ra1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Il11ra1 protein, rat)', '0 (Il11ra2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-11 Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Molecular Chaperones)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-11)', '42013-48-9 (2-phenyl-5,5-dimethyltetrahydro-1,4-oxazine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A major cause of oxidative stress appears to be the high rate of reactive oxygen species generation associated with the retention of excess residual cytoplasm in the sperm midpiece. Other possible causes include the redox cycling of xenobiotics, and antioxidant depletion or apoptosis. Oxidative stress induces peroxidative damage in the sperm plasma membrane and DNA damage in both the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Nuclear DNA damage in the germ line of the father may be associated with pathology in the offspring, including childhood cancer and infertility. Gene deletions on the non-recombining region of the Y chromosome account for the infertility observed in about 15% of patients with azoospermia and 5-10% of subjects with severe oligozoospermia. The Y chromosome is particularly susceptible to gene deletions because of the inability of the haploid genome to deploy recombination repair in retrieving lost genetic information. Aberrant recombination, defective chromatin packaging, abortive apoptosis and oxidative stress may all be involved in the aetiology of DNA damage in the germ line. The factors responsible for Y chromosome deletions in spermatozoa remain unresolved but may be one facet of a central reproductive problem: controlling the amount of oxidative stress experienced by germ cells during their differentiation and maturation in the male reproductive tract.","['Aitken, R J', 'Krausz, C']","['Aitken RJ', 'Krausz C']","['School of Biological and Chemical Sciences, Centre for Life Sciences, University of Newcastle, University Drive, Callaghan, NSW 23008, Australia. jaitken@mail.newcastle.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Reproduction,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",100966036,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'DNA Replication', 'Evolution, Molecular', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Infertility, Male/*genetics', 'Male', 'Oncogenes', '*Oxidative Stress', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Spermatogenesis', 'Spermatozoa/physiology', '*Y Chromosome']",2001/09/26 10:00,2002/06/26 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/06/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1530/rep.0.1220497 [doi]'],ppublish,Reproduction. 2001 Oct;122(4):497-506. doi: 10.1530/rep.0.1220497.,,92,['281/B/Telethon/Italy'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was recently advanced that dysregulation of the apoptotic process can lead to pathophysiological changes which result in either degenerative diseases or cancer. As the apoptotic potential of Tax is still debated, we addressed this question by testing the susceptibility of Tax(+) and Tax(-) murine fibroblasts to apoptosis under conditions of growth factor withdrawal or treatment with TNFalpha, which trigger apoptosis through different pathways, i.e., mitochondrial and receptor-mediated pathways, respectively. Results showed that Tax-expressing cells are protected from apoptotic death induced by serum deprivation but are sensitive to TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that Tax expression has different effects on cell death, depending on the apoptotic stimulus used. Analysis of the mechanism(s) involved in the resistance to serum depletion-induced apoptosis indicated that Tax(+) cells do not undergo release of cytochrome c from the mitochondrial intermembrane space or redistribution of Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria, two phenomena critical to the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.","['Saggioro, D', 'Barp, S', 'Chieco-Bianchi, L']","['Saggioro D', 'Barp S', 'Chieco-Bianchi L']","['Department of Oncology and Surgical Sciences-Oncology Section, IST, Viral and Molecular Oncology Section, University of Padova, Via Gattamelata 64, Padua, 35128, Italy. d.saggioro@unipd.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,IM,"['Animals', '*Apoptosis', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Fibroblasts/*metabolism', 'Gene Products, tax/*biosynthesis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Time Factors', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2001/09/26 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/excr.2001.5310 [doi]', 'S0014-4827(01)95310-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 2001 Oct 1;269(2):245-55. doi: 10.1006/excr.2001.5310.,"['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To survive in such a hostile habitat, it is crucial to develop strategies to exclude toxic substances from the cell and to acquire tolerance. Cells remove metalloids from the cytosol either by active efflux or by sequestration in an internal organelle. Controlling the influx appears to be another way of maintaining a low intracellular metalloid content. Inside the cell, the metalloid can be reduced to a form that is recognised by the expulsion system(s). In addition, metalloid complexation and compartmentalisation contributes to enhanced cellular tolerance. Finally, the presence of metalloids activates transcription of various cellular defence genes. Metalloid-containing drugs are currently used to treat protozoan infections and promyelocytic leukaemia. Since metalloid resistance hampers efficient treatment, interest in identifying the mechanisms involved in tolerance acquisition has arisen. The possibility of using genetic approaches has made the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae a compelling model system to investigate the basis of metalloid tolerance at a molecular level. This review describes the recent progress made in elucidating the mechanisms involved in metalloid transport and tolerance in yeast and other organisms.","['Tamas, M J', 'Wysocki, R']","['Tamas MJ', 'Wysocki R']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Biology/Microbiology, Goteburg University, Sweden. markus.tamas@gmm.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Genet,Current genetics,8004904,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimony/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Arsenic/*pharmacokinetics/*toxicity', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Drug Resistance, Bacterial', 'Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Drug Tolerance', 'Escherichia coli/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression', 'Glutathione', 'Humans', 'Leishmania/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Metalloproteins/metabolism', 'Metallothionein/metabolism', 'Nematoda/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Phytochelatins', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Symbiosis', 'Trypanosoma/drug effects/genetics/metabolism']",2001/09/26 10:00,2002/03/05 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002940100234 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Genet. 2001 Aug;40(1):2-12. doi: 10.1007/s002940100234.,"['0 (Metalloproteins)', '9038-94-2 (Metallothionein)', '98726-08-0 (Phytochelatins)', '9IT35J3UV3 (Antimony)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",102,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we propose a new approach to monitor the spatial and temporal aspects of tyrosine phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The method can be used to determine whether protein tyrosine phosphorylations and dephosphorylations occur in the cytosol or the nucleus and to ascertain whether such modifications are associated with nuclear traffic. Promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells are used as the experimental model. Biotinylated cytosolic proteins from donor cells are used to trace nuclear transport in permeabilized recipient cells. Thereafter, 2-D gel electrophoresis is applied to fractionate the cytosolic and nuclear proteins of the recipient cells, which are subsequently blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes are developed with streptavidin and then reprobed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The major advantages of the protocol are that it is simple to perform, and reproducible results are obtained by overlaying the patterns of biotinylated and/or tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Moreover, several hundred cytosolic and nuclear proteins can be analyzed in parallel. Thus, by comparing the 2-D gel electrophoresis maps of biotinylated and tyrosine-phosphor lated proteins, it is possible to determine the involvement of trafficking of the latter proteins in cell signaling.","['Kulyte, A', 'Navakauskiene, R', 'Treigyte, G', 'Gineitis, A', 'Magnusson, K E']","['Kulyte A', 'Navakauskiene R', 'Treigyte G', 'Gineitis A', 'Magnusson KE']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius, Lithuania. agnku@ihm.liu.se']",['eng'],"[""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Technical Report']",England,Biotechniques,BioTechniques,8306785,IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Biotinylation', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Cell Nucleus/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/chemistry/metabolism', 'Digitonin/pharmacology', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phosphotyrosine/analysis/*metabolism', 'Polyvinyls']",2001/09/26 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2001/09/26 10:00'],"['2001/09/26 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/26 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,"Biotechniques. 2001 Sep;31(3):510, 512-4, 517, passim.","['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Polyvinyls)', '21820-51-9 (Phosphotyrosine)', '24937-79-9 (polyvinylidene fluoride)', 'KOO5CM684H (Digitonin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SETTING: The study was conducted in one of the 22 United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG) centres. SAMPLE AND METHODS: Data were collected by means of a structured interview, employing an administered questionnaire. RESULTS: The majority of children had attended a dentist both prior to, and following diagnosis, though the regularity of such attendance was variable and the receipt of dental preventive advice inconsistent. Parents appeared to place a high level of importance on their children's dental care, with more than two-thirds expressing a preference for this to be provided within the Paediatric Oncology Unit. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to establish means by which regular dental attendance may be encouraged and facilitated in the difficult circumstances posed following diagnosis. All healthcare professionals need to be equipped to give clear, consistent oral health advice. This, together with appropriate preventive measures, should be incorporated in oral care protocols.

The full-length cDNA (4839 bp) encompassed the recently reported androgen-regulated prostatic cDNA PMEPA1, and so we refer to this gene as STAG1/PMEPA1. Two STAG1/PMEPA1 mRNA transcripts of approximately 2.7 and 5 kb, with identical coding regions but variant 3' untranslated regions, were predominantly expressed in normal prostate tissue and at lower levels in the ovary. The expression of this gene was upregulated in 87% of RCC samples and also was upregulated in stomach and rectal adenocarcinomas. In contrast, STAG1/PMEPA1 expression was barely detectable in leukemia and lymphoma samples. Analysis of expressed sequence tag databases showed that STAG1/PMEPA1 also was expressed in pancreatic, endometrial, and prostatic adenocarcinomas. The STAG1/PMEPA1 cDNA encodes a 287-amino-acid protein containing a putative transmembrane domain and motifs that suggest that it may bind src homology 3- and tryptophan tryptophan domain-containing proteins. This protein shows 67% identity to the protein encoded by the chromosome 18 open reading frame 1 gene. Translation of STAG1/PMEPA1 mRNA in vitro showed two products of 36 and 39 kDa, respectively, suggesting that translation may initiate at more than one site. Comparison to genomic clones showed that STAG1/PMEPA1 was located on chromosome 20q13 between microsatellite markers D20S183 and D20S173 and spanned four exons and three introns. The upregulation of this gene in several solid tumors indicated that it may play an important role in tumorigenesis.","['Rae, F K', 'Hooper, J D', 'Nicol, D L', 'Clements, J A']","['Rae FK', 'Hooper JD', 'Nicol DL', 'Clements JA']","['Centre for Molecular Biotechnology, School of Life Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Carcinoma, Renal Cell/*genetics/surgery', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 20/*genetics', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'Drosophila melanogaster/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*genetics/surgery', 'Membrane Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Up-Regulation']",2001/09/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/mc.1063 [pii]', '10.1002/mc.1063 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2001 Sep;32(1):44-53. doi: 10.1002/mc.1063.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (PMEPA1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"['GENBANK/AF305426', 'GENBANK/AF305616']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PROCEDURE: Using a computerized writing task, we have prospectively studied the processes necessary for the production of handwriting movements in 11 children (5-12 years old) during treatment for ALL.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Children treated for ALL drew slower, with longer pause durations and increased drawing pressure. Children were able to overcome the problems, except for a consistently increased drawing pressure. This increased drawing pressure may be an attempt of the children to obtain sufficient kinesthetic information and thus can be seen as an adequate adaptation mechanism in case of peripheral neuropathy due to the neurotoxic effects of vincristine. However, neurotoxic effects of other cytostatic drugs cannot be excluded.","['Reinders-Messelink, H A', 'Schoemaker, M M', 'Snijders, T A', 'Goeken, L N', 'Bokkerink, J P', 'Kamps, W A']","['Reinders-Messelink HA', 'Schoemaker MM', 'Snijders TA', 'Goeken LN', 'Bokkerink JP', 'Kamps WA']","[""Children's Cancer Center, University Hospital Groningen, 9700 RB Groningen, The Netherlands.

We review our institutional experience with timed sequential induction chemotherapy consisting of daunorubicin/Ara-C/-thioguanine (DAT) or idarubicin/Ara-C/-thioguanine (IAT) followed on day 14 by HDAC regardless of the degree of marrow aplasia for children with newly diagnosed AML. PROCEDURE: Children presenting with newly diagnosed AML were treated with induction chemotherapy consisting of idarubicin (12 mg/m/day on days 1-3 or daunorubicin at 45 mg/m(2)/day for the first five patients), Ara-C (100 mg/m(2)/day by continuous infusion on days 1-7), and thioguanine (100 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-7). HDAC (1 g/m(2)/dose every 12 hr for 10 doses) was administered beginning on day 14, regardless of the results of bone marrow examination. RESULTS: Thirteen children received timed sequential HDAC. Only one child received HDAC later than Day 18. Eleven of the children achieved a complete remission. All patients experienced grade 4 hematologic toxicity, and all had fever as well. There were 11 children with documented infections. Ten had grade 3 or 4 GI toxicity. One patient died of sepsis.

Most of these genes are only partially characterized and the functions of the vast majority are as yet unknown. It is likely that many genes that might be useful for diagnosis and/or prognostication of human malignancies have yet to be recognized. The advent of cDNA microarray technology now allows the efficient measurement of expression for almost every gene in the human genome in a single overnight hybridization experiment. This genomic scale approach has begun to reveal novel molecular-based sub-classes of tumours in breast carcinoma, colon carcinoma, lymphoma, leukaemia, and melanoma. In several instances, gene microarray analysis has already identified genes that appear to be useful for predicting clinical behaviour. This review discusses some recent findings using gene microarray technology and describes how this and related technologies are likely to contribute to the emergence of novel molecular classifications of human malignancies.","['Alizadeh, A A', 'Ross, D T', 'Perou, C M', 'van de Rijn, M']","['Alizadeh AA', 'Ross DT', 'Perou CM', 'van de Rijn M']","['Department of Biochemistry, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Pathol,The Journal of pathology,0204634,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'DNA Fingerprinting', '*Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Neoplasms/*classification/*genetics', '*Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis', 'Prognosis']",2001/09/25 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/09/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/path.889 [pii]', '10.1002/path.889 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pathol. 2001 Sep;195(1):41-52. doi: 10.1002/path.889.,['0 (Genetic Markers)'],31,,,"['Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using reporter gene assays, several investigators showed that EVI1 is a transcription repressor, and recently it was shown that EVI1 interacts with the co-repressor carboxyl-terminal binding protein 1 (CtBP1). Earlier, we showed that the inappropriate expression of EVI1 in murine hematopoietic precursor cells leads to their abnormal differentiation and to increased proliferation. Using biochemical assays, we have identified two groups of transcription co-regulators that associate with EVI1 presumably to regulate gene expression. One group of co-regulators includes the CtBP1 and histone deacetylase. The second group includes the two co-activators cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF), both of which have histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity. All of these proteins require separate regions of EVI1 for efficient interaction, and they divergently affect the ability of EVI1 to regulate gene transcription in reporter gene assays. Confocal microscopy analysis shows that in the majority of the cells, EVI1 is nuclear and diffused, whereas in about 10% of the cells EVI1 localizes in nuclear speckles. However, in the presence of the added exogenous co-repressors histone deacetylase or CtBP1, all of the nuclei have a diffuse EVI1 staining, and the proteins do not appear to reside together in obvious nuclear structures. In contrast, when CBP or P/CAF are added, defined speckled bodies appear in the nucleus. Analysis of the staining pattern indicates that EVI1 and CBP or EVI1 and P/CAF are contained within these structures. These nuclear structures are not observed when CBP is substituted with a point mutant HAT-inactive CBP with which EVI1 also physically interacts. Finally, we show that the interaction of EVI1 with either CBP or P/CAF leads to acetylation of EVI1. These results suggest that the assembly of EVI1 in nuclear speckles requires the intact HAT activity of the co-activators.","['Chakraborty, S', 'Senyuk, V', 'Sitailo, S', 'Chi, Y', 'Nucifora, G']","['Chakraborty S', 'Senyuk V', 'Sitailo S', 'Chi Y', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Pathology and The Cancer Center, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60607, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Acetyltransferases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'E1A-Associated p300 Protein', 'Epitopes', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Histone Acetyltransferases', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'MDS1 and EVI1 Complex Locus Protein', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Point Mutation', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Time Factors', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Up-Regulation', 'Zinc Fingers', 'p300-CBP Transcription Factors']",2001/09/25 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/09/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M106733200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)82698-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Nov 30;276(48):44936-43. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M106733200.

This study examined in murine models the effects of interleukin-7 (IL-7) given to young and middle-aged (9-month-old) recipients of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched or -mismatched allogeneic BMT. Although administration of IL-7 from day 0 to 14 after syngeneic BMT promoted lymphoid reconstitution, this regimen was ineffective after allogeneic BMT. However, IL-7 administration from day 14 (or 21) to 27 after allogeneic BMT accelerated restoration of the major lymphoid cell populations even in middle-aged recipients. This regimen significantly expanded donor-derived thymocytes and peripheral T cells, B-lineage cells in bone marrow and spleen, splenic natural killer (NK) cells, NK T cells, and monocytes and macrophages. Interestingly, although recipients treated with IL-7 had significant increases in CD4(+) and CD8(+) memory T-cell populations, increases in naive T cells were less profound. Most notable, however, were the observations that IL-7 treatment did not exacerbate graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in recipients of an MHC-matched BMT, and would ameliorate GVHD in recipients of a MHC-mismatched BMT. Nonetheless, graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity (measured against 32Dp210 leukemia) remained intact. Although activated and memory CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells normally express high levels of IL-7 receptor (IL-7R, CD127), activated and memory alloreactive donor-derived T cells from recipients of allogeneic BMT expressed little IL-7R. This might explain the failure of IL-7 administration to exacerbate GVHD. In conclusion, posttransplant IL-7 administration to recipients of an allogeneic BMT enhances lymphoid reconstitution without aggravating GVHD while preserving GVL.","['Alpdogan, O', 'Schmaltz, C', 'Muriglan, S J', 'Kappel, B J', 'Perales, M A', 'Rotolo, J A', 'Halm, J A', 'Rich, B E', 'van den Brink, M R']","['Alpdogan O', 'Schmaltz C', 'Muriglan SJ', 'Kappel BJ', 'Perales MA', 'Rotolo JA', 'Halm JA', 'Rich BE', 'van den Brink MR']","['Department of Medicine and Pediatrics, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects/immunology/*methods', 'Cytokines/drug effects', '*Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect', 'Immune System/cytology/*drug effects', 'Interleukin-7/*administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/cytology/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects/methods']",2001/09/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.7.2256 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)58771-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 1;98(7):2256-65. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.7.2256.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-7)']",,['P30 CA008748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells from patients with this disorder and cell lines established from this type of leukemia showed the presence of gelsolin but the absence of scinderin expression, 2 filamentous actin-severing proteins present in normal megakaryocytes and platelets. Vector-mediated expression of scinderin in the megakaryoblastic cell line MEG-01 induced a decrease in both F-actin and gelsolin. This was accompanied by increased Rac2 expression and by activation of the PAK/MEKK.SEK/JNK/c-jun, c-fos transduction pathway. The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway was also activated in these cells. Transduction pathway activation was followed by cell differentiation, polyploidization, maturation, and apoptosis with release of platelet-like particles. Particles expressed surface CD41a antigen (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa or fibrinogen receptor), had dense bodies, high-affinity serotonin transport, and circular array of microtubules. Treatment of particles with thrombin induced serotonin release and aggregation that was blocked by CD41a antibodies. PAC-1 antibodies also blocked aggregation. Exposure of cells to PD98059, a blocker of MEK, inhibited antigen CD41a expression, increases in cell volume, and number of protoplasmic extensions. Cell proliferation and cell ability to form tumors in nude mice were also inhibited by the expression of scinderin. MEG-01 cells expressing scinderin had the same fate in vivo as in culture. Thus, when injected into nude mice, they entered apoptosis and released platelet-like particles. The lack of scinderin expression in megakaryoblastic leukemia cells seems to be responsible for their inability to enter into differentiation and maturation pathways characteristic of their normal counterparts.","['Zunino, R', 'Li, Q', 'Rose, S D', 'Romero-Benitez, M M', 'Lejen, T', 'Brandan, N C', 'Trifaro, J M']","['Zunino R', 'Li Q', 'Rose SD', 'Romero-Benitez MM', 'Lejen T', 'Brandan NC', 'Trifaro JM']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Actins/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Cytoplasmic Vesicles/drug effects/metabolism', 'Gelsolin', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microfilament Proteins/genetics/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Polyploidy', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription Factors/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/09/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.7.2210 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)58766-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 1;98(7):2210-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.7.2210.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Gelsolin)', '0 (Microfilament Proteins)', '0 (Platelet Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (scinderin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under physiologic conditions other myeloid cells are virtually tryptase negative. However, tryptases are also expressed in several myeloid leukemia cell lines. In this study, serum total tryptase levels were determined in 150 patients with acute leukemias (de novo acute myeloid leukemia [AML], n = 108; secondary AML, n = 25; acute lymphoid leukemia [ALL], n = 17) by fluoroenzyme immunoassay. In healthy subjects (n = 30), tryptase levels ranged between 2.0 and 12.6 ng/mL. Elevated tryptase levels (> 15) were detected in 42 (39%) of 108 patients with de novo AML and in 11 (44%) of 25 patients with secondary AML. No elevated tryptase levels were found in patients with ALL. In de novo AML, elevated tryptase levels were frequently detected in patients with French-American-British classification M0 (6 of 9), M2 (9 of 14), M3 (4 of 6), and M4eo (7 of 7), and less frequently in M1 (7 of 20), M4 (6 of 26), M5 (2 of 18), M6 (0 of 5), or M7 (1 of 3). The highest tryptase levels were found in M4eo. Immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow sections with anti-tryptase antibody as well as immunoelectron microscopy revealed tryptase expression in the cytoplasm of myeloblasts. As assessed by Northern blotting and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, AML cells expressed alpha-tryptase messenger RNA (mRNA) but little or no beta-tryptase mRNA. In AML patients with elevated serum tryptase before chemotherapy, who entered complete remission, tryptase levels returned to normal or near normal values. Blast cell persistence or regrowth was associated with a persistently elevated level or recurrent increase of tryptase. Together, tryptase is expressed in myeloblasts in a group of AML and may serve as a useful disease-related marker.","['Sperr, W R', 'Jordan, J H', 'Baghestanian, M', 'Kiener, H P', 'Samorapoompichit, P', 'Semper, H', 'Hauswirth, A', 'Schernthaner, G H', 'Chott, A', 'Natter, S', 'Kraft, D', 'Valenta, R', 'Schwartz, L B', 'Geissler, K', 'Lechner, K', 'Valent, P']","['Sperr WR', 'Jordan JH', 'Baghestanian M', 'Kiener HP', 'Samorapoompichit P', 'Semper H', 'Hauswirth A', 'Schernthaner GH', 'Chott A', 'Natter S', 'Kraft D', 'Valenta R', 'Schwartz LB', 'Geissler K', 'Lechner K', 'Valent P']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, University of Vienna, Austria. wolfgang.r.sperr@univie.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers', 'Bone Marrow Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/metabolism', 'Microscopy, Immunoelectron', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/*enzymology/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*biosynthesis/blood/genetics', 'Tryptases']",2001/09/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.7.2200 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)58765-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 1;98(7):2200-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.7.2200.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",,"['AI20487/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AR45441/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study used a competitive repopulation assay in the dog model to evaluate oncoretroviral vectors carrying the envelope protein of the endogenous feline virus, RD114. CD34-enriched marrow cells were divided into equal aliquots and transduced with vectors produced by the RD114-pseudotype packaging cells FLYRD (LgGLSN and LNX) or by the gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV)-pseudotype packaging cells PG13 (LNY). A total of 5 dogs were studied. One dog died because of infection before sustained engraftment could be achieved, and monitoring was discontinued after 9 months in another animal that had very low overall gene-marking levels. The 3 remaining animals are alive with follow-ups at 11, 22, and 23 months. Analyses of gene marking frequencies in peripheral blood and marrow by polymerase chain reaction revealed no significant differences between the RD114 and GALV-pseudotype vectors. The LgGLSN vector also contained the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), enabling us to monitor proviral expression by flow cytometry. Up to 10% of peripheral blood cells expressed GFP shortly after transplantation and approximately 6% after the longest follow-up of 23 months. Flow cytometric analysis of hematopoietic subpopulations showed that most of the GFP-expressing cells were granulocytes, although GFP-positive lymphocytes and monocytes were also detected. In summary, these results show that RD114-pseudotype oncoretroviral vectors are able to transduce hematopoietic long-term repopulating cells and, thus, may be useful for human stem cell gene therapy.","['Goerner, M', 'Horn, P A', 'Peterson, L', 'Kurre, P', 'Storb, R', 'Rasko, J E', 'Kiem, H P']","['Goerner M', 'Horn PA', 'Peterson L', 'Kurre P', 'Storb R', 'Rasko JE', 'Kiem HP']","['Divisions of Clinical Research and Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Transport System ASC/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Blood Cells/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cats', 'Cell Lineage/*genetics', 'Dogs', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/genetics', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors/*standards', '*Graft Survival/genetics', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia Virus, Gibbon Ape/genetics', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods/standards']",2001/09/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.7.2065 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)58748-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 1;98(7):2065-70. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.7.2065.,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport System ASC)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,"['DK47754/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK56465/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is little doubt that allogeneic stem cell transplantation can eradicate the leukemia and that a graft-versus-leukemia effect makes a major contribution to this result; conversely, only a minority of patients are eligible for transplantation, which still carries an appreciable risk for death or protracted illness. For most patients, interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) prolongs life to some degree in comparison with hydroxyurea, but it is associated with considerable toxicity. The newly introduced tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI571 induces complete hematologic remission in almost all patients and is associated with a very high rate of cytogenetic response; its capacity to prolong life in comparison with IFN-alpha is not yet established. Here are reviewed some factors that predict survival after nontransplantation therapy and after allografting for CML in chronic phase. Two contrasting options are considered for managing the patient with newly diagnosed disease, and it can be concluded that, for now, allogeneic stem cell transplantation soon after diagnosis should continue to be offered as an option for selected patients. Further experience with the use of STI571 as a single agent or in combination with other antileukemic agents may alter the picture in the near future.","['Goldman, J M', 'Druker, B J']","['Goldman JM', 'Druker BJ']","['Imperial College School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom. jgoldman@ic.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Decision Making', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/mortality/*therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Prognosis', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/09/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.7.2039 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)58744-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Oct 1;98(7):2039-42. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.7.2039.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",,,,,,,['Blood. 2002 Apr 15;99(8):3070-1; author reply 3071.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of overexpression of the human EAT gene on light induced retinal cell apoptosis. METHODS: EAT transgenic mice incorporating the EF-1alpha promoter were utilised, and expression of human EAT was detected by RT-PCR. Light damage was induced by raising mice under constant illumination. Two groups of animals, EAT transgenic mice (n=14) and littermates (n=13), were examined by ERG testing and histopathology at regular time points up to 20 weeks of constant light stimulation. Electrophysiological and histopathological findings were evaluated by established systems of arbitrary scoring as scores 0-2 and scores 0-3, respectively. RESULTS: The mean score (SD) of ERG response was significantly lower in EAT transgenic mice (0.79 (0.89)) than in littermates (1.69 (0.48)) (p<0.01). Although the differences between the two survival curves did not reach statistical significance (p=0.1156), the estimated incidence of electrophysiological retinal damage was higher in EAT mice (0.0495/mouse/week; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.0347-0.0500) than in littermates (0. 0199/mouse/week; 95% CI 0.0035-0.0364). The mean scores (SD) for histopathological retinal degeneration were 2.31 (0.63) in littermates and 1.43 (1.22) in EAT transgenic mice (p=0.065). However, Kaplan-Meier curves for histopathological failure in two groups of mice showed that retinal photoreceptor cells were preserved significantly against constant light in the littermate compared with transgenic mice (p=0.0241). The estimated incidence of histopathological retinal damage was 0.0042/mouse/week in the littermates (95% CI 0-0.0120) and 0.0419/mouse/week in the EAT mice (95% CI 0.0286-0.0500). CONCLUSION: Retinal photoreceptor cell apoptosis under constant light stimulation is likely to be accelerated in transgenic retina overexpressing EAT.","['Shinoda, K', 'Nakamura, Y', 'Matsushita, K', 'Shimoda, K', 'Okita, H', 'Fukuma, M', 'Yamada, T', 'Ohde, H', 'Oguchi, Y', 'Hata, J', 'Umezawa, A']","['Shinoda K', 'Nakamura Y', 'Matsushita K', 'Shimoda K', 'Okita H', 'Fukuma M', 'Yamada T', 'Ohde H', 'Oguchi Y', 'Hata J', 'Umezawa A']","['Department of Ophthalmology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Ophthalmol,The British journal of ophthalmology,0421041,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Electroretinography/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Light/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', 'Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate/*pathology/radiation effects', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transcriptional Activation/*physiology']",2001/09/25 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/09/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bjo.85.10.1237 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Ophthalmol. 2001 Oct;85(10):1237-43. doi: 10.1136/bjo.85.10.1237.,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Mcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (eat-20 protein, C elegans)']",,,,,,,,PMC1723738,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Examination of presenting features and response to treatment in patients treated in two consecutive national trials, MRC UKALL X and XI. RESULTS: The proportion of children with DS was significantly higher in UKALL XI (1.9%) than UKALL X (0.9%). Children with DS tended to be under 10 years and to have the common ALL subtype. Cytogenetic analysis showed that favourable features, such as high hyperdiploidy and t(12;21) were less frequent but also that there was a lack of translocations associated with a poor prognosis. Children with DS showed no increase in risk of relapse at any site but their survival and event free survival were inferior to other children. These results were caused by an increased number of infective deaths during remission (11% compared to 2%). At five years overall survival was 73% in DS children compared with 82% in other children; event free survival was 53% compared to 63% in non-DS children. CONCLUSIONS: Entry of children with DS to national trials has increased and survival has improved. However they remain at risk of relapse and also of treatment related mortality. These findings emphasise the need for both intensive chemotherapy and optimal supportive care.","['Chessells, J M', 'Harrison, G', 'Richards, S M', 'Bailey, C C', 'Hill, F G', 'Gibson, B E', 'Hann, I M']","['Chessells JM', 'Harrison G', 'Richards SM', 'Bailey CC', 'Hill FG', 'Gibson BE', 'Hann IM']","['Molecular Haematology Unit, Camelia Botnar Laboratories, Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London WCIN 1EH, UK. j.chessells@ich.ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,IM,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Down Syndrome/*complications/genetics/mortality', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/therapeutic use', '*Patient Selection', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Survival Rate']",2001/09/25 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/09/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.85.4.321 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 2001 Oct;85(4):321-5. doi: 10.1136/adc.85.4.321.,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,PMC1718934,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To facilitate this process, a novel family of retroviral vectors, the pE vector family, has been generated. The retroviral sequences in the pE vectors have been taken from the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) vector pMFG, which has been shown to express cDNA inserts more consistently and at higher levels than earlier generations of MMLV vectors. These vectors contain four different internal ribosome entry site-selectable markers, allowing high-efficiency selection of transductants expressing the desired cDNA. The pE vectors have an episomal design to allow long-term production of high-titer virus without the need for subcloning the producer line. Using a strategy of combinatorial infection followed by combinatorial drug selection, we demonstrate that the pE vectors can be used to generate stable, polyclonal cell lines expressing at least three novel cDNAs in less than 2 weeks. The use of these vectors will thus dramatically accelerate the production of complex stable cell lines.","['Schaefer, B C', 'Mitchell, T C', 'Kappler, J W', 'Marrack, P']","['Schaefer BC', 'Mitchell TC', 'Kappler JW', 'Marrack P']","['National Jewish Medical and Research Center, Denver, Colorado 80206, USA. schaefer@njc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Anal Biochem,Analytical biochemistry,0370535,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques/*methods', 'Cell Line', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/physiology', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods']",2001/09/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/25 10:00'],"['2001/09/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/abio.2001.5327 [doi]', 'S0003-2697(01)95327-8 [pii]']",ppublish,Anal Biochem. 2001 Oct 1;297(1):86-93. doi: 10.1006/abio.2001.5327.,,,"['AI17134/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI18785/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI22295/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Reverse transcriptase is an essential retroviral enzyme that replicates the single-stranded RNA genome of the retrovirus producing a double-stranded DNA copy, which is subsequently integrated into the host's genome. We have introduced a single amino acid substitution in the connection domain of an N-terminally truncated MMLV RT (L435K) that significantly improves the solubility of the enzyme eliminating the need for nonionic detergents in buffering storage solutions. The substituted enzyme retains near wild-type polymerase activity.

In adult LIFR heterozygote (+/-) mice, the number of neural stem cells and their progeny in the forebrain subependyma and TH-immunoreactive neurons in the olfactory bulb were significantly reduced. Intraventricular infusion of CNTF into the adult mouse forebrain, in the absence or presence of epidermal growth factor (EGF), enhanced self-renewal of neural stem cells in vivo. Analyses of EGF-responsive neural stem cells proliferating in vitro found that CNTF inhibits lineage restriction of neural stem cells to glial progenitors, which in turn results in enhanced expansion of stem cell number. These results suggest that CNTFR/LIFR/gp130-mediated signaling supports the maintenance of forebrain neural stem cells, likely by suppressing restriction to a glial progenitor cell fate.","['Shimazaki, T', 'Shingo, T', 'Weiss, S']","['Shimazaki T', 'Shingo T', 'Weiss S']","['Genes & Development Research Group, Department of Cell Biology and Anatomy, University of Calgary Faculty of Medicine, Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2N 4N1.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,8102140,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/metabolism', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Heterozygote', 'Injections, Intraventricular', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Neuroglia/cytology/metabolism', 'Neurons/cytology/*metabolism', 'Olfactory Bulb/cytology/metabolism', 'Prosencephalon/cytology/*metabolism', 'Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Cytokine/deficiency/genetics', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/biosynthesis']",2001/09/22 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/22 10:00'],"['2001/09/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['21/19/7642 [pii]'],ppublish,J Neurosci. 2001 Oct 1;21(19):7642-53.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptor, Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)']",,,,,,,,PMC6762896,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that MM-1 bound to myc box II within the transactivation domain of c-Myc and repressed the E-box-dependent transcriptional activity of c-Myc. Here we report that MM-1 showed features of a tumor suppressor. In an EST data base search for cDNAs homologous to MM-1, we found a frequent substitution of amino acid 157 of MM-1, from alanine to arginine (A157R), and the substitution was observed more in tumor cells than in normal cells. A survey of the A157R mutation of MM-1 in 57 cultured cancer cells and 90 tissues from cancer patients showed that the A157R was present in about 50-60% of leukemia/lymphoma cells and in more than 75% of squamous cell carcinoma of tongue cancer. Although both the A157R and the wild-type MM-1 bound to c-Myc, only A157R lost the activities to repress both the E-box-dependent transcriptional activity of c-Myc and the myc/ras cooperative transforming activity in rat 3Y1 cells. Furthermore, the wild-type MM-1, but not A157R, arrested the growth of 3Y1 cells. The human MM-1 gene was mapped at chromosome 12q12-12q13, where many chromosome abnormalities in cancer cells have been reported. The results suggest that MM-1 is a novel candidate for a tumor suppressor that controls the transcriptional activity of c-Myc.","['Fujioka, Y', 'Taira, T', 'Maeda, Y', 'Tanaka, S', 'Nishihara, H', 'Iguchi-Ariga, S M', 'Nagashima, K', 'Ariga, H']","['Fujioka Y', 'Taira T', 'Maeda Y', 'Tanaka S', 'Nishihara H', 'Iguchi-Ariga SM', 'Nagashima K', 'Ariga H']","['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Department of Pathology, Graduate School of Medicine, College of Medical Technology, Hokkaido University, Kita-ku, Sapporo 060-8012, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acids/chemistry', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Exons', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/genetics/*metabolism', 'Luciferases/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Rats', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tongue Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/09/22 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/09/22 10:00'],"['2001/09/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M106127200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)82722-9 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Nov 30;276(48):45137-44. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M106127200.

Pbx1 contributions were investigated through characterization of Pbx1-deficient mice. Pbx1 mutants died at embryonic day 15/16 with severe hypoplasia or aplasia of multiple organs and widespread patterning defects of the axial and appendicular skeleton. An obligatory role for Pbx1 in limb axis patterning was apparent from malformations of proximal skeletal elements, but distal structures were unaffected. In addition to multiple rib and vertebral malformations, neural crest cell-derived skeletal structures of the second branchial arch were morphologically transformed into elements reminiscent of first arch-derived cartilages. Although the skeletal malformations did not phenocopy single or compound Hox gene defects, they were restricted to domains specified by Hox proteins bearing Pbx dimerization motifs and unaccompanied by alterations in Hox gene expression. In affected domains of limbs and ribs, chondrocyte proliferation was markedly diminished and there was a notable increase of hypertrophic chondrocytes, accompanied by premature ossification of bone. The pattern of expression of genes known to regulate chondrocyte differentiation was not perturbed in Pbx1-deficient cartilage at early days of embryonic skeletogenesis, however precocious expression of Col1a1, a marker of bone formation, was found. These studies demonstrate a role for Pbx1 in multiple developmental programs and reveal a novel function in co-ordinating the extent and/or timing of proliferation with terminal differentiation. This impacts on the rate of endochondral ossification and bone formation and suggests a mechanistic basis for most of the observed skeletal malformations.","['Selleri, L', 'Depew, M J', 'Jacobs, Y', 'Chanda, S K', 'Tsang, K Y', 'Cheah, K S', 'Rubenstein, J L', ""O'Gorman, S"", 'Cleary, M L']","['Selleri L', 'Depew MJ', 'Jacobs Y', 'Chanda SK', 'Tsang KY', 'Cheah KS', 'Rubenstein JL', ""O'Gorman S"", 'Cleary ML']","['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA. lselleri@cmgm.stanford.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', '*Body Patterning', 'Bone and Bones/abnormalities/*embryology', 'Branchial Region/embryology', 'Cartilage/abnormalities/*embryology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Chondrocytes/*cytology', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Genes, Homeobox', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Homozygote', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Morphogenesis', 'Osteogenesis', 'Phenotype', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",2001/09/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/22 10:00'],"['2001/09/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 2001 Sep;128(18):3543-57.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (pbx1 protein, human)']",,"['CA 42971/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 70704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 90735/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, the cytotoxic effect of 80 microT, 50 Hz magnetic fields on 3T3 cell proliferation was investigated using the neutral red test. Many chemicals are believed to cause damage because they interfere with basal or ""housekeeping"" cell functions. The basal cell functions are present in every cell. Non-specialized, actively dividing cells are suitable for measuring cytotoxic effects. Cytotoxic doses can be identified by exposing actively dividing cells in vitro and measuring growth inhibition caused by interference with these basal cell functions. 80 microT, 50 Hz magnetic fields caused no cytotoxicity: we were not able to demonstrate any interference with essential cell functions in the non-differentiated 3T3 cell line. Furthermore, the in vitro effects of ELF fields on murine haemopoietic and stromal stem cell proliferation were studied. Haemopoiesis is a continuous process, where mature blood cells are replaced by the proliferation and differentiation of more primitive progenitor and stem cells. Blood formation is tightly regulated by the stromal micro-environment. Exposure of murine bone marrow cells, from male and female mice, to 80 microT (50 Hz) magnetic fields showed a reduction in the proliferation and differentiation of the granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (CFU-GM) compared to non-exposed bone marrow cells. The results on the effect of the ELF-field on stromal stem cell proliferation (CFU-f) are somewhat equivocal at the moment. CFU-f from female mice showed a reduction while CFU-f from male mice were not decreased.","['Van Den Heuvel, R', 'Leppens, H', 'Nemethova, G', 'Verschaeve, L']","['Van Den Heuvel R', 'Leppens H', 'Nemethova G', 'Verschaeve L']","['Department of Environmental Toxicology, Boeretang 200, 2400 Mol, Belgium. rosette.vandenheuvel@vito.be']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicol In Vitro,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,8712158,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*radiation effects', 'Cell Count', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*radiation effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Stromal Cells/cytology/radiation effects']",2001/09/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/22 10:00'],"['2001/09/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0887-2333(01)00035-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0887-2333(01)00035-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicol In Vitro. 2001 Aug-Oct;15(4-5):351-5. doi: 10.1016/s0887-2333(01)00035-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a recent study we reported that 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(2) [1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(2)] like 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), is also converted into the same final product, calcitroic acid. This finding indicated that 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(2) also undergoes side chain cleavage between C-23 and C-24. As the side chain of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(2) when compared to the side chain of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), has a double bond between C-22 and C-23 and an extra methyl group at C-24 position, it opens the possibility for both (a) double bond reduction and (b) demethylation to occur during the metabolism of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(2). We undertook the present study to establish firmly the possibility of double bond reduction in the metabolism of vitamin D(2) related compounds. We compared the metabolism of 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-22-ene-vitamin D(3) [1alpha,25(OH)(2)-22-ene-D(3)], a synthetic vitamin D analog whose side chain differs from that of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) only through a single modification namely the presence of a double bond between C-22 and C-23. Metabolism studies were performed in the chronic myeloid leukemic cell line (RWLeu-4) and in the isolated perfused rat kidney. Our results indicate that both 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-22-ene-D(3) and 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) are converted into common metabolites namely, 1alpha,24(R),25-trihydroxyvitamin D(3) [1alpha,24(R),25(OH)(3)D(3)], 1alpha,25-dihydroxy-24-oxovitamin D(3) [1alpha,25(OH)(2)-24-oxo-D(3)], 1alpha,23(S),25-trihydroxy-24-oxovitamin D(3) and 1alpha,23-dihydroxy-24,25,26,27-tetranorvitamin D(3). This finding indicates that the double bond in the side chain of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-22-ene-D(3) is reduced during its metabolism. Along with the aforementioned metabolites, 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-22-ene-D(3) is also converted into two additional metabolites namely, 1alpha,24,25(OH)(3)-22-ene-D(3) and 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-24-oxo-22-ene-D(3). Furthermore, we did not observe direct conversion of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-22-ene-D(3) into 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3). These findings indicate that 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-22-ene-D(3) is first converted into 1alpha,24,25(OH)(3)-22-ene-D(3) and 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-24-oxo-22-ene-D(3). Then the double bonds in the side chains of 1alpha,24,25(OH)(3)-22-ene-D(3) and 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-24-oxo-22-ene-D(3) undergo reduction to form 1alpha,24(R),25(OH)(3)D(3) and 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-24-oxo-D(3), respectively. Thus, our study indicates that the double bond in 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-22-ene-D(3) is reduced during its metabolism. Furthermore, it appears that the double bond reduction occurs only during the second or the third step of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-22-ene-D(3) metabolism indicating that prior C-24 hydroxylation of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)-22-ene-D(3) is required for the double bond reduction to occur.","['Sunita Rao, D', 'Balkundi, D', 'Uskokovic, M R', 'Tserng, K', 'Clark, J W', 'Horst, R L', 'Satyanarayana Reddy, G']","['Sunita Rao D', 'Balkundi D', 'Uskokovic MR', 'Tserng K', 'Clark JW', 'Horst RL', 'Satyanarayana Reddy G']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Women and Infants' Hospital of Rhode Island, Brown University School of Medicine, 101 Dudley Street, Providence, RI 02905, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,9015483,IM,"['Animals', 'Cholecalciferol/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Ergocalciferols/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kidney/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/09/22 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/09/22 10:00'],"['2001/09/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0960076001000826 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-0760(01)00082-6 [doi]']",ppublish,J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol. 2001 Aug;78(2):167-76. doi: 10.1016/s0960-0760(01)00082-6.,"['0 (1,25-dihydroxy-22-ene-vitamin D3)', '0 (Ergocalciferols)', '1C6V77QF41 (Cholecalciferol)']",,['DK52488/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Duplication of the MLL gene (localized to 11q23) has been found on one chromosome 11 in patients with trisomy 11, detected by DNA techniques. We investigated copy number of MLL in seven patients with trisomy 11 to see if duplication could be assessed by the detection of two separate signals on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). If so, FISH could provide a quick easy screen of MLL status in routine referrals. The diagnostic bone marrow aspirate showed trisomy 11 in five adult patients with MDS/AML as part of a complex karyotype and in two children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as part of a hyperdiploid karyotype. Fluorescence in situ hybridization utilized the suspensions remaining after the cytogenetic harvest. Two FISH probes were used on the adult patients (MLL - Oncor and Vysis), and one (Vysis) for the two children with ALL. Analysis showed that the proximity of the two putative hybridization signals made it very difficult to unambiguously see two separate signals. The hybridisations (Oncor probe) were convincing of MLL duplication (namely two distinct signals) in only one patient, but this was not borne out with the other MLL probe (Vysis).

Putative tumor suppressor genes, CDKN2A (p16), p14(ARF) and CDKN2B (p15), were localized to 9p21. However, there have been reports that suggest that there may be other genes targeted for inactivation in the region. We have developed a method to search for transcribed sequences within large genomic regions. We tested our approach in a 100-kilobase region on 9p21, which is 40 kilobases telomeric to CDKN2A. The method, termed expressed sequence selection (ESS), resulted in the isolation of genomic fragments known to be from 9q21 that are homologous to transcribed sequences. One fragment was used to obtain a 1.2 kilobase cDNA. The sequence of the 5' half of the cDNA was almost identical to exons 3-5 of the MTAP gene, which maps to chromosome band 9p21. The 3' portion of the cDNA had sequence homology to the ALA gene, which maps to chromosome arm 9q. Using Northern blot analysis, the 1.2 Kb cDNA identified several widely expressed transcripts ranging from 1 Kb to 8.5 Kb and displayed a complex pattern of alternative splicing in which certain exons of the 1.2 Kb cDNA are excluded from some of the splice products. Using cancer tissue Northern blots, we could show that all of the transcripts are absent from a leukemia cell line and a lung cancer cell line (K562, A549) with homozygous, genomic deletions within chromosome band 9p21. In addition, the 7 Kb transcript is also absent from two additional tumor cell lines (Molt4, a leukemia derived cell line, and in G361, a melanoma derived cell line) with homozygous deletions. Further investigation will determine whether the difference in the expression pattern between the 7 Kb transcript compared with the other sized transcripts could be due to specific targeting for alteration in certain tumor types.","['Gursky, S', 'Olopade, O I', 'Rowley, J D']","['Gursky S', 'Olopade OI', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 5841 South Maryland Avenue, MC 2115, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"[""3' Untranslated Regions"", ""5' Untranslated Regions/genetics"", 'Alternative Splicing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/*genetics', 'DNA, Complementary/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Exons', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Physical Chromosome Mapping', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/genetics', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA/*methods', 'Sequence Deletion/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/09/22 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/09/22 10:00'],"['2001/09/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0165-4608(01)00444-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0165-4608(01)00444-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 2001 Sep;129(2):93-101. doi: 10.1016/s0165-4608(01)00444-7.,"[""0 (3' Untranslated Regions)"", ""0 (5' Untranslated Regions)"", '0 (DNA, Complementary)', 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)""]",,"['5-T32GMO7183-20/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['GENBANK/AF216650'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ASB proteins also contain the SOCS box and the ankyrin repeat sequence at the N-terminus, but do not have the SH2 domain. Although Socs genes are directly induced by several cytokines, no Asb gene inducers have been identified. In this study, we screened the specific genes expressed in the course of differentiation of HL-60 cells, and demonstrated that ASB-2, one of the ASB proteins, was rapidly induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Typical retinoid receptors (RARs) or retinoid X receptors (RXRs) binding element (RARE/RXRE) were presented in the promoter of the Asb-2 gene. We showed that RARalpha, one of the RARs, binds to the RARE/RXRE in the Asb-2 promoter. In addition, we demonstrated by luciferase reporter assay that this element was a functional RARE/RXRE.

It is in phase III trials for malignant melanoma, for which it has been awarded Fast Track status 1359044]. Genasense received Orphan Drug status in August 2000 [3782331. In September 2000, the company announced that pivotal phase III trials in multiple melanoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) would be underway by 2001 [382783]. By January 2001, trials in AML and CLL had been initiated 1396512]. As of February 2001, Genta was planning the initiation of two additional, registration quality trials. Pending positive results from these trials, launch of Genasense is anticipated in 2002 13984111. A phase III trial in patients with advanced multiple myeloma at 65 centers in the US, Canada and Great Britain began in February 2001. The trial will examine whether the addition of Genasense can improve response rates, response duration and quality of life compared with dexamethasone therapy alone 13989081. Genta Inc has been issued a patent (US-05831066) for Genasense 1283005]. The patent provides protection to Genta for the composition of Genasense and its analogs. Furthermore, Genta Inc has also been issued two new patents that cover a series of compounds containing new backbone constructions that enhance the antisense affinity of the drug to the target pre-RNA, while the other patent covers the methods for preparation of antisense oligonucleotides containing the new backbone structures 12896851. Genta has already licensed the rights for the use of Bd-2 as a target for antisense- and gene therapy-based treatments from The University of Pennsylvania. The licensing agreements with Chugai Pharmaceutical Co for worldwide marketing and profit sharing places Genta in a favorable position. In January 2001, Needham & Co expected Genasense to have a potential market of 47,700 malignant melanoma patients in the US. The analysts also expected potential patient market sizes of 50,000 (CLL), 21,000 (AML), 136,000 (non-small cell lung cancer; NSLCC) and 180,000 (prostate cancer) in the US. In addition, the analysts predicted that Genasense would be approved for melanoma in the second quarter of 2002, with approvals to follow for CLL (third quarter of 2002), AML (third quarter of 2002) and myeloma (fourth quarter of 2002) 1399251].","['Banerjee, D']",['Banerjee D'],"['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021, USA. banerjee@aol.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Curr Opin Investig Drugs,"Current opinion in investigational drugs (London, England : 2000)",100965718,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/metabolism/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thionucleotides/therapeutic use']",2001/09/22 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/22 10:00'],"['2001/09/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Curr Opin Investig Drugs. 2001 Apr;2(4):574-80.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '85J5ZP6YSL (oblimersen)']",60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fundamental principles of DIAAD rely on the induction of high zone tolerance to the ""wild type"" (normal) antigen. followed by immunization with the modified (diseased) antigen. Because chronic myelogenic leukemia (CML) cells are derived from a lineage closely related to MM, we immunized mice by contrasting a pool of MM cells with CML cells. Monoclonal antibody VAC69 reacted exclusively with MM cells, identifying a membrane molecule composed of a single-chain glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 78-120 kd. This antigen exhibited narrow tissue specificity and was not found on human cancers such as prostate, breast, or cervical carcinoma; leukemia; or lymphoma, nor was it seen on normal human peripheral lymphocytes or on Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines. By immunohistochemistry, mAb VAC69 showed no binding to antigens expressed on normal human ovary, breast, prostate, lung or colon tissue, nor did it bind to human breast or prostate cancer. Conversely, mAb VAC69 bound strongly to human MM, although showing only slight binding to histiocytes or inflamed cells in human lymph nodes and human tumors of the colon, lung, and ovary. Monoclonal antibody VAC69 also triggered cancer-specific cytotoxicity in vitro (in the presence of complement) as well as in vivo using a sever combined immunodeficiency model transplanted with human MM. Further studies showed the ability of mAb VAC69 to be specifically internalized by human MM cells, indicating its potential use for therapeutic intervention in MM by delivering drugs into cancer cells.","['Krueger, P', 'Nitz, C', 'Moore, J', 'Foster, R', 'Gelber, O', 'Gelber, C']","['Krueger P', 'Nitz C', 'Moore J', 'Foster R', 'Gelber O', 'Gelber C']","['Molecular Discoveries, LLC, New York, New York 10017, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunother,"Journal of immunotherapy (Hagerstown, Md. : 1997)",9706083,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Multiple Myeloma/*immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/09/22 10:00,2002/03/09 10:01,['2001/09/22 10:00'],"['2001/09/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/09 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00002371-200107000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunother. 2001 Jul-Aug;24(4):334-44. doi: 10.1097/00002371-200107000-00009.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This unique feature is the basis of various applications of ES cell technology such as in vitro models of mammalian development, germline transgenesis to make knockout mice, and a generic source for cell therapy in regenerative medicine. To achieve success in these applications, the pluripotency of ES cells has to be kept stable during long-term culture in vitro, leading to the necessity of determining the molecular basis for maintaining ES self-renewal. This paper summarizes the recent progress in this area, focusing mainly on the LIF signaling pathway and the transcription factor Oct-3/4.

To characterize protein alterations during the apoptosis-initiation phase and to understand the metabolic status at that time, we investigated the protein profiles in the apoptosis-initiation phase of APL cell line HL-60 by proteomic analysis. ATRA-withdrawal was conducted to demonstrate that there was committed initiation phase of apoptosis triggered by 10(-6) M ATRA at day 3. Only after that time point, ATRA-treated cells irreversibly went to apoptosis. Also at that time point, the positive regulators of apoptosis such as STAT3 increased at protein level, whereas negative regulators (Bcl-2 and p-STAT3) decreased. In addition, caspase-3 also increased after that time. Furthermore, comparative proteomic analysis was utilized to examine the protein expression profiles during the initiation stage of apoptosis. Our results showed 12 upregulated and 7 downregulated proteins experiencing twofold alteration, including key regulators of signal transduction such as G-proteins and nucleic receptors, proteins related with metabolism, oxidation and reduction, proteins associated with the nucleus and cytoskeleton-related proteins. Some of them could be positive modulators to trigger apoptosis, whereas others could contribute to intracellular defense against apoptosis induced by exogenous triggers. The results above suggest that there is a subtle balance between apoptosis and the intracellular defense against apoptosis. Once the balance is disturbed, cells would irreversibly initiate to undergo the execution of apoptosis.","['Wan, J', 'Wang, J', 'Cheng, H', 'Yu, Y', 'Xing, G', 'Oiu, Z', 'Qian, X', 'He, F']","['Wan J', 'Wang J', 'Cheng H', 'Yu Y', 'Xing G', 'Oiu Z', 'Qian X', 'He F']","['Department of Genomics and Proteomics, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Chinese National Human Genome Center at Beijing, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Electrophoresis,Electrophoresis,8204476,IM,"['Amino Acids/analysis', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Blotting, Western', 'DNA, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Enzymes/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Image Processing, Computer-Assisted', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Proteome', 'Sequence Analysis, Protein', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization', 'Subtraction Technique', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",2001/09/22 10:00,2002/04/09 10:01,['2001/09/22 10:00'],"['2001/09/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/09 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1522-2683(200108)22:14<3026::AID-ELPS3026>3.0.CO;2-8 [pii]', '10.1002/1522-2683(200108)22:14<3026::AID-ELPS3026>3.0.CO;2-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Electrophoresis. 2001 Aug;22(14):3026-37. doi: 10.1002/1522-2683(200108)22:14<3026::AID-ELPS3026>3.0.CO;2-8.,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteome)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The application of minimally invasive techniques in the setting of splenomegaly is less well defined and was previously considered a contraindication to the laparoscopic approach. The purpose of this prospective study of consecutive patients was to compare the outcomes of patients undergoing laparoscopic splenectomy for normal-sized spleens (150 g or less) versus those with clear evidence of splenomegaly (500 g or greater). One hundred forty-two patients met the inclusion criteria. The most common diagnosis in the normal-sized spleen group was idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (67 of 82, 82%). Malignant hematologic diseases (lymphoma and leukemia) were the most common diagnoses in the splenomegaly group (35 of 60, 58%). Mean operative times (127 vs 172 minutes) and estimated blood loss (123 vs 173 cm3) were lower for those patients with normal-sized spleens (P < 0.05). There were no statistical differences in conversion rates, lengths of stay, or complications between the two groups. We conclude that laparoscopic splenectomy is safe and effective in the setting of splenomegaly despite modest but statistically longer operative times and increased operative blood loss when compared with laparoscopic splenectomy for normal-sized spleens.","['Heniford, B T', 'Park, A', 'Walsh, R M', 'Kercher, K W', 'Matthews, B D', 'Frenette, G', 'Sing, R F']","['Heniford BT', 'Park A', 'Walsh RM', 'Kercher KW', 'Matthews BD', 'Frenette G', 'Sing RF']","['Department of Surgery and Medicine, Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, North Carolina 28232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am Surg,The American surgeon,0370522,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Loss, Surgical', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Laparoscopy', 'Leukemia/surgery', 'Lymphoma/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures', 'Organ Size', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prospective Studies', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/surgery', 'Spleen/anatomy & histology', '*Splenectomy', 'Splenomegaly/etiology/*surgery']",2001/09/22 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/09/22 10:00'],"['2001/09/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Am Surg. 2001 Sep;67(9):854-7; discussion 857-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report that the soluble ligand was released constitutively at low levels from leukocytes and at higher levels following cellular activation. Release from cells was blocked by addition of a metalloproteinase inhibitor which concomitantly caused the accumulation of 4-1BBL on the cell surface. In addition, we show that a soluble form of 4-1BBL was present at high levels in the sera of some patients with various hematological diseases, but only at low levels in healthy donors. Soluble 4-1BBL was active in that it competed with recombinant 4-1BBL for binding to the 4-1BB receptor and was able to costimulate IL-2 and IFN-gamma release from peripheral T cells. These results indicate that the release of soluble 4-1BBL from the cell surface is mediated by one or more sheddases and likely regulates 4-1BB-4-1BBL interactions between cells in vivo. Cleavage of 4-1BBL to an active soluble form would alter both proximal and distal cellular responses, including cell survival and costimulatory or inflammatory responses, that are mediated through the 4-1BB pathway. This, in turn, would likely alter disease progression or outcome.","['Salih, H R', 'Schmetzer, H M', 'Burke, C', 'Starling, G C', 'Dunn, R', 'Pelka-Fleischer, R', 'Nuessler, V', 'Kiener, P A']","['Salih HR', 'Schmetzer HM', 'Burke C', 'Starling GC', 'Dunn R', 'Pelka-Fleischer R', 'Nuessler V', 'Kiener PA']","['Department of Immunology, Inflammation, and Pulmonary Diseases, Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['4-1BB Ligand', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*blood', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Metalloendopeptidases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Protease Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/immunology/*metabolism/pharmacology']",2001/09/21 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/21 10:00'],"['2001/09/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.167.7.4059 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Oct 1;167(7):4059-66. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.167.7.4059.,"['0 (4-1BB Ligand)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Protease Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor)', '0 (Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'EC 3.4.24.- (Metalloendopeptidases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, using a constitutively active STAT5A (STAT5A1*6), we show that STAT5 induces macrophage differentiation of mouse leukemic M1 cells through a distinct mechanism, autocrine production of IL-6. The supernatant of STAT5A1*6-transduced cells contained sufficient concentrations of IL-6 to induce macrophage differentiation of parental M1 cells, and STAT3 was phosphorylated on their tyrosine residues in these cells. Treatment of the cells with anti-IL-6 blocking Abs profoundly inhibited the differentiation. We also found that the STAT5A1*6 transactivated the IL-6 promoter, which was mediated by the enhanced binding of NF-kappaB p65 (RelA) to the promoter region of IL-6. These findings indicate that STAT5A cooperates with Rel/NF-kappaB to induce production of IL-6, thereby inducing macrophage differentiation of M1 cells in an autocrine manner.

We studied here the effect of IL-10 on human monocytes stimulated with GM-CSF. Monocytes stimulated with GM-CSF alone survived and developed into macrophages. Monocytes cultured with GM-CSF plus IL-10, however, died through apoptosis. IL-10 decreased expression of bcl-2, bcl-x(L), and mcl-1- but not bax mRNA in monocytes stimulated with GM-CSF. IL-10 did not change the expression of mRNA of both GM-CSFR alpha-chain and beta-chain, but inhibited tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 in the monocytes. The inhibitory effect of IL-10 was restricted to treatment 48 h after stimulation with GM-CSF. Addition of IL-10 after that time induced neither apoptosis nor a decrease in expression of bcl-2, bcl-x(L), and mcl-1 mRNA. IL-10, however, inhibited LPS-induced TNF-alpha production even in these cells, indicating that the cells still possessed responsiveness to IL-10. Monocytes pretreated for >48 h with GM-CSF became resistant to GM-CSF withdrawal, and the cells could survive without GM-CSF. These results indicate that IL-10 selectively inhibits GM-CSF-dependent monocyte survival by inhibiting the signaling events induced by GM-CSF, but the timing of addition of IL-10 is critical, and IL-10 had to be added within 48 h after stimulation with GM-CSF to achieve the inhibitory effect. These results taken together with our previous results indicate that IL-10 plays a pivotal role in monocyte survival and development into macrophages in concert with M-CSF and GM-CSF.","['Hashimoto, S I', 'Komuro, I', 'Yamada, M', 'Akagawa, K S']","['Hashimoto SI', 'Komuro I', 'Yamada M', 'Akagawa KS']","['Department of Immunology, National Institutes of Health, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Macrophages/*immunology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Monocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/genetics', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/09/21 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/21 10:00'],"['2001/09/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.167.7.3619 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Oct 1;167(7):3619-25. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.167.7.3619.,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report that receptor phosphorylation also provides a stimulatory signal for CCR ligand 2 (CCL2) production. C3a stimulated degranulation in a basophilic leukemia RBL-2H3 cell expressing wild-type C3aR or a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (DeltaST-C3aR). In contrast, C3a caused CCL2 production only in C3aR but not DeltaST-C3aR cells. Furthermore, overexpression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 resulted in enhancement of both ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation and CCL2 production but inhibition of degranulation. Agonist activation of C3aR, but not DeltaST-C3aR, led to the translocation of green fluorescent protein tagged beta-arrestin 2 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane. These data demonstrate that receptor phosphorylation, which provides a turn off signal for degranulation, is essential for CCL2 production.","['Ahamed, J', 'Haribabu, B', 'Ali, H']","['Ahamed J', 'Haribabu B', 'Ali H']","['Department of Pathology, School of Dental Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, 4010 Locust Street, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', '*Cell Degranulation', 'Chemokine CCL2/*biosynthesis', 'Complement C3a/pharmacology', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/genetics/physiology', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2', 'Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', '*Membrane Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Phosphorylation', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Complement/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Adrenergic Receptor Kinases']",2001/09/21 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/21 10:00'],"['2001/09/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/21 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.167.7.3559 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Oct 1;167(7):3559-63. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.167.7.3559.,"['0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Complement)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (complement C3a receptor)', '80295-42-7 (Complement C3a)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (Grk2 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.15 (beta-Adrenergic Receptor Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.16 (G-Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinase 2)', 'EC 3.6.5.1 (Heterotrimeric GTP-Binding Proteins)']",,"['HL-54166/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-63372/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DNA binding studies also revealed the presence of three additional DNA factors in cutaneous T cell lymphoma cells that bound to the same sequences and could also be stimulated by interleukin-7 and interleukin-15. One of these novel factors was also present in the adult T cell leukemia cell line Jurkat and malignant T cells from the blood of Sezary syndrome patients, but not in normal peripheral blood lymphocytes.

However, it is clear that engraftment does not necessarily correlate with total CD34+ cell numbers in some patients. Consequently, there is increasing interest in evaluating the role of CD34+ subsets in haemopoietic recovery as a more accurate marker of harvest quality. We analysed the numbers of CD34+ cell subsets, namely Thy-1+, L-Selectin+ and CD38-, and correlated this with engraftment in 86 patients undergoing PBSCT. Adequate engraftment was defined as being a platelet count greater than 50 x 10(9)/l and a neutrophil count greater than 1.0 x 10(9)/l. CD34+L-Selectin+ provided the best prediction of engraftment rapidity, although the improvement over total CD34+ cell dose was minor. Only the dose of CD34+Thy-1+ cells transplanted correlated with durable engraftment.

In addition, membrane expression levels of complement inhibitory proteins CD55 and CD59 play a role in determining susceptibility to lysis. We have identified one t(14;18)-positive human B-cell non Hodgkin's lymphoma cell line (Karpas 422) that is resistant to rituximab and complement and used it for subsequent studies on the possible interaction between this novel therapeutic agent and established antineoplastic drugs. We have exposed Karpas to several chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin, idarubicin, cisplatin, taxol) for different time periods and subsequently exposed the cells to rituximab and human complement. The combination of these drugs with rituximab induced an additive cytotoxic effect. In contrast, exposure to fludarabine (1 microg/ml for 48-72 h) showed a synergistic effect, with cell lysis increasing from 10% to 20% using fludarabine or rituximab and complement alone to about 70% with both cytotoxic agents. Analysis of the mechanism for this synergistic effect showed that fludarabine downmodulates the membrane expression of CD55 (from 96% to 55% positive cells) without significantly altering CD20 levels. Northern analysis demonstrated that fludarabine induced a general downmodulation of steady state mRNA levels with no change in transcription rate detected in run-off assays. The study of the effect of fludarabine and rituximab in six freshly isolated B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) samples showed that, in most cases, fludarabine has an additive cytotoxic activity with rituximab and complement.

Occasionally, both diseases are present in the same patient, and this raises the question of clonal associations between the two neoplasms. We here report on two patients with concomitant B-CLL and MM. Clonal chromosomal abnormalities in both lymphocytic cells and plasma cells were studied by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a panel of 24 chromosome- and region-specific DNA probes. In the first patient, cytogenetics revealed 47, X, t(Y;22)(p11;q10), +12, dell4(q21q32). By FISH, +12 was present in lymphoid cells, but not in plasma cells. MM cells were characterized by multiple chromosomal gains (1, 11q23) and losses (5q, 10, 13q14, 15, 17p13, Y), which were all undetectable in lymphoid cells. The second patient, in whom no clonal abnormalities were obtained by conventional cytogenetic analysis, had lymphoid cells with loss of 8q24 by FISH. In contrast, evidence for a gain of 8q24 (consistent with amplification of c-myc) was obtained in 13% of plasma cells. Plasma cells were further characterized by gains of chromosomes 1, 3, 11, 18, and Y.

Hematopoiesis is a complex developmental system in which the hemopoietic stem cells (HSC) were experimentally shown to have been derived from a single multipotent stem cell. PGC, as well as HSC are regulated by a range of growth factors that control both proliferative and differentiative processes. Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a cytokine that regulates the differentiation and the totipotentional phenotype of PGC. Recently, other growth factors, such as stem cell factor (SCF), macrophage growth factor (MGF), and forskolin (FRKL) have been proposed as the possible in vivo and in vitro regulators for PGCs and HSCs. Induction of hematopoiesis in an embryonic germ cell derived from PGCs indicates that germ cells acquire the potentiality to differentiate toward hematopoietic cells. The coincidental presence of both PGCs and HSCs at the sites where early hemopoiesis is established, together with similar growth factor requirements support the hypothesis that PGCs may also be considered hemopoiesis initiating cells.","['Bianchi de Di Risio, C C', 'Argibay, P']","['Bianchi de Di Risio CC', 'Argibay P']","['Instituto de Ciencias Basicas y Medicina Experimental (ICBME), Hospital Italiano, Buenos Aires, Argentina. prebora@hitalba.edu.ar']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Argentina,Medicina (B Aires),Medicina,0204271,IM,"['Animals', 'Germ Cells/*physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Mice']",2001/09/21 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/09/21 10:00'],"['2001/09/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/21 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Medicina (B Aires). 2001;61(4):491-4.,,27,,,,Caracteristicas de las celulas primordiales germinales murinas y su relacion con la hemopoyesis.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we report a novel targeting approach wherein IgG-binding peptides were inserted into the Moloney murine leukemia virus (MuLV) envelope (env) protein. The modifications on the viral env included replacement of the entire receptor binding region of the viral env with protein A (or ZZ) domains. The truncated env incorporating IgG-binding motifs (known as proteins) provided the targeting function, while the co-expressed wild-type (WT) env protein enabled viral fusion and cell entry. An anti-human VEGF receptor (Flk-1/KDR) antibody served as a molecular bridge, directing the retroviral vector to the endothelial cell. Hence, the IgG-targeted vectors bound to the Flk-1/KDR antibody which in turn bound to VEGF receptors on Kaposi sarcoma, KSY1, endothelial cells. The net effect was increased viral fusion and infectivity of IgG-bound retroviral vectors when compared to non-targeted vectors bearing WT env alone.

This defect preconditions tumor cells to be less sensitive to inhibitors of growth factor receptors and/or signal transduction pathways that arrest normal cells, predominantly in G0/1. Strategies were proposed, therefore, to combine cytotoxic agents with such inhibitors in order to selectively arrest normal host cells in a relatively resistant part of the cycle and thereby protect them during chemotherapy with agents targeting proliferating cells. The present study was designed to explore whether inhibition of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), one of the pivotal kinases involved in signal transduction essential for cell proliferation can be considered in these strategies. Indeed, proliferation of phytohemagglutinin stimulated human lymphocytes was prevented at 5 microM concentration of LY294002 (LY), a PI3K inhibitor, whereas several-times higher (> or =20 microM) concentrations of LY were needed to affect proliferation of leukemic HL-60, Molt-4, or Jurkat cells. LY prevented the exit of lymphocytes from G0 concomitant with the suppression of induction of cyclins D2, D3 and E, and phosphorylation of pRb. G0/1 lymphocytes, that were initially stimulated in the absence of LY, were also inhibited from proliferating following exposure to LY. The arrest of lymphocytes by LY was reversible and, after its removal, the cells asynchronously re-entered the cell cycle. LY, at a concentration of 5-20 microM, protected lymphocytes from apoptosis induced by ara-C but offered no protection at all to Jurkat cells treated under identical conditions. The data suggest that inhibitors of PI3K such as LY may be considered in strategies designed to shield normal cells from the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy by transiently arresting them in the cycle. An additional advantage of LY was the suppression of the protein level and activity of PKB/Akt, a kinase that, through the phosphorylation of the proapoptotic molecule BAD, protects cells from apoptosis. Because this LY-induced suppression was stronger in Jurkat cells (>70%) than in lymphocytes (20%), the proapoptotic effects of PKB/Akt down-regulation appear to be selective towards tumor cells.","['Du, L', 'Smolewski, P', 'Bedner, E', 'Traganos, F', 'Darzynkiewicz, Z']","['Du L', 'Smolewski P', 'Bedner E', 'Traganos F', 'Darzynkiewicz Z']","['Brander Cancer Research Institute, New York Medical College, Hawthorne, NY 10532, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chromones/*pharmacology', 'Cyclins/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', '*Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/physiology', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2001/09/20 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/20 10:00'],"['2001/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3892/ijo.19.4.811 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 Oct;19(4):811-9. doi: 10.3892/ijo.19.4.811.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,"['R01 CA028704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA028704-24/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

STUDY DESIGN: Consecutive patients (n = 17) had 2 extensive NPAs (12 psychometric measures) after cessation of therapy. Test results were compared with those of both healthy control subjects and 28 previously treated children who received cranial irradiation. MRI findings were related to test scores. School levels were evaluated in the patients and their healthy siblings. RESULTS: Initial participation (n = 17) and availability of the study group after 8 years of follow-up were 100%. Significant group differences between patients who received chemotherapy and healthy control subjects were found for memory and fine-motor functioning. The 17 patients combined showed 16 deficits on various test measures. MRI abnormalities were seen in 6 children, but these did not correlate with cognitive performance. No differences in school levels were seen when the patients who received chemotherapy were compared with their siblings. The current nonirradiated patients demonstrated significantly better test results and significantly fewer learning disabilities and MRI abnormalities than did the previously irradiated group. CONCLUSION: Treatment with chemotherapy only may be associated with some cognitive impairment. However, these children attained normal school levels.","['Kingma, A', 'van Dommelen, R I', 'Mooyaart, E L', 'Wilmink, J T', 'Deelman, B G', 'Kamps, W A']","['Kingma A', 'van Dommelen RI', 'Mooyaart EL', 'Wilmink JT', 'Deelman BG', 'Kamps WA']","['Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, University Hospital Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cognition/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Netherlands', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Psychomotor Performance/*drug effects', 'Wechsler Scales']",2001/09/20 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/09/20 10:00'],"['2001/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(01)54156-6 [pii]', '10.1067/mpd.2001.117066 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 2001 Sep;139(3):413-20. doi: 10.1067/mpd.2001.117066.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that myeloma stimulates osteoclastogenesis by triggering a coordinated increase in the tumor necrosis factor-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE) and decrease in its decoy receptor, osteoprotegerin (OPG). Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization studies of bone marrow specimens indicate that in vivo, deregulation of the TRANCE-OPG cytokine axis occurs in myeloma, but not in the limited plasma cell disorder monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance or in nonmyeloma hematologic malignancies. In coculture, myeloma cell lines stimulate expression of TRANCE and inhibit expression of OPG by stromal cells. Osteoclastogenesis, the functional consequence of increased TRANCE expression, is counteracted by addition of a recombinant TRANCE inhibitor, RANK-Fc, to marrow/myeloma cocultures. Myeloma-stroma interaction also has been postulated to support progression of the malignant clone. In the SCID-hu murine model of human myeloma, administration of RANK-Fc both prevents myeloma-induced bone destruction and interferes with myeloma progression. Our data identify TRANCE and OPG as key cytokines whose deregulation promotes bone destruction and supports myeloma growth.","['Pearse, R N', 'Sordillo, E M', 'Yaccoby, S', 'Wong, B R', 'Liau, D F', 'Colman, N', 'Michaeli, J', 'Epstein, J', 'Choi, Y']","['Pearse RN', 'Sordillo EM', 'Yaccoby S', 'Wong BR', 'Liau DF', 'Colman N', 'Michaeli J', 'Epstein J', 'Choi Y']","['Laboratories of Molecular Genetics and Immunology, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10021, USA. rnp2001@med.cornell.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Disease Progression', 'Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/pathology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Osteoprotegerin', 'Paraproteinemias/pathology', 'RANK Ligand', 'Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor', 'Reference Values', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase', 'Time Factors']",2001/09/20 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/20 10:00'],"['2001/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.201394498 [doi]', '201394498 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Sep 25;98(20):11581-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.201394498.

At nanomolar concentrations, the SPIKET compound SPIKET-P caused tubulin depolymerization and demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. COBRA-1 inhibited GTP-induced tubulin polymerization. Treatment of human breast cancer and brain tumor cells with COBRA-1 caused destruction of microtubule organization and apoptosis. Other agents that have shown promise for cancer treatment include phorboxazoles, natural products that are extremely cytostatic towards the National Cancer Institute's panel of 60 tumor cell lines. In standard MTT assays, synthetic phorboxazole A exhibited potent cytotoxicity against NALM-6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (IC50 = 1.7 nM), BT-20 breast cancer cells (IC50 = 3.4 nM), and U373 glioblastoma cells (IC50 = 6.7 nM). Structure-activity studies were reported for seven synthetic analogs of phorboxazole A. Out of these, two showed potent anti-cancer activity. Phorboxazole analog 2 was active against NALM-6 cells (IC50 = 4.8 nM), BT-20 cells (IC50 = 12.6 nM) and U373 cells (IC50 = 27.4 nM), as was analog 3 (NALM-6 IC50 = 5.2 nM, BT-20 IC50 = 11.3 nM, and U373 IC50 = 29.2 nM). Anticancer activity of the phorboxazole analogs was correlated to the presence of certain structural moieties such as portions of the macrolide group, the central oxazole group, and the polyene side chain. The requirement of more than one structural element for activity suggested that at least bimodal interactions of the natural product with key cellular components may occur. Promising anti-mitotic agents with pro-apoptotic activity include inhibitors of the tyrosine kinase BTK. The leflunomide metabolite analog LFM-A13 inhibited BTK in leukemia and lymphoma cells (IC50 = 17 microM).

The noncalcemic actions of natural and synthetic VDR ligands are exemplified by their potent anti-proliferative, prodifferentiative and immunomodulatory activities. As a result, a VDR ligand is an approved drug for the topical treatment of psoriasis. A plethora of actions of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in various systems have suggested wide clinical applications of VDR ligands in such diverse disease states as inflammation (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis), dermatological indications (psoriasis, photoaging and skin rejuvenation), osteoporosis, cancers (breast, prostate, colon, leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome) and autoimmune diseases (multiple sclerosis, type I diabetes and systemic lupus erythematosus). VDR ligands have shown therapeutic potential in limited human clinical trials as well as in animal models of these diseases. Some of the VDR ligands have shown not only potent preventive but also therapeutic anabolic activities in animal models of osteoporosis. However, the use of VDR in above mentioned indications as well as in oral therapy for psoriasis and even topical therapy for severe psoriasis is hampered by its associated toxicity, namely hypercalcemia. New VDR ligands have been synthesized which exhibit greater specificity by retaining desirable properties, but with reduced calcemic potential.

METHODS: The occupational and environmental exposures histories of 110 incident leukemia cases and 199 general population controls were compared. The cases were recruited through referrals to treatment centers in New Zealand between 1989 and 1991. For subjects classified as having worked in one or more of the ""electrical occupations,"" the degree of exposures to extremely low frequency electromagnetic fields (ELF-EMFs) was assessed in detail using a job-exposure matrix. RESULTS: An odds ratio of 1.9 (95% Cl 1.0-3.8) was found for subjects who had ever worked in an electrical occupation. Significantly increased risks for leukemia are seen amongst welders/flame cutters (OR = 2.8 (95% CI 1.2-6.8)) and telephone line workers (OR = 5.81 (95% CI 1.2-27.8)). The excess leukemia risk appeared to be confined to acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (OR=2.31 (95% CI 1.2-4.6)), in comparison to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (OR = 0.9 (95% CI 0.3-2.9)) but for the latter category the numbers were very small. A dose-response effect was also found, with acute leukemia risk rising with increasing occupational magnetic field exposure, based on both current and historical occupational field exposure estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study indicate a significantly elevated risk of acute leukemia for electrical workers overall, and for the specific occupational categories of welders/flame cutters and telephone line workers. A dose-response effect was also found, indicating that acute leukemia risk was related to historical and current magnetic field exposures in an occupational context.","['Bethwaite, P', 'Cook, A', 'Kennedy, J', 'Pearce, N']","['Bethwaite P', 'Cook A', 'Kennedy J', 'Pearce N']","['Medical Laboratory Wellington, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Electricity', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology', 'New Zealand', 'Occupational Diseases/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure/adverse effects', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Risk Factors']",2001/09/20 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/09/20 10:00'],"['2001/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1011297803849 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2001 Oct;12(8):683-9. doi: 10.1023/a:1011297803849.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two-drug combination of 6-MP plus ara-C results in greater cytotoxicity than that achieved with either ara-C or 6-MP alone. Further preclinical investigations have shown that the addition of PEG-asparaginase (PEG-ASNase) to the combination of 6-MP plus ara-C (6-MP + ara-C + PEG-ASNase) results in 15.6-fold synergism over that achieved with the two-drug regimen. This is due to increased DNA damage leading to apoptotic cell death. PURPOSE: Since the intravenous preparation of 6-MP is no longer available and since oral 6-thioguanine (6-TG) provides higher levels of intracellular thioguanine nucleotides than an isotoxic dose of oral 6-MP, we investigated the potential drug synergism of 6-TG plus ara-C plus PEG-ASNase (TGAP) in myeloid (HL60/S, HL60/SN3, U937) and lymphoblastic (CEM/0, CEM/ ara-C/B, CEM/ara-C/I, MOLT-4) leukemia cell lines. The CEM clones, MOLT-4 and HL60/SN3 cell lines expressed functional or measurable p53 protein, while the other cell lines did not. METHODS: The MTT and trypan blue dye exclusion assays were used to determine drug cytotoxicity. In addition, cellular apoptosis and cellular p53, p21/waf-1 and bcl-2 protein concentrations were determined by FACS analysis and ELISA assays. RESULTS: Sequential exposure to 6-TG (24 h) plus ara-C (24 h) plus PEG-ASNase (24 h) produced 1.3- to 18.3-fold drug synergism over the two-drug combination of 6-TG plus ara-C. The molecular mechanism of synergism was due to the fact that the three-drug combination was capable of downregulating bcl-2 oncoprotein levels in these cell lines even when p53 was absent. CONCLUSION: These studies strongly demonstrate that the TGAP regimen is highly synergistic in p53-null and p53-expressing leukemia cell lines. We conclude that this combination regimen is collaterally sensitive with ara-C and further evaluation in an investigational phase I trial in relapsed leukemia patients is warranted.","['Fu, C H', 'Martin-Aragon, S', 'Weinberg, K I', 'Ardi, V C', 'Danenberg, P V', 'Avramis, V I']","['Fu CH', 'Martin-Aragon S', 'Weinberg KI', 'Ardi VC', 'Danenberg PV', 'Avramis VI']","['Department of Pediatrics, USC School of Medicine, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Polyethylene Glycols/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis/deficiency/*physiology', 'U937 Cells']",2001/09/20 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/09/20 10:00'],"['2001/09/20 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/20 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100289 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Aug;48(2):123-33. doi: 10.1007/s002800100289.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '3WJQ0SDW1A (Polyethylene Glycols)', '7D96IR0PPM (pegaspargase)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'TGAP protocol']",,"['2T32 CA09659/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13539/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of the translocation was twofold: Notch expression was placed under the control of a T-cell-specific element, and Notch was truncated, resulting in a constitutively active protein. Subsequent work has shown that Notch1 is required for T cell commitment and is exclusively oncotropic for T cells. During the past year, several murine models have been used to dissect the function of Notch signaling in lymphoid development and leukemia. These models show that Notch1 drives the earliest stages of T cell commitment and that Notch signaling must be downregulated by the double positive stage for proper T cell development to occur. Constitutive Notch signaling mediated by Notch1, Notch2, or Notch3 predisposes to T-cell leukemia. Future studies are expected to elucidate the mechanisms by which Notch leads to transformation.

In this review, the authors summarize current mouse models of acute promyelocytic leukemia and describe current knowledge about additional genetic alterations that occur during development of acute promyelocytic leukemia in the mouse.","['Pollock, J L', 'Westervelt, P', 'Walter, M J', 'Lane, A A', 'Ley, T J']","['Pollock JL', 'Westervelt P', 'Walter MJ', 'Lane AA', 'Ley TJ']","['Division of Oncology, Section of Stem Cell Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, 660 South Euclid, St. Louis, MO 63110-1093, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Deletion', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/physiology', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/physiology', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2001/09/19 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/19 10:00'],"['2001/09/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200107000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2001 Jul;8(4):206-11. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200107000-00005.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PLZF-RARalpha fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'N712M78A8G (Arsenic)']",62,"['KO8 HL03991/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA83962/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 HL07088/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",['Curr Opin Hematol 2002 Mar;9(2):179'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This chromosomal rearrangement results in the fusion of CBFB and MYH11 genes. Mouse models indicate that the fusion gene, Cbfb-MYH11, inhibits differentiation of hematopoietic cells. Although expression of Cbfb-MYH11 is not sufficient for leukemogenesis, a combination of Cbfb-MYH11 and additional mutations can lead specifically to the development of myeloid leukemia. Normally, CBFbeta interacts with CBFalpha to form a transcriptionally active nuclear complex. In vitro studies indicate that expression of CBFB-MYH11 leads to sequestration of CBFalpha2 in the cytoplasm. It also has been shown to inhibit CBF-mediated transactivation, slow cell cycle progression, delay the apoptotic response to DNA damaging agents, and protect CBFalpha2 from degradation. The importance of these functions in vivo remains to be determined.","['Kundu, M', 'Liu, P P']","['Kundu M', 'Liu PP']","['National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health, 49 Convent Drive, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. pliu@nhgri.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Curr Opin Hematol,Current opinion in hematology,9430802,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits', 'Core Binding Factor beta Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*etiology', 'Mice', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*physiology', 'Transcription Factor AP-2', 'Transcription Factors/physiology']",2001/09/19 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/19 10:00'],"['2001/09/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00062752-200107000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Curr Opin Hematol. 2001 Jul;8(4):201-5. doi: 10.1097/00062752-200107000-00004.,"['0 (CBFbeta-MYH11 fusion protein)', '0 (Cbfb protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor alpha Subunits)', '0 (Core Binding Factor beta Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factor AP-2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (core binding factor alpha)']",48,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Which empiric antibiotic regimen to use in these cases is still under debate. METHODS: We performed a randomized comparative study to evaluate the efficacy of cefepime versus ceftriaxone plus amikacin as the initial treatment in an escalating, empirical, antibiotic therapy regimen in febrile neutropenic patients. Both adults and children were included. All patients had less than 500 neutrophils/microl at the time of infection. Patients were randomized to receive either cefepime or ceftriaxone plus amikacin. If infection continued 72 h later, patients in both groups received vancomycin, and if infection had not disappeared 7 days after starting antibiotics, amphotericin B was started. RESULTS: Twenty patients were included in each group. Both treatment and control groups were comparable for age and sex, among other factors. There were 18 cures in the cefepime group and 17 in the ceftriaxone plus amikacin group (p = 0.9). No patient discontinued therapy because of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Cefepime is a safe and very effective therapy for patients with acute leukemia and febrile neutropenia; in addition, it is a cheaper regimen in our country, and lacks the potential toxicity of the aminoglycosides.","['Borbolla, J R', 'Lopez-Hernandez, M A', 'Gonzalez-Avante, M', 'DeDiego, J', 'Trueba, E', 'Alvarado, M L', 'Jimenez, R M']","['Borbolla JR', 'Lopez-Hernandez MA', 'Gonzalez-Avante M', 'DeDiego J', 'Trueba E', 'Alvarado ML', 'Jimenez RM']","['Hematology Department, Centro Medico Nacional 20 de Noviembre, ISSSTE, Mexico City, Mexico. rafael@borbolla.com']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amikacin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/*prevention & control', 'Cefepime', 'Ceftriaxone/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cephalosporins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fever/complications/drug therapy/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/complications/etiology']",2001/09/19 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/09/19 10:00'],"['2001/09/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/19 10:00 [entrez]']","['48547 [pii]', '10.1159/000048547 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2001 Sep-Oct;47(5):381-4. doi: 10.1159/000048547.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Cephalosporins)', '75J73V1629 (Ceftriaxone)', '807PW4VQE3 (Cefepime)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

Because Bcr encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase, we studied its kinase activity and determined the role of Bcr in the PDGF signaling pathway to ERK1/2 activation and DNA synthesis in rat aortic smooth muscle cells (RASMCs). METHODS AND RESULTS: In RASMCs, platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF) stimulated Bcr kinase activity, with a maximum at 1 minute. Because phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3-K) is essential for Bcr/Abl leukemogenesis, we evaluated the role of mouse PDGF-beta-receptor binding sites for PI3-K (Y708, Y719) and for phospholipase C-gamma (Y977, Y989) in PDGF-mediated Bcr kinase activation. The mutant PDGF receptor Y708F/Y719F but not Y977F/Y989F showed significantly reduced Bcr kinase activity. To determine the role of Bcr in PDGF-mediated signal transduction events leading to ERK1/2 and its downstream Elk1 transcription activation, wild-type (WT) and kinase-negative (KN) Bcr were transiently expressed in RASMCs. Bcr WT enhanced, whereas Bcr KN inhibited, PDGF-stimulated ERK1/2 and Elk1 transcriptional activity. Overexpression of Bcr also enhanced PDGF-induced Ras/Raf-1 activity and DNA synthesis, but this regulation is independent of the kinase activity of Bcr. Finally, we found that Bcr expression was increased in the neointimal layer after balloon injury of rat carotid artery. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated the importance of Bcr in PDGF-mediated events, such as activation of Ras, Raf-1, ERK1/2, and Elk1, and stimulation of DNA synthesis.","['Che, W', 'Abe, J', 'Yoshizumi, M', 'Huang, Q', 'Glassman, M', 'Ohta, S', 'Melaragno, M G', 'Poppa, V', 'Yan, C', 'Lerner-Marmarosh, N', 'Zhang, C', 'Wu, Y', 'Arlinghaus, R', 'Berk, B C']","['Che W', 'Abe J', 'Yoshizumi M', 'Huang Q', 'Glassman M', 'Ohta S', 'Melaragno MG', 'Poppa V', 'Yan C', 'Lerner-Marmarosh N', 'Zhang C', 'Wu Y', 'Arlinghaus R', 'Berk BC']","['Center for Cardiovascular Research, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,IM,"['Animals', 'Aorta', 'CHO Cells', 'Carotid Arteries/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Muscle, Smooth, Vascular/cytology/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/*pharmacology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary/physiology', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Transfection', 'Tunica Intima/metabolism', 'ras Proteins/metabolism']",2001/09/19 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/09/19 10:00'],"['2001/09/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/hc3701.095581 [doi]'],ppublish,Circulation. 2001 Sep 18;104(12):1399-406. doi: 10.1161/hc3701.095581.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-raf)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,"['HL-44721/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-49192/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-61319/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have utilized the hybrid FMEV (Friend mink cell focus-forming/murine embryonic stem cell virus) backbone, previously shown to be efficient in early hematopoietic cells, even when coexpressing two distinct genes. In SF91GCS-MRP, the cDNAs were combined via an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) sequence from poliovirus, resulting in a bicistronic mRNA produced via the long terminal repeat (LTR). Producer Fly-eco clones were established by trans-infection with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped retroviral supernatants. Drug-resistant producer clones were subsequently selected with antimony potassium tartrate, a nonmutagenic MRP1 substrate. By RNA slot-blot and transduction of 3T3 fibroblasts, titers of both SF91MRP and SF91GCS-MRP were found to be greater than 10(6) viral particles/ml. The correct viral integration in the genome was established by Southern blotting. By flow cytometry, both MRP1 and bicistronic clones showed an increase in expression of the MRP1 protein. The bicistronic producer clones, as well as 3T3 cells transduced with SF91GCS-MRP, presented an increase in intracellular glutathione levels, compared with the parental counterparts. Producer cells, 3T3 fibroblasts transduced with either SF91MRP or SF91GCS-MRP, and primary murine myeloid progenitor cells transduced with SF91GCS-MRP were resistant to MRP1-effluxed drugs. However, only bicistronic producers, 3T3 fibroblasts transduced with SF91GCS-MRP, and primary murine myeloid progenitor cells transduced with SF91GCS-MRP were also resistant to alkylating agents. We conclude that the retrovirus SF91GCS-MRP has features that make it a suitable vector to induce bone marrow resistance to multiple classes of chemotherapeutic agents. The strategy of coexpressing gamma-GCS and MRP1 may help to design an effective in vivo selection for various clinical protocols of gene therapy.","['Rappa, G', 'Lorico, A', 'Hildinger, M', 'Fodstad, O', 'Baum, C']","['Rappa G', 'Lorico A', 'Hildinger M', 'Fodstad O', 'Baum C']","['Department of Tumor Biology, Norwegian Radium Hospital, Montebello, Oslo 0310, Norway. germanar@labmed.uio.no']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Alkylating Agents/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antimony/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chlorambucil/pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Complementary/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', '*Genetic Vectors/genetics', 'Genome, Viral', 'Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Glutathione/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Male', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins/*biosynthesis/*genetics', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/metabolism']",2001/09/19 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/19 10:00'],"['2001/09/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/104303401750476276 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 2001 Sep 20;12(14):1785-96. doi: 10.1089/104303401750476276.,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9IT35J3UV3 (Antimony)', 'EC 6.3.2.2 (Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The outcomes of interest were cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, larynx, skin, prostate, and brain, as well as leukemia. Additional follow-up increased the power to detect modest elevations in mortality rates in association with specific types of MWF, including synthetic fluids not in widespread use until the 1970s. METHODS: Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were computed for the most recent 10 years of follow-up, as well as for the entire study period. Adjusted relative risks (RR) were estimated in Poisson regression models with categorical variables for cumulative exposure to each type of MWF and in proportional hazards models with continuous exposure variables. RESULTS: Associations were found between straight MWF and esophageal, laryngeal and rectal cancer; soluble MWF and cancer of the esophagus, larynx, skin, and brain; synthetic MWF and cancer of the esophagus, liver, and prostate. The elevated RR values were modest in magnitude (1.5 to 2.0). SMR values were increased for stomach, liver, and pancreatic cancer and also for leukemia in the last 10 years of follow-up. The SMR values were also elevated for stomach and liver cancer among the persons recently hired. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide further evidence that exposure to metalworking fluids causes cancer among workers in automobile manufacturing. Although airborne exposures declined over the study period, this study suggests that modest risk of several digestive cancers, as well as prostatic cancer and leukemia, may persist at current levels of exposure to water-based metalworking fluids.","['Eisen, E A', 'Bardin, J', 'Gore, R', 'Woskie, S R', 'Hallock, M F', 'Monson, R R']","['Eisen EA', 'Bardin J', 'Gore R', 'Woskie SR', 'Hallock MF', 'Monson RR']","['Department of Work Environment, University of Massachusetts, Lowell 01854, USA.

SAMPLE POPULATION: Serum samples from 43 client-owned dogs and 131 horses (81 with signs of acute illness and 50 without signs of disease). PROCEDURE: Serum samples were analyzed, using ELISA with a recombinant 44-kd protein antigen for IgM and IgG antibodies to the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) agent (NCH-1 strain). Western blot analyses, using infected human promyelocytic leukemia cells, were conducted on 38 serum samples of horses and 11 serum samples of dogs to verify reactivity to the 44-kd peptide. RESULTS: IgM or IgG antibodies to the HGE agent were detected in 5 to 28% of dog serum samples and 5 to 37% of horse serum samples. Thirty-five of 38 (92%) horse serum samples had corresponding results on both tests (2 positive results for 26 samples and 2 negative results for 9 samples), using an ELISA for IgG antibodies or immunoblotting for total immunoglobulins. All 11 serum samples of dogs had positive results for both methods. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These ELISA with recombinant 44-kd antigen are suitable for detecting IgM or IgG antibodies to the HGE agent in serum samples of dogs and horses. Positive results for serum samples of horses from Connecticut, New York, Virginia, and Georgia indicate that the HGE agent is widely distributed in tick-infested areas of the eastern United States.","['Magnarelli, L A', 'Ijdo, J W', 'Van Andel, A E', 'Wu, C', 'Oliver, J H Jr', 'Fikrig, E']","['Magnarelli LA', 'Ijdo JW', 'Van Andel AE', 'Wu C', 'Oliver JH Jr', 'Fikrig E']","['Department of Entomology, Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, New Haven 06504, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Vet Res,American journal of veterinary research,0375011,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bacterial/blood', 'Blotting, Western/veterinary', 'Connecticut', 'Dog Diseases/blood/*immunology/microbiology', 'Dogs', 'Ehrlichia/growth & development/*immunology', 'Ehrlichiosis/blood/immunology/microbiology/*veterinary', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods/*veterinary', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect/veterinary', 'Georgia', 'Horse Diseases/blood/*immunology/microbiology', 'Horses', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/blood', 'Immunoglobulin M/blood', 'New York', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Virginia']",2001/09/19 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2001/09/19 10:00'],"['2001/09/19 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/19 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.1365 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Vet Res. 2001 Sep;62(9):1365-9. doi: 10.2460/ajvr.2001.62.1365.,"['0 (Antibodies, Bacterial)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,"['HR8/CCH113382-01/HR/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AI41440/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U50/CCU111188-01/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined TEL/AML1 using nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and correlated TEL/AML1 with cytogenetics and immunophenotypes in 75 consecutively analyzed Chinese children with ALL in Hong Kong. TEL/AML1 was detected in 17.9% (12/67) B-lineage ALL at diagnosis but not in 8 T-ALL children or in 34 adults with ALL. E2A/PBX1, MLL/AF4, and BCR/ABL were not found in TEL/AML1+ patients. Coexpression of cross-lineage antigens was associated with TEL/AML1 gene fusion (p = 0.032), with CD13 in 80% (4/5) TEL/AML1+ cohort. Chromosomal abnormalities were demonstrated in 50% of the TEL/AML1+ ALL; however, a cryptic t(12;21) was not detected in these cases. Hyperdiploidy of 47-48 chromosomes was encountered in 25%. Deletion of 12p resulting in the loss of the normal allele of TEL and nonspecific del(6q) were noted in 8% (1/12) and 25% (3/12) of the TEL/AML1+ children, respectively. Rapid clearance of TEL/AML1 was noted in 50% of the patients on completion of the induction therapy; however, 16.7% (2/12) TEL/AML1+ ALL relapsed at a mean of 48.6 months from diagnosis (25 months off-therapy). The incidence of relapses of TEL/AML1+ ALL was comparable to that at diagnosis in B-lineage ALL (14.3% [2/14] vs. 17.9% [12/67], p > 0.05). The relapse rate in TEL/AML1+ ALL was similar to that of TEL/AML1- ALL (16.7% [2/12] vs. 20.6% [13/63], p > 0.05). The duration of first complete remission in TEL/AML1+ ALL was significantly longer as compared to TEL/AML1- ALL (mean [range] in month: 48.6 [47.2 - 50] vs 14.6 [2.9 - 42.3], p < 0.0001). Irrespective of TEL/AML1 rearrangement, the probabilities of the five-year overall survival and the event-free survival of patients were comparable (overall survival: 100% vs. 72.3%, p = 0.166 and event-free survival: 60% vs. 56.2%, p = 0.343).

Seven patients with progressively diffuse pulmonary infiltrates despite aggressive medical treatment were examined. The underlying diseases, prior treatment for presumptive pneumonia, the change in therapeutic approach after operation, and clinical outcome were reviewed retrospectively. Diffuse pulmonary infiltrates were caused by infection in two patients and by noninfectious etiology such as alveolar proteinosis, idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis, leukemic involvement, and drug-induced alveolar damage in the others. Four patients who had serious underlying hematologic diseases such as myelodysplastic syndrome, acute and chronic myeloid leukemia, and T cell lymphoma died. Three patients with acute lymphoid leukemia survived. In two of these three, change of therapeutic strategies after OLB was created for the survival. OLB in patients with hematological malignancy may be useful in selected patients with a treatable hematologic disease who have treatable underlying causes of the pulmonary infiltrate.","['Dai, M S', 'Lee, S C', 'Ho, C L', 'Chen, Y C', 'Kao, W Y', 'Chao, T Y']","['Dai MS', 'Lee SC', 'Ho CL', 'Chen YC', 'Kao WY', 'Chao TY']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Tri-Service General Hospital, National Defense Medical Center, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Biopsy/*methods', 'Cause of Death', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Lung/microbiology/*pathology', 'Lung Diseases/*diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/09/18 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/09/18 10:00'],"['2001/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/ajh.1158 [pii]', '10.1002/ajh.1158 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2001 Oct;68(2):87-90. doi: 10.1002/ajh.1158.,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunological classification was assessed using a three-line panel of monoclonal antibodies for phenotypic characterization of leukemic blast cells as proposed at the First Latin American Consensus Conference for Flow Cytometric Immunophenotyping of Leukemia. We found 74 cases of B-cell lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), seven cases of T-cell ALL, and 19 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study cytoplasmic (cy) CD79a, cyCD22, cyCD3, and cyMPO were highly sensitive, specific B, T, and myeloid markers that were expressed in virtually all cases of B and T cell ALL and in all subtypes of AML. Applied in combination with immunophenotyping this knowledge led to improvement in diagnostic precision and refinement of immunological classification, ensuring the selection of the most appropriate therapy for the patients studied. In conclusion, intracellular Ags detection was of utmost importance in establishing correct lineage affiliation in cases lacking expression of B, T, or myeloid surface Ags or disclosing equivocal or ambiguous immunophenotypic features and in identifying biphenotypic acute leukemia.

In this report, we describe the production and efficient concentration of RD114-pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (MLV)-based vectors. Following a single round of centrifugation, vector supernatants were concentrated approximately 200-fold with a 50 to 70% yield. Concentrated vector stocks transduced prestimulated human CD34(+) (hCD34(+)) cells with approximately 69% efficiency (n = 7, standard deviation = 4.4%) using a single addition of vector at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI = 5). Introduction of transduced hCD34(+) cells into irradiated NOD/SCID recipients resulted in multilineage engraftment with long-term transgene expression. These data demonstrate that RD114-pseudotyped MLV-based vectors can be efficiently concentrated to high titers and that hCD34(+) cells transduced with concentrated vector stocks retain in vivo repopulating potential.

A panel of Tax11-19-reactive CD8(+) T-cell clones was generated by single-cell cloning of Tax11-19/HLA-A*0201 tetramer-positive peripheral blood lymphocytes from an HTLV-1-infected individual. The analyses of TCR usage revealed that the combination of diverse TCR alpha and beta chains could be used for the recognition of Tax11-19 but the major population of T-cell clones (15 of 24 clones) expressed the TCR V beta 13S1 and V alpha 17 chain. We found striking similarities in CDR3 regions of TCR alpha and beta chains between our major group of CD8(+) T-cell clones and those originating from different subjects as previously reported, including TCRs with resolved crystal structures. A 3-amino-acid sequence (PG-G) in the CDR3 region of the V beta chain was conserved among all the Tax11-19-reactive T-cell clones expressing V beta 13S1 and V alpha 17 chains. Conserved amino acids in the CDR3 region do not directly contact the Tax11-19 peptide, as corroborated by the crystal structure of B7-TCR, a TCR that is almost identical to VB13S1 clones isolated in this study. Analysis of fine peptide specificity using altered peptide ligands (APL) of Tax11-19 revealed a similar recognition pattern among this panel of T-cell clones. These data suggest that the PG-G amino acids in the CDR3 beta loop provide a structural framework necessary for the maintenance of the tertiary TCR structure.","['Bourcier, K D', 'Lim, D G', 'Ding, Y H', 'Smith, K J', 'Wucherpfennig, K', 'Hafler, D A']","['Bourcier KD', 'Lim DG', 'Ding YH', 'Smith KJ', 'Wucherpfennig K', 'Hafler DA']","[""Laboratory of Molecular Immunology, Center for Neurological Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. kbourcier@rics.bwh.harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'Complementarity Determining Regions/chemistry/*immunology', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HLA-A Antigens/*immunology/metabolism', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/*immunology/metabolism', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta/genetics', 'Sequence Alignment']",2001/09/18 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/09/18 10:00'],"['2001/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.20.9836-9843.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Oct;75(20):9836-43. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.20.9836-9843.2001.,"['0 (Complementarity Determining Regions)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HLA-A Antigens)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta)']",,"['P01NS38037/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 AI039671/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', '1NS2424710/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01AI39671/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 NS038037/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC114556,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tumors display little evidence of loss of heterozygosity, and MMLV is only weakly synergistic with the Trp53 null genotype, suggesting that viral lymphomagenesis involves mechanisms which do not require mutational loss of Trp53 function. To explore this relationship in greater depth, we infected CD2-myc transgenic mice with MMLV and examined the role of Trp53 in the genesis of these tumors. Most (19 of 27) of the tumors from MMLV-infected, CD2-myc Trp53(+/-) mice retained the wild-type Trp53 allele in vivo while tumors of uninfected CD2-myc Trp53(+/-) mice invariably showed allele loss from a significant fraction of primary tumor cells. The functional integrity of the Trp53 gene in these tumors was indicated by ongoing allele loss or selection for mutational stabilization during in vitro propagation and by the radiosensitivity of selected Trp53(+/-) tumor cell lines. An inverse correlation was noted between retention of the wild-type Trp53 allele and expression of p19(ARF), providing further evidence of negative-feedback control of the latter by p53. However, expression of p19(ARF) does not appear to be counterselected in the absence of p53, and its integrity in Trp53(+/-) tumors was indicated by its transcriptional upregulation on Trp53 wild-type allele loss in vitro in selected tumor cell lines. The role of MMLV was investigated further by analysis of proviral insertion sites in tumors of CD2-myc transgenic mice sorted for Trp53 genotype. A proportion of tumors showed insertions at Runx2, an oncogene which has been shown to collaborate independently with CD2-myc and with the Trp53 null genotype, and at a novel common integration site (ptl-1) on chromosome 8. Genotypic analysis of the panel of tumors suggested that neither of these integrations is functionally redundant with loss of p53, but it appears that the combination of the MMLV oncogenic program with the CD2-myc oncogene relegates p53 loss to a late step in tumor progression or in vitro culture. While the means by which these tumors preempt the p53 tumor suppressor response remains to be established, this study provides further evidence that irreversible inactivation of this pathway is not a prerequisite for tumor development in vivo.","['Baxter, E W', 'Blyth, K', 'Cameron, E R', 'Neil, J C']","['Baxter EW', 'Blyth K', 'Cameron ER', 'Neil JC']","['Molecular Oncology Laboratory, Department of Veterinary Pathology, University of Glasgow Veterinary School, Glasgow G61 1QH, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'CD2 Antigens', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Genes, myc', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*virology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*deficiency/genetics', 'Virus Integration']",2001/09/18 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/09/18 10:00'],"['2001/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.20.9790-9798.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Oct;75(20):9790-8. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.20.9790-9798.2001.,"['0 (CD2 Antigens)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p14ARF)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",,,,,,['GENBANK/AJ302067'],,PMC114551,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An in vitro concerted two-end integration reaction catalyzed by the Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) integrase (IN) was used to investigate the binding and coordination of the two viral DNA ends. Comparison of the two-end integration and strand transfer assays indicates that zinc is required for efficient concerted integration utilizing plasmid DNA as target. Complementation assays using a pair of nonoverlapping integrase domains, consisting of the HHCC domain and the core/C-terminal region, yielded products containing the correct 4-base target site duplication. The efficiency of the coordinated two-end integration varied depending on the order of addition of the individual protein and DNA components in the complementation assay. Two-end integration was most efficient when the long terminal repeat (LTR) was premixed with either the target DNA or the HHCC domain. The preference for two-end integration through preincubation of the HHCC finger with the viral DNA supports the role of this domain in the recognition and/or positioning of the LTR.","['Yang, F', 'Roth, M J']","['Yang F', 'Roth MJ']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-- Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Binding Sites', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', 'Integrases/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*enzymology', 'Oligonucleotides/metabolism', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Recombinant Proteins/chemistry', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', '*Virus Integration', 'Zinc/chemistry', 'Zinc Fingers']",2001/09/18 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/09/18 10:00'],"['2001/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.20.9561-9570.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Oct;75(20):9561-70. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.20.9561-9570.2001.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.7.- (Integrases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",,['R01 CA76545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC114526,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty patients experiencing first (n = 21) or > or = second (n = 19) relapse were treated with daily infusions of ATO to a maximum of 60 doses or until all leukemic cells in bone marrow were eliminated. Patients who achieved a complete remission (CR) were offered one consolidation course of ATO that began 3 to 4 weeks later. Patients who remained in CR were eligible to receive further cycles of ATO therapy on a maintenance study. RESULTS: Thirty-four patients (85%) achieved a CR. Thirty-one patients (91%) with CRs had posttreatment cytogenetic tests negative for t(15;17). Eighty-six percent of the patients who were assessable by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction converted from positive to negative for the promyelocytic leukemia/retinoic acid receptor-alpha transcript by the completion of their consolidation therapy. Thirty-two patients received consolidation therapy, and 18 received additional ATO as maintenance. Eleven patients underwent allogeneic (n = 8) or autologous (n = 3) transplant after ATO treatment.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The inpatient, outpatient, and research records of patients treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocol C89803 and on North Center Cancer Treatment Group protocol N9741 were reviewed by a panel of five medical oncologists not directly involved with either study. Each death was categorized as treatment-induced, treatment-exacerbated, or treatment-unrelated. RESULTS: The records of 44 patients who experienced early deaths on C89803 (21 patients) or N9741 (23 patients) were reviewed. Patients treated with irinotecan plus bolus 5-FU/leucovorin had a three-fold higher rate of treatment-induced or treatment-exacerbated death than patients treated on the other arm(s) of the respective studies. For C89803, these rates were 2.5% (16 of 635) for IFL versus 0.8% (five of 628) for bolus weekly 5-FU and leucovorin. For N9741, these rates were 3.5% (10 of 289) for IFL, 1.1% (three of 277) for oxaliplatin plus bolus and infusional 5-FU and leucovorin, and 1.1% (three of 275) for oxaliplatin plus irinotecan. Multiple gastrointestinal toxicities that often occurred together were characterized into a gastrointestinal syndrome. Sudden, unexpected thromboembolic events were characterized as a vascular syndrome. The majority of deaths in both studies were attributable to one or both of these syndromes.

The alternative, downstream ABL promoter (Pa), which is usually retained in this chimeric oncogene, was reported to be methylated in many CML patients, but there has been controversy as to whether this methylation is a frequent change in bone marrow (BM) in early chronic phase (CP) or only past this stage. Also, the relevance of Pa promoter methylation to BCR-ABL expression in CML is unclear. We examined methylation of the ABL Pa promoter in uncultured BM samples and in colonies derived from their hematopoietic precursor cells by bisulfite and PCR-based assays (combined bisulfite restriction analysis and methylation-specific PCR). BM from seven CP CML patients at diagnosis had about 20-60% of the copies of the ABL Pa promoter methylated. No Pa methylation was detected in normal BMs or colonies derived from them. In contrast, most colonies from CP CML patients had Pa methylation. Surprisingly, 18-49% of the CML-derived colonies with this methylation reproducibly had no detectable BCR-ABL RNA on nested reverse transcription-PCR. Furthermore, the percentage of BCR-ABL RNA-positive colonies was almost same among the colonies not displaying Pa methylation as among the colonies in which this methylation was found. We conclude that ABL Pa methylation is often an early marker of CML in hematopoietic precursors and in total mononuclear BM cells but that it is not associated with an increased frequency of BCR-ABL RNA-positive cells. This methylation might be emblematic of cancer-associated hypermethylation elsewhere in the genome with the consequent silencing of tumor suppressor genes seen in many malignancies.","['Sun, B', 'Jiang, G', 'Zaydan, M A', 'La Russa, V F', 'Safah, H', 'Ehrlich, M']","['Sun B', 'Jiang G', 'Zaydan MA', 'La Russa VF', 'Safah H', 'Ehrlich M']","['Tulane Cancer Center, Human Genetics Program, Tulane Medical School, New Orleans, Louisiana 70112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology/physiology', '*DNA Methylation', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology/physiology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2001/09/18 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/18 10:00'],"['2001/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Sep 15;61(18):6931-7.,,,['CA78639/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several kinases involved in SR protein phosphorylation have been identified and characterized, among which human DNA topoisomerase I is known to have DNA-relaxing activity. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of splicing inhibition by a glycosylated indolocarbazole derivative (NB-506), a potent inhibitor of both kinase and relaxing activities of topoisomerase I. NB-506 completely inhibits the capacity of topoisomerase I to phosphorylate, in vitro, the human splicing factor 2/alternative splicing factor (SF2/ASF). This inhibition is specific, because NB-506 does not demonstrate activity against other kinases known to phosphorylate SF2/ASF such as SR protein kinase 1 and cdc2 kinase. Importantly, HeLa nuclear extracts competent in splicing but not splicing-deficient cytoplasmic S100 extracts treated with the drug fail to phosphorylate SF2/ASF and to support splicing of pre-mRNA substrates containing SF2/ASF-target sequences. Native gel analysis of splicing complexes revealed that the drug affects the formation of the spliceosome, a dynamic ribonucleoprotein structure where splicing takes place. In the presence of the drug, neither pre-spliceosome nor spliceosome is formed, demonstrating that splicing inhibition occurs at early steps of spliceosome assembly. Splicing inhibition can be relieved by adding phosphorylated SF2/ASF, showing that extracts treated with NB-506 lack a phosphorylating activity required for splicing. Moreover, NB-506 has a cytotoxic effect on murine P388 leukemia cells but not on P388CPT5 camptothecin-resistant cells that carry two point mutations in conserved regions of topoisomerase I gene (Gly361Val and Asp709Tyr). After drug treatment, P388 cells accumulated hypophosphorylated forms of SR proteins and polyadenylated RNA in the nucleus. In contrast, neither SR protein phosphorylation nor polyadenylated mRNA distribution was affected in P388 CPT5-treated cells. Consistently, NB506 treatment altered the mRNA levels and/or splicing pattern of several tested genes (Bcl-X, CD 44, SC35, and Sty) in P388 cells but not in P388 CPT5 cells. The study shows for the first time that indolocarbazole drugs targeting topoisomerase I can affect gene expression by modulating pre-mRNA splicing through inhibition of SR proteins phosphorylation.","['Pilch, B', 'Allemand, E', 'Facompre, M', 'Bailly, C', 'Riou, J F', 'Soret, J', 'Tazi, J']","['Pilch B', 'Allemand E', 'Facompre M', 'Bailly C', 'Riou JF', 'Soret J', 'Tazi J']","['Institut de Genetique Moleculaire, UMR 5535, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, IFR 24, Universite de Montpellier II, 34293 Montpellier Cedex, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology', 'Glucosides/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'RNA Precursors/metabolism', 'RNA Splicing/*drug effects', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Spliceosomes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Topoisomerase I Inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/09/18 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/18 10:00'],"['2001/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Sep 15;61(18):6876-84.,"['0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (Glucosides)', '0 (NB 506)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Topoisomerase I Inhibitors)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using reverse transcription-PCR and MUC1-specific monoclonal antibodies, MUC1 expression was found in 67% of AML samples and 92% of myeloma samples. To analyze the presentation of MUC1 peptides by primary AML blasts, we induced MUC1-specific CTLs in vitro using peptide-pulsed dendritic cells from HLA-A2+ healthy donors as antigen-presenting cells. These CTLs efficiently lysed in an antigen-specific and HLA-A2-restricted manner not only target cells pulsed with the antigenic peptide but also tumor cell lines including multiple myeloma cells and primary AML blasts that constitutively expressed both MUC1 and HLA-A2. The specificity of the CTLs was confirmed in a cold target inhibition assay.

To identify the putative tumor suppressor gene targeted by 13q14 genomic loss, we completely sequenced and characterized a segment of 790 kb at 13q14 spanning the minimal region of loss in CLL. Transcribed sequences in the region were identified through database homology searches and exon-prediction analysis. Two-hundred kb at the centromeric end of the sequence contain five CpG islands, three previously identified genes LEU5/RFP2, LEU2, and LEU1, seven of seven EST clusters composed of >10 ESTs, and a large number of predicted exons. Homology searches against the mouse EST database have allowed us to identify a highly conserved alternative first exon of the LEU2 gene, giving rise to a novel transcript, ALT1 (GenBank accession no. AF380424), which originates within a G+C region in the vicinity of the D13S272 marker. Two novel 3' exons of LEU2 were also identified and are present in both LEU2 and ALT1 transcripts. However, we have not identified any mutations in leukemia cases, or alterations in expression of mRNAs in the region, that might directly implicate these mRNAs in the pathology of CLL. The centromeric end of the sequence, where all reported genes are located, contains twice the expected amount of ALU repeats, whereas the telomeric end is LINE1 rich and contains four LINE1 elements longer than 4 kb, including two full-length LINE1 sequences. This feature of the sequence may favor the occurrence of chromosomal rearrangements and may confer instability to the region, resulting in deletions that may inactivate an as yet unidentified tumor suppressor.","['Bullrich, F', 'Fujii, H', 'Calin, G', 'Mabuchi, H', 'Negrini, M', 'Pekarsky, Y', 'Rassenti, L', 'Alder, H', 'Reed, J C', 'Keating, M J', 'Kipps, T J', 'Croce, C M']","['Bullrich F', 'Fujii H', 'Calin G', 'Mabuchi H', 'Negrini M', 'Pekarsky Y', 'Rassenti L', 'Alder H', 'Reed JC', 'Keating MJ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Croce CM']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Kimmel Cancer Center, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 13/*genetics', 'Expressed Sequence Tags', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Proteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transferases', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/09/18 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/18 10:00'],"['2001/09/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/18 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Sep 15;61(18):6640-8.,"['0 (DLEU2 lncRNA, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.- (Dleu2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.- (Transferases)']",,"['P01CA76259/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA56036/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['GENBANK/AF380424'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because response rates are often low, we decided to evaluate antibody response to single and booster vaccinations with influenza A and B virus vaccine in these patients. Methods: Twenty patients with B-CLL received two subunit virus vaccine injections 21 days apart. Antibody titres were determined before and 21 days after the single and booster vaccinations. The serological response was expressed using the following criteria: (1) response rate, i.e. the proportion of subjects with at least a 4-fold titre increase; (2) the protection rate, i.e. the proportion of subjects exceeding the threshold of 100 (influenza A) or 200 (influenza B); and (3) the mean fold increase (MFI), i.e. the difference between the log-adjusted geometric mean titres of pre- and post-vaccination sera. Results: Response rates were 5% for influenza A and 15% for B after the single vaccination and 15% for A and 30% for B after the booster vaccination. Protection rates were 0% for influenza A and 25% for B after the single vaccination; they were 5% (H1N1) and 10% (H3N2) for influenza A and 30% for B after the booster. The MFI+/-S.D. (range) after the booster vaccination was 0.26+/-0.33 (0-1.00), 0.17+/-0.34 (0-1.00) and 0.35+/-0.34 (0-1.20) for H1N1, H3N2 and influenza B, respectively. Conclusion: In this study with B-CLL patients, immune response to influenza vaccination was poor. Thus, single and booster vaccinations with influenza virus vaccine do not appear to be of great value to patients with B-cell CLL.","['van der Velden, A M.T.', 'Mulder, A H.L.', 'Hartkamp, A', 'Diepersloot, R J.A.', 'van Velzen-Blad, H', 'Biesma, D H.']","['van der Velden AM', 'Mulder AH', 'Hartkamp A', 'Diepersloot RJ', 'van Velzen-Blad H', 'Biesma DH']","['Department of Internal Medicine, St. Antonius Hospital, Koekoekslaan 1, 3435 CM, Nieuwegein, The Netherlands']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Eur J Intern Med,European journal of internal medicine,9003220,,,2001/09/15 10:00,2001/09/15 10:01,['2001/09/15 10:00'],"['2001/09/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0953620501001492 [pii]', '10.1016/s0953-6205(01)00149-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Intern Med. 2001 Sep;12(5):420-424. doi: 10.1016/s0953-6205(01)00149-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Mortality and illness-absence data were extracted from the Shell Oil Company's Health Surveillance System (HSS). Mortality data were compared to the United States, the state of California, and Contra Costa County, where the refinery is located. Morbidity data were compared to other company manufacturing employees. The standardized mortality/morbidity ratio (SMR/SMbR) was used as a measure of risk. Morbidity frequency and duration of absence were calculated by age, sex, and four health risk factors (smoking, high blood pressure, hypercholesterolemia, and obesity). RESULTS: With the United States as a comparison, the all causes combined SMR was 0.84 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.78-0.90], and the SMR for all cancer was 0.75 (95% CI = 0.64-0.88). Statistically significant deficits in mortality were found for lung cancer (SMR = 0.60) and leukemia (SMR = 0.26). Morbidity frequency and duration of absence among smokers were substantially higher than those of nonsmokers. Similar results were also noted for obese employees when compared to those of normal weight. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the comparison population, significantly fewer deaths were seen for all causes combined, all cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia. The study also showed no increased mortality from cancer of the stomach, kidney, skin, prostate, and brain. The increased morbidity frequency and duration of absence were associated with the presence of known health risk factors. These study findings are useful in setting priorities for medical programs and directing efforts such as health promotion and disease prevention strategies.","['Tsai, S P', 'Wendt, J K']","['Tsai SP', 'Wendt JK']","['Shell Oil Company, Corporate Health Department, P.O.

We previously identified a transporter (L-type amino acid transporter 1: LAT1) subserving system L in C6 rat glioma cells and demonstrated that LAT1 requires 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) for its functional expression. Since its oncofetal expression was suggested in the rat liver, it has been proposed that LAT1 plays a critical role in cell growth and proliferation. In the present study, we have examined the function of human LAT1 (hLAT1) and its expression in human tissues and tumor cell lines. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes with human 4F2hc (h4F2hc), hLAT1 transports large neutral amino acids with high affinity (K(m)= approximately 15- approximately 50 microM) and L-glutamine and L-asparagine with low affinity (K(m)= approximately 1.5- approximately 2 mM). hLAT1 also transports D-amino acids such as D-leucine and D-phenylalanine. In addition, we show that hLAT1 accepts an amino acid-related anti-cancer agent melphalan. When loaded intracellularly, L-leucine and L-glutamine but not L-alanine are effluxed by extracellular substrates, confirming that hLAT1 mediates an amino acid exchange. hLAT1 mRNA is highly expressed in the human fetal liver, bone marrow, placenta, testis and brain. We have found that, while all the tumor cell lines examined express hLAT1 messages, the expression of h4F2hc is varied particularly in leukemia cell lines. In Western blot analysis, hLAT1 and h4F2hc have been confirmed to be linked to each other via a disulfide bond in T24 human bladder carcinoma cells. Finally, in in vitro translation, we show that hLAT1 is not a glycosylated protein even though an N-glycosylation site has been predicted in its extracellular loop, consistent with the property of the classical 4F2 light chain. The properties of the hLAT1/h4F2hc complex would support the roles of this transporter in providing cells with essential amino acids for cell growth and cellular responses, and in distributing amino acid-related compounds.","['Yanagida, O', 'Kanai, Y', 'Chairoungdua, A', 'Kim, D K', 'Segawa, H', 'Nii, T', 'Cha, S H', 'Matsuo, H', 'Fukushima, J', 'Fukasawa, Y', 'Tani, Y', 'Taketani, Y', 'Uchino, H', 'Kim, J Y', 'Inatomi, J', 'Okayasu, I', 'Miyamoto, K', 'Takeda, E', 'Goya, T', 'Endou, H']","['Yanagida O', 'Kanai Y', 'Chairoungdua A', 'Kim DK', 'Segawa H', 'Nii T', 'Cha SH', 'Matsuo H', 'Fukushima J', 'Fukasawa Y', 'Tani Y', 'Taketani Y', 'Uchino H', 'Kim JY', 'Inatomi J', 'Okayasu I', 'Miyamoto K', 'Takeda E', 'Goya T', 'Endou H']","['Second Department of Surgery, Kyorin University School of Medicine, Mitaka, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Amino Acid Transport Systems', 'Amino Acids, Essential/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Fetus/metabolism', 'Fusion Regulatory Protein-1', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oocytes/metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Complementary/genetics/isolation & purification', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/biosynthesis', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Xenopus']",2001/09/15 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/15 10:00'],"['2001/09/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0005273601003844 [pii]', '10.1016/s0005-2736(01)00384-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2001 Oct 1;1514(2):291-302. doi: 10.1016/s0005-2736(01)00384-4.,"['0 (Amino Acid Transport Systems)', '0 (Amino Acids, Essential)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Fusion Regulatory Protein-1)', '0 (RNA, Complementary)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We previously showed that LiCl interacts synergistically with all-trans-retinoic acid to promote terminal differentiation of WEHI-3B D(+) cells, a phenomenon accompanied by the recovery of the retinoid-induced loss of retinoic acid receptor alpha protein pools. Here, we demonstrate the effects of LiCl on proteasome-dependent degradation of retinoic acid receptor alpha proteins. LiCl alone, or in combination with all-trans-retinoic acid, increased cellular levels of ubiquitinated retinoic acid receptor alpha and markedly reduced chymotryptic-like activity of WEHI-3B D(+) 20 S and 26 S proteasome enzymes. Neither KCl nor all-trans-retinoic acid affected enzyme activity, whereas NaCl produced a modest reduction at relatively high concentrations. In addition, LiCl inhibited 20 S proteasome chymotryptic-like activity from rabbits but had no effect on tryptic-like activity of the 26 S proteasome. This effect has significant consequences in stabilizing the retinoic acid receptor alpha protein levels that are necessary to promote continued differentiation of leukemia cells in response to all-trans-retinoic acid. In support of this concept, combination of proteasome inhibitors beta-clastolactacystin or benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Phe with all-trans-retinoic acid increased differentiation of WEHI-3B D(+) cells in a manner that was analogous to the combination of LiCl and all-trans-retinoic acid.","['Rice, A M', 'Sartorelli, A C']","['Rice AM', 'Sartorelli AC']","['Department of Pharmacology and Developmental Therapeutics Program, Cancer Center, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06520, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Chymotrypsin/pharmacology', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'Lithium Chloride/*pharmacology', 'Multienzyme Complexes/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Precipitin Tests', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Rabbits', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha', 'Time Factors', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Trypsin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Ubiquitin/metabolism']",2001/09/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/14 10:00'],"['2001/09/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M106583200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)82893-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Nov 16;276(46):42722-7. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M106583200.

Most human tumors and immortal cell lines maintain their telomeric DNA via the activity of a specialized reverse transcriptase, telomerase. Stabilization of telomeric repeat tracts may also be achieved through a telomerase-independent mechanism, referred to as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). ALT cells are telomerase negative and are characterized by extremely long and heterogeneously sized telomeres and novel multiprotein structures called ALT-associated PML nuclear bodies which are unique to ALT cells. To determine if reconstitution of telomerase activity suppressed ALT and restored wild-type telomere lengths, we introduced the catalytic subunit of telomerase into two ALT cell lines. Initially, two clonal lines exhibited enrichment of shorter telomeres while maintaining a population of ultra-long telomeres similar to that observed in the parental line, suggesting that telomerase is stabilizing the shorter telomeres in the population. Telomere length in the third clonal line was not detectably different from that in the parental cell line. One clonal line with a phenotype of shorter telomeres maintained this pattern over time in culture while the second gradually reverted to the parental ALT telomere length pattern, concurrent with reduction of telomerase activity. All clones continued to maintain ALT-associated PML nuclear bodies regardless of whether telomerase was present. The data suggest that introduction of telomerase activity alone is not sufficient to completely repress ALT, that telomerase acts preferentially on the shortest telomeres in the culture and that the ALT and telomerase pathways may be present concurrently in mammalian cells.","['Grobelny, J V', 'Kulp-McEliece, M', 'Broccoli, D']","['Grobelny JV', 'Kulp-McEliece M', 'Broccoli D']","['Fox Chase Cancer Center, 7701 Burholme Avenue, Philadelphia, PA 19111, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Catalytic Domain', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect', 'G2 Phase', 'Humans', 'Mitosis', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/09/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/14 10:00'],"['2001/09/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/hmg/10.18.1953 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2001 Sep 1;10(18):1953-61. doi: 10.1093/hmg/10.18.1953.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,['CA-09035-25/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies with yeast have indicated that expression of telomerase inhibits telomere recombination. In the present study, we have investigated whether expression of telomerase in cells that use ALT would similarly reveal dominance of telomere elongation by telomerase over telomere recombination. Telomerase-negative WI38 VA13/2RA ALT cells were reconstituted for telomerase activity through ectopic expression of the enzyme subunits, hTERT and hTR, and the presence and function of telomerase and ALT were monitored during long term cell growth by enzymatic assays, detection of the ALT-associated PML bodies (APBs) and analysis of telomere dynamics. Our results indicate that telomerase activity and APBs persisted in the cells over at least 90 population doublings. The activity of both pathways on telomeres was determined by analysis of telomere length versus time by gel electrophoresis and in situ hybridization. ALT cells are characterized by very heterogeneous telomeres with a much longer average size than the telomeres of telomerase-positive cells. Telomere dynamics in our cells were compatible with both ALT and telomerase being biologically active since the long telomeres typical of ALT were maintained, while short telomeres, thought to be the preferential substrate of telomerase, were elongated. These findings, indicating that human cells may be capable of concomitantly utilizing both mechanisms of telomere maintenance without effects on their growth and viability, have implications for cancer therapy.","['Cerone, M A', 'Londono-Vallejo, J A', 'Bacchetti, S']","['Cerone MA', 'Londono-Vallejo JA', 'Bacchetti S']","['Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine, McMaster University HSC-4H30, 1200 Main Street West, Hamilton, ON L8N 3Z5, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Mol Genet,Human molecular genetics,9208958,IM,"['Cell Division/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence/methods', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Subunits', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics/metabolism', 'Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/09/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/14 10:00'],"['2001/09/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/14 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/hmg/10.18.1945 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Mol Genet. 2001 Sep 1;10(18):1945-52. doi: 10.1093/hmg/10.18.1945.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Telomeric Repeat Binding Protein 2)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hayashibara et al., Leukemia, 13: 1634-1635, 1999) revealed a possible link between high plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) concentration and leukemic cell invasion in adult T-cell leukemia (ATL). However, the biological mechanism of this link has not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to address that mechanism. Our present observations showed that VEGF mRNA was expressed in ATL cell lines. The corresponding protein was secreted into the extracellular environment, which suggested that the major source of plasma VEGF is ATL cells themselves. More interestingly, all of the cell lines examined were found to express the mRNA and protein for fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1), which is one of the receptors for VEGF. Cytofluorometric analysis demonstrated the VEGF binding potency of these cells. In clinical specimens, expression of VEGF and Flt-1 mRNAs was detected in all (100%) of 11 and 8 (73%) of 11 ATL patients, respectively. Cytofluorometric analysis revealed that VEGF effectively bound only to Flt-1-expressing cells. These findings are highly suggestive of an autocrine pathway involving VEGF operating in ATL. The proliferation of ATL cell lines was not affected by treatment with an anti-VEGF antibody or exogenous VEGF, which indicated that VEGF has no mitogenic effect on ATL cells. In contrast, we made the interesting finding that treatment with exogenous VEGF enhanced the chemotactic activities of some ATL cell lines, which may play a key role in ATL cell invasion. Collectively, these data lead us to propose a possible autocrine mechanism involving VEGF operating by way of Flt-1, in which ATL cells up-regulate their own chemotaxis to facilitate their invasion into various organs.","['Hayashibara, T', 'Yamada, Y', 'Miyanishi, T', 'Mori, H', 'Joh, T', 'Maeda, T', 'Mori, N', 'Maita, T', 'Kamihira, S', 'Tomonaga, M']","['Hayashibara T', 'Yamada Y', 'Miyanishi T', 'Mori H', 'Joh T', 'Maeda T', 'Mori N', 'Maita T', 'Kamihira S', 'Tomonaga M']","['Department of Haematology, Molecular Medicine Unit, Atomic Disease Institute, Nagasaki University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Autocrine Communication/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemotaxis/drug effects/*physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphokines/*genetics/immunology/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/genetics', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor', 'Signal Transduction', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/09/14 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/09/14 10:00'],"['2001/09/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Sep;7(9):2719-26.,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HER-2 has been associated with worse prognosis and resistance or sensitivity to specific treatment. We evaluated circulating levels of extracellular domain of HER-2 (ECD/HER-2) in metastatic breast cancer patients and investigated the prognostic and predictive significance of circulating HER-2 levels regarding endocrine therapy or chemotherapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Plasma samples from 242 patients were assayed for circulating ECD/HER-2 levels, using a sandwich enzyme immunoassay. ECD/HER-2 was correlated with clinical data gathered from these patients while they were participating in prospective Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) therapeutic protocols for metastatic breast cancer. RESULTS: Eighty-nine (37%) of 242 patients had elevated ECD/HER-2 levels (> or =10.5 ng/ml). ECD/HER-2 was significantly associated with tumor burden, progesterone receptor levels, and presence of visceral metastases. Patients with elevated pretreatment levels had a significantly shorter OS but not time-to-progression than did those with ECD/HER-2 levels <10.5 ng/ml in univariate analysis. In univariate but not multivariate subset analyses, among patients treated with endocrine therapy (megestrol acetate), elevated initial ECD/HER-2 was associated with worse OS compared with nonelevated patients. However, among patients treated with chemotherapy (mainly anthracycline-containing regimens), OS did not differ significantly. Rates of response to either endocrine therapy or chemotherapy were similar for patients with elevated and nonelevated ECD/HER-2 levels. CONCLUSIONS: ECD/HER-2 levels are elevated in 35-40% of patients with metastatic breast cancer. Elevated ECD/HER-2 levels are associated with a poorer prognosis in these patients. However, no predictive role for ECD/HER-2 was identified, either for endocrine therapy or for anthracycline-based chemotherapy in the metastatic setting.","['Hayes, D F', 'Yamauchi, H', 'Broadwater, G', 'Cirrincione, C T', 'Rodrigue, S P', 'Berry, D A', 'Younger, J', 'Panasci, L L', 'Millard, F', 'Duggan, D B', 'Norton, L', 'Henderson, I C']","['Hayes DF', 'Yamauchi H', 'Broadwater G', 'Cirrincione CT', 'Rodrigue SP', 'Berry DA', 'Younger J', 'Panasci LL', 'Millard F', 'Duggan DB', 'Norton L', 'Henderson IC']","['Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, DC 20007, USA. hayesdf@umich.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Adult', 'Breast Neoplasms/*blood/drug therapy/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*blood', 'Survival Analysis', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/09/14 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/09/14 10:00'],"['2001/09/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Sep;7(9):2703-11.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)']",,"['60138/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA02599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA03927/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04326/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04457/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07968/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA08025/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA11789/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12449/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16450/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21060/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26806/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31946/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31983/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32291/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA33601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37135/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41287/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45374/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45389/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45400/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45418/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45808/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47545/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47555/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47559/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47577/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA47642/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA54697/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA74811/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77298/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77406/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77440/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77597/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA77651/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R03CA53336/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,"['Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Sep;7(9):2601-4.

METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients who had received diagnoses of both CMD and PH. Patients with a known cause of PH were excluded. The diagnosis of a CMD was based on established criteria. The diagnosis of PH was based on echocardiographic data or right heart catheterization data. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients satisfied the criteria for both a CMD and PH. Twelve patients had myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis (MMM), 5 patients had essential thrombocythemia (ET), 6 patients had polycythemia vera, 2 patients had a myelodysplastic syndrome, and 1 patient had chronic myeloid leukemia. Twenty-two patients (92%) received treatment for their CMDs, which included therapy with hydroxyurea (18 patients), anagrelide (7 patients), and busulfan (3 patients). PH was diagnosed a median of 8 years after recognition of the CMD (range, 0 to 26 years). The median right ventricular systolic pressure (RVsys) was 71 mm Hg (range, 32 to 105 mm Hg). RVsys correlated with the platelet count in patients with MMM (r = 0.30) and ET (r = 0.6) and with the hemoglobin levels in patients with PV (r = 0.77). Treatment of CMD did not seem to affect the severity of the pulmonary artery pressures as measured by serial echocardiography. With a median survival time of 18 months after the diagnosis of PH, the cause of death in the majority of the patients was cardiopulmonary. CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests a higher than expected incidence of PH in patients with MMM, PV, and ET.

Since IFNgamma is a potent activator of STAT 1, we searched for IFNgamma-sensitive binding sites in the PPARgamma promotors. A region of the murine PPARgamma2 promoter was identified that bound nuclear protein from adipocyte nuclei that had been acutely treated with IFNgamma. Supershift analysis revealed that STAT 1, and no other STATs present in the adipocyte nucleus, was capable of binding to this site within the PPARgamma2 promoter. NIH 3T3 and 3T3-L1 cells were transiently transfected with a PPARgamma2 promoter reporter construct, which contained the STAT 1 binding site. Treatment of these cells with IFNgamma resulted in a decrease in reporter activity, demonstrating the modulation of the PPARgamma2 promoter by IFNgamma. We also examined the ability of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) to regulate binding at this site. LIF, a potent activator of STAT3 and a weak activator of STAT 1 in these cells, resulted in some binding to the IFNgamma responsive element in the PPARgamma2 promoter that was mediated by STAT 1. Therefore, we examined the ability of LIF to regulate PPARgamma mRNA and observed that LIF, unlike IFNgamma, had little effect on PPARgamma expression. These results and our previous work suggest that cytokine induced STAT 1 homodimers modulate the transcriptional repression of PPARgamma2 in adipocytes.","['Hogan, J C', 'Stephens, J M']","['Hogan JC', 'Stephens JM']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Louisiana State University, 508 Life Sciences Building., Baton Rouge, Louisiana 70803, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/*physiology', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2001/09/14 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/09/14 10:00'],"['2001/09/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2001.5606 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)95606-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Sep 21;287(2):484-92. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.5606.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (STAT1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,['R01DK52968-02/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This case prompted us to review the published literature for cases of secondary HD in childhood. Our experience suggests that we should follow strictly our patients with ALL and be ready to intervene with invasive diagnostic procedures at the least suspicion of a second or recurrent neoplasm. The most frequent causes of second tumors are radiotherapy, genetic susceptibility and prior treatment with certain chemotherapeutic agents, such as nitrogen mustards.

Study of leukemia biology, as well as preclinical testing of potential therapeutic regimens directed at T-ALL, has been impeded by the lack of an efficient in vivo model of primary leukemia. We have reported elsewhere some observations that human cord blood conditioned medium enhances leukemia colony formation in vitro and preconditioning of sublethally irradiated nonobese diabetic/ severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice with cord blood mononuclear cells (MNCs) facilitates the subsequent engraftment of primary T-ALL cells in these mice. Here we characterize in greater detail this in vivo xenograft model of human leukemia in NOD/SCID mice. Consistent with the thesis that cord blood facilitates engraftment, the engraftment of human leukemia can be shown to increase with increasing number of cord blood MNCs injected. In addition, we documented the expression of chemokine receptor CXCR4 by primary T-ALL from patients and found that the presence of these receptors did not result in the transmigration of T-ALL cells induced by stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha. Finally, we show that in this xenograft system T-ALL cells recovered from engrafted bone marrow are characterized by upregulated expression of interleukin 2 receptor gamma chain, suggesting that cord blood preconditioning may function in part to increase T-ALL responsiveness to growth factor(s).","['Dialynas, D P', 'Shao, L', 'Billman, G F', 'Yu, J']","['Dialynas DP', 'Shao L', 'Billman GF', 'Yu J']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, California 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Stem Cells,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",9304532,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/cytology', 'Cell Movement', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CXCL12', 'Chemokines, CXC/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Fetal Blood/*immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', '*Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Receptors, CXCR4/biosynthesis', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Time Factors']",2001/09/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/stemcells.19-5-443 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells. 2001;19(5):443-52. doi: 10.1634/stemcells.19-5-443.,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Chemokines, CXC)', '0 (Cxcl12 protein, mouse)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,['MO1-RR00833/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, whether inhibition of angiogenesis also may play a role in liquid tumors is not well established. We recently have shown that certain leukemias not only produce VEGF but also selectively express functional VEGF receptors (VEGFRs), such as VEGFR-2 (Flk-1, KDR) and VEGFR1 (Flt1), resulting in the generation of an autocrine loop. Here, we examined the relative contribution of paracrine (EC-dependent) and autocrine (EC-independent) VEGF/VEGFR signaling pathways, by using a human leukemia model, where autocrine and paracrine VEGF/VEGFR loops could be selectively inhibited by neutralizing mAbs specific for murine EC (paracrine pathway) or human tumor (autocrine) VEGFRs. Blocking either the paracrine or the autocrine VEGF/VEGFR-2 pathway delayed leukemic growth and engraftment in vivo, but failed to cure inoculated mice. Long-term remission with no evidence of disease was achieved only if mice were treated with mAbs against both murine and human VEGFR-2, whereas mAbs against human or murine VEGFR-1 had no effect on mice survival. Therefore, effective antiangiogenic therapies to treat VEGF-producing, VEGFR-expressing leukemias may require blocking both paracrine and autocrine VEGF/VEGFR-2 angiogenic loops to achieve remission and long-term cure.","['Dias, S', 'Hattori, K', 'Heissig, B', 'Zhu, Z', 'Wu, Y', 'Witte, L', 'Hicklin, D J', 'Tateno, M', 'Bohlen, P', 'Moore, M A', 'Rafii, S']","['Dias S', 'Hattori K', 'Heissig B', 'Zhu Z', 'Wu Y', 'Witte L', 'Hicklin DJ', 'Tateno M', 'Bohlen P', 'Moore MA', 'Rafii S']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', '*Autocrine Communication', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*physiopathology', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/physiopathology', '*Paracrine Communication', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/09/13 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.191117498 [doi]', '98/19/10857 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Sep 11;98(19):10857-62. doi: 10.1073/pnas.191117498.,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",,"['R01 HL061849/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL-58707/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL-61401/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL-61849/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC58564,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional polymorphisms exist in at least three genes that encode GSTs, including GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1. We hypothesize, therefore, that polymorphisms in genes that encode GSTs alter susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced carcinogenesis, specifically to therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML), a devastating complication of long-term cancer survival. Elucidation of genetic determinants may help to identify individuals at increased risk of developing t-AML. To this end, we have examined 89 cases of t-AML, 420 cases of de novo AML, and 1,022 controls for polymorphisms in GSTM1, GSTT1, and GSTP1. Gene deletion of GSTM1 or GSTT1 was not specifically associated with susceptibility to t-AML. Individuals with at least one GSTP1 codon 105 Val allele were significantly over-represented in t-AML cases compared with de novo AML cases [odds ratio (OR), 1.81; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.11-2.94]. Moreover, relative to de novo AML, the GSTP1 codon 105 Val allele occurred more often among t-AML patients with prior exposure to chemotherapy (OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 1.39-5.09), particularly among those with prior exposure to known GSTP1 substrates (OR, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.43-13.20), and not among those t-AML patients with prior exposure to radiotherapy alone (OR,1.01; 95% CI, 0.50-2.07). These data suggest that inheritance of at least one Val allele at GSTP1 codon 105 confers a significantly increased risk of developing t-AML after cytotoxic chemotherapy, but not after radiotherapy.","['Allan, J M', 'Wild, C P', 'Rollinson, S', 'Willett, E V', 'Moorman, A V', 'Dovey, G J', 'Roddam, P L', 'Roman, E', 'Cartwright, R A', 'Morgan, G J']","['Allan JM', 'Wild CP', 'Rollinson S', 'Willett EV', 'Moorman AV', 'Dovey GJ', 'Roddam PL', 'Roman E', 'Cartwright RA', 'Morgan GJ']","['Molecular Epidemiology Unit, Academic Unit of Epidemiology and Health Services Research, School of Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, United Kingdom. j.m.allan@leeds.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Genetic Carrier Screening', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Glutathione S-Transferase pi', 'Glutathione Transferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/epidemiology/genetics', '*Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Reference Values', 'Risk Assessment']",2001/09/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.191211198 [doi]', '191211198 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Sep 25;98(20):11592-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.191211198.

The mechanism by which Tax induces apoptosis has remained unclear. Using genetically manipulated T-cell lines, we demonstrate that Tax-induced T-cell death is dependent on NF-kappaB signaling. Tax fails to induce apoptosis in T cells lacking IkappaB kinase gamma (IKKgamma), an essential component of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. This defect was rescued when the mutant cells were reconstituted with exogenous IKKgamma. We further demonstrate that the Tax-induced T-cell death is mediated by TNF (tumor necrosis factor)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), because this event can be effectively inhibited by a TRAIL-blocking antibody. Consistent with this functional aspect, Tax stimulates the expression of TRAIL mRNA. Finally, we provide genetic evidence demonstrating that the NF-kappaB signaling pathway is essential for TRAIL gene induction by both Tax and T-cell activation signals. These studies reveal a novel function of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway and suggest a key mechanism by which Tax induces T-cell death.","['Rivera-Walsh, I', 'Waterfield, M', 'Xiao, G', 'Fong, A', 'Sun, S C']","['Rivera-Walsh I', 'Waterfield M', 'Xiao G', 'Fong A', 'Sun SC']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Primers', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*physiology', 'Gene Products, tax/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'NF-kappa B/*metabolism/physiology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*genetics']",2001/09/13 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.C100501200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)77872-5 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Nov 2;276(44):40385-8. doi: 10.1074/jbc.C100501200.

In this study, we examined the ability of a series of synthetic gingerols and related phenylalkanol analogues (G1-G7) to inhibit human platelet activation, compared to aspirin, by measuring their effects on arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet serotonin release and aggregation in vitro. The IC(50) for inhibition of AA-induced (at EC(50)=0.75 mM) serotonin release by aspirin was 23.4+/-3.6 microM. Gingerols and related analogues (G1-G7) inhibited the AA-induced platelet release reaction in a similar dose range as aspirin, with IC(50) values between 45.3 and 82.6 microM. G1-G7 were also effective inhibitors of AA-induced human platelet aggregation. Maximum inhibitory (IC(max)) values of 10.5+/-3.9 and 10.4+/-3.2 microM for G3 and G4, respectively, were approximately 2-fold greater than aspirin (IC(max)=6.0+/-1.0 microM). The remaining gingerols and related analogues maximally inhibited AA-induced platelet aggregation at approximately 20-25 microM. The mechanism underlying inhibition of the AA-induced platelet release reaction and aggregation by G1-G7 may be via an effect on cyclooxygenase (COX) activity in platelets because representative gingerols and related analogues (G3-G6) potently inhibited COX activity in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) cells. These results provide a basis for the design of more potent synthetic gingerol analogues, with similar potencies to aspirin, as platelet activation inhibitors with potential value in cardiovascular disease.","['Koo, K L', 'Ammit, A J', 'Tran, V H', 'Duke, C C', 'Roufogalis, B D']","['Koo KL', 'Ammit AJ', 'Tran VH', 'Duke CC', 'Roufogalis BD']","['Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Arachidonic Acid/*pharmacology', 'Aspirin/pharmacology', 'Blood Platelets/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Catechols', 'Fatty Alcohols/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Aggregation/*drug effects', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/chemical synthesis/pharmacology', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/drug effects', 'Rats', 'Serotonin/*metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology']",2001/09/13 10:00,2002/03/28 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0049-3848(01)00338-3 [pii]', '10.1016/s0049-3848(01)00338-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Thromb Res. 2001 Sep 1;103(5):387-97. doi: 10.1016/s0049-3848(01)00338-3.,"['0 (Catechols)', '0 (Fatty Alcohols)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '333DO1RDJY (Serotonin)', '925QK2Z900 (gingerol)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'R16CO5Y76E (Aspirin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we show that expression of biklf is significantly suppressed in the blood-less mutants vampire and m683 in which primitive hematopoiesis is impaired. Knockdown of biklf using morpholino-based antisense oligonucleotides (biklf-MO) led to a potent reduction in the number of circulating blood cells and deficiency in hemoglobin production. Consistently, we found that the expression of beta(e3)globin is strongly suppressed in biklf-MO-injected embryos, while gata1 expression is partly inhibited at the 10-somite stage. In addition, analysis of reporter constructs driven by the GATA1 and beta-globin promoters showed that Biklf can positively regulate both genes.

Doxorubicin encapsulated with liposomes has less cardiotoxicity, is at least as efficient and has fewer side effects than conventional doxorubicin. Two female patients (69 and 54 yr old) with primary PCL are described in this study. They both received a modified form of VAD (vincristine, doxorubicin and dexamethasone), a regimen which includes liposomal doxorubicin (40 mg/m2 for 1 d), vincristine (2 mg for 1 d) and dexamethasone 40 mg per os on days 1-4, 9-12 and 17-20. A disease evaluation of the first patient after six courses of the modified \VAD regimen showed no plasma cells in the peripheral blood, a decrease in the serum M protein level and a plasma cell infiltration in the bone marrow of less than 5%. The patient died from a cardiac episode 24 months post-diagnosis, while she was in complete hematological remission. The second patient also exhibited good tolerance to liposomal doxorubicin with no side effects, achieved complete haematological remission and remains in good condition 7 months after the last VAD administration. These results suggest that this modified form of VAD regimen also seems to work in PCL and is well tolerated with no side effects.","['Christou, L', 'Hatzimichael, E', 'Chaidos, A', 'Tsiara, S', 'Bourantas, K L']","['Christou L', 'Hatzimichael E', 'Chaidos A', 'Tsiara S', 'Bourantas KL']","['Haematology Clinic, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Ioannina Medical School, Ioannina, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cardiomyopathies/chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Dexamethasone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Drug Carriers', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Electrocardiography', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Plasma Cell/blood/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Safety', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",2001/09/13 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['ejh326 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.067001051.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Jul;67(1):51-3. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.067001051.x.,"['0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'VAD protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To identify possible clinical applications of this technology we compared the effect of MGMT gene transfer on the hematotoxicity induced by different O(6)-alkylating agents in clinical use: the chloroethylnitrosoureas ACNU, BCNU, CCNU and the tetrazine derivative temozolomide. In addition, various retroviral vectors expressing the MGMT-cDNA were investigated to identify optimal viral backbones for hematoprotection by MGMT expression. Protection from ACNU, BCNU, CCNU or temozolomide toxicity was evaluated utilizing a Moloney murine leukemia virus-based retroviral vector (N2/Zip-PGK-MGMT) to transduce primary murine bone marrow cells. Increased resistance in murine colony-forming units (CFU) was demonstrated for all four drugs. In comparison to mock-transduced controls, after transduction with N2/Zip-PGK-MGMT the IC50 for CFU increased on average 4.7-fold for ACNU, 2.5-fold for BCNU, 6.3-fold for CCNU and 1.5-fold for temozolomide. To study the effect of the retroviral backbone on hematoprotection various vectors expressing the human MGMT-cDNA from a murine embryonic sarcoma virus LTR (MSCV-MGMT) or a hybrid spleen focus-forming/murine embryonic sarcoma virus LTR (SF1-MGMT) were compared with the N2/Zip-PGK-MGMT vector. While all vectors increased resistance of transduced human CFU to ACNU, the SF1-MGMT construct was most efficient especially at high ACNU concentrations (8-12 microg/ml). Similar results were obtained for protection of murine high-proliferative-potential colony-forming cells. These data may help to optimize treatment design and retroviral constructs in future clinical studies aiming at hematoprotection by MGMT gene transfer.","['Jansen, M', 'Bardenheuer, W', 'Sorg, U R', 'Seeber, S', 'Flasshove, M', 'Moritz, T']","['Jansen M', 'Bardenheuer W', 'Sorg UR', 'Seeber S', 'Flasshove M', 'Moritz T']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Cancer Research), West German Cancer Center, University of Essen Medical School, Essen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*toxicity', 'Alkylation', 'Animals', 'Carmustine/toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA, Complementary/genetics', 'Dacarbazine/analogs & derivatives/toxicity', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Lomustine/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Nimustine/toxicity', 'O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Sarcoma Viruses, Murine/genetics', 'Spleen Focus-Forming Viruses/genetics', 'Temozolomide', 'Terminal Repeat Sequences', 'Transfection']",2001/09/13 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['ejh465 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.067001002.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Jul;67(1):2-13. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.067001002.x.,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0S726V972K (Nimustine)', '7BRF0Z81KG (Lomustine)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 2.1.1.63 (O(6)-Methylguanine-DNA Methyltransferase)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Immunophenotypic changes at relapse were observed in 51 of 99 patients (51.5%) with almost even distribution in AML and ALL. Overall expression of aberrant markers on leukaemic cells was more frequent at relapse than at initial diagnosis (P < 0.05), and this finding was most prominent in B lineage ALL (41.4% versus 10.3%, P=0.007). Gain of aberrant CD13 or CD33 at relapse of B lineage ALL was most frequently observed. Cytogenetic changes at relapse were observed in 28 of 46 patients (60.8%). The initially abnormal karyotypes were more frequently associated with clonal changes at relapse compared to initially normal karyotypes (78.3% versus 43.5%, P=0.016). Cytogenetic changes were more frequent in B lineage ALL than in AML (90% versus 47.8%, P=0.05). In ALL, patients showing cytogenetic changes at relapse were significantly younger than those showing no changes (mean age of 15.0 versus 38.8, P=0.002), whereas in AML there was no significant difference between the two groups. In conclusion, the gain of aberrant markers and cytogenetic changes at relapse, which are suggestive of clonal instability, are more prevalent in B lineage ALL compared to AML, and lymphoid leukaemic cells of younger patients are more susceptible to clonal changes at relapse.","['Hur, M', 'Chang, Y H', 'Lee, D S', 'Park, M H', 'Cho, H I']","['Hur M', 'Chang YH', 'Lee DS', 'Park MH', 'Cho HI']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Clone Cells/pathology', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence']",2001/09/13 10:00,2002/07/03 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['clh389 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2257.2001.00389.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2001 Jun;23(3):173-9. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2001.00389.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the 1980s specific chromosomal abnormalities have been identified, of which the commonest are deletions of chromosomes 6q, 11q23, 13q14 and 17q13 and trisomy 12. The search for the responsible oncogenes at these sites has proved to be extremely frustrating. There are many oncogenes at 11q23 but the exact gene(s) responsible have yet to be identified. Germline abnormalities of the ATM gene occur in about 18% of patients compared to a normal population carriage of 0.5% but not all studies agree that ATM is the gene responsible. Unfortunately, despite the identification of various minimally deleted regions and the full sequencing of 13q14 no oncogenes have been identified. All original studies suggested the presence of a autosomally recessive tumour suppressor gene at this site but more recent studies suggest this may not be the case and the pathogenesis is more complex than first thought. Similarly, no genes have been identified at 6q or on chromosome 12. We know that the p53 tumour suppressor gene at 17p13 is an important prognostic indicator but it occurs in a minority of patients (about 15%), usually in patients with advanced disease, and therefore probably is not of aetiological importance.","['Fegan, C']",['Fegan C'],"['Department of Haematology, Bordesley Green East, Birmingham, UK.

Some tumour cells, however, are resistant to cellular cytotoxicity. Using the NK-resistant tumour cell lines ML-2, MONOMAC-1, RPMI and L540Cy, we demonstrated that activation of NK cells with interleukin 2 (IL-2) and IL-12 resulted in significant lysis of these tumour targets. To investigate the underlying mechanisms, we isolated the cytotoxic granules from non-activated and IL-2-/IL-12-activated NK cells and compared the killing of K562 leukaemia cells (sensitive to NK cell-mediated lysis) and ML-2 leukaemia cells (resistant to NK cell-mediated lysis). In contrast to K562 cells, which were easily killed by NK-cell granules, ML-2 cells were resistant to granules from non-activated NK cells. However, granules from NK cells activated with IL-2 and IL-12 were able to induce significant tumour cell lysis. Cell death of both K562 and ML-2 cells by granules from activated NK cells was completely blocked by anti-perforin antibodies, indicating that perforin mainly accounts for the lysis induced by NK granules. Comparing granules from non-activated and IL-2-/IL-12-activated NK cells, the increased cell death of ML-2 cells was caused by an improved binding of perforin to the target cell membrane. Functional assays, however, indicated that the differences in perforin binding were not as a result of an augmented production of perforin by activated NK cells. We conclude that activation of NK cells results in an increased binding of perforin and subsequent lysis of tumour cells.","['Lehmann, C', 'Zeis, M', 'Uharek, L']","['Lehmann C', 'Zeis M', 'Uharek L']","['Department of Haematology, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-12/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology/*metabolism', 'Perforin', 'Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins', 'Protein Binding', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",2001/09/13 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2995 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02995.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Sep;114(3):660-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02995.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Pore Forming Cytotoxic Proteins)', '126465-35-8 (Perforin)', '187348-17-0 (Interleukin-12)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apoptosis was quantified using morphological criteria and Western blot analysis for the apoptosis-specific p85 fragment of poly(ADP ribose) polymerase. Cell viability was estimated using the methyl thiazol tetrazolium bromide dye reduction assay. Plasma cultures showed lower rates of basal apoptosis as well as a decreased cytotoxic response to chlorambucil and gamma-radiation compared with cultures in fetal calf serum. Experiments using neutralizing antibodies suggested that the protective actions of plasma could not be accounted for by interleukin 4, the interferons alpha or gamma or stromal cell-derived factor 1, each of which have been shown to protect B-CLL cells from apoptosis in vitro. Plasma addition to B-CLL cells resulted in rapid activation of the Akt protein kinase, a key signalling enzyme that has been implicated in anti-apoptotic signalling.

Application of the TMR resistance assay to cells obtained from chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) patients revealed, in all individuals, a significant resistance compared with healthy donors (P < 0.001). Cells from the same patients at later phases exhibited a further increase in TMR resistance. Doxorubicin was excluded from all cell samples obtained from CML patients at presentation. The resistance to TMR and doxorubicin was energy-dependent, and was not modulated by inhibitors of MDR1 and multidrug-resistance protein-1 (MRP1). Transcription of mRNAs suspected as relevant to multidrug resistance was assessed using comparative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. All cells from the CML patients transcribed high levels of MRP3, MRP4 and MRP5 compared with healthy donors. Low levels of MDR1, MRP1, MRP2, MRP6, lung resistance-related protein and anthracycline resistance-associated protein were equally transcribed in cells from healthy donors and CML patients. These results indicated that neither MDR1 nor MRP1 mediate the resistance in these cells. Our results shed light on a resistance mechanism operative in CML patients, which, together with the resistance to apoptosis, is responsible for the lack of response of CML patients to induction-type protocols used to treat acute myeloid leukaemia patients.","['Carter, A', 'Dann, E J', 'Katz, T', 'Shechter, Y', 'Oliven, A', 'Regev, R', 'Eytan, E', 'Rowe, J M', 'Eytan, G D']","['Carter A', 'Dann EJ', 'Katz T', 'Shechter Y', 'Oliven A', 'Regev R', 'Eytan E', 'Rowe JM', 'Eytan GD']","['Haematology Department and Blood Bank, Rambam Medical Centre, Haifa, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['*ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics', 'ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics', 'Adult', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Dihydrolipoyllysine-Residue Acetyltransferase', 'Doxorubicin', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Fungal Proteins/genetics', '*Genes, MDR', '*Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', '*Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', '*Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines', 'Ribosomal Proteins/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2001/09/13 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2969 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02969.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Sep;114(3):581-90. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02969.x.,"['0 (ABCC4 protein, human)', '0 (ABCC5 protein, human)', '0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Fungal Proteins)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds, 3-Ring)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Ribosomal Proteins)', '0 (tetramethylrosamine)', '135640-68-5 (MRP-3 protein, Neurospora crassa)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.3.1.12 (Dihydrolipoyllysine-Residue Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lactic acidosis is associated with ATLS and its extent is correlated with the severity of ATLS. In the course of cytoreductive therapy, apoptosis is induced in tumour cells, which results in loss of mitochondrial function. We hypothesize that loss of mitochondrial function leads to compensatory glycolysis, which is the main cause of lactate accumulation and acidosis. We tested this hypothesis using the model of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in the human acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cell line CCRF-CEM. After induction of glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis, a biphasic course of lactate production was observed. Prior to the onset of apoptosis, i.e. prior to the loss of membrane potential, lactate production was reduced. However, subsequent to loss of mitochondrial membrane potential a massive increase in lactate production was observed (15.5 +/- 0.5 versus 10.17 +/- 0.09 mmol/10(6) cells, P = 0.001). We also demonstrated that inhibition of respiratory chain activity by antimycin A resulted in excess lactate production. In the model cell line used, conditional bcl-2 expression delayed glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis by protecting against loss of mitochondrial membrane potential; bcl-2 expression delayed the increase in lactate production and had no effect on the pre-apoptotic drop in lactate production. Apoptosis-induced lactate production was also observed in other cell lines (HL60, THP1 and OPM2) with various cytotoxic agents [doxorubicin, gemcitabine and vumon (VM26)]. Thus, the data suggest that lactate acidosis can be caused by apoptotic loss of mitochondrial function and massive apoptosis of a tumour mass via lactic acidosis may be the essential pathological event in ATLS.","['Tiefenthaler, M', 'Amberger, A', 'Bacher, N', 'Hartmann, B L', 'Margreiter, R', 'Kofler, R', 'Konwalinka, G']","['Tiefenthaler M', 'Amberger A', 'Bacher N', 'Hartmann BL', 'Margreiter R', 'Kofler R', 'Konwalinka G']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Innsbruck University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria. martin.tiefenthaler@uibk.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/09/13 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2988 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02988.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Sep;114(3):574-80. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02988.x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of the multidrug resistance (MDR-1) gene and its product, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), is associated with cellular resistance to drugs, such as anthracyclines and vinca alkaloids. This resistance can be reversed by cyclosporine analogues or verapamil (ver). We investigated the in vitro cross-resistance to AraC in a doxorubicin-resistant HL60 cell line, with an elevated expression of the MDR-1 gene. The resistant clone showed an eightfold increased resistance to AraC and a two- to fourfold resistance to the other analogues, as measured by cytotoxicity test. There was no significant increase in the activity of 5'-nucleotidase or in the amount of deoxyribonucleotide pools between cell lines. We could, however, detect a reduction in deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) activity (30%, P = 0.021, using deoxycytidine as substrate) and the level of AraC triphosphates was significantly reduced in the resistant cells (70%, P = 0.009). When the cells were exposed to cyclosporin A (CsA) or the cyclosporine analogue PSC 833 (PSC) in combination with AraC, there was more extensive apoptosis, as measured by formation of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase-3-like activity, than with exposure to AraC alone. We also found an increased retention of AraC in the resistant cells when incubated with AraC in combination with CsA. Ver in combination with AraC, failed to increase apoptosis for the resistant cell line. Our data suggests that the resistance to AraC for the P-gp-expressing cells is a result of a reduction of dCK activity and an increase in efflux, the latter possibly depending on P-gp. A combination of CsA or PSC with AraC may improve the effect of AraC in vivo.","['Mansson, E', 'Paul, A', 'Lofgren, C', 'Ullberg, K', 'Paul, C', 'Eriksson, S', 'Albertioni, F']","['Mansson E', 'Paul A', 'Lofgren C', 'Ullberg K', 'Paul C', 'Eriksson S', 'Albertioni F']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/metabolism', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cyclosporine/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', '*Cytarabine', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', '*Doxorubicin', '*Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism']",2001/09/13 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2979 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02979.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Sep;114(3):557-65. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02979.x.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '83HN0GTJ6D (Cyclosporine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the assessment of health effects from exposure to radiation is a matter of considerable controversy. This paper presents results of a retrospective study of leukemia incidence (203-207, ICD-9) around the highest 137Cs pollution in Poland (as an effect of the Czarnobyl disaster and/or military bomb tests). The data relating to all the registered leukemias in males and females originated from the Regional Cancer Registry in Opole. The information on 137Cs concentration rates in Opole province was derived from the state monitoring provided by the Polish Geological Institute in Warsaw. The spatial analysis--based on the random-effects Poisson regression model--was carried out via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique (Gibbs sampling) using BUGS software. The model incorporated epidemiological data and an ecological covariate--isotope concentrations--and provided a framework for estimating the strength of a dose-response relationship. The differences in incidence levels were quantified by traditional standardized morbidity ratios (SMRs) and presented in thematic maps as well as in combined charts of distance-disease-dose relations. Additionally, to assess spatial disease clustering, a Tango test was adopted. The results of this ecological study suggest that the 137Cs concentrations did not have any negative influence on the exposed population.","['Tukiendorf, A']",['Tukiendorf A'],"['Technical University, Opole, Poland. antu@po.opole.pl']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Bayes Theorem', 'Cesium Radioisotopes/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Markov Chains', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Radioactive Fallout/*adverse effects', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Ukraine']",2001/09/13 10:00,2002/01/30 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/30 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1011293224832 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2001 Sep;12(7):653-9. doi: 10.1023/a:1011293224832.,"['0 (Cesium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Radioactive Fallout)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We evaluated the hypothesis as to whether newly diagnosed ALL cases, compared to their controls, are characterized by lower herd immunity, as reflected in a more seronegative spectrum to several agents, with the exception of a strongly positive response to a single infectious agent, assumed to trigger ALL. METHODS: The study included 94 incident cases of ALL, from all pediatric hematology-oncology units of Greece, and 94, matched for age and gender, controls hospitalized with minor non-infectious conditions. The past exposure to common infections was assessed using 10 serological markers. RESULTS: There was little evidence for an association of ALL with the serology of any of the studied infectious agents among the very young children. In contrast, among children aged 5 years or older, leukemia was inversely associated with seropositivity to Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus-6, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and parvovirus B19. CONCLUSIONS: Among children aged 5 years or older the risk of leukemia may be higher when the low herd immunity for several agents is challenged by late infection from an agent that, as a rule, would attack children at a younger age.","['Petridou, E', 'Dalamaga, M', 'Mentis, A', 'Skalkidou, A', 'Moustaki, M', 'Karpathios, T', 'Trichopoulos, D']","['Petridou E', 'Dalamaga M', 'Mentis A', 'Skalkidou A', 'Moustaki M', 'Karpathios T', 'Trichopoulos D']","['Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'DNA Virus Infections/*complications', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Female', 'Greece', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Active', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Mycoplasma Infections/*complications', 'Odds Ratio', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/microbiology/virology']",2001/09/13 10:00,2002/01/30 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/30 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1011255825887 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2001 Sep;12(7):645-52. doi: 10.1023/a:1011255825887.,,,,,,,,,,,['Childhood Haematologists-Oncologists Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A total of 110 incident leukemia cases identified from referrals to one of six treatment centers between 1989 and 1991 were compared with 199 general population controls. Detailed occupational exposure histories were obtained by interview. RESULTS: There was an elevated risk associated with ever having worked in an abattoir (OR = 2.3, 95% CI 1.0-5.2), which appeared confined to those with over 2 years exposure (OR = 4.9, 95% CI 1.5-15.6). The excess risk was confined to abattoir workers having direct contact with animals or animal products (OR = 5.2 95% CI 1.2-22.2). Ever having worked as a butcher was associated with elevated risk (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.1-7.2), confined to those individuals who worked as a butcher in an abattoir (OR = 4.8) or who butchered livestock on farms (OR = 8.2). No increased risk was found for work as a retail/wholesale butcher or meatpacker (OR = 1.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study found increased leukemia risks associated with employment in the meat industry.

METHODS AND AIM OF THE STUDY: We enrolled 54 primary MDS patients, having an advanced median age of 78.5 years, that discouraged the choice of aggressive treatments. Then, we employed only the Bournemouth score (without cytogenetic analysis), with the aim to identify the best predictor of death and of AML development. RESULTS: Both for overall and leukemia-free analysis, shorter survival and faster development of AML were found in MDS patients with severe peripheral cytopenia, RAEB-T, major proportion of bone marrow blasts (over 20%) and with the higher Bournemouth score (i.e. 3-4). The multivariate analysis by the Cox's regression model showed that a high percentage of bone marrow blasts presented the best statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: In our survey we confirmed the value of Bournemouth score in identifying those MDS patients presenting a greater risk of death and AML development. Moreover, a high percentage of bone marrow blasts rose as the best predictor of death and leukemic evolution. The kariotypic analysis, with a stronger prognostic power but also complex and expensive, was not performed in our elderly MDS patients, who were unable to tolerate aggressive treatments.","['Luraschi, A', 'Buscaglia, P', 'Fedeli, P', 'Montanara, S', 'Uccelli, E', 'Antonietti, M P']","['Luraschi A', 'Buscaglia P', 'Fedeli P', 'Montanara S', 'Uccelli E', 'Antonietti MP']","['Divisione di Medicina, Ospedale di Omegna, Omegna.']",['ita'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Recenti Prog Med,Recenti progressi in medicina,0401271,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2001/09/13 10:00,2002/05/03 10:01,['2001/09/13 10:00'],"['2001/09/13 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/05/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/13 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Recenti Prog Med. 2001 Sep;92(9):521-9.,,,,,,Sindromi mielodisplastiche.

Early, extensive studies of retrovirus induction were done in mouse cells; however, similar studies have not been done using state-of-the-art virus detection assays and with cells of other mammalian species. To investigate induction and detection of occult retroviruses in cells of different species, especially primate cells that are used in production of biologics, we have initially determined the optimum conditions for retrovirus induction in chemically treated K-BALB mouse cells using highly sensitive product-enhanced reverse transcriptase (PERT) assays as well as transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Retrovirus induction was detected at day 1 post-drug treatment under all test conditions but was optimum using 30 microg ml(-1) of 5-iododeoxyuridine (IdU) for 24 h. Additionally, the combination of IdU and 5-azacytidine specifically enhanced activation of type C particles. RT activity was detected by PERT assays in one microliter equivalent of test sample and retroviral particle production was seen by TEM analysis. The induction of infectious murine leukemia retroviruses was confirmed by infectivity assays and correlated with PERT activity. These results indicate that strategies for detection of occult viral agents should include optimization of induction conditions using multiple viral detection assays to evaluate virus activation.","['Khan, A S', 'Muller, J', 'Sears, J F']","['Khan AS', 'Muller J', 'Sears JF']","['Laboratory of Retrovirus Research, Division of Viral Products, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Review, US Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. khan@cber.fda.gov']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/pharmacology', 'Azacitidine/pharmacology', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/drug effects/growth & development/*isolation & purification', 'Idoxuridine/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Time Factors', 'Virus Activation']",2001/09/12 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/12 10:00'],"['2001/09/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0168170201002805 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00280-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2001 Nov 5;79(1-2):39-45. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00280-5.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', 'LGP81V5245 (Idoxuridine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MDR1 is also being investigated as a gene therapy tool, both to protect normal cells against chemotherapy-related toxicity and to serve as an in vivo selectable marker for the overexpression of non-selectable therapeutic genes. The success of these strategies will depend on whether MDR1 expression can be sustained at levels high enough to confer a survival advantage on target cells. However, the MDR1 selection system is quite stringent, requiring high gene expression for transduced cells to survive in the presence of drug. The current report is a detailed molecular analysis of MDR1 selection stringency compared with the common neo selectable marker. A bicistronic vector encoding MDR1 and neo genes linked through an internal ribosome entry site was transferred into NIH 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and K562 human leukemia cells; cells were then exposed to colchicine (to select for MDR1 expression) or to G418 (to select for neo expression). Surviving populations and individual clones of cells were analyzed for expression levels of MDR1 and neo gene products; resistance to colchicine, paclitaxel, and G418; level and integrity of bicistronic mRNA; and structural integrity, integration number, and copy number of vector DNA. These studies provide direct evidence that colchicine selection is more stringent than G418 selection; that increased selection pressure with colchicine leads to increased gene expression; that increased gene expression can be accommodated primarily by gene amplification, even within an individual transduced clone and starting from a single-copy proviral integration event; and that the clonal diversity of a transduced population of cells is influenced significantly by the stringency of selection. Taken together, these results have important implications for the potential utility of MDR1 as a selectable marker and as a gene therapy tool in hematopoietic cells.","['Kane, S E', 'Matsumoto, L', 'Metz, M Z', 'Donohue, C A', 'Lingeman, R G', 'Lin, S W', 'Doroshow, J H']","['Kane SE', 'Matsumoto L', 'Metz MZ', 'Donohue CA', 'Lingeman RG', 'Lin SW', 'Doroshow JH']","['Department of Cell and Tumor Biology, City of Hope National Medical Center, 1500 E.

[6]-Paradol, a pungent phenolic compound present in certain Zingiberaceae plants, is known to have antimicrobial and analgesic activities. The compound has been reported to attenuate promotion of skin carcinogenesis and TPA-induced ear edema in female ICR mice, and to induce apoptosis in cultured human promyelocytic leukemia (HL-60) cells. In this study, we performed several biochemical studies to evaluate and compare the cancer chemopreventive potential of [6]-paradol and its synthetic derivatives. [6]-Paradol and its synthetic nonpungent analog, [6]-dehydroparadol significantly decreased the incidence and the multiplicity of skin tumors initiated by 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and promoted by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). Topical application of [6]-paradol and its derivatives inhibited TPA-induced ear edema and H(2)O(2) production and myeloperoxidase activity in the dorsal skin of mice. Induction of TPA-induced mouse epidermal ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) activity and H(2)O(2)- and UV-induced formation of oxidized DNA bases in vitro were also attenuated by the above compounds. These results indicate that [6]-paradol and its derivatives possess the cancer chemopreventive potential.","['Chung, W Y', 'Jung, Y J', 'Surh, Y J', 'Lee, S S', 'Park, K K']","['Chung WY', 'Jung YJ', 'Surh YJ', 'Lee SS', 'Park KK']","['Department of Oral Biology, Yonsei University College of Dentistry, 134 Shinchon-Dong, Seodaemoon-Ku, 120-752, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene/toxicity', 'Administration, Topical', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinogens/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'Ear, External/drug effects/pathology', 'Edema/chemically induced/pathology/prevention & control', 'Epidermis/drug effects/enzymology', 'Female', 'Guaiacol/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/metabolism', 'Ketones/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred ICR', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/biosynthesis', 'Peroxidase/biosynthesis', 'Skin Neoplasms/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",2001/09/12 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/09/12 10:00'],"['2001/09/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1383571801002212 [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(01)00221-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2001 Sep 20;496(1-2):199-206. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(01)00221-2.,"['0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Ketones)', '57-97-6 (9,10-Dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene)', '6JKA7MAH9C (Guaiacol)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'BO24ID7E9U (6-paradol)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, eupatilin exhibited concentration-dependent inhibitory effects on viability and DNA synthesis capability of HL-60 cells. The anti-proliferative effect of eupatilin was attributable to its apoptosis-inducing activity as determined by characteristic nuclear condensation, in situ terminal end-labeling of fragmented DNA (TUNEL), release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into cytoplasm, proteolytic activation of caspases-9, -3, and -7, and cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase. Eupatilin-induced HL-60 cell apoptosis does not appear to be mediated via alteration in Bcl-2/Bax-2.

METHODS: 114 eligible patients from 47 institutions enrolled between April, 1985 and March 1986. Patients had documented L-SCLC. Induction chemotherapy consisted of three cycles of PEV. TRT was administered at 1.8 Gy/fraction in 25 daily fractions to a total dose of 45 Gy, to begin concomitantly. Consolidative chemotherapy included two cycles of vincristine, methotrexate, etoposide, doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) was concurrent with the 3rd cycle of chemotherapy. The PCI dose was 30 Gy in 15 fractions of 2 Gy/fraction. RESULTS: As of May 2000, 5 of 114 remain alive and progression-free with a minimum follow-up interval of 13.2 years, as of May 2000. The median follow-up interval is 14.2 years. Thirty eight patients died of causes other than SCLC and five patients are still alive and progression-free. Of the remaining 71 patients dying of SCLC, local failure (LF) occurred in 24% (17 patients), distant metastasis (DM) occurred in 35% (25 patients), simultaneous LF and DM occurred in 25% (18 patients), and was indeterminate in 16% (11 patients). Thus, LF was a component of failure in 49%. Twenty patients had the CNS as the initial site of failure. Eleven patients (10%) developed fatal second primary cancers, including two with acute myelogenous leukemia, two with squamous cell lung cancer, one each with breast, pancreas, prostate, renal cell, and myelodysplasia. One patient developed both a melanoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. CONCLUSION: There are long-term survivors with concomitant TRT and PEV. LF and DM are common. Pattern of failure suggests needs to improve local and systemic control.","['Thomas, C R Jr', 'Giroux, D J', 'Janaki, L M', 'Turrisi, A T 3rd', 'Crowley, J J', 'Taylor, S A', 'McCracken, J D', 'Shankir Giri, P G', 'Gordon, W Jr', 'Livingston, R B', 'Gandara, D R']","['Thomas CR Jr', 'Giroux DJ', 'Janaki LM', 'Turrisi AT 3rd', 'Crowley JJ', 'Taylor SA', 'McCracken JD', 'Shankir Giri PG', 'Gordon W Jr', 'Livingston RB', 'Gandara DR']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, San Antonio Cancer Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, TX, USA']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",8800805,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Cisplatin/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Etoposide/*therapeutic use', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/mortality/*radiotherapy', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Survival Rate', 'Vinblastine/*therapeutic use']",2001/09/12 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/09/12 10:00'],"['2001/09/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0169500201001817 [pii]', '10.1016/s0169-5002(01)00181-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Lung Cancer. 2001 Aug-Sep;33(2-3):213-9. doi: 10.1016/s0169-5002(01)00181-7.,"['5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'VEP combination']",,"['CA04919/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04920/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12213/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA12644/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA13612/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA14028/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA16385/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA20319/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22433/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA27057/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32102/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35090/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35128/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35176/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35178/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35192/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35261/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35281/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37981/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA38296/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46113/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA46441/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58416/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA58686/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76132/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA76447/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, increased expression of p53 and HER2 may confer relative chemotherapy resistance and shortened survival. The Cancer and Leukemia Group B performed a series of studies involving sequential chemotherapy followed by radiation for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC. The objectives of this study were to analyze pathological specimens using immunohistochemistry for NE markers, p53 and HER2 to determine if there was a correlation between marker expression and response or survival. Of 160 eligible patients, 28 (18%) were not evaluable because of inadequate material. The percentage of specimens positive for markers was as follows: neuron-specific enolase 38%, Leu-7 2%, chromogranin A 0%, synaptophysin 5%, > or =2+NE markers 3%, p53 61%, and HER2 65%. There was no statistically significant correlation between any individual marker and response to induction chemotherapy or response to combined chemotherapy/radiation except for synaptophysin. Six of 6 (100%) synaptophysin positive tumors responded by the completion of all therapy compared with 69/125 (55%) synaptophysin negative tumors (P=0.04). None of the individual markers had a significant effect on survival in univariate analysis. Neuron-specific enolase was marginally significant in multivariate analysis (P=0.08). In conclusion, this study did not demonstrate that expression of NE markers, p53 and HER2 were predictive of response to chemotherapy, combined chemotherapy/radiation or for survival in this group of patients with stage III NSCLC.

Since interfering with this enzyme activity might be useful for treating leukemia and solid tumors, we have sought small-molecule inhibitors of Escherichia coli asparagine synthetase B (AS-B) as a model system for the human enzyme. Prior work showed that L-cysteine sulfinic acid competitively inhibits this enzyme by interfering with L-aspartate binding. Here, we demonstrate that cysteine sulfinic acid is also a partial substrate for E. coli asparagine synthetase, acting as a nucleophile to form the sulfur analogue of beta-aspartyl-AMP, which is subsequently hydrolyzed back to cysteine sulfinic acid and AMP in a futile cycle. While cysteine sulfinic acid did not itself constitute a clinically useful inhibitor of asparagine synthetase B, these results suggested that replacing this linkage by a more stable analogue might lead to a more potent inhibitor. A sulfoximine reported recently by Koizumi et al. as a competitive inhibitor of the ammonia-dependent E. coli asparagine synthetase A (AS-A) [Koizumi, M., Hiratake, J., Nakatsu, T., Kato, H., and Oda, J. (1999) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, 5799-5800] can be regarded as such a species. We found that this sulfoximine also inhibited AS-B, effectively irreversibly. Unlike either the cysteine sulfinic acid interaction with AS-B or the sulfoximine interaction with AS-A, only AS-B productively engaged in asparagine synthesis could be inactivated by the sulfoximine; free enzyme was unaffected even after extended incubation with the sulfoximine. Taken together, these results support the notion that sulfur-containing analogues of aspartate can serve as platforms for developing useful inhibitors of AS-B.","['Boehlein, S K', 'Nakatsu, T', 'Hiratake, J', 'Thirumoorthy, R', 'Stewart, J D', 'Richards, N G', 'Schuster, S M']","['Boehlein SK', 'Nakatsu T', 'Hiratake J', 'Thirumoorthy R', 'Stewart JD', 'Richards NG', 'Schuster SM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Adenosine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Asparagine/*biosynthesis', 'Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases with Glutamine as Amide-N-Donor/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cysteine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Escherichia coli/*enzymology', 'Hydrolysis', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Models, Chemical', 'Neurotransmitter Agents', 'Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular', 'Phosphorus Isotopes', 'Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization']",2001/09/12 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/09/12 10:00'],"['2001/09/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/12 10:00 [entrez]']","['bi0155551 [pii]', '10.1021/bi0155551 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochemistry. 2001 Sep 18;40(37):11168-75. doi: 10.1021/bi0155551.,"[""0 (5'-((methionine sulfoximinophospho)oxy)adenosine)"", '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Neurotransmitter Agents)', '0 (Phosphorus Isotopes)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 6.3.5.- (Carbon-Nitrogen Ligases with Glutamine as Amide-N-Donor)', 'EC 6.3.5.4 (asparagine synthetase (glutamine-hydrolyzing))', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)', 'UZY4HYK4ZX (cysteine sulfinic acid)']",,['CA28725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, 31 patients are alive (14 in CR, five in PR, five in PD and seven in relapse) and 16 died from PD at a median follow-up of 37 months (1-67). Only one patient died from transplant-related toxicity. Quality of life, evaluated using a QLQ-C30 questionnaire in 25 patients at day +90, was good. In our experience PBPC mobilization and transplantation is feasible in patients aged > or = 60 years and the toxicity of this procedure is acceptable, with an early transplant-related mortality of 1.8%; therefore patients with hematological malignancies potentially curable with high-dose therapy (HDT) should also be candidates for HDT.","['Olivieri, A', 'Capelli, D', 'Montanari, M', 'Brunori, M', 'Massidda, D', 'Poloni, A', 'Lucesole, M', 'Centurioni, R', 'Candela, M', 'Masia, M C', 'Tonnini, C', 'Leoni, P']","['Olivieri A', 'Capelli D', 'Montanari M', 'Brunori M', 'Massidda D', 'Poloni A', 'Lucesole M', 'Centurioni R', 'Candela M', 'Masia MC', 'Tonnini C', 'Leoni P']","['Hematology Department, University of Ancona, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*toxicity', 'Female', 'Graft Survival', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/psychology/therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/*standards', 'Hospitalization', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Quality of Life/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous/adverse effects/methods/standards', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/09/12 10:00,2002/07/18 10:01,['2001/09/12 10:00'],"['2001/09/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703034 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Jun;27(11):1189-95. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703034.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here the results of 91 stem cell mobilisations performed with various chemotherapy regimens followed by G-CSF. We show that mobilisation of Ph-negative cells is possible after diagnosis as well as in advanced stages of the disease. The yield of Ph-negative cells is highly dependent on the chemotherapy regimen: while the combination of idarubicin and cytarabin for 3-5 days (IC3-5) mobilised Ph-negative cells in most patients, high-dose cyclophosphamide was ineffective. Mobilisation of Ph-negative progenitor cells after IC3 was at least as effective as after IC5; however, less apheresis sessions were required, and toxicity was much reduced after IC3. Compared to historical controls, IC was equally effective as the widely used ICE/miniICE (idarubicin, cytarabin, etoposide) protocol. No correlation was found between graft quality and the cytogenetic response to subsequent treatment with interferon-alpha. We conclude that IC3 is an effective and well-tolerated regimen for mobilising Ph-negative cells that compares well with more aggressive approaches such as IC5 and ICE/miniICE.","['Deininger, M', 'Ponisch, W', 'Krahl, R', 'Leiblein, S', 'Edel, E', 'Lange, T', 'Fiedler, F', 'Freund, M', 'Franke, A', 'Pasold, R', 'von Grunhagen, U', 'Herold, M', 'Dolken, G', 'Hoffmann, F A', 'Uhle, R', 'Schultze, W', 'Steglich, J', 'Schwarzer, A', 'Richter, P', 'Winkelmann, C', 'Kettner, E', 'Dachselt, K', 'Subert, R', 'Schwalbe, E', 'Doepper, J', 'Helbig, W', 'Niederwieser, D']","['Deininger M', 'Ponisch W', 'Krahl R', 'Leiblein S', 'Edel E', 'Lange T', 'Fiedler F', 'Freund M', 'Franke A', 'Pasold R', 'von Grunhagen U', 'Herold M', 'Dolken G', 'Hoffmann FA', 'Uhle R', 'Schultze W', 'Steglich J', 'Schwarzer A', 'Richter P', 'Winkelmann C', 'Kettner E', 'Dachselt K', 'Subert R', 'Schwalbe E', 'Doepper J', 'Helbig W', 'Niederwieser D']","['Department of Hematology, University of Leipzig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/standards/toxicity', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/standards/toxicity', 'Female', 'Graft Survival/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/standards/toxicity', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Mobilization/*methods/standards', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/standards/toxicity', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage', 'Leukapheresis/standards', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Philadelphia Chromosome']",2001/09/12 10:00,2002/07/18 10:01,['2001/09/12 10:00'],"['2001/09/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/07/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703057 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Jun;27(11):1125-32. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703057.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,['East German Study Group Haematology/Oncology (OSHO)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic aim is selective destruction of cancer cells by the activated infused cells. An important problem in the early phase of developing such a treatment is to determine a maximal tolerated dose (MTD) for use in a subsequent phase II clinical trial. Dose may be quantified by the number of cells infused per unit body weight, and determination of an MTD may be based on the probability of infusional toxicity as a function of dose. As in a phase I trial of a new chemotherapeutic agent, this may be done by treating successive cohorts of patients at different dose levels, with each new level chosen adaptively based on the toxicity data of the patients previously treated. Such a dose-finding strategy is inadequate in T-cell infusion trials because the number of cells grown ex vivo for a given patient may be insufficient for infusing the patient at the current targeted dose. To address this problem, we propose an algorithm for trial conduct that determines a feasible MTD based on the probabilities of both infusibility and toxicity as functions of dose. The method is illustrated by application to a dendritic cell activated lymphocyte infusion trial in the treatment of acute leukemia. A simulation study indicates that the proposed methodology is both safe and reliable.","['Thall, P F', 'Sung, H G', 'Choudhury, A']","['Thall PF', 'Sung HG', 'Choudhury A']","['Department of Biostatistics, The University of Texas M.

Twenty patients (36%) were classified as refractory anemia (RA); seven (13%) as refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RARS); 13 (24%) as chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML); 11 (20%) as refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB); and four (7%) as refractory anemia with excess blasts in transformation (RAEB-t). Twenty-seven (49%) died during the follow-up period, seven with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The median survival was 2.8 years. The variables that showed association with survival by univariate analysis included the absolute neutrophil count, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, percentage of blasts, number of cytopenias, abnormal localization of immature precursors, and IPSS score. When entered into a regression model, IPSS showed a trend towards an association with survival (P 0.09). We conclude that the IPSS can prognostically stratify MDS patients.

Cancer epidemiology studies in relation to EMF have focused primarily on brain cancer and leukemia, both from residential sources of exposure in children and adults and from occupational exposure in adult men. Because genotoxic effects of EMF have not been shown, most recent laboratory research has attempted to show biological effects that could be related to cancer promotion. In this report, we briefly review residential and occupational EMF studies on brain cancer. We also provide a general review of experimental studies as they relate both to the biological plausibility of an EMF-brain cancer relation and to the insufficiency of such research to help guide exposure assessment in epidemiologic studies. We conclude from our review that no recent research, either epidemiologic or experimental, has emerged to provide reasonable support for a causal role of EMF on brain cancer.","['Gurney, J G', 'van Wijngaarden, E']","['Gurney JG', 'van Wijngaarden E']","['Division of Epidemiology/Clinical Research, Department of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Neuro Oncol,Neuro-oncology,100887420,IM,"['Adult', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Calcium/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/radiation effects', 'Child', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Cocarcinogenesis', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Free Radicals', 'Humans', 'Melatonin/metabolism', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Radiation, Nonionizing/adverse effects', 'Residence Characteristics', 'Risk', 'Secretory Rate/radiation effects', 'United States/epidemiology']",2001/09/12 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/09/12 10:00'],"['2001/09/12 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/12 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/neuonc/1.3.212 [doi]'],ppublish,Neuro Oncol. 1999 Jul;1(3):212-20. doi: 10.1093/neuonc/1.3.212.,"['0 (Free Radicals)', 'JL5DK93RCL (Melatonin)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",112,,,,,,,PMC1920742,,,,10.1093/neuonc/1.3.212 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is important to identify patients with this translocation so that they can receive appropriate treatment. To identify new partner breakpoints for ETV6 and CBFA2, we selected 30 patients with childhood ALL in whose leukemic cells a t(12;21) had been detected by RT-PCR. Conventional cytogenetics revealed that 12p abnormalities were present in 10 patients and that other random abnormalities were present in another 15, including 9 with a numerical or structural abnormality of chromosome 21. Normal karyotypes were observed in the leukemic blasts of five patients. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) confirmed the RT-PCR finding of the t(12;21) in each patient and detected the loss of the wild-type ETV6 allele in 14 (47%) patients. Metaphase cells from only 20 patients were available for additional FISH analysis. In 13 patients, the expected fusion signal of t(12;21) was observed on der(21)t(12;21), and the reciprocal CBFA2 signal was observed on der(12)t(12;21). However, in six patients with the ETV6-CBFA2 fusion on chromosome 21, the reciprocal CBFA2 signal was observed not on 12p13 but on 4q21, 4q27, 8q24, 11q24, 14q11.2, or 16p13.1. In four of these six patients, we found interstitial insertions of part of CBFA2. In another patient, the ETV6-CBFA2 fusion was observed on 4q21 rather than on 21q. Thus, seven (35%) of the 20 patients with a t(12;21) revealed complex rearrangements.

In all cases thus far examined (n = 10), the t(8;13) results in an identical mRNA fusion between ZNF198 exon 17 and FGFR1 exon 9. To determine if consistent fusions are also seen in the variant translocations, we performed RT-PCR on four cases and sequenced the products. For two patients with a t(8;9), we found that CEP110 exon 15 was fused to FGFR1 exon 9. For two patients with a t(6;8), we found that FOP exon 5 (n = 1) or exon 7 (n = 1) was fused to FGFR1 exon 9. To determine if FGFR1 might be involved in other myeloid disorders with translocations of 8p, we developed a two-color FISH assay using two differentially labeled PAC clones that flank FGFR1.

Breakpoints in BCR occur mostly within one of two regions: a 5 kb major breakpoint cluster region (M-Bcr) and a larger 35 kb minor breakpoint cluster region (m-Bcr) towards the 3' end of the first BCR intron. By contrast, breakpoints in ABL1 are reported to occur more widely across a >200 kb region which spans the large first and second introns. The mechanisms that determine preferential breakage sites in BCR, and which cause recombination between BCR and ABL1, are presently unknown. In some cases, Alu repeats have been identified at or near sequenced breakpoint sites in both genes, providing indications, albeit controversial, that they may be relevant. For the present study, we carried out a detailed analysis of genomic BCR and ABL1 sequences to identify, classify, and locate interspersed repeat sequences and to relate their distribution to precisely mapped BCR-ABL1 recombination sites. Our findings confirm that Alu are the most abundant class of repeat in both genes, but that they occupy fewer sites than previously estimated and that they are distributed nonrandomly. r-Scan statistics were applied to provide a measure of repeat distribution and to evaluate extremes in repeat spacing. A significant lack of Alu elements was observed across the major and minor breakpoint cluster regions of BCR and across a 25-kb region showing a high frequency of breakage in ABL1. These findings counter the suggestion that occurrence of Alu at BCR-ABL1 recombination sites is likely by chance because of the high density of Alu in these two genes. Instead, as yet unidentified DNA conformation or nucleotide characteristics peculiar to the preferentially recombining regions, including those Alu elements present within them, more likely influence their fragility.","['Jeffs, A R', 'Wells, E', 'Morris, C M']","['Jeffs AR', 'Wells E', 'Morris CM']","['Leukaemia Research Group, Christchurch School of Medicine, Christchurch, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Alu Elements/*genetics', 'Chromosome Breakage/*genetics', 'Contig Mapping/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Databases, Factual', 'Genes, abl/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Interspersed Repetitive Sequences/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'Statistical Distributions']",2001/09/11 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/11 10:00'],"['2001/09/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/gcc.1176 [pii]', '10.1002/gcc.1176 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Oct;32(2):144-54. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1176.,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The authors studied 94 previously untreated CD5-positive B-cell CLL patients whose sera was taken at the time of diagnosis, stored at - 70 degrees C, and analyzed for the presence of standard sCD44 (sCD44(std)) using a commercial enzyme-linked-immunoadsorbent-assay. The impact of the sCD44 level on the clinical outcome of the disease was assessed in 74 patients with early CLL (61 Binet Stage A patients and 13 asymptomatic Stage B patients). Because the time to disease progression appears to predict the survival time of patients with CLL, it was used as a surrogate endpoint in the current study. RESULTS: Patients with higher than median sCD44 levels (i.e., 642 ng/mL) had a more advanced clinical disease stage (P = 0.04), higher peripheral blood lymphocytosis (P = 0.006), and increased circulating levels of either lactate dehydrogenase (P = 0.01) or beta(2)-microglobulin (P < 0.0001). In univariate analysis, seven of the nine parameters investigated predicted progression-free survival (PFS). In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, only 2 parameters provided independent prognostic information regarding PFS: Rai substages (0 vs. I-II) (P = 0.002) and serum sCD44 levels > 642 ng/mL (P = 0.01). When added to the classification of smoldering CLL versus nonsmoldering CLL, the sCD44 level distinguished two groups within the group of nonsmoldering Stage A patients; patients with a sCD44 level > 642 ng/mL had a median PFS of 36 months, whereas patients with a sCD44 level < 642 ng/mL experienced a longer PFS (median had not been reached at 8 years of follow-up). Furthermore, serum levels of sCD44 defined two different patterns of PFS within the group of patients with Rai disease Stages I-II (P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: An increased serum level of sCD44 can be considered to be a promising parameter for predicting the risk of disease progression in patients with early CLL. Furthermore, sCD44 helps to refine the prognostic stratification of patients with either nonsmoldering CLL or Rai Stage I-II disease, thus enabling the identification of different prognostic subgroups in patients with early CLL.","['Molica, S', 'Vitelli, G', 'Levato, D', 'Giannarelli, D', 'Gandolfo, G M']","['Molica S', 'Vitelli G', 'Levato D', 'Giannarelli D', 'Gandolfo GM']","['Divisione Ematologia e Oncologia Clinica, Azienda Ospedaliera Pugliese-Ciaccio, via Pio X, 88100 Catanzaro, Italy. smolica@libero.it']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*blood', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Regression Analysis', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/09/11 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/09/11 10:00'],"['2001/09/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0142(20010815)92:4<713::AID-CNCR1374>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010815)92:4<713::aid-cncr1374>3.0.co;2-o [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Aug 15;92(4):713-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010815)92:4<713::aid-cncr1374>3.0.co;2-o.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we show that leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a fundamental component of the conditioning response. Conditioning injury in vivo significantly increases the intrinsic growth capacity of sensory neurons in vitro from LIF+/+ mice. This conditioning effect is significantly blunted in sensory neurons from LIF-/- mice. Enhanced growth is rescued in vitro in LIF-/- mice by the addition of exogenous LIF, and the effect blocked by human LIF-05, an LIF receptor antagonist.

In particular, the colony-stimulating factors stimulate the growth and proliferation of myeloid leukemia cells. Under normal conditions, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is produced by activated monocytes, whereas interleukin- 10 (IL-10) is produced by several cell types like monocytes and lymphocytes. The autocrine production of cytokines by leukemic cells may have a pathogenic role in the progression of leukemia or may be an epiphenomenon. In this study, we investigated the expression of TNF-alpha and IL-10 in human leukemic cells by RT-PCR and by a cytoplasmic protein assay. Most cases of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) (7/8 cases) and all cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (n = 2), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (n = 5), both in chronic phase and during blast crisis, expressed the mRNA for TNF-alpha and IL-10. A patient whose blasts were positive for IL-10 and negative for TNF-alpha, had high circulating levels of IL-10 and failed to respond to donor lymphocyte infusions. Using a cytoplasmic protein assay, generally low levels of cytoplasmic TNF-alpha and IL-10 were found which increased in case of TNF-alpha following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide. Taken together, our data show that most leukemic cells express the mRNA for a proinflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha) and an immunosuppressive cytokine (IL-10). More work is necessary to determine under which conditions these cytokines actually paralyze the immune system and thereby permit the progression of leukemia.","['Schulz, U', 'Munker, R', 'Ertl, B', 'Holler, E', 'Kolb, H J']","['Schulz U', 'Munker R', 'Ertl B', 'Holler E', 'Kolb HJ']","['Medizinische Klinik III der LMU, Klinikum Grosshadern, Munchen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Med Res,European journal of medical research,9517857,IM,"['Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia/blood/complications/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis/blood', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/blood', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis/*genetics']",2001/09/11 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/11 10:00'],"['2001/09/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/11 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Eur J Med Res. 2001 Aug 27;6(8):359-63.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, by using the human leukemic U937 cell line, we demonstrate that the cytochrome c release is caspase-8-dependent and can be blocked by an inhibitor of caspase-8, Z-Ile-Glu (OMe)-Thr-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-IETD.fmk), or a pan caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD.fmk). However, TNFalpha-mediated loss of DeltaPsim was not inhibited by caspase inhibitors. The apoptotic process was blocked by either Z-IETD.fmk or Z-VAD.fmk in cells with lower DeltaPsim. U937 cells with stable transfection of the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (c-IAP1) are resistant to TNFalpha-induced activation of caspases, Bid cleavage, cytochrome c release and DeltaPsim collapse. In addition, both c-IAP1 and XIAP were not up-regulated upon prolonged exposure to TNFalpha. In contrast, there was a caspase-dependent cleavage of XIAP, but not c-IAP1, during treatment with TNFalpha for 7 days. These results demonstrate that c-IAP1 blocks TNFalpha signaling at a level controlling both activation of caspase-8 and a signal to cause loss of DeltaPsim. The sensitive U937 cell line failed to acquire resistance and gain a self-protecting advantage against apoptosis, upon induction of c-IAP1 expression.","['Partheniou, F', 'Kelsey, S M', 'Srinivasula, S M', 'Newland, A C', 'Alnemri, E S', 'Jia, L']","['Partheniou F', 'Kelsey SM', 'Srinivasula SM', 'Newland AC', 'Alnemri ES', 'Jia L']","[""Department of Haematology/Oncology, St. Bartholomew's and the Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Turner Street, London E1 2AD, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/enzymology/physiology', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology', 'U937 Cells', 'Ultraviolet Rays', 'Viral Proteins/genetics/*pharmacology', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein']",2001/09/11 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/09/11 10:00'],"['2001/09/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2001.5582 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)95582-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Sep 14;287(1):181-9. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.5582.,"['0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (inhibitor of apoptosis, Nucleopolyhedrovirus)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Prospective study of 107 client-owned cats with naturally-occurring lymphosarcoma. PROCEDURE: An ELISA was used to detect FeLV p27 antigen in serum specimens collected from cats with lymphosarcoma. A PCR was used to detect FeLV DNA in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections containing neoplastic lymphoid cells. The PCR was designed to amplify a highly conserved region of the untranslated long terminal repeat of FeLV provirus. RESULTS: Only 2 of 107 cats (2%), for which serum samples were available, were FeLV-positive on the basis of detectable p27 antigen in serum. In contrast, 25 of 97 tumours (26%) contained FeLV DNA. Of the 86 cats for which both PCR and ELISA data were available, 19(22%) had FeLV provirus in their tumours but no detectable circulating FeLV antigen in serum, while 2 (2%) had FeLV provirus and circulating FeLV antigen. FeLV PCR-positive/ELISA-negative cats (19) differed from PCR-negative/ELISA-negative cats (65) in having fewer B-cell tumours (P = 0.06), more non B-/non T-cell tumours (P = 0.02) and comprising fewer non-Siamese/Oriental pure-bred cats (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of FeLV antigen or provirus was considerably lower in our cohort of cats compared with studies of lymphosarcoma conducted in the Northern hemisphere. This suggests that factors other than FeLV are important in the development of lymphosarcoma in many Australian cats. No firm conclusions could be drawn concerning whether FeLV provirus contributed to the development of lymphosarcoma in PCR-positive/ELISA-negative cats.","['Gabor, L J', 'Jackson, M L', 'Trask, B', 'Malik, R', 'Canfield, P J']","['Gabor LJ', 'Jackson ML', 'Trask B', 'Malik R', 'Canfield PJ']","['Department of Veterinary Anatomy and Pathology, The University of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Aust Vet J,Australian veterinary journal,0370616,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/*isolation & purification', 'Cat Diseases/*epidemiology/*virology', 'Cats', 'DNA, Viral/*isolation & purification', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/veterinary', 'Gene Products, gag/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Feline/epidemiology/virology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/*veterinary/virology', 'New South Wales/epidemiology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Prevalence', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/immunology']",2001/09/11 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/09/11 10:00'],"['2001/09/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1751-0813.2001.tb13017.x [doi]'],ppublish,Aust Vet J. 2001 Jul;79(7):476-81. doi: 10.1111/j.1751-0813.2001.tb13017.x.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (feline leukemia virus protein p27)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cohort consisted of 17,747 workers (11,660 men and 6087 women) employed in a rubber tire plant for at least three months during the years 1950-1995. The cohort follow-up was completed on December 31, 1995. Deaths by causes were analyzed using standardized mortality ratio (SMR) calculated by the person-years method. The mortality pattern of the general population of Poland was used as the reference. The study indicated significantly lower total mortality in the cohort (men: SMR = 72; women: SMR = 62) as compared to the general population, which is an example of a well known ""healthy worker effect"". The number of deaths from malignant neoplasms was also lower than expected (men: SMR = 67; women: SMR = 64). Only in a very small sub-cohort of men involved in dosing and mixing of raw material for the production of rubber, an excess of total mortality (SMR = 104) and from all cancers (SMR = 115) was found. Mortality from all neoplasms was enhanced (SMR = 108) in the sub-cohort of women employed in the technical service work area. When analyzing individual cancer sites in men of the whole cohort or sub-cohorts, the observed number of deaths from cancers of the lip, tongue, pharynx, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, peritoneum, articular cartilage, connective tissue, skin, testis, prostate, bladder, kidney, brain, as well as from Hodgkin's disease, multiple myeloma and leukemia was larger than the expected number. Among women the excess mortality was due to cancers of the large myeloma and leukemia. The SMR calculated for these sites were statistically insignificant. The cohort under study was ""young"" and thus relatively small numbers of deaths were recorded. The excess mortality, based quite frequently on single cases of selected cancer sites, cannot be regarded as a basis for final conclusions. Nevertheless, the fact that these observations are in agreement with the findings of other authors who carried out studies in the rubber industry of other countries justifies the need to follow-up this cohort in the future.","['Wilczynska, U', 'Szadkowska-Stanczyk, I', 'Szeszenia-Dabrowska, N', 'Sobala, W', 'Strzelecka, A']","['Wilczynska U', 'Szadkowska-Stanczyk I', 'Szeszenia-Dabrowska N', 'Sobala W', 'Strzelecka A']","['Department of Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology, Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Lodz, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Poland,Int J Occup Med Environ Health,International journal of occupational medicine and environmental health,9437093,IM,"['Adult', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Digestive System Neoplasms/mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Male', 'Multiple Myeloma/mortality', 'Neoplasms/*mortality', 'Occupational Diseases/*mortality', 'Poland/epidemiology', 'Respiratory Tract Neoplasms/mortality', '*Rubber', 'Urogenital Neoplasms/mortality']",2001/09/08 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/09/08 10:00'],"['2001/09/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/08 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2001;14(2):115-25.,['9006-04-6 (Rubber)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results indicate that the three agents have approximately equal hydrophobicity, affinity for L1210 cells and ability to initiate photodamage leading to an apoptotic response.

This classification was based on effects that occur within minutes of irradiation of photosensitized cells: rapid loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential (delta psi m), release of cytochrome c into the cytosol and activation of caspase-3. These effects were followed by the appearance of an apoptotic morphology within 30-90 min. Fluorescence localization studies on three sensitizers initially classified as 'mitochondrial' revealed that these agents bind to a variety of intracellular membranes. The earliest detectable effect of photodamage is the selective loss of the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 leaving the proapoptotic protein bax undamaged. Bcl-2 photodamage can be detected directly after irradiation of cells at 10 degrees C. Subsequent warming of cultures to 37 degrees C results in loss of delta psi m, release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3. The latter appears to amplify the other two effects. Based on results reported here we propose that the apoptotic response to these photosensitizers is derived from selective photodamage to the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 while leaving the proapoptotic protein bax unaffected.","['Kessel, D', 'Castelli, M']","['Kessel D', 'Castelli M']","['Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, MI 48201, USA. dhkessel@med.wayne.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Photochem Photobiol,Photochemistry and photobiology,0376425,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Photobiology', 'Photosensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*drug effects/radiation effects', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2001/09/08 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/09/08 10:00'],"['2001/09/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1562/0031-8655(2001)074<0318:etbitt>2.0.co;2 [doi]'],ppublish,Photochem Photobiol. 2001 Aug;74(2):318-22. doi: 10.1562/0031-8655(2001)074<0318:etbitt>2.0.co;2.,"['0 (Bax protein, mouse)', '0 (Photosensitizing Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)']",,['CA23378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

By in situ hybridization using embryonic day 16.5 (E16.5) mouse embryos, strong expression of POEM mRNA was observed in developing kidney renal tubules, parathyroid and thyroid glands, developing bone, tooth germ, and endocrine organs of the brain. The inner ear, skeletal muscle, smooth muscle (except for the vascular system), and skin were also positive for POEM expression. Bacterial recombinant POEM protein containing the RGD sequence and MAM domain showed strong cell adhesion, spreading, and survival-promoting activities. By mutating the RGD sequence to RGE, the cell spreading and survival activities were significantly decreased, but the MAM domain was shown to contribute only to cell adhesion and not to cell spreading and survival-promoting activities. The distribution of POEM in several tissues was close to that of alpha(8)beta(1) integrin. Therefore, we conducted cell adhesion assays using KA8 cells, a K562 leukemia clone stably expressing alpha(8) integrin. Parental K562 cells, which expressed alpha(5)beta(1) integrin, bound to fibronectin but not to POEM. On the other hand, KA8 cells showed strong binding and spreading on both fibronectin and POEM. These results suggest that POEM is a novel ligand for alpha(8)beta(1) integrin and that POEM may be involved in the development and function of various tissues, such as kidney, bone, muscles, and endocrine organs.","['Morimura, N', 'Tezuka, Y', 'Watanabe, N', 'Yasuda, M', 'Miyatani, S', 'Hozumi, N', 'Tezuka Ki, K']","['Morimura N', 'Tezuka Y', 'Watanabe N', 'Yasuda M', 'Miyatani S', 'Hozumi N', 'Tezuka Ki K']","['Research Institute for Biological Sciences, Science University of Tokyo, Yamazaki 2669, Noda, Chiba 278-0022, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Adhesion Molecules/analysis/chemistry/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Embryo, Mammalian/metabolism', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/*chemistry', 'Integrins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides', 'Osteoblasts/*chemistry', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Amino Acid', 'Stem Cells/*chemistry', 'Tissue Distribution']",2001/09/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/08 10:00'],"['2001/09/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M103216200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)83076-4 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Nov 9;276(45):42172-81. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M103216200.

To apply this vector system to gene therapy of human diseases, we generated a stable packaging cell line, FLY-HIV-87, expressing the MuLV gag and pol genes and the C-terminally truncated variant of the HIV-1 envelope gene, but no retroviral vector genome. Production of infectious vector particles was tested after the introduction of different vector genomes and was in the range of 5x10(5) IU/ml. The vector particles could be concentrated up to 25-fold.

We have also previously reported that VSV-G can enhance DNA lipofection efficiency by interacting with liposomes to form fusogenic, serum-stable liposomes with enhanced transfection properties. Here, we report that VSV-G can form a complex directly with naked plasmid DNA in the absence of a lipofection reagent and can thereby enhance the transfection efficiency of the naked plasmid vector. Sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis demonstrated that VSV-G can also associate with plasmid DNA and murine leukemia virus (MLV) gag-pol particles to form ternary complexes that co-sediment with high DNA transfecting activity. The increased transfection efficiency with VSV-G was dependent on the presence of the polycation (Polybrene) in the culture medium during transfection. Enhanced transfection was abolished by a neutralizing antibody to VSV-G. These results may be useful in the study of retrovirus assembly, in the further design of hybrid DNA-based retrovirus-like vectors, and in the full in vitro, cell-free assembly of infectious virus-like particles from component parts.","['Okimoto, T', 'Friedmann, T', 'Miyanohara, A']","['Okimoto T', 'Friedmann T', 'Miyanohara A']","['Program in Human Gene Therapy, Center for Molecular Genetics, UCSD School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA 92093-0692, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Ther,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,100890581,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell-Free System', 'Genes, Reporter/genetics', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Liposomes/metabolism', 'Luciferases/genetics/metabolism', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Plasmids/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transfection/*methods', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Virion/chemistry/*metabolism']",2001/09/08 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/09/08 10:00'],"['2001/09/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/mthe.2001.0443 [doi]', 'S1525-0016(01)90443-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Mol Ther. 2001 Sep;4(3):232-8. doi: 10.1006/mthe.2001.0443.,"['0 (G protein, vesicular stomatitis virus)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,"['2P30 AI 36214/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'DK49023/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'HL64730/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The distribution of certain characteristics of pregnancy and birth among 83 cases of malignant neoplasms of the brain and other parts of the nervous system (diagnosed between 0 and 14 years of age) and 166 controls (individually matched on date of birth, sex, and hospital of birth) were compared. Odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) and two-sided p-values were calculated using conditional logistic regression for matched sets. RESULTS: Children whose mothers had documented evidence of a clinically diagnosed viral infection during pregnancy had an approximately 11-fold increase in risk of developing a malignant neoplasm of the brain or other part of the nervous system (OR = 10.6, 95% CI = 1.1-503.2). In addition, non-statistically significant increased risks were observed among children who had a non-cephalic presentation (OR = 3.3, 95% CI = 0.8-13.9) or a low 1-minute apgar score (OR = 2.7, 95% CI = 1.0-7.4). No other aspects of the index pregnancy, delivery, or maternal characteristics were associated with an increased risk of childhood brain tumors.

In the study an atypical non-ischaemic late retinopathy is described. METHODS: Sequential cases of late retinal microvasculopathy following allogeneic BMT were reviewed. Demographic features and clinical and angiographic data were collected. RESULTS: Of 399 patients undergoing allogeneic BMT between 1992 and 1999, eight eyes of four patients developed atypical retinopathy. All patients were male and the age range was 27-50 (mean 37.5) years. The indications for BMT were acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (two patients), chronic myeloid leukaemia (one patient) and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (one patient). Two patients had conditioning regimens including irradiation. All had cyclosporine and methotrexate as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis. All but one had cyclophosphamide and busulphan as conditioning treatment. One had interferon. No patients had sustained hypertension or diabetes mellitus. Atypical retinopathy was identified 13-62 (mean 50) months after BMT and clinical features consisted of microaneurysms (MA; 4/4), hard exudates (1/4) and macular oedema (1/4).

Mice with a null mutation in either the gene for leukemia inhibitory factor or the interleukin-11 receptor alpha chain are infertile, owing in both cases to a failure of embryo implantation. Both of these genes are expressed in the human endometrium with patterns suggesting a role in human fertility. The technique of RNA differential display has been applied to a comparison of the expression of genes at implantation sites v. inter-implantation sites in the mouse uterus on the first day of implantation, and has defined additional genes whose products may be important for this process. Among these are the calcium-binding protein D9K, the monoclonal non-specific suppressor factor beta, and the splicing factor SC35.

Also, gluthoxim effect was studied with respect to transformed murine fibroblasts C8 and A4, carrying the plasmide structure with Ras and E1A genes which boost Ras-gene expression. This in turn makes fibroblasts ready to start apoptosis. Gluthoxim induction of cell death was demonstrated in both cell lines; however, apoptosis in cells C8 (with intact gene p53) was much more pronounced than in cells A4 without this gene. It is suggested that apoptosis can be triggered by both imbalance of redox potential typical of tumor cells, induction of p53 synthesis and an impact on the phosphoproteinase cascade of Ras-signal pathway.","['Kozhemiakin, L A', 'Belokhvostov, A S', 'Antonov, V G', 'Goranin, K V', 'Sakuta, G N', 'Perestenko, P V']","['Kozhemiakin LA', 'Belokhvostov AS', 'Antonov VG', 'Goranin KV', 'Sakuta GN', 'Perestenko PV']",,['rus'],['Journal Article'],Russia (Federation),Vopr Onkol,Voprosy onkologii,0413775,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Genes, p53/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Oligopeptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/biosynthesis']",2001/09/08 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2001/09/08 10:00'],"['2001/09/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/08 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Vopr Onkol. 2001;47(3):338-42.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'GY131TX61G (gluthoxim)']",,,,,Molekuliarno-geneticheskie aspekty protivoopukholevoi aktivnosti preparata glutoksim.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is due to to advancements in three fields, (i) 3D structure determination, (ii) analysis of the complexes formed between nuclear receptors and co-regulatory molecules, and (iii) the genetic analysis of nuclear receptor signalling by gene ""knock out"" and ""knock in"" technologies. The elucidation of the crystal structure of apo-, holo (agonist)- and antagonist-NR ligand-binding domain (LBD) complexes is of outstanding importance for our understanding of the structural principles, in particular of the ligand-induced allosteric alterations, that are at the basis of receptor action. The concomitant identification and functional analysis of co-regulators (TIFs, coactivators and co-repressors) previously predicted from squelching studies have provided the possibility to understand the propagation of the original signal from ligand binding through intramolecular allosteric effects to intermolecular interactions. Recent crystal data of receptor LBD heterodimers and LBD-agonist complexes with nuclear receptor interacting peptides of co-activators have provided molecular insights into receptor dimerization and receptor-coactivator interaction. Finally, analysis of the signalling compexes established over nuclear receptors, assembling enzymatic activities that can alter the acetylation status of chromatin at the promoter regions of target genes and (de)acetylate other transcription regulatory factors paves the way to a comprehension of receptor action at the chromatin level. But much remains to be learnt and the recent studies have pointed towards an enormous complexity of this signalling system. Insights into the mechanistic basis of promyelocytic leukemia and the role of retinoic acid in differentiation therapy have been obtained as a consequence of the above studies, justified the efforts and led to an increasing awareness of the nuclear receptor signalling systems in basic and applied research. Here we will review recent data with the focus on what we have learnt about the interplay between NR structure and function to provide a view of the early steps of nuclear receptor action.","['Gronemeyer, H', 'Miturski, R']","['Gronemeyer H', 'Miturski R']","['Institut de Genetique et de Biologie Moleculaire et Cellulaire (IGBMC), CNRS/INSERM/ULP, Illkirch, France. hg@igbmc.u-strasbg.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cell Mol Biol Lett,Cellular & molecular biology letters,9607427,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Dimerization', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Models, Biological', 'Models, Genetic', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Retinoids/*genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation']",2001/09/07 10:00,2002/01/18 10:01,['2001/09/07 10:00'],"['2001/09/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/07 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Mol Biol Lett. 2001;6(1):3-52.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Retinoids)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Murine NKT cells may directly kill tumor cells and induce NK cell cytotoxicity, but the mechanisms are not well defined. Newly developed human CD1d/alphaGalCer tetrameric complexes were used to obtain highly purified human alphaGalCer-reactive NKT cell lines (>99%), and the mechanisms of NKT cell cytotoxicity and activation of NK cells were investigated. Human NKT cells were cytotoxic against CD1d(-) neuroblastoma cells only when they were rendered CD1d(+) by transfection and pulsed with alphaGalCer. Four other CD1d(-) tumor cell lines of diverse origin were resistant to NKT cells, whereas Jurkat and U937 leukemia cell lines, which are constitutively CD1d(+), were killed. Killing of the latter was greatly augmented in the presence of alphaGalCer. Upon human CD1d/alphaGalCer recognition, NKT cells induced potent cytotoxicity of NK cells against CD1d(-) neuroblastoma cell lines that were not killed directly by NKT cells. NK cell activation depended upon NKT cell production of IL-2, and was enhanced by secretion of IFN-gamma. These data demonstrate that cytotoxicity of human NKT cells can be CD1d and ligand dependent, and that TCR-stimulated NKT cells produce IL-2 that is required to induce NK cell cytotoxicity. Thus, NKT cells can mediate potent antitumor activity both directly by targeting CD1d and indirectly by activating NK cells.","['Metelitsa, L S', 'Naidenko, O V', 'Kant, A', 'Wu, H W', 'Loza, M J', 'Perussia, B', 'Kronenberg, M', 'Seeger, R C']","['Metelitsa LS', 'Naidenko OV', 'Kant A', 'Wu HW', 'Loza MJ', 'Perussia B', 'Kronenberg M', 'Seeger RC']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Los Angeles and Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA 90027, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Antigens, CD1/*immunology', 'Antigens, CD1d', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/pathology', 'Cell Line/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Galactosylceramides/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunomagnetic Separation', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/metabolism', 'Interleukin-2/*physiology', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Ligands', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Melanoma/pathology', 'Mice', 'Neuroblastoma/pathology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/*immunology', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2001/09/07 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/07 10:00'],"['2001/09/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.167.6.3114 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Sep 15;167(6):3114-22. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.167.6.3114.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, CD1)', '0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD1D protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Galactosylceramides)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'WX671898JF (KRN 7000)']",,"['AI45053/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA22794/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA45284/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA81403/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA09683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Competitive repopulation assays were performed to quantify the proliferative advantage of Nf1(-/-) hematopoietic cells in vivo. Nf1 mutant stem cells demonstrated a growth advantage that was greatest in myeloid lineage cells and least pronounced in T lymphocytes. Surprisingly, although low numbers of Nf1-deficient cells consistently outcompeted wild-type cells, levels of chimerism were stable over months of observation, and MPD was not observed unless threshold numbers of mutant cells were injected. These data showing that normal competitor cells can strongly modulate the growth of mutant populations in vivo have general implications for modeling cancer in the mouse. In particular, strains in which cancer-associated mutations are expressed in fields of target cells may not accurately model early events in tumorigenesis because they eliminate the requirement for a mutant clone to outcompete resident normal cells.","['Zhang, Y', 'Taylor, B R', 'Shannon, K', 'Clapp, D W']","['Zhang Y', 'Taylor BR', 'Shannon K', 'Clapp DW']","['Wells Center for Pediatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adoptive Transfer', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chimera', 'Female', '*Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Liver/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Organ Size', 'Spleen/cytology', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Survival Rate']",2001/09/07 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/09/07 10:00'],"['2001/09/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI12758 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 2001 Sep;108(5):709-15. doi: 10.1172/JCI12758.,,,"['R29 CA074177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA72624/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA74177/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC209383,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because PUFAs induce apoptosis of different cells, we studied the effect of various PUFAs, such as arachidonic acid (AA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), on the fate of cultured human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60) to elucidate the mechanism of apoptosis and the difference in action between n-3 and n-6 PUFAs. Fairly low concentrations of PUFAs inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells and induced their apoptosis by a mechanism that is sensitive to DMSO, an antioxidant, and z-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (z-VAD-fmk), a pan-caspase inhibitor. PUFAs stimulated the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activated various types of caspase-like proteases, such as caspase-3, -6, -8, and -9, but not caspase-1. In addition, PUFAs triggered the reaction leading to the cleavage of Bid, a death agonist member of the Bcl-2 family, and also released cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. PUFAs also decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential of intact HL-60 cells. All of these actions of n-3 PUFAs were stronger than those of AA, an n-6 PUFA, although the mechanism is not known. PUFAs stimulate swelling and membrane depolarization of isolated mitochondria in a cyclosporin A-sensitive manner. The results indicated that PUFA-induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells may be caused, in part, by direct action on the cells and by activation of the caspase cascade through cytochrome c release coupled with mitochondrial membrane depolarization.","['Arita, K', 'Kobuchi, H', 'Utsumi, T', 'Takehara, Y', 'Akiyama, J', 'Horton, A A', 'Utsumi, K']","['Arita K', 'Kobuchi H', 'Utsumi T', 'Takehara Y', 'Akiyama J', 'Horton AA', 'Utsumi K']","['Department of Biological Chemistry, Faculty of Agriculture, Yamaguchi University, 753-8515, Yamaguchi, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Cytochrome c Group/metabolism', 'DNA/drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-6', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Membrane Potentials/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/enzymology', 'Triglycerides/*pharmacology']",2001/09/07 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/09/07 10:00'],"['2001/09/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-2952(01)00723-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00723-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 2001 Oct 1;62(7):821-8. doi: 10.1016/s0006-2952(01)00723-7.,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cytochrome c Group)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-6)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '100085-40-3 (Pikasol)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HQ-induced apoptosis in both cell types was accompanied by phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, caspases-3/-7 activation, PARP cleavage, DNA fragmentation, and ultrastructural changes as assessed by electron microscopy. In HL-60 cells, the general caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD.FMK) blocked activation of caspases-3/-7, cleavage of PARP, and DNA, but PS externalization and cytoplasmic changes were not significantly affected. In marked contrast, all features of apoptosis were completely inhibited by Z-VAD.FMK in HQ-treated Jurkat cells. These data provide evidence for Z-VAD.FMK-insensitive and caspases-3/-7-independent pathway(s) in the externalization of PS and cytoplasmic changes during HQ-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells. In contrast, in Jurkat cells, all of these changes required caspase activation. The ability of HQ to induce equivalent apoptosis in both MPO-deficient Jurkat cells and MPO-rich HL-60 cells demonstrates that MPO-catalyzed bioactivation of HQ is not a prerequisite for toxicity. The differential mechanisms of apoptosis in HL-60 and Jurkat T cells may reflect the MPO activity of these cells and, as a result, the amount of reactive BQ and other metabolites that are generated.","['Inayat-Hussain, S H', 'Winski, S L', 'Ross, D']","['Inayat-Hussain SH', 'Winski SL', 'Ross D']","['Molecular Toxicology and Environmental Health Sciences Program, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, Colorado 80262, USA. salmann@medic.ukm.my']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,0416575,IM,"['Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/*pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', '*Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Jurkat Cells/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Peroxidase/*metabolism']",2001/09/07 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/09/07 10:00'],"['2001/09/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/07 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/taap.2001.9221 [doi]', 'S0041-008X(01)99221-X [pii]']",ppublish,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol. 2001 Sep 1;175(2):95-103. doi: 10.1006/taap.2001.9221.,"['0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there is a growing body of evidence that a considerable fraction of cells surviving radiation exposure appear normal, but a variety of mutational changes arise in their progeny due to a transmissible genomic instability. In our investigations of G-banded metaphases, non-clonal cytogenetic aberrations, predominantly chromatid-type aberrations, have been observed in the clonal descendants of murine and human haemopoietic stem cells surviving low doses (approximately l track per cell) of alpha-particle irradiations. The data are consistent with a transmissible genetic instability induced in a stem cell resulting in a diversity of chromosomal aberrations in its clonal progeny many cell divisions later. Recent studies have demonstrated that the instability phenotype persists in vivo and that the expression of chromosomal instability has a strong dependence on the genetic characteristics of the irradiated cell. At the time when cytogenetic aberrations are detected, an increased incidence of hprt mutations and apoptotic cells have been observed in the clonal descendants of (alpha-irradiated murine haemopoietic stem cells. Thus, delayed chromosomal abnormalities, delayed cell death by apoptosis and late-arising specific gene mutations may reflect diverse consequences of radiation-induced genomic instability. The relationship, if any, between these effects is not established. Current studies suggest that expression of these delayed heritable effects is determined by the type of radiation exposure, type of cell and a variety of genetic factors.","['Kadhim, M A', 'Wright, E G']","['Kadhim MA', 'Wright EG']","['Radiation and Genome Stability Unit, Medical Research Council, Harwell, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Adv Space Res,Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR),9878935,,"['*Alpha Particles', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Cell Cycle/radiation effects', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Metaphase', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains']",2001/09/07 10:00,2001/09/11 10:01,['2001/09/07 10:00'],"['2001/09/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0273-1177(98)00081-7 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Space Res. 1998;22(4):587-96. doi: 10.1016/s0273-1177(98)00081-7.,['EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,['NASA: 00024899'],,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, the late effects of A-bomb radiation on mortality appear to be limited to an increase in malignant tumors. At present, it can be shown that cancers of the breast, colon, esophagus, lungs, stomach, thyroid, and urinary tract as well as leukemia and multiple myeloma increase in frequency with an increase in exposure. No significant relationship to radiation can as yet be established for malignant lymphoma, nor cancers of the rectum, pancreas or uterus. Radiation induced malignancies other than leukemia seem to develop proportionally to the natural cancer rate for the attained age. For specific age-at-death intervals, both relative and absolute risks tend to be higher for those of younger age at the time of bombing. Other late effects include radiation-related lenticular opacities, disturbances of growth among those survivors still growing at the time of exposure, and mental retardation and small head sizes among the in utero exposed. Chromosomal abnormalities too are more frequently encountered in the peripheral leukocytes of survivors, and this increase is functionally related to their exposure. Some uncertainty continues to surround both the quantity and quality of the radiation released by these two nuclear devices, particularly the Hiroshima bomb. A recent reassessment suggests that the gamma radiation estimates which have been used in the past may be too low at some distances and the neutron radiation estimates too high at all distances; moreover, the energies of the neutrons released now appear ""softer"" than previously conjectured. These uncertainties are not sufficiently large, however, to compromise the reality of the increased frequency of malignancy, but make estimates of the dose response, particularly in terms of gamma and neutron exposures, tentative.","['Schull, W J']",['Schull WJ'],"['Center for Demographic and Population Genetics, University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston 77025, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Adv Space Res,Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR),9878935,,"['Age Factors', 'Cataract/epidemiology/etiology', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/radiation effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gamma Rays', 'Growth/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/*etiology', '*Neutrons', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Survivors']",1983/01/01 00:00,2001/09/11 10:01,['1983/01/01 00:00'],"['1983/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '1983/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0273-1177(83)90193-x [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Space Res. 1983;3(8):231-9. doi: 10.1016/0273-1177(83)90193-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NASA: 00024930'],,,,,,,,,,,

In certain individuals, however, such continuous cycles of damage and repair provide an essential inductive environment for selected types of hematopathologies, e.g., myeloid leukemia (ML). In our laboratory we have been studying temporal and causal relationships between hematopoietic capacity, associated repair functions, and propensities for hematologic disease in canines under variable levels of chronic radiation stress (0.3-26.3 cGy d-1). Results indicate that the maximum exposure rate tolerated by the hematopoietic system is highly individual-specific (three major responding subgroups identified) and is based largely on the degree to which repair capacity, and, in turn, hematopoietic restoration, is augmented under chronic exposure. In low-tolerance individuals (prone to aplastic anemia, subgroup 1), the failure to augment basic repair functions seemingly results in a progressive accumulation of genetic and cellular damage within vital progenitorial marrow compartments (particularly marked within erythroid compartments) that results in loss of reproductive capacity and ultimately in collapse of the hematopoietic system. The high-tolerance individuals (radioaccomodated and either prone- or not prone to ML, subgroup 2 & 3) appear to minimize the accumulating damage effect of daily exposures by extending repair functions, which preserves reproductive integrity and fosters regenerative hematopoietic responses. As the strength of the regenerative response manifests the extent of repair augmentation, the relatively strong response of high- tolerance individuals progressing to patent ML suggests an insufficiency of repair quality rather than repair quantity. The kinetics of these repair-mediated, regenerative hematopoietic responses within the major subgroups are under study and should provide useful insights into the nature of hematopoietic accommodation (or its failure) under greatly extended periods of chronic, low-daily-dose ionizing radiation exposure.","['Seed, T M']",['Seed TM'],"['Radiation Hematology, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL 60439, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Adv Space Res,Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR),9878935,,"['Anemia, Aplastic/etiology/*mortality/physiopathology', 'Animals', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dogs', 'Female', '*Gamma Rays', 'Granulocytes/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic System/cytology/*radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*mortality/physiopathology', 'Macrophages/radiation effects', 'Male', 'Survival Rate', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1996/01/01 00:00,2001/09/11 10:01,['1996/01/01 00:00'],"['1996/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '1996/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0273-1177(95)00792-d [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Space Res. 1996;18(1-2):65-70. doi: 10.1016/0273-1177(95)00792-d.,['0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,['NASA: 00019405'],,,,,,,,,,,

Damage to the hematopoietic system is emphasized, but results on acute lethality, host response to challenge with transplanted leukemia cells and life-shortening are presented. Low dose rates per fraction were used in some neutron experiments. Split-dose lethality studies (LD 50/30) with fission neutrons indicated greater accumulation of injury during a 9 fraction course (over 17 days) than was the case for gamma-radiation. When total doses of 96 or 247 cGy of neutrons or gamma rays were given as a single dose or in 9 fractions, a significant sparing effect on femur CFU-S depression was observed for both radiation qualities during the first 11 days, but there was not an earlier return to normal with dose fractionation. During the 9 fraction sequence, a significant sparing effect of low dose rate on CFU-S depression was observed in both neutron and gamma-irradiated mice. CFU-S content at the end of the fractionation sequence did not correlate with measured LD 50/30. Sustained depression of femur and spleen CFU-S and a significant thrombocytopenia were observed when a total neutron dose of 240 cGy was given in 72 fractions over 24 weeks at low dose rates. The temporal aspects of CFU-S repopulation were different after a single versus fractionated neutron doses. The sustained reduction in the size of the CFU-S population was accompanied by an increase in the fraction in DNA synthesis. The proliferation characteristics and effects of age were different for radial CFU-S population closely associated with bone, compared with the axial population that can be readily aspirated from the femur. In aged irradiated animals, the CFU-S proliferation/redistribution response to typhoid vaccine showed both an age and radiation effect. After high single doses of neutrons or gamma rays, a significant age- and radiation-related deficiency in host defense mechanisms was detected by a shorter mean survival time following challenge with transplantable leukemia cells. Comparison of dose-response curves for life shortening after irradiation with fission-spectrum neutrons or high energy silicon particles indicated high initial slopes for both radiation qualities at low doses, but for higher doses of silicon, the effect per Gy decreased to a value similar to that for gamma rays. The two component life-shortening curve for silicon particles has implications for the potential efficacy of radioprotectants. Recent studies on protection against early and late effects by aminothiols, prostaglandins, and other compounds are discussed.","['Ainsworth, E J', 'Afzal, S M', 'Crouse, D A', 'Hanson, W R', 'Fry, R J']","['Ainsworth EJ', 'Afzal SM', 'Crouse DA', 'Hanson WR', 'Fry RJ']","['Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Adv Space Res,Advances in space research : the official journal of the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR),9878935,,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'DNA/metabolism/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Femur/pathology/radiation effects', 'Gamma Rays/adverse effects', 'Hematopoietic System/pathology/*radiation effects', '*Linear Energy Transfer', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neutrons/adverse effects', 'Photons/*adverse effects', 'Radiation Injuries, Experimental/pathology', 'Radiation Protection/methods/*standards', 'Space Flight', 'Spleen/pathology/radiation effects', 'Time Factors']",1989/01/01 00:00,2001/09/11 10:01,['1989/01/01 00:00'],"['1989/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/11 10:01 [medline]', '1989/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0273-1177(89)90453-5 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Space Res. 1989;9(10):299-313. doi: 10.1016/0273-1177(89)90453-5.,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],63,"['1F06TW00980-01/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 15184/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,['NASA: 00011768'],,['NASA'],"['NASA Discipline Number 04-10', 'NASA Discipline Radiation Health', 'NASA Program Biomedical Research', 'Non-NASA Center']",['Ainsworth EJ'],"['Ainsworth, E J']","['U CA, Berkeley, Lawrence Berkeley Lab']",['NASA: Grant numbers: T7163B'],,,,

Initial standards were based on the absence of observable harm, notably skin erythema, but have since been modified as other concerns, such as leukemia and genetic effects, became more important. More recently, the general carcinogenic effect of radiation has become the principal concern at low doses. Genetic effects are also of concern in the younger individual. Modern radiation protection practices take both of these risks into account. Quantification of these risks improves as new information emerges. The study of the Japanese survivors of the atomic bombs continues to yield new information and the recent revisions in the dosimetry are about to be completed. The special circumstances of space travel suggest approaches to limits not unlike those for radiation workers on the ground. One approach is to derive a career limit based on the risks of accident faced by many nonradiation workers in a lifetime. The career limit can be apportioned according to the type of mission.

Since the HTLV-I-encoded transactivator Tax has been shown to activate many cellular genes including cytokine genes interleukin (IL-)1alpha, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 15, we ask whether Tax also affects IL-4 expression. In this study, we show that addition of recombinant Tax proteins greatly enhances IL-4 secretion in human peripheral primary T cells. Transient transfection studies showed that ectopic expression of Tax significantly enhanced IL-4 promoter activity. The IL-4 promoter contains a strong NF-IL6 (PRE-I element) and a NF-AT/NF-kappaB overlapping site (P1 element). We show that expression of Tax stimulates NF-IL6 binding to the PRE-I element and, consequently, enhances PRE-I-mediated transcriptional activity. Using Jurkat T cell lines which stably express Tax fused to the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (ER), we show that Tax enhances endogenous IL-4 mRNA expression and increases IL-4 promoter activity in a hormone-dependent manner. Mutation analysis revealed that the IL-4 PRE-I (NF-IL6 site) and the P1 (NF-AT/NF-kappaB site) are involved in Tax-mediated transactivation.

Targeted therapy with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and anthracycline-based chemotherapy results in an apparent cure in 70-80% of patients. Both allogeneic (ALLO) and autologous (AUTO) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are effective in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but their role in APL is not clear given the excellent outcome with ATRA and chemotherapy. Several retrospective studies have analyzed the outcome of patients undergoing AUTO or ALLO-HSCT in first (CR1) or second (CR2) complete remission. Most of these studies have shown significant transplant-related mortality (TRM) with ALLO-HSCT, but a reduction in relapse rate compared with AUTO-HSCT. The high TRM with ALLO-HSCT and the excellent outcome with ATRA and chemotherapy do not justify recommending this procedure for the majority of patients in CR1. The role of AUTO-HSCT in CR1 also is unclear. A small subset of patients at high risk of relapse, possibly identifiable by a high white blood cell count at presentation may benefit from HSCT. Most patients with relapsed disease achieve CR2 with ATRA, arsenic trioxide, or combination therapy. However, it is not known if these responses are sustained or if consolidation with HSCT has a place in this setting. The outcome of AUTO-HSCT in CR2 using stem cells that are negative for PML-RARalpha is excellent. It is unclear whether ALLO-HSCT from an HLA-identical sibling is superior to AUTO-HSCT with PML-RARalpha-negative cells in CR2 since the former would be associated with graft-versus-leukemia effects and the latter with lower TRM. Alternatively, arsenic trioxide or re-treatment with ATRA, followed by intensive chemotherapy may also be effective. A randomized prospective clinical trial, or a retrospective analysis of the available data would be useful in answering this critical question.","['Nabhan, C', 'Mehta, J', 'Tallman, M S']","['Nabhan C', 'Mehta J', 'Tallman MS']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Medicine, Northwestern University Medical School, Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chicago, IL 60611, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/mortality/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tretinoin/therapeutic use']",2001/09/06 10:00,2002/03/08 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703119 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Aug;28(3):219-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703119.,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],66,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Minimal residual disease (MRD) was analyzed before SCT in 30 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The aim was to determine whether the level of MRD before transplantation was correlated with outcome. Fifteen patients were found to have high-level MRD (10(-2) to 10(-3)), 10 had low-level MRD (< 10(-3)), and 5 were MRD(-). Among MRD(-) patients the probability of relapse was 0 in 5, which was less than in MRD(+) patients (13 of 25) (P =.05). No major difference was found between the high- and low-level MRD(+) groups. Among the MRD(+) patients, only 2 of 11 with acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease had a relapse, versus 11 of 14 without (P =.005). In conclusion, for patients entering transplantation while they have residual disease, a combination of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease may be needed to decrease the risk of relapse after SCT.","['Uzunel, M', 'Mattsson, J', 'Jaksch, M', 'Remberger, M', 'Ringden, O']","['Uzunel M', 'Mattsson J', 'Jaksch M', 'Remberger M', 'Ringden O']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, Karolinska Institute at Huddinge University Hospital, Huddinge, Sweden. mehmet.uzunel@impi.ki.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*complications', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*etiology/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/genetics/*therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/09/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.6.1982 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60966-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1982-4. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.6.1982.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Northern blot analysis showed that high levels of expression of murine TfR2 occurred in the liver, whereas expression of TfR1 in the liver was relatively low. During liver development, TfR2 was up-regulated and TfR1 was down-regulated. During erythrocytic differentiation of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells induced by dimethylsulfoxide, expression of TfR1 increased, whereas TfR2 decreased. In MEL cells, expression of TfR1 was induced by desferrioxamine, an iron chelator, and it was reduced by ferric nitrate. In contrast, levels of TfR2 were not affected by the cellular iron status. Reporter assay showed that GATA-1, an erythroid-specific transcription factor essential for erythrocytic differentiation at relatively early stages, enhanced TfR2 promoter activity. Interestingly, FOG-1, a cofactor of GATA-1 required for erythrocyte maturation, repressed the enhancement of the activity by GATA-1. Also, CCAAT-enhancer binding protein, which is abundant in liver, enhanced the promoter activity. Thus, tissue distribution of TfR2 was consistent with the reporter assays. Expression profiles of TfR2 were different from those of TfR1, suggesting unique functions for TfR2, which may be involved in iron metabolism, hepatocyte function, and erythrocytic differentiation.","['Kawabata, H', 'Germain, R S', 'Ikezoe, T', 'Tong, X', 'Green, E M', 'Gombart, A F', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Kawabata H', 'Germain RS', 'Ikezoe T', 'Tong X', 'Green EM', 'Gombart AF', 'Koeffler HP']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Medicine, Burns and Allen Research Institute, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Animals', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Erythrocytes/*physiology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Humans', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Tissue Distribution', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/09/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.6.1949 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60961-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1949-54. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.6.1949.,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Protein-alpha)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (TFR2 protein, human)', '0 (TFR2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,,['GENBANK/AF207741'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The deubiquitinating enzyme DUB-2 is induced in response to IL-2 but as yet its function has not been determined. The results of this study show that DUB-2 is expressed in human T-cell lymphotropic virus-I (HTLV-1)-transformed T cells that exhibit constitutive activation of the IL-2 JAK/STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) pathway, and when expressed in Ba/F3 cells DUB-2 markedly prolonged IL-2-induced STAT5 phosphorylation. Although DUB-2 did not enhance IL-2-mediated proliferation, when withdrawn from growth factor, cells expressing DUB-2 had sustained STAT5 phosphorylation and enhanced expression of IL-2-induced genes cis and c-myc. Moreover, DUB-2 expression markedly inhibited apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal allowing cells to survive. Taken together these data suggest that DUB-2 can enhance signaling through the JAK/STAT pathway, prolong lymphocyte survival, and, when constitutively expressed, may contribute to the activation of the JAK/STAT pathway observed in some transformed cells.","['Migone, T S', 'Humbert, M', 'Rascle, A', 'Sanden, D', ""D'Andrea, A"", 'Johnston, J A']","['Migone TS', 'Humbert M', 'Rascle A', 'Sanden D', ""D'Andrea A"", 'Johnston JA']","['DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Palo Alto, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cysteine Endopeptidases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism/physiology', '*Endopeptidases', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity', 'Humans', 'Immediate-Early Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leupeptins/pharmacology', '*Milk Proteins', 'Multienzyme Complexes/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism/physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Ubiquitins/metabolism']",2001/09/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.6.1935 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60959-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1935-41. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.6.1935.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Immediate-Early Proteins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Leupeptins)', '0 (Milk Proteins)', '0 (Multienzyme Complexes)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Ubiquitins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Dub2 protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Cysteine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.25.1 (Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex)', 'RF1P63GW3K (benzyloxycarbonylleucyl-leucyl-leucine aldehyde)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60/VCR, a multidrug-resistant human myeloid leukemia cell line, and wild-type HL-60 cells were used to study the impact of DT(388)-GM-CSF on metabolism of ceramide, a modulator of apoptosis. After 48 hours with DT(388)-GM-CSF (10 nM), ceramide levels in HL-60/VCR cells rose 6-fold and viability fell to 10%, whereas GM-CSF alone was without influence. Similar results were obtained in HL-60 cells. Examination of the time course revealed that protein synthesis decreased by about 50% and cellular ceramide levels increased by about 80% between 4 and 6 hours after addition of DT(388)-GM-CSF. By 6 hours this was accompanied by activation of caspase-9, followed by activation of caspase-3, cleavage of caspase substrates, and chromatin fragmentation. Hygromycin B and emetine failed to elevate ceramide levels or induce apoptosis at concentrations that inhibited protein synthesis by 50%. Exposure to C(6)-ceramide inhibited protein synthesis (EC(50) approximately 5 microM) and decreased viability (EC(50) approximately 6 microM). Sphingomyelinase treatment depleted sphingomyelin by about 10%, while increasing ceramide levels and inhibiting protein synthesis. Diphtheria toxin increased ceramide and decreased sphingomyelin in U-937 cells, a cell line extremely sensitive to diphtheria toxin; exposure to DT(388)-GM-CSF showed sensitivity at less than 1.0 pM.

High Km 5NT was expressed at diagnosis in the blast cells of 54% of patients. In univariate analysis, (1) patients whose blast cells contained high levels (values greater than the median value for total population) of high Km 5NT at diagnosis had significantly shorter disease-free survival (DFS) than patients with low levels of high Km 5NT (11 months versus 17.5 months, P =.02) and (2) high levels of high Km 5NT also predicted significantly shorter overall survival (15.7 months versus 39 months, P = .01) in young patients (< or = 57 years; median value for the entire population). In a multivariate analysis taking into account age, karyotype risk, and other factors found to have prognostic significance in univariate analysis, (1) high Km 5NT expression was an independent prognostic factor for DFS and (2) high levels of high Km 5NT also predicted significantly shorter overall survival in young patients.

HSPs chaperone a broad repertoire of endogenous peptides including tumor antigens. For the immunotherapy of tumors, a strategy using HSPs may be more advantageous than other procedures because the identification of each tumor-specific antigen is not necessary. In this study, the efficacy of immunotherapy against minimal residual leukemia cells using HSP preparations was evaluated. HSP70 and GP96 were purified from syngeneic leukemia cell line A20 and immunized into BALB/c mice during the reconstitution period of the immune system after syngeneic bone marrow transplantation. In this procedure, all mice not immunized were dead within 60 days of A20 inoculation, whereas the survival times of HSP-immunized mice were significantly prolonged. In addition, the depletion of either CD4(+) or CD8(+) T lymphocyte significantly abrogated this efficacy, indicating that both CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes were required for tumor cell rejection. Moreover, the vaccination of HSPs elicited a specific response of potent CD8(+) T lymphocytes cytotoxic against A20 in vitro. These observations suggest that immunization of the complex of HSPs and peptides derived from leukemia cells leads to immune responses. These immune responses are sufficient to reject minimal amounts of leukemia cells for relatively immunocompromised mice after syngeneic bone marrow transplantation.","['Sato, K', 'Torimoto, Y', 'Tamura, Y', 'Shindo, M', 'Shinzaki, H', 'Hirai, K', 'Kohgo, Y']","['Sato K', 'Torimoto Y', 'Tamura Y', 'Shindo M', 'Shinzaki H', 'Hirai K', 'Kohgo Y']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Asahikawa Medical College, Hokkaido, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vaccination']",2001/09/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.6.1852 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60948-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1852-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.6.1852.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (sarcoma glycoprotein gp96 rejection antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A prospective study of vWF protease activity was performed using samples from 20 healthy controls, 20 patients with acute TTP, 20 patients with immune idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), 10 patients with disseminated intravascular thrombocytopenia (DIC), 10 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE,) and 5 thrombocytopenic patients with leukemia. Studies were performed blinded to the diagnosis. Samples from hospitalized patients with normal platelet counts were also tested. The vWF digests and multimer analysis were done using previously described methods. Six laboratory personnel independently scored each of the multimer gels. Reduced protease activity was observed in 9 of 20 patients with TTP. Reduced activity was also observed in 6 of 20 patients with ITP, 6 of 10 patients with DIC, 5 of 10 patients with SLE, 1 of 5 patients with leukemia, 2 of 20 healthy controls, and 3 of 25 hospitalized patients. This study indicates that abnormalities of vWF protease activity are not restricted to patients with the diagnosis of TTP.","['Moore, J C', 'Hayward, C P', 'Warkentin, T E', 'Kelton, J G']","['Moore JC', 'Hayward CP', 'Warkentin TE', 'Kelton JG']","['Department of Medicine, Faculty of Health Science, McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/*blood', 'Humans', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/blood', 'Platelet Count', 'Prospective Studies', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/*blood', 'Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic/*blood', 'von Willebrand Factor/*metabolism']",2001/09/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.6.1842 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60946-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1842-6. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.6.1842.,['0 (von Willebrand Factor)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many downstream effectors of Bcr-Abl have been described, including activation of the Grb2-SoS-Ras-MAP kinase (Erk) pathway. The precise contributions of these signal-transduction proteins in CML blast cells in human patients are not yet well defined. To gain further insight into the importance of Grb2 for CML, peptides that disrupt Grb2-SoS complexes were tested. These high-affinity Grb2-binding peptides (HAGBPs) can autonomously shuttle into cells and function by binding to the N-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2. The HAGBPs were analyzed for their effects on Bcr-Abl-expressing cell lines and freshly isolated CML blast cells from patients. They induced a dramatic decrease in the proliferation of CML cell lines. This was not observed with point-mutated control peptides with abolished Grb2SH3(N) binding. As expected, Grb2-SoS complexes were greatly diminished in the HAGBP-treated cells, and MAP kinase activity was significantly reduced as determined by an activation-specific phospho-MAPK antibody. Furthermore, cell fractions that are enriched for blast cells from CML patients with active disease were also incubated with the Grb2 blocker peptides. The HAGBPs led to a significant proliferation reduction of these cells in the majority of the isolates, but not in all patients' cells. These results show that, in addition to the direct targeting of Bcr-Abl, selective inhibition of Grb2 protein complexes may be a therapeutic option for a significant number of CML patients.","['Kardinal, C', 'Konkol, B', 'Lin, H', 'Eulitz, M', 'Schmidt, E K', 'Estrov, Z', 'Talpaz, M', 'Arlinghaus, R B', 'Feller, S M']","['Kardinal C', 'Konkol B', 'Lin H', 'Eulitz M', 'Schmidt EK', 'Estrov Z', 'Talpaz M', 'Arlinghaus RB', 'Feller SM']","['Laboratory of Molecular Oncology, Institut fur Medizinishe Strahleukunde und Zellforschung, Universitat Wurzburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['3T3 Cells', '*Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Erythrocytes/physiology', 'GRB2 Adaptor Protein', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'Son of Sevenless Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'src Homology Domains']",2001/09/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.6.1773 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60938-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1773-81. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.6.1773.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (GRB2 Adaptor Protein)', '0 (GRB2 protein, human)', '0 (Grb2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Son of Sevenless Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent studies have indicated that an internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the FLT3 gene may adversely affect clinical outcome. This study evaluated the impact of a FLT3/ITD mutation on outcome in 854 patients, mostly 60 years of age or younger, treated in the United Kingdom Medical Research Council (MRC) AML trials. An FLT3/ITD mutation was present in 27% of the patients and was associated with leukocytosis and a high percentage of bone marrow blast cells (P <.001 for both). It had a borderline association with a lower complete remission rate (P =.05) and a higher induction death rate (P =.04), and was associated with increased relapse risk (RR), adverse disease-free survival (DFS), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) (P <.001 for all). In multivariate analysis, presence of a mutation was the most significant prognostic factor predicting RR and DFS (P <.0001) and was still significant for OS (P =.009) and EFS (P =.002). There was no evidence that the relative effect of a FLT3/ITD differed between the cytogenetic risk groups. More than one mutation was detected in 23% of FLT3/ITD(+) patients and was associated with worse OS (P =.04) and EFS (P =.07). Biallelic disease or partial/complete loss of wild-type alleles was present in 10% of FLT3/ITD(+) patients. The suggestion is made that detection of a FLT3/ITD should be included as a routine test at diagnosis and evaluated for therapeutic management.","['Kottaridis, P D', 'Gale, R E', 'Frew, M E', 'Harrison, G', 'Langabeer, S E', 'Belton, A A', 'Walker, H', 'Wheatley, K', 'Bowen, D T', 'Burnett, A K', 'Goldstone, A H', 'Linch, D C']","['Kottaridis PD', 'Gale RE', 'Frew ME', 'Harrison G', 'Langabeer SE', 'Belton AA', 'Walker H', 'Wheatley K', 'Bowen DT', 'Burnett AK', 'Goldstone AH', 'Linch DC']","['Department of Haematology, University College London, London, United Kingdom. p.kottaridis@ucl.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Duplication', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/*drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",2001/09/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.6.1752 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60935-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1752-9. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.6.1752.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is hypothesized that early immunophenotypical evaluation may help identify patients at high risk for relapse from those who may remain in complete remission (CR). Using multiparametric flow cytometry, the level of minimal residual disease (MRD) was evaluated in the first bone marrow (BM) in morphologic CR obtained after induction treatment from 126 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who displayed aberrant phenotypes at diagnosis. Based on MRD level, 4 different risk categories were identified: 8 patients were at very low risk (fewer than 10(-4) cells), and none have relapsed thus far; 37 were at low risk (10(-4) to 10(-3) cells); and 64 were at intermediate risk (fewer than 10(-3) to 10(-2) cells), with 3-year cumulative relapse rates of 14% and 50%, respectively. The remaining 17 patients were in the high-risk group (more than 10(-2) residual aberrant cells) and had a 3-year relapse rate of 84% (P =.0001). MRD level not only influences relapse-free survival but also overall survival (P =.003). The adverse prognostic impact was also observed when M3 and non-M3 patients with AML were separately analyzed, and was associated with adverse cytogenetic subtypes, 2 or more cycles to achieve CR, and high white blood cell counts. Multivariate analysis showed that MRD level was the most powerful independent prognostic factor, followed by cytogenetics and number of cycles to achieve CR. In conclusion, immunophenotypical investigation of MRD in the first BM in mCR obtained after AML induction therapy provides important information for risk assessment in patients with AML.","['San Miguel, J F', 'Vidriales, M B', 'Lopez-Berges, C', 'Diaz-Mediavilla, J', 'Gutierrez, N', 'Canizo, C', 'Ramos, F', 'Calmuntia, M J', 'Perez, J J', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Orfao, A']","['San Miguel JF', 'Vidriales MB', 'Lopez-Berges C', 'Diaz-Mediavilla J', 'Gutierrez N', 'Canizo C', 'Ramos F', 'Calmuntia MJ', 'Perez JJ', 'Gonzalez M', 'Orfao A']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital; Department of Cytometry, University of Salamanca, Spain. sanmigiz@gugu.usal.es']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Phenotype', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2001/09/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.6.1746 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60934-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1746-51. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.6.1746.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Large deletions on the derivative chromosome 9 have recently been reported, but it was unclear whether deletions arose during disease progression or at the time of the Ph translocation. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was used to assess the deletion status of 253 patients with CML. The strength of deletion status as a prognostic indicator was then compared to the Sokal and Hasford scoring systems. The frequency of deletions was similar at diagnosis and after disease progression but was significantly increased in patients with variant Ph translocations. In patients with a deletion, all Ph(+) metaphases carried the deletion. The median survival of patients with and without deletions was 38 months and 88 months, respectively (P =.0001). By contrast the survival difference between Sokal or Hasford high-risk and non-high-risk patients was of only borderline significance (P =.057 and P =.034). The results indicate that deletions occur at the time of the Ph translocation. An apparently simple reciprocal translocation may therefore result in considerable genetic heterogeneity ab initio, a concept that is likely to apply to other malignancies associated with translocations. Deletion status is also a powerful and independent prognostic factor for patients with CML. The prognostic significance of deletion status should now be studied prospectively and, if confirmed, should be incorporated into management decisions and the analysis of clinical trials.","['Huntly, B J', 'Reid, A G', 'Bench, A J', 'Campbell, L J', 'Telford, N', 'Shepherd, P', 'Szer, J', 'Prince, H M', 'Turner, P', 'Grace, C', 'Nacheva, E P', 'Green, A R']","['Huntly BJ', 'Reid AG', 'Bench AJ', 'Campbell LJ', 'Telford N', 'Shepherd P', 'Szer J', 'Prince HM', 'Turner P', 'Grace C', 'Nacheva EP', 'Green AR']","['Department of Hematology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9/ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate']",2001/09/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.6.1732 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60932-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1732-8. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.6.1732.,,,,,,,,['Blood. 2001 Nov 1;98(9):2879-80.

Preliminary results indicated a high remission induction rate with the human CD52 antibody, CAMPATH-1H. This study reports results in 39 patients with T-PLL treated with CAMPATH-1H between March 1993 and May 2000. All but 2 patients had received prior therapy with a variety of agents, including 30 with pentostatin; none achieved complete remission (CR). CAMPATH-1H (30 mg) was administered intravenously 3 times weekly until maximal response. The overall response rate was 76% with 60% CR and 16% partial remission (PR). These responses were durable with a median disease-free interval of 7 months (range, 4-45 months). Survival was significantly prolonged in patients achieving CR compared to PR or no response (NR), including one patient who survived 54 months. Nine patients remain alive up to 29 months after completing therapy. Seven patients received high-dose therapy with autologous stem cell support, 3 of whom remain alive in CR 5, 7, and 15 months after autograft. Stem cell harvests in these patients were uncontaminated with T-PLL cells as demonstrated by dual-color flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction. Four patients had allogeneic stem cell transplants, 3 from siblings and 1 from a matched unrelated donor. Two had nonmyeloablative conditioning. Three are alive in CR up to 24 months after allograft.

It was previously reported that the relapse risk of bcr-abl detection 6 to 12 months after transplantation was greater than 40%. This risk decreased as the time between transplantation and detection increased. To further define the relapse risk associated with bcr-abl molecular detection in ""late"" CML survivors, 379 consecutive CML patients alive at 18 months after transplantation or later were studied. Ninety of 379 patients (24%) had at least one positive bcr-abl test 18 months after transplantation or later; 13 of 90 bcr-abl-positive patients (14%) and 3 of 289 bcr-abl-negative patients (1.0%) relapsed. The median time from bcr-abl detection to relapse was 916 days (range, 251-2654 days). The hazard ratio of relapse associated with bcr-abl detection was 19.2 (P <.0001). The stage of disease, chronic graft-versus-host disease, and the donor type did not alter the association between bcr-abl and relapse. Quantification of bcr-abl was performed on 344 samples from 85 bcr-abl-positive patients by means of a real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. The median bcr-abl change of patients who relapsed was significantly greater than those that remained in remission (P =.002). The median bcr-abl level at relapse was 40 443 bcr-abl copies per microg RNA (range, 960-299 552). Of 73 bcr-abl-positive patients who failed to relapse, 69% had only one positive test at a median of 24 copies bcr-abl per microg RNA. The detection of bcr-abl is common following transplantation. The prognostic significance of a qualitative bcr-abl can be refined by quantitative assays and thus may target patients who would benefit from early intervention.","['Radich, J P', 'Gooley, T', 'Bryant, E', 'Chauncey, T', 'Clift, R', 'Beppu, L', 'Edmands, S', 'Flowers, M E', 'Kerkof, K', 'Nelson, R', 'Appelbaum, F R']","['Radich JP', 'Gooley T', 'Bryant E', 'Chauncey T', 'Clift R', 'Beppu L', 'Edmands S', 'Flowers ME', 'Kerkof K', 'Nelson R', 'Appelbaum FR']","['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA. jradich@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/metabolism/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Risk Factors']",2001/09/06 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/06 10:00'],"['2001/09/06 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/06 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.6.1701 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)60927-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 15;98(6):1701-7. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.6.1701.,"['0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,"['CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The efficacy of a combination of DNA plasmids encoding the nef, rev, and tat HIV-1 regulatory genes in inducing cellular immune responses was analyzed in asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients. Patients initially selected for having low or no detectable immune responses to Nef, Rev, or Tat antigens developed MHC class I-restricted cytolytic activities as well as enhanced bystander effects. The induction of memory cells against target cells infected with the whole HIV-1 genome was analyzed by using a pseudovirus HIV-1/murine leukemia virus (MuLV), and target cells infected with vaccinia virus carrying the respective gene. The most remarkable change observed after immunization with the gene combination was an increase in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) precursors to target cells infected with the whole HIV-1 genome. Infection by the pseudotype HIV-1/MuLV virus should result in a multitude of HIV-1 peptides presented on the target cell surface, representative of the in vivo situation. An in vitro assessment of the expression of the single and combined gene products showed that this was consistent with the induction of CTL responses in vivo.

Here, we show that distinct domains of ETO contact the mSin3A and N-CoR corepressors and define two binding sites within ETO for each of these corepressors. In addition, of eight histone deacetylases (HDACs) tested, only the class I HDACs HDAC-1, HDAC-2, and HDAC-3 bind ETO. However, these HDACs bind ETO through different domains. We also show that the murine homologue of MTG16, ETO-2, is also a transcriptional corepressor that works through a similar but distinct mechanism. Like ETO, ETO-2 interacts with N-CoR, but ETO-2 fails to bind mSin3A. Furthermore, ETO-2 binds HDAC-1, HDAC-2, and HDAC-3 but also interacts with HDAC-6 and HDAC-8. In addition, we show that expression of AML-1-ETO causes disruption of the cell cycle in the G(1) phase. Disruption of the cell cycle required the ability of AML-1-ETO to repress transcription because a mutant of AML-1-ETO, Delta469, which removes the majority of the corepressor binding sites, had no phenotype. Moreover, treatment of AML-1-ETO-expressing cells with trichostatin A, an HDAC inhibitor, restored cell cycle control. Thus, AML-1-ETO makes distinct contacts with multiple HDACs and an HDAC inhibitor biologically inactivates this fusion protein.","['Amann, J M', 'Nip, J', 'Strom, D K', 'Lutterbach, B', 'Harada, H', 'Lenny, N', 'Downing, J R', 'Meyers, S', 'Hiebert, S W']","['Amann JM', 'Nip J', 'Strom DK', 'Lutterbach B', 'Harada H', 'Lenny N', 'Downing JR', 'Meyers S', 'Hiebert SW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*chemistry/*metabolism/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors', 'Histone Deacetylases/*metabolism', 'Hydroxamic Acids/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism/physiology', 'Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Repressor Proteins/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex', 'Transcription Factors/antagonists & inhibitors/*chemistry/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/09/05 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/09/05 10:00'],"['2001/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.21.19.6470-6483.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Oct;21(19):6470-83. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.19.6470-6483.2001.,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Cbfa2t3 protein, mouse)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (NCOR1 protein, human)', '0 (Ncor1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Co-Repressor 1)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SIN3A transcription factor)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '3X2S926L3Z (trichostatin A)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Sin3 Histone Deacetylase and Corepressor Complex)']",,"['R01 CA077274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA071907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA71907/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA77274/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-AG13726/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA76186/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA068485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA68485/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-CA64140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA064140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC99794,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These results indicate that HTLV-1 spread is required for immortalization.","['Tsukahara, T', 'Wielgosz, M M', 'Ratner, L']","['Tsukahara T', 'Wielgosz MM', 'Ratner L']","['Department of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Glycoproteins/genetics', 'HTLV-I Infections/virology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Virulence/genetics', 'Virus Replication/genetics']",2001/09/05 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/05 10:00'],"['2001/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.19.9553-9559.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Oct;75(19):9553-9. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.19.9553-9559.2001.,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",,,,,,,,PMC114525,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In most patients, JMML has a progressive course leading to death by virtue of infection, bleeding, or progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). As it is known that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome have a markedly increased risk of developing JMML, we have previously developed a mouse model of JMML through reconstitution of lethally irradiated mice with hematopoietic stem cells homozygous for a loss-of-function mutation in the Nf1 gene (D. L. Largaespada, C. I. Brannan, N. A. Jenkins, and N. G. Copeland, Nat. Genet. 12:137-143, 1996). In the course of these experiments, we found that all these genetically identical reconstituted mice developed a JMML-like disorder, but only a subset went on to develop more acute disease. This result strongly suggests that additional genetic lesions are responsible for disease progression to AML. Here, we describe the production of a unique tumor panel, created using the BXH-2 genetic background, for identification of these additional genetic lesions. Using this tumor panel, we have identified a locus, Epi1, which maps 30 to 40 kb downstream of the Myb gene and appears to be the most common site of somatic viral integration in BXH-2 mice. Our findings suggest that proviral integrations at Epi1 cooperate with loss of Nf1 to cause AML.","['Blaydes, S M', 'Kogan, S C', 'Truong, B T', 'Gilbert, D J', 'Jenkins, N A', 'Copeland, N G', 'Largaespada, D A', 'Brannan, C I']","['Blaydes SM', 'Kogan SC', 'Truong BT', 'Gilbert DJ', 'Jenkins NA', 'Copeland NG', 'Largaespada DA', 'Brannan CI']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Center for Mammalian Genetics, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida 32610, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Animals', 'Gene Deletion', 'Genes, Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Genes, myb', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology/*genetics/virology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/*genetics/virology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Virus Integration/genetics']",2001/09/05 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/05 10:00'],"['2001/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.19.9427-9434.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Oct;75(19):9427-34. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.19.9427-9434.2001.,,,"['U01 CA084221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA75986/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA84221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC114510,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SU contains a discrete N-terminal receptor binding domain (RBD) that is connected to the remainder of Env by a short, proline-rich segment. Previous studies suggest that after receptor binding, the RBD interacts directly with the remainder of Env to trigger fusion (A. L. Barnett, R. A. Davey, and J. M. Cunningham, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 98:4113-4118, 2001). To investigate the role of the RBD in activating fusion, we compared infection by several MLVs that are defective unless rescued in trans by the addition of soluble RBD to the culture medium. Infection by MLV lacking a critical histidine residue near the N terminus of the viral RBD is dependent on the expression of receptors for both the RBD in the viral Env and the soluble RBD supplied in trans. However, infection by MLVs in which the RBD has been deleted or replaced by the ligand erythropoietin are dependent only on expression of the receptor for the soluble RBD. We were able to expand the host range of xenotropic MLV to nonpermissive murine fibroblasts only if the RBD was deleted from the xenotropic viral envelope and the soluble RBD from ecotropic Friend MLV was supplied to the culture medium. These findings indicate that receptor binding transforms the RBD from an inhibitor to an activator of the viral fusion mechanism and that viruses lacking the critical histidine residue at the N terminus of the RBD are impaired at the activation step.","['Barnett, A L', 'Cunningham, J M']","['Barnett AL', 'Cunningham JM']","[""Department of Medicine and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Gene Products, env/chemistry/*physiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Virus Replication']",2001/09/05 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/05 10:00'],"['2001/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.19.9096-9105.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Oct;75(19):9096-105. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.19.9096-9105.2001.,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)']",,,,,,,,PMC114478,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We recently identified two cellular proteins, FeLIX and Pit1, required for productive infection by these immunodeficiency-inducing FeLV-T variants (M. M. Anderson, A. S. Lauring, C. C. Burns, and J. Overbaugh, Science 287:1828-1830, 2000). FeLV-T is the first example of a naturally occurring type C retrovirus that requires two proteins to gain entry into target cells. FeLIX is an endogenous protein that is highly related to the N-terminal portion of the FeLV envelope protein, which includes the receptor-binding domain. Pit1 is a multiple-transmembrane phosphate transport protein that also functions as a receptor for FeLV-B. The FeLV-B envelope gene is derived by recombination with endogenous FeLV-like sequences, and its product can functionally substitute for FeLIX in facilitating entry through the Pit1 receptor. In the present study, we tested other retrovirus envelope surface units (SUs) with their cognate receptors to determine whether they also could mediate infection by FeLV-T. Cells were engineered to coexpress the transmembrane form of the envelope proteins and their cognate receptors, or SU protein was added as a soluble protein to cells expressing the receptor. Of the FeLV, murine leukemia virus, and gibbon ape leukemia virus envelopes tested, we found that only those with receptor-binding domains derived from endogenous FeLV could render cells permissive for FeLV-T. We also found that there is a strong preference for Pit1 as the transmembrane receptor. Specifically, FeLV-B SUs could efficiently mediate infection of cells expressing the Pit1 receptor but could only inefficiently mediate infection of cells expressing the Pit2 receptor, even though these SUs are able to bind to Pit2. Expression analysis of feline Pit1 and FeLIX suggests that FeLIX is likely the primary determinant of FeLV-T tropism. These results are discussed in terms of current models for retrovirus entry and the interrelationship among FeLV variants that evolve in vivo.","['Lauring, A S', 'Anderson, M M', 'Overbaugh, J']","['Lauring AS', 'Anderson MM', 'Overbaugh J']","['Program in Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Washington, Seattle, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/*physiology', 'Membrane Proteins/*physiology', 'Organ Specificity', 'Receptors, Virus/*physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/*virology', 'Transcription Factor Pit-1', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*virology', 'Virus Replication']",2001/09/05 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/05 10:00'],"['2001/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.75.19.8888-8898.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Oct;75(19):8888-98. doi: 10.1128/JVI.75.19.8888-8898.2001.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FeLIX protein, feline leukemia virus)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (POU1F1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Transcription Factor Pit-1)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,"['R01 CA051080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2 T32 CA09229/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 51080/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC114457,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aimed to achieve this by the application of interphase cytogenetics to marrow trephine sections, a technique not previously reported for formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded trephine biopsies. METHODS: Dual colour fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) was used to detect numerical and structural abnormalities in routinely processed paraffin wax embedded trephine biopsies. Three cases with t(8;21) and three with t(15;17) were analysed, together with a case of trisomy 8. Chromosome specific probes were hybridised with sections and disclosed by fluorescein isothiocyanate and rhodamine/Texas red labelled antidigoxigenin and antibiotin amplification; translocations were identified by colocalisation of probes using a double wavelength bypass filter. RESULTS: A translocation signal was present in 12% and 11.5% of the cells counted in the t(8;21) and t(15;17) cases, respectively, but in none of the normal controls (p < 0.001). In the case of trisomy 8, 9% of the cells counted contained three hybridisation signals for chromosome 8, whereas no cell contained more than two in the normal control (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This technique is useful for archived routinely processed material, enabling it to be used as a research tool but also, and perhaps more importantly, in clinical practice.","['Le Maitre, C L', 'Byers, R J', 'Liu Yin, J A', 'Hoyland, J A', 'Freemont, A J']","['Le Maitre CL', 'Byers RJ', 'Liu Yin JA', 'Hoyland JA', 'Freemont AJ']","['Laboratory of Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Manchester, Manchester M13 9PT, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Paraffin Embedding', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Trisomy']",2001/09/05 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/09/05 10:00'],"['2001/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.54.9.730 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 2001 Sep;54(9):730-3. doi: 10.1136/jcp.54.9.730.,,,,,,,,,PMC1731524,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different techniques have been used to detect N-ras mutations; however, most of them are either labor intensive or provide sequence data for only a limited number of codons. Consequently, study of the N-ras oncogene has not been convenient in every day clinical practice being restricted, as a rule, to retrospective analysis of patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study we used a recently developed method that enables rapid and reliable detection of mutations at the cDNA level, namely, the non-isotopic RNase cleavage assay (NIRCA). Using this method we were able to screen the N-ras oncogene rapidly and determine the incidence and prognostic significance of N-ras mutations in 77 Greek patients with acute leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and chronic myeloproliferative disorders, both at the presentation and during relapse or progression of the disease. RESULTS: Activating N-ras mutations were detected in 7 patients and our results were confirmed by direct sequencing. Interestingly, two novel alterations were identified, a mutation at codon 8 (characterized by a substitution of valine by leucine) in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia during hematologic relapse of the disease and a polymorphism at codon 92 (1002T-->C, without amino acid substitution) in a patient with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: A rapid and easy protocol that allows the analyses of N-ras sequences has been developed. This reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)/NIRCA protocol can allow the study of this proto-oncogene in every day clinical practice, rapidly facilitating the validation of the diagnostic and prognostic value of N-ras mutational analyses in patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Speletas, M', 'Arvanitidi, K', 'Tzoanopoulos, D', 'Tsironidou, V', 'Pardali, E', 'Aggeli, C', 'Tsapogas, P', 'Kartalis, G', 'Sideras, P', 'Ritis, K']","['Speletas M', 'Arvanitidi K', 'Tzoanopoulos D', 'Tsironidou V', 'Pardali E', 'Aggeli C', 'Tsapogas P', 'Kartalis G', 'Sideras P', 'Ritis K']","['First Department of Internal medicine, Democritus University of Thrace, Alexandroupolis, Greece. speletas@otenet.gr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/methods', 'Endoribonucleases/metabolism', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Greece', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction/*standards', 'Time Factors']",2001/09/05 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2001/09/05 10:00'],"['2001/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Sep;86(9):918-27.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', 'EC 3.1.- (Endoribonucleases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used sodium bisulfite sequencing to obtain a complete map of the 5-methylcytosine status of 80 CpGs covering approximately 900 bp in the 5' p15 CpG island, and 53 CpGs covering approximately 700 bp in the 5' p16 CpG island in the hematopoietic cell lines HL60, KG-1, and KG-1a, two normal human bone marrow samples (NBM), and eight cytosine arabinoside (ara-C)-resistant adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. We found methylation of the p15 CpG island in 75% of the AML cases studied spread throughout the 5' region analyzed but only minimal methylation of p15 in NBM. Further, the p16 CpG island was not aberrantly methylated in NBM or the eight AML patients studied. Two distinct modes of p15 methylation in AML were identified, variegated and complete. Interestingly, KG-1 and KG-1a model the methylation of p15 observed in AML, where KG-1 methylation is variegated and KG-1a methylation is complete. Both KG-1 and KG-1a had no detectable p15 mRNA or protein. These results demonstrate that rather than continuous increases in p15 methylation, surprisingly two punctuated modes of aberrant p15 methylation, variegated and complete, were observed in vitro and in vivo. Thus aberrant methylation of tumor suppressor genes is not a binary switch but in the case of p15 occurs in two independent and stable states.","['Dodge, J E', 'Munson, C', 'List, A F']","['Dodge JE', 'Munson C', 'List AF']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Arizona, Arizona Cancer Center, Tucson, AZ 85724-5024, USA. dodge@cvrc.mgh.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Bone Marrow', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', '*CpG Islands', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA Primers/chemistry', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Histones/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sulfites', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/09/05 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/09/05 10:00'],"['2001/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145-2126(01)00053-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00053-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Oct;25(10):917-25. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00053-4.,"['0 (CDKN2B protein, human)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p15)', '0 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p16)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Sulfites)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'TZX5469Z6I (sodium bisulfite)']",,['3P30 CA 23074-19/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following treatment with Ara-C or VP-16 in vitro, caspase 3 activity in leukemic cells was consistently reduced by co-culture of leukemic cells with human bone marrow stromal cell layers.

Low concentrations of dCTP facilitate the phosphorylation of 1-beta-D arabinofuranosyl cytosine (araC) and the incorporation of arabinofuranosyl cytosine triphosphate (araCTP) into DNA. Apoptosis and necrosis were analyzed by flow cytometric detection of fluorescence-labeled Annexin V in a human T-lymphoblastic MOLT-3 cell-line after incubations with CPEC and/or araC. CPEC induced apoptosis and necrosis in a concentration- (50-300 nM) and time-dependent (8-16 h) way. The observed necrosis proved to be secondary to apoptosis as the caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk) completely blocked the CPEC-induced apoptosis and necrosis. Coincubation of various concentrations of CPEC and araC for 16h showed a significant additive effect on the occurrence of apoptosis and (secondary) necrosis. In contrast, a preincubation with 37.5 nM of CPEC for 24 h, which by itself caused only minor apoptosis (4%), followed by a coincubation for 16 h with 62.5 nM of araC (7% of apoptotic cells), showed a synergistic effect on the induction of apoptosis (27%, P<0.001). Growth-inhibition experiments with CPEC and araC under various conditions showed an additive effect on the araC-induced growth-inhibition after 48 h. The results indicate that the cytotoxicity of araC can be increased in T-lymphoblasts by CPEC.","['Verschuur, A C', 'Brinkman, J', 'Van Gennip, A H', 'Leen, R', 'Vet, R J', 'Evers, L M', 'Voute, P A', 'Van Kuilenburg, A B']","['Verschuur AC', 'Brinkman J', 'Van Gennip AH', 'Leen R', 'Vet RJ', 'Evers LM', 'Voute PA', 'Van Kuilenburg AB']","['Laboratory of Genetic Metabolic Diseases, Divisions of Clinical Chemistry and Pediatrics, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, Emma Kinderziekenhuis AMC, P.O.

Concomitantly, we observed a decrease in glucose oxidation and the synthesis of glutamate, palmitate and stearate from glucose. Our results demonstrate that this organophosphate pesticide exerts a leukemogenic effect by the recruitment of glucose carbons for nucleic acid synthesis thus promoting proliferation simultaneous with poor differentiation.

The clinical relevance of the loss of FHIT expression in ALL is not known. We used western blot and solid-phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) to analyze Fhit protein expression in 90 patients with ALL. Eighteen (20%) of the tested patients had severely reduced Fhit protein (undetectable by western blot), and 43 patients (47%) had levels lower than those detected in normal bone marrows. Interestingly, seven patients (8%) expressed very high levels (>two-fold the level detected in normal bone marrow). A parallel pattern of FHIT RNA expression was also observed. Of the 90 patients, 39 received induction therapy consisting of hyper-CVAD (hyperfractionated cyclophosphamide, vencristine, adriamycine, and dexamethasone) and were followed in our institution. Patients with low Fhit protein levels showed no statistically significant difference in survival or complete remission duration (CRD) from patients with normal levels (P=0.12 and 0.24, respectively). Our study confirms that FHIT is aberrantly expressed in ALL, but suggests it does not have a role as a prognostic factor.

Since a serious environmental contamination of areas in this locality with armament wastes containing toluene-derivatives has been known for a long time, the hypothesis arose that TNT production and the related severe contamination of soil and water might be responsible for the observed higher risk. We carried out a case-control study within the cluster to test this hypothesis. Overall, the results do not confirm the hypothesis. There is an indication of a relationship of an increased odds ratio with the exposure for a small group of persons who lived at a particular site in one of the two communities involved during the peak phase of TNT production during the 1940s. However, this finding is spurious and cannot explain the large majority of cases which occurred in that area in the 1980s.

One formulation allows us to investigate whether a cluster of genes with similar expression profiles is related to the observed phenotypes; this model can also be used for future prediction. The other formulation provides an alternative way of identifying genes that are over- or underexpressed from their expression levels in tissue or cell samples of a given tissue or cell type. RESULTS: We illustrate the methods on available datasets of a classification of acute leukemias and of 60 cancer cell lines. For tumor classification, the results are comparable to those previously obtained. For the cancer cell lines dataset, we found four clusters of genes that are related to drug response for many of the 90 drugs that we considered. In addition, for each type of cell line, we identified genes that are over- or underexpressed relative to other genes. CONCLUSIONS: The cluster-Rasch model provides a probabilistic model for describing gene expression patterns across samples and can be used to relate gene expression profiles to phenotypes.","['Li, H', 'Hong, F']","['Li H', 'Hong F']","['Rowe Program in Human Genetics, Departments of Medicine and Statistics, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA. hli@dna.ucdavis.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Genome Biol,Genome biology,100960660,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Databases, Nucleic Acid', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', '*Models, Statistical', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*methods', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics', 'Probability', 'Regression Analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/09/05 10:00,2002/01/10 10:01,['2001/09/05 10:00'],"['2001/02/26 00:00 [received]', '2001/05/11 00:00 [revised]', '2001/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/gb-2001-2-8-research0031 [doi]'],ppublish,Genome Biol. 2001;2(8):RESEARCH0031. doi: 10.1186/gb-2001-2-8-research0031.

In this paper we investigated if patients taking digitoxin for cardiac disease have a different cancer incidence compared to the general population. METHODS: Computer stored data on digitoxin concentrations in plasma from 9271 patients with cardiac disease were used to define a user population. Age and sex matched controls from the Norwegian Cancer Registry were used to calculate the number of expected cancer cases. RESULTS: The population on digitoxin showed a higher incidence of cancer compared to the control population. However, an additional analysis showed that the population on digitoxin had a general increased risk of cancer already, before the start on digitoxin. Leukemia/lymphoma were the cancer types which stood out with the highest risk in the digitoxin population before starting on digitoxin. This indicates that yet unknown risk factors exist for cardiovascular disease and lymphoproliferative cancer. An internal dose-response analysis revealed a relationship between high plasma concentration of digitoxin and a lower risk for leukemia/lymphoma and for cancer of the kidney/urinary tract. CONCLUSION: Morbidity and mortality are high in the population on digitoxin, due to high age and cardiac disease. These factors disturb efforts to isolate an eventual anticancer effect of digitoxin in this setting. Still, the results may indicate an anticancer effect of digitoxin for leukemia/lymphoma and kidney/urinary tract cancers.

A recent study investigating the expression of CD10 in a wide range of non-haematopoietic neoplasms found positive staining in a small number of endometrial stromal sarcomas as well as in normal endometrial stroma. The present study aimed to ascertain whether CD10 positivity is indeed found in normal endometrial stroma and endometrial stromal neoplasms. Staining of a range of tumours which can be confused morphologically with endometrial stromal neoplasms was also undertaken to ascertain whether antibodies against CD10 are of value in a diagnostic sense. METHODS AND RESULTS: Neoplasms included in the study were endometrial stromal nodule (n=1), low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) (n=13), high-grade ESS (n=6), mixed endometrial stromal-smooth muscle tumour (n=1), uterine cellular leiomyoma (n=10), uterine leiomyosarcoma (n=5), adult granulosa cell tumour (AGCT) (n=10), undifferentiated endometrial carcinoma (n=6), uterine carcinosarcoma with an endometrial stromal component (n=1) and type II uterine mesenchymal tumour with sex cord-like elements (n=1). Cases of proliferative (n=5), secretory (n=5) and atrophic (n=3) endometrium were also stained. There was positive staining of stroma but not of glands in all cases of non-tumorous endometrium. There was positive staining of the endometrial stromal nodule and of all low-grade ESS. Staining in these varied but was often diffuse and of moderate to strong intensity. There was positive staining of four of six high-grade ESS, but this was usually focal. There was also positive staining of the endometrial stromal component in the mixed endometrial stromal-smooth muscle tumour and in the uterine carcinosarcoma. Most cellular leiomyomas were completely negative although three exhibited weak positivity. There was some positivity, usually focal or weak, of three of five leiomyosarcomas. Most AGCT and undifferentiated carcinomas were completely negative although one case of each exhibited focal staining. There was focal staining of the type II uterine mesenchymal tumour with sex cord-like elements. CONCLUSION: CD10 is a reliable and sensitive immunohistochemical marker of normal endometrial stroma. Positivity, which is often strong and/or diffuse is found in endometrial stromal nodules and low-grade ESS. Positive staining with CD10, when strong and diffuse, may be useful in distinguishing these tumours from histological mimics, especially cellular leiomyoma and AGCT which are generally negative. In this situation, CD10 should be used as part of a panel which might include desmin and alpha-inhibin depending on the differential diagnosis considered. Positive staining with CD10 in a high-grade uterine sarcoma which is negative with muscle markers might indicate endometrial stromal differentiation and identify a group of neoplasms which it is correct to diagnose as high-grade ESS rather than undifferentiated uterine sarcoma.","['McCluggage, W G', 'Sumathi, V P', 'Maxwell, P']","['McCluggage WG', 'Sumathi VP', 'Maxwell P']","['Department of Pathology, Royal Group of Hospitals Trust, Belfast, Northern Ireland. glenn.mccluggage@bll.n-i.nhs.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['Endometrial Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Endometrium/*metabolism/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Neprilysin/*metabolism']",2001/09/05 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/09/05 10:00'],"['2001/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['his1215 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2559.2001.01215.x [doi]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2001 Sep;39(3):273-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.2001.01215.x.,['EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)'],,,,,,,['Histopathology. 2002 Jul;41(1):82-3.

Assessing a child's understanding of the stresses associated with treatment during hospitalization is now seen as a key element of caring for the paediatric patient. A population particularly vulnerable to the effects of the stress of intensive treatments during hospitalization are preschool children. In order to understand the impact on leukaemia preschool children of intensive hospital treatment it is necessary to have comparative information on healthy peers who have not been exposed to such treatment experiences. This article presents findings from recent qualitative research that explored the beliefs held by healthy preschoolers about what happens in hospital, what it means to be sick, their reactions to and knowledge of medical equipment and their level of knowledge regarding cancer and leukaemia. It is the hope and expectation that the findings will be used comparatively to contribute to a deeper understanding of the world of the child coping with leukaemia and related disorders.","['McGrath, P', 'Huff, N']","['McGrath P', 'Huff N']","['Centre for Public Health Research, Queensland University of Technology, Red Hill, Queensland, Australia. p.mcgrath@qut.edu.au']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Child Care Health Dev,"Child: care, health and development",7602632,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological', 'Australia', 'Awareness', 'Child', 'Child, Hospitalized/*psychology', 'Child, Preschool', '*Cognition', 'Equipment and Supplies, Hospital', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', '*Play and Playthings/psychology']",2001/09/05 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/09/05 10:00'],"['2001/09/05 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/05 10:00 [entrez]']","['cch219 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2214.2001.00219.x [doi]']",ppublish,Child Care Health Dev. 2001 Sep;27(5):451-62. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2214.2001.00219.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Relapse generally occurs outside radiation fields and most relapsed patients ultimately die from lymphoma. No randomized data exist to support adjuvant chemotherapy but only one trial of low-intensity chemotherapy was sufficiently powerful to address the question. Nevertheless, data from a large phase-II study from MD Anderson suggest that combined chemotherapy and RT can produce progression-free survival results that are far superior to historical series, with survival at 10 years to be approximately 20% superior to radiation alone. These results have encouraged the development of a joint phase III study by the Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group (TROG) and the Australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group (ALLG) in which patients with clinical stage I/II follicular lymphoma are randomized to involved field RT with or without six cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapy. In an era of rapid development in immunological and molecular therapies the potential for improved results with new combinations of more established treatment modalities should not be forgotten.

Among them, 34 samples exhibited a typical HTLV-1 Western blot pattern. Polymerase chain reaction was performed with three primer sets specific either to HTLV-1/STLV-1 or HTLV-2 and encompassing gag, pol, and tax sequences, on genomic DNA from peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 31 animals. The presence of HTLV-1/simian T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (STLV-1) related viruses was determined in the 21 HTLV-1 seropositive animals tested but not in the 10 HTLV-1 seronegative individuals. Proviral DNA sequences from the complete LTR (750 bp) and a portion of the env gene (522 bp) were determined for 16 new STLV-1 strains; some of them originating from species for which no STLV-1 molecular data were available as Allenopithecus nigroviridis and Cercopithecus nictitans. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses revealed that these 16 new sequences belong to five different molecular groups. The A. nigroviridis STLV-1 strains exhibited a very strong nucleotide similarity with HTLV-1 of the subtype B. Furthermore, four novel STLV-1, found in Cercocebus torquatus, C. m. mona, C. nictitans, and Chlorocebus aethipos, were identical to each other and to a previously described Papio anubis STLV-1 strain (PAN 503) originating from the same primate center in Cameroon.

In B-lineage ALL, myeloid antigen (mAg) CD15 was concentrated in CD10-CD20- cases (49%); CD13 (42%); and CD33 (43%) in CD10+CD20- cases. This trend had no correlation with the presence of Ph1 or t(4;11) chromosomal abnormality. T-cell antigen CD2, CD4, and CD7 was seen in four, four, and two cases, respectively, and CD4+ and CD7+ cases commonly expressed CD13 and/or CD33 (CD13/CD33). In T-lineage ALL, expression of mAg, CD11b (47%), CD13 (38%), CD15 (28%), and CD33 (51%) was restricted to CD3- cases. B-cell antigen CD19 was found in two cases with CD7 solely as T-cell antigen, and these cases possessed CD13/CD33. CD21 was detected in three cases with CD3. In whole ALL, CD13/CD33 was associated closely with the presence of stem-cell antigen CD34, and in T-lineage ALL, CD13/CD33 had a significant correlation with additional stem-cell features, such as HLA-DR, multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) and c-kit gene expression.

Although the appearance of different types of CA may mean that these clones did not obtain any growth advantages, it may be a sign of genomic instability, which is probably a risk factor for the development of secondary AML/MDS.","['Lin, Y W', 'Hamahata, K', 'Watanabe, K', 'Adachi, S', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Kubota, M', 'Nakahata, T']","['Lin YW', 'Hamahata K', 'Watanabe K', 'Adachi S', 'Akiyama Y', 'Kubota M', 'Nakahata T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan. linying@mail.nih.gov']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosome Aberrations', '*Chromosome Disorders', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/radiation effects/*ultrastructure', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'DNA Damage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Methylprednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2001/09/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/04 10:00'],"['2001/09/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982555 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Jul;74(1):86-9. doi: 10.1007/BF02982555.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A 66-year-old man was admitted because of pancytopenia with peripheral blasts. A diagnosis of MDS (with refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation [RAEB-T]) was made by bone marrow examination. Chromosome analysis revealed 46,XY. An early gastric cancer was also diagnosed by endoscopic examination. The peripheral blasts gradually proliferated and the disease progressed to M6. A chromosome abnormality 46,XY,del(1)(q42) was detected at the leukemic transformation. A CAG (low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin in combination with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) regimen was started as a remission-induction therapy.

FA cells show chromosome instability and hypersensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents such as mitomycin C. Recent studies indicate that there are at least 8 genetically distinct FA groups (A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G). To date, 6 genes (for A, C, D2, E, F, and G) have been cloned. In this review, we describe the structures and functions of FA proteins. Increasing evidence indicates that the multiple FA proteins cooperate in a biochemical pathway and/or a multimer complex. FANCD2, a downstream component of the FA pathway, has recently been shown to be ubiquitinated in response to DNA damage and to translocate to nuclear foci containing BRCA1, a breast cancer susceptibility gene product, suggesting a role for this protein in DNA repair functions. We also describe 2 emerging issues: genotype-phenotype relationships and mosaicism. The FA pathway is likely to play a critical role as a caretaker of genomic integrity in hematopoietic stem cells. Clarifying the molecular basis of this disease may provide new insights into the pathogenesis of bone marrow failure syndromes and myeloid malignancies.","['Yamashita, T', 'Nakahata, T']","['Yamashita T', 'Nakahata T']","['Division of Genetic Diagnosis, Institute of Medical Science, University of Tokyo, Japan. y-taka@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Animals', 'BRCA1 Protein/physiology', '*Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Chromosomes, Human/drug effects', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA Repair/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Fanconi Anemia/classification/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group E Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group F Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein', 'Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Genetic Complementation Test', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genotype', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Models, Biological', 'Mosaicism/genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/physiology']",2001/09/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/04 10:00'],"['2001/09/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982547 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Jul;74(1):33-41. doi: 10.1007/BF02982547.,"['0 (BRCA1 Protein)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (FANCA protein, human)', '0 (FANCD2 protein, human)', '0 (FANCE protein, human)', '0 (FANCF protein, human)', '0 (FANCG protein, human)', '0 (Fanca protein, mouse)', '0 (Fancd2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fancg protein, mouse)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group A Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group D2 Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group E Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group F Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group G Protein)', '0 (Fanconi Anemia Complementation Group Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",116,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GVHD is destructive by itself and sets the stage for other sequelae, in particular, overwhelming infections. Recent investigations have improved our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of GVHD. There are now compelling data on the role of host tissue destruction as the initial insult, extensive interactions of cellular donor and host components, a complex network of cytokines, adhesion molecules, and other components in the development of GVHD. The improved understanding of interactions among various signals is likely to allow for the development of new prophylactic strategies. A review of the data shows, however, that results are very dependent upon the models used. It is difficult or impossible to separate completely the discussion of cytokines that affect hemopoietic cells from discussion of cytokines that exert effects on immune cells. Furthermore, secondary effects on immune cells via hemopoietic cells complicate the picture. Application of the principles of cytokine signaling to the clinical setting may necessitate new trial design structures that take into consideration donor and host characteristics as well as the kinetics of GVHD development.","['Deeg, H J']",['Deeg HJ'],"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and University of Washington, Seattle 98109-1024, USA. jdeeg@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Cytokines/*physiology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 7', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/physiology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*metabolism/prevention & control', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/physiology', 'Interleukins/physiology', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Cytokine/drug effects/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/physiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",2001/09/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/09/04 10:00'],"['2001/09/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02982546 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Jul;74(1):26-32. doi: 10.1007/BF02982546.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (FGF7 protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Fasl protein, mouse)', '0 (Fgf7 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '126469-10-1 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 7)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",71,"['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA87948/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ES cell pluripotentiality is preserved in culture in the presence of LIF. LIF withdrawal induces ES cell differentiation to nervous, myocardial, endothelial and hematopoietic tissues. The model of murine ES cell hematopoietic differentiation is of major interest because ES cells are non transformed cell lines and the consequences of genomic manipulations of these cells are directly measurable on a hierarchy of synchronized in vitro ES cell-derived hematopoietic cell populations. These include the putative hemangioblast (which represents the emergence of both hematopoietic and endothelial tissues during development), myeloid progenitors and mature stages of myeloid lineages.

We studied whether the in vitro treatment of primary human acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) cells with CI leads to differentiation towards DC. Blast cells derived from nine AML patients were cultured in the presence of either CI or an established differentiation cocktail consisting of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor plus interleukin 4 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha for 5-7 d. Microscopic examination revealed that under both conditions, AML cells were shifted along the DC pathway. In seven out of nine cases, CI-cultivation led to a higher proportion of cells with dendritic morphology. The percentage of CD40 and CD86 expressing cells was significantly increased upon CI treatment compared with cytokine-cultured cells. DC molecules as CD80 and CD83 were up-regulated upon calcium mobilization of AML cells in four out of nine samples. In four cases, CI-treated stimulator cells induced an enhanced proliferative allogeneic T-cell response compared with cytokine-treated stimulator cells.

Clinically, low-dose decitabine ameliorates cytopenias including induction of trilineage responses in approximately 50% of patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). We examined the incidence and kinetics of cytogenetic responses to decitabine in these patients. Of 115 successfully karyotyped patients, 61 (53%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities prior to treatment. Major cytogenetic responses were observed in 19 patients (31% of those with abnormal cytogenetics, 17% of all patients by intention-to-treat) after a median of three courses (range, 2-6) until best cytogenetic response. Progressive decrease of the abnormal clone over time was also determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis in two patients. Median duration of cytogenetic responses was 7.5 months (range, 3-15). Analysis of response by the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) cytogenetic risk groups revealed three out of five cytogenetic responses (60%) in the IPSS 'low-risk' group, 6 out of 30 with 'intermediate risk' (20%) and 10 out of 26 in the 'high-risk' group (38%). Median survival in these cytogenetic subgroups was 30, 8 and 13 months respectively. The relative risk of death in patients achieving a major cytogenetic response was 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.88) compared with patients in whom the cytogenetically abnormal clone persisted (P = 0.0213). In conclusion, repeated courses of low-dose decitabine induce cytogenetic remissions in a substantial number of elderly MDS patients with pre-existing chromosomal abnormalties; these are associated with improved survival compared with patients in whom the cytogenetically abnormal clone persists. Patients with 'high-risk' chromosomal abnormalities may particularly benefit from this treatment.","['Lubbert, M', 'Wijermans, P', 'Kunzmann, R', 'Verhoef, G', 'Bosly, A', 'Ravoet, C', 'Andre, M', 'Ferrant, A']","['Lubbert M', 'Wijermans P', 'Kunzmann R', 'Verhoef G', 'Bosly A', 'Ravoet C', 'Andre M', 'Ferrant A']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Haematology/Oncology, University of Freiburg Medical Centre, Freiburg, Germany. luebbert@mm11.ukl.uni-freiburg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Azacitidine/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Decitabine', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Risk', 'Survival Rate']",2001/09/01 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/09/01 10:00'],"['2001/09/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2933 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02933.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Aug;114(2):349-57. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02933.x.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Between April 1997 and July 1998, 36 patients with CLL (median age 59 years) received a regimen that consisted of fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) in a 30-min IV infusion, d 1-3, and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m(2) in a 30-min IV infusion on d 1-3. Cycles were repeated every 28 d. Twenty-one patients had received between one and three different treatment regimens prior to the study, while 15 patients had received no prior therapy. The median Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score was 1. One patient was at Binet stage A, 18 were stage B and 17 patients were stage C. Objective responses, assessed according to the revised guidelines of the National Cancer Institute-sponsored Working Group, were recorded in 29 out of 32 assessable patients (90.6%). Twenty-four partial remissions and five complete remissions were observed. Two patients showed no change and one patient showed disease progression. At February 2000, three of the responders had relapsed. Severe neutropenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia (Common Toxicity Criteria grade 3 and 4) were observed in 25, six and six patients (69.4%, 16.7% and 16.7%) respectively. Other side-effects were uncommon. No treatment-related deaths and no grade 3 or 4 infections occurred.

The RB-1 gene is a tumour suppressor gene, but other loci including D13S319 and D13S25 telomeric to this within 13q14.3 are deleted in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), multiple myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with varying clinical significance. The fluorescence in situ hybridization screening of 22 patients with T-prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL) for deletions of 13q14.3 revealed loss of D13S25 in 17 cases (mean 40% range 13-98%), with 11 patients having at least a 20% deletion. Mapping the deletions for the RB-1, D13S319,and D13S25 loci revealed D13S25 as the most frequently deleted marker. However, patients with only the D13S25 deletion had low percentages of cells with the deletion (12-13%), suggesting that loss of D13S25 on its own may not provide sufficient growth advantage. The use of the YAC 954c12, which maps immediately adjacent to D13S25, defined the telomeric border of the deletion in some of the cases. Inv(14)(q11q32) and t(14;14)(q11;q32) are characteristic of T-PLL, but are also observed in premalignant T-cell clones in patients with ataxia telangiectasia. Transition to overt leukaemia may result from loss of suppressor function. Thus, 13q14.3 deletions could contribute to the development of overt leukaemia in T-PLL, but the involvement of more than one gene in the region cannot be excluded.","['Brito-Babapulle, V', 'Baou, M', 'Matutes, E', 'Morilla, R', 'Atkinson, S', 'Catovsky, D']","['Brito-Babapulle V', 'Baou M', 'Matutes E', 'Morilla R', 'Atkinson S', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics/Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK. vasantha@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Chromosome Inversion', 'Female', 'Gene Deletion', '*Genes, Retinoblastoma', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Trisomy']",2001/09/01 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/09/01 10:00'],"['2001/09/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['bjh2935 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02935.x [doi]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2001 Aug;114(2):327-32. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2141.2001.02935.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, molecular monitoring via WT1 RNA levels is far from being routinely performed, which is possibly owing to the complex and inaccurate quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedures. Using a newly-developed quantitative real time RT-PCR, we measured WT1 transcripts in peripheral blood leucocytes of patients with acute myeloid (AML), acute lymphoid (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). While healthy blood donors did not show measurable amounts of WT1 transcripts, WT1 RNA levels were detectable in all types of leukaemia. Furthermore, intraindividual WT1 transcript kinetics were exclusively dependent on disease progression, treatment and subsequent disease outcome. Using this approach, we could distinguish between treatment response and failure within the first days of therapeutic intervention. Moreover, gradually rising WT1 levels over a period of weeks and months paralleled long-term disease progression and appeared to be a prognostic indicator for subsequent clinical relapse. A linear correlation between quantities of WT1 and bcr/abl fusion transcripts could be seen in CML.

Leukemia inhibitory factor, a member of the interleukin-6 (IL-6) ciliary neurotrophic factor family, inhibits differentiation of embryonic stem cells, induces tubulogenesis in the embryonic kidney, and regulates sperm differentiation. Other IL-6 family members are important in cardiac differentiation and they have pleiotropic functions in the hematopoietic and immune systems. Although neurotrophin receptors have been found on a number of non-neuronal tissues, they represent mostly truncated receptor isoforms that are incapable of signal transduction and may have scavenger or dominant negative functions.

Because UCB transplantation (UCBT) is associated with a relatively low infused dose of donor T cells, frequent donor-recipient HLA disparity, and use of antithymocyte globulin during conditioning, we hypothesized that the risk of EBV-associated posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (EVB-PTLD) after UCBT may be increased. To investigate the incidence of EBV-PTLD after UCBT, we analyzed 272 unrelated-donor UCBTs performed from August 1993 to December 1999 at Duke University Medical Center and the University of Minnesota. Five cases of EBV-PTLD were identified, with a cumulative incidence of 2% (95% confidence interval, 0.3%-3.7%) at 2 years. EBV-PTLD affected UCB recipients aged 1 to 49 years (median, 8 years), with 4 patients undergoing transplantation for leukemia and 1 for immunodeficiency. Patients received UCB grafts that were HLA matched (n = 1) or mismatched at 1 (n = 1) or 2 (n = 3) HLA loci. Diagnoses occurred at 4 to 14 months (median, 6 months) after UCBT, with 4 of 5 patients having preceding grade II to IV acute graft-versus-host disease and 1 being diagnosed at autopsy. Treatment of 4 patients consisted of withdrawal of immunosuppressive treatment and administration of rituximab, with 2 of 4 patients responding. Thus, the incidence of EBV-PTLD after unrelated-donor UCBT appears similar to that observed after transplantation using unrelated bone marrow (BM) and compares favorably with unrelated-donor T-cell-depleted BM transplantation. Because adoptive immunotherapy with donor lymphocytes is not an available option for recipients of unrelated-donor UCBT, new therapeutic strategies are needed, and rituximab appears promising.","['Barker, J N', 'Martin, P L', 'Coad, J E', 'DeFor, T', 'Trigg, M E', 'Kurtzberg, J', 'Weisdorf, D J', 'Wagner, J']","['Barker JN', 'Martin PL', 'Coad JE', 'DeFor T', 'Trigg ME', 'Kurtzberg J', 'Weisdorf DJ', 'Wagner J']","['University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, USA. barke014@tc.umn.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,9600628,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Donors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications', 'Fetal Blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human/growth & development', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/etiology/*virology', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Virus Activation/drug effects']",2001/09/01 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2001/09/01 10:00'],"['2001/09/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/01 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1083879101500658 [pii]', '10.1053/bbmt.2001.v7.pm11529490 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Blood Marrow Transplant. 2001;7(7):395-9. doi: 10.1053/bbmt.2001.v7.pm11529490.,,,"['N01-HB-67139/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-HB-67141/HB/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA65493/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The serum calcium level was elevated to 14.9 mg/dl. Biochemical parameters for bone formation including serum osteocalcin (bone Gla protein, BGP) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were normal. The serum levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), a parameter for bone resorption, were increased (4.6 KAU). The serum level of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) was elevated (343 pmol/l). The cytokines with stimulatory effects on bone resorption, such as interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, were not detected. Serum Ca levels, PTHrP levels, and TRAP levels decreased with the decrease in ATL cells after chemotherapy, while serum BGP levels and ALP levels increased. On the 29th hospital day, ATL cells began to increase again. Then serum PTHrP levels, Ca levels, and TRAP levels increased, while serum BGP levels and ALP levels decreased. A marked excessive bone resorption with suppressed bone formation (uncoupling) occurred in this patient. The ATL cells produced not only PTHrP but also IL-1alpha and IL-1beta. These results suggest that PTHrP may act as a humoral factor and IL-1 may act as a local factor in bone metabolism of ATL patients.","['Hino, M', 'Yamane, T', 'Ohta, K', 'Shioi, A', 'Koyama, H', 'Tahara, H', 'Nishizawa, Y', 'Tatsumi, N']","['Hino M', 'Yamane T', 'Ohta K', 'Shioi A', 'Koyama H', 'Tahara H', 'Nishizawa Y', 'Tatsumi N']","['Department of Clinical Hematology, Osaka City University Medical School, Osaka, Japan. himon@med.osaka-cu.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Bone Resorption/*etiology/*physiopathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/*complications', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*blood/*complications/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Osteoblasts/*physiology', 'Osteoclasts/*physiology', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Proteins/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",2001/09/01 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/09/01 10:00'],"['2001/09/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770100305 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2001 Jul;80(7):426-9. doi: 10.1007/s002770100305.,"['0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To improve the outcome of children with acute promyelocytic leukemia, ATRA has been applied since 1994 as an additional induction element inthe AML-BFM 93 study. In a retrospective study, we compared 22 children treated with ATRA (median age: 9.3 years; range: 1.8-16.3) with 22 patients receiving conventional therapy (median age: 12.3 years; range: 3.2-16.7). Twenty-one of the children achieved complete remission. Only one patient died early from bleeding complications after 3 days administration of ATRA. In the control group, seven early deaths occurred (Fisher exact test; p<0.04). Two children died from intracerebral hemorrhages. Two patients suffered from sepsis during aplasia after induction therapy, and one child did not respond to treatment. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) of the children who received ATRA followed by chemotherapy were significantly bettercom-pared with conventionally treated children [OS: 0.87 +/- 0.9 vs 0.45 +/- 0.11, p (log rank) <0.003; EFS: 0.76 +/- 0.11 vs 0.43 +/- 0.11 p (log rank) <0.02]; the median observation time was 2.8 years (19-76 months). However, nearly all children suffered from common side effects such as headache, fever, joint, muscle and bone pain, weight gain, or dermatitis. In three patients, a retinoic acid syndrome was observed. Interruption of ATRA treatment and application of dexamethasone, necessary in 12 children, controlled theadverse effects. ATRA treatment could be resumed in 18 patients. In conclusion, ATRA treatment during induction could avoid early deaths in children with acute promyelocytic leukemia with considerable but manageable toxic side effects.","['Mann, G', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Ritter, J', 'Hermann, J', 'Schmitt, K', 'Gadner, H', 'Creutzig, U']","['Mann G', 'Reinhardt D', 'Ritter J', 'Hermann J', 'Schmitt K', 'Gadner H', 'Creutzig U']","[""St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/chemically induced/mortality', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Mortality', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/adverse effects/*therapeutic use']",2001/09/01 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/09/01 10:00'],"['2001/09/01 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/09/01 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002770100304 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2001 Jul;80(7):417-22. doi: 10.1007/s002770100304.,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The underlying mechanisms of these disorders are unknown. METHODS: A new animal model of experimentally induced pubertal disorders by cranial irradiation has been developed. In infantile or juvenile (12 - 23 days old) female rats precocious or delayed puberty have been induced by selective cranial Co60-irradiation (4 - 18 Gy). At age of 32 - 38 days or 3 months relevant hormone parameters have been studied basal and after stimulated conditions. RESULTS: Low radiation doses (5 or 6 Gy) led to accelerated onset of puberty as well as elevated LH- and estradiol levels. High radiation doses (9 - 18 Gy) caused retardation of sexual development, lower gonadotropin levels and growth retardation associated with growth hormone deficiency. After cranial irradiation with 5 Gy the release rates of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric-acid (GABA) from hypothalamic explants were significantly lower (p < 0,05). The gonadotropin-releasing-hormone (GnRH) expression in the hypothalamic preoptic area of irradiated animals (5 Gy) was significantly higher than in controls (p < 0,05). CONCLUSION: The GnRH-pulse generator is very radiosensitive as low dose irradiation causes precocious puberty, whereas high dose irradiation is associated with delayed sexual maturation. Radiation induced precocious puberty might be caused by damage to inhibitory GABAergic neurons leading to desinhibition and premature activation of GnRH neurons. Our animal model of cranial irradiation seems to be suitable to study neurotransmitter disorders, molecular mechanisms and potential preventive intervention of radiation induced pubertal changes.","['Roth, C', 'Lakomek, M', 'Schmidberger, H', 'Jarry, H']","['Roth C', 'Lakomek M', 'Schmidberger H', 'Jarry H']","['Kinderklinik, Germany.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,IM,"['*Abnormalities, Radiation-Induced', 'Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Brain/*radiation effects', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone/deficiency/*radiation effects', 'Neurons/radiation effects', 'Puberty, Delayed/etiology', 'Puberty, Precocious/etiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'gamma-Aminobutyric Acid/*radiation effects']",2001/08/31 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2001-16854 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2001 Jul-Aug;213(4):239-43. doi: 10.1055/s-2001-16854.,"['33515-09-2 (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone)', '56-12-2 (gamma-Aminobutyric Acid)']",,,,,Schadelbestrahlung verursacht vorzeitige Aktivierung des Gonadotropin-Releasinghormon (GnRH)-Pulsgenerators bei Ratten - Ein neuesTiermodell fur strahleninduzierte Storungen der Pubertat.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After induction all patients were stratified to the standard or high risk group. To improve outcome in high risk patients high dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone (HAM) was introduced. The placing of HAM as either the 2nd or 3rd therapy block was randomized to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity accordingly. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 471 children with de novo AML entered the trial AML-BFM 93 (161 standard risk, 310 high risk). RESULTS: Overall, 387 of 471 (82 %) patients achieved remission, 5-year survival, event free survival (EFS), and disease free survival were 60 % SE 3 %, 51 % SE 2 % and 62 % SE 3 %, respectively. Idarubicin-based induction resulted in a significantly better blast cell reduction in the bone marrow on day 15 (25 of 144=17 % patients with > 5 % blasts compared to 46 of 149=31 % patients after daunorubicin, pchi(2)=0.01). This was, however, mainly seen in high risk patients treated with idarubicin (19 % vs. 38 %, pchi(2)=0.007). Cardiotoxicity, WHO grade 1 - 3 shortening fraction reduction after induction occurred in 6 % patients in both arms. In the total group of patients probabilities of five years event-free survival and disease-free survival were similar for patients treated with daunorubicin or idarubicin. However, in patients presenting with more than 5 % blasts on day 15 there was a trend for a better outcome after treatment with idarubicin (p logrank 0.06). Outcome in high risk patients was superior in study 93 compared to study 87 (remission rate and 5-year pEFS in study AML-BFM 93 vs. study 87: 78 % vs. 68 %, p=0.007, and 44 % vs. 31 %, p logrank=0.01). The placing of HAM as the 2nd or 3rd therapy block was of minor importance. However, patients who received the daunorubicin treatment during induction benefited from early HAM. CONCLUSION: Compared to study AML-BFM 87 treatment results in study AML 93 improved significantly in high risk patients. This can partly be contributed to the better response on day 15 after idarubicin induction but is mainly due to the introduction of HAM.","['Creutzig, U', 'Berthold, F', 'Boos, J', 'Fleischhack, G', 'Gadner, H', 'Gnekow, A', 'Graubner, U', 'Henze, G', 'Hermann, J', 'Imbach, P', 'Jurgens, H', 'Kabisch, H', 'Korholz, D', 'Niemeyer, C M', 'Reinhardt, D', 'Reiter, A', 'Ritter, J', 'Spaar, H J', 'Zimmermann, M']","['Creutzig U', 'Berthold F', 'Boos J', 'Fleischhack G', 'Gadner H', 'Gnekow A', 'Graubner U', 'Henze G', 'Hermann J', 'Imbach P', 'Jurgens H', 'Kabisch H', 'Korholz D', 'Niemeyer CM', 'Reinhardt D', 'Reiter A', 'Ritter J', 'Spaar HJ', 'Zimmermann M']","['Universitats-Kinderkliniken in Deutschland, Munster, Germany. ucreutzig@aol.com']",['ger'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Germany/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/08/31 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2001-16849 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2001 Jul-Aug;213(4):175-85. doi: 10.1055/s-2001-16849.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,Verbesserung der Prognose bei Kindern mit AML: Ergebnisse der Studie AML-BFM 931.,,,,,['AML-BFM-Studien-Gruppe'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prednisone response is characterized by the peripheral leukaemic blast count. The threshold value for the characterisation as good or poor prednisone response is 1000 blasts/microliter on day eight of initial prednisone treatment. It is frequently being discussed, whether patients with ALL that initially present with < 1000 blasts/microliter and still show < 1000 blasts/microliter by day eight of treatment, have the same therapy outcome as prednisone good-responders with initially >/= 1000 blasts/microliter. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We evaluated all patients included in the ALL-BFM 90 study showing good prednisone response. This group included 660 patients presenting with < 1000 blasts/microliter at diagnosis. We compared these patients with the prednisone good-responders that initially presented with >/= 1000 blasts/microliter. In addition we analysed all patients who showed an increasing blast count within the threshold of 1000 blasts/microliter by day eight of treatment. RESULTS: Children presenting with ALL and < 1000 blasts/microliter at diagnosis showed a small but significantly better outcome than prednisone good-responders with initially >/= 1000 blasts/microliter (5 year pEFS 0.86 vs. 0.81, P value 0.0064). If analyzed by treatment group, no significant differences were found. Patients with < 1000 blasts/microliter on day eight of treatment but increasing blast count from diagnosis until day eight did not perform worse. CONCLUSION: The prognostic value of the prednisone response is not restricted to childhood ALL patients presenting with >/= 1000 blasts/microliter at diagnosis, but retains its strength as a strong predictor of treatment outcome also in patients with < 1000 blasts/microliter at diagnosis.","['Lauten, M', 'Stanulla, M', 'Zimmermann, M', 'Welte, K', 'Riehm, H', 'Schrappe, M']","['Lauten M', 'Stanulla M', 'Zimmermann M', 'Welte K', 'Riehm H', 'Schrappe M']","[""Department of Paediatric Haematology and Oncology, Children's Hospital, Hannover Medical School, 30625 Hannover, Germany. lauten.melchior@mh-hannover.de""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,IM,"['*Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal', 'Blast Crisis/*blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Prednisone', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/08/31 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2001-16848 [doi]'],ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 2001 Jul-Aug;213(4):169-74. doi: 10.1055/s-2001-16848.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latest of the three studies (AML-BFM-93-OST) was part of the common German study AML-BFM-93. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The total number of registered patients was 262. The number and dosage of administered chemotherapeutic agents was elevated with each new study. RESULTS: Both the remission rate (85 %) and the likelihood of an event free survival (52 % after 5 years) could be improved significantly in study AML-BFM-93-OST. The results of the common German study AML-BFM-93 were identical to those of the East German part AML-BFM-93-OST. Compared with international studies it was one of the most successful treatment strategies in children with AML. Patients who showed toxic side effects to heart, liver, kidneys, skin or nervous system during the chemotherapy had a significantly lower risk of relapse, once they overcame the intensive therapy. During the five years of study AML-BFM-93-OST, treatment results could be improved despite an unchanged therapy strategy. This may partly be due to the modernisations and restorations that were carried out in many East German hospitals in this time. CONCLUSIONS: The therapy regimen of study AML-BFM-93 allowed a substantial improvement in the treatment of children with AML. Further intensification of chemotherapy should only be undertaken in accordance to the individual sensitivity of each patient.","['Steinbach, D', 'Dorffel, W', 'Eggers, G', 'Holfeld, E', 'Kluba, U', 'Krause, I', 'Lauterbach, I', 'Reiss, T', 'Rieske, K', 'Scharfe, V', 'Schumacher, R', 'Weigel, H', 'Weinmann, G', 'Zintl, F', 'Hermann, J']","['Steinbach D', 'Dorffel W', 'Eggers G', 'Holfeld E', 'Kluba U', 'Krause I', 'Lauterbach I', 'Reiss T', 'Rieske K', 'Scharfe V', 'Schumacher R', 'Weigel H', 'Weinmann G', 'Zintl F', 'Hermann J']","['Klinikum der FSU Jena, Klinik fur Kinder-und Jugendmedizin Postfach, 07740 Jena, Germany.

Antisense IL-10 oligonucleotide treatment induces apoptosis and cell cycle disruption in these cells both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, NZB IL-10 knock-out mice fail to develop the B-1 clones. Dampening of IL-10 protein production via antisense IL-10 oligonucleotide treatment is correlated with decreased p27/Kip1 protein expression which results in increased cyclin D2, cyclin E and cyclin A associated kinase activity. The action of the antisense oligonucleotides is through alterations in cell cycle regulation, resulting in accelerated cell cycle progression, a G2/M block which culminates in apoptosis induction in the malignant cells. This implies that the role of IL-10 as an autocrine growth factor in malignant B-1 cells lies in its ability to inhibit apoptosis induction through the maintenance of sustainable cell cycle progression in malignant cells.","['Yen Chong, S', 'Lin, Y C', 'Czarneski, J', 'Zhang, M', 'Coffman, F', 'Kashanchi, F', 'Raveche, E']","['Yen Chong S', 'Lin YC', 'Czarneski J', 'Zhang M', 'Coffman F', 'Kashanchi F', 'Raveche E']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, NJ 07109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Genes Immun,Genes and immunity,100953417,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', '*Cell Cycle/genetics/immunology', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclins/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/immunology', 'Interleukin-10/deficiency/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Mice, Inbred NZB', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/genetics/metabolism/pharmacology', 'S Phase/genetics/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/31 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/02/20 00:00 [received]', '2001/03/10 00:00 [revised]', '2001/03/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gene.6363773 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Immun. 2001 Aug;2(5):239-47. doi: 10.1038/sj.gene.6363773.,"['0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)']",,['CA71478/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, the influence of those cocktails and/or LAK cells on the clonogenic potential of AML BM-MNC was investigated. BM colonies cultured in agar during different stages of the disease were immunophenotyped in situ: 17 patients at diagnosis, 14 patients in complete remission, 8 patients at relapse, 8 healthy donors. A significant reduction in leukemic cells and colonies positive for CD34 after in vitro culture of BM-MNC with cytokine cocktails was achieved with all samples obtained at diagnosis (n = 8, p < 0.01), in 6 of 8 cases in complete remission but only in 2 of 6 cases at relapse. Cytokine cocktails stimulated granulopoiesis as well as B and T lymphopoiesis. Colonies with leukemic phenotype could never be detected in healthy BM. A significant reduction in leukemic colonies was achieved by coculture of BM-MNC (uncultured or cytokine precultured) with autologous LAK cells in all 4 cases at diagnosis and in 1 case at relapse. An additive effect of in vitro cytokine preincubation of BM samples on the leukemia-reducing effect of LAK cells could be demonstrated in all samples studied (p < 0.001; diagnosis: n = 10, relapse: n = 3, complete remission: n = 7). Patients had a better prognosis if CD34-positive colonies in AML could be reduced by cytokine incubation (p = 0.03) or coculture with autologous LAK cells in vitro (p = 0.04). Our data show that cytokines as well as LAK cells alone and in combination can reduce, however not eliminate clonogenic AML cells. Such mechanisms might be responsible for maintaining stable remissions in AML.","['Braun, S W', 'Gerhartz, H H', 'Schmetzer, H M']","['Braun SW', 'Gerhartz HH', 'Schmetzer HM']","['Charite, Campus Virchow-Klinikum, Experimental Surgery, Humboldt University of Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cytokines/*immunology/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/mortality/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/31 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['46568 [pii]', '10.1159/000046568 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2001;105(4):209-21. doi: 10.1159/000046568.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Cytokines)']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

We examined the fundus oculi in a cohort of 122 adult patients with AML at presentation and analyzed some clinical and biological features to assess whether there was any association with RA. For this purpose, we subdivided the patients into two groups according to the presence or absence of RA (groups 1 and 2, respectively). We considered current laboratory parameters such as white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin (Hb), platelets and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Moreover, we subdivided the patients into two groups according to age <60 (group A) or > or =60 years (group B) to evaluate a possible association between RA and response to treatment and/or overall survival (OS). In our series, a higher median age and a lower Hb value were associated with group 1 (p = 0.001 and p = 0.04, respectively); the median LDH value was 812 U/l (range 224-5,551) and 607 (range 181-5,244) for groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.02). There was no association between RA and karyotypic alterations. In terms of outcome, in group A (<60 years), 80% patients who achieved complete remission (CR) were in group 2 vs. 13% nonresponders (NR) (p < 0.0001).

Median OS of patients in group 2 was 14.6 months compared with 2.9 months in group 1 (p = 0.02).

These molecules are important for some aspects of viral entry, although in some cases it remains to be determined whether they are required for binding or postbinding stages in entry, such as fusion. There are certain common features to the molecules that many retroviruses use to gain entry into the cell. For example, the receptors for most mammalian oncoretroviruses are multiple membrane-spanning transport proteins. However, avian retroviruses use single-pass membrane proteins, and a sheep retrovirus uses a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored molecule as its receptor. For some retroviruses, particularly the lentiviruses, two cell surface molecules are required for efficient entry. More recently, a soluble protein that is required for viral entry has been identified for a feline oncoretrovirus. In this review, we will focus on the various strategies used by mammalian retroviruses to gain entry into the cell. The choice of receptors will also be discussed in light of pressures that drive viral evolution and persistence.","['Overbaugh, J', 'Miller, A D', 'Eiden, M V']","['Overbaugh J', 'Miller AD', 'Eiden MV']","['Division of Human Biology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave., Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA. joverbau@fhcrc.org']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Microbiol Mol Biol Rev,Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,9706653,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'CD4 Antigens', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'Glycosylphosphatidylinositols/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Humans', '*Membrane Fusion', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins', 'Receptors, Virus/*metabolism', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2001/08/31 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MMBR.65.3.371-389.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,"Microbiol Mol Biol Rev. 2001 Sep;65(3):371-89, table of contents. doi: 10.1128/MMBR.65.3.371-389.2001.","['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (GIT1 protein, human)', '0 (Glycosylphosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)']",200,,,,,,,PMC99032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The patients (n = 12) had median age at diagnosis of 4.7 years, and at assessment of 20.8 years. They collected a daily urine sample over two to five consecutive menstrual cycles (total of 41 cycles) for analysis of LH and steroid excretion. Blood sampling and ovarian ultrasound examination was performed in the early follicular phase. Sixteen healthy women with regular menstrual cycles were recruited as controls. RESULTS: Urinary LH excretion was significantly lower in patients throughout the cycle, particularly during the LH surge (P < 0.0001). The length of the luteal phase was significantly shorter in patients than in normal controls (12.2 +/- 0.3 versus 13.6 +/- 0.4 days, P = 0.01) with a high prevalence of short (< or =11 days) luteal phases (15/39 cycles). Luteal phase pregnanediol excretion was slightly but not significantly lower. Follicular and luteal phase excretion of oestrone was lower in patients than in controls (P = 0.01).

Extracellular ATP and several nucleotide analogs stimulated cAMP accumulation with the following order of potency: ATP (EC(50)=120+/-20 microM)>ADP>>AMP. ADP was less effective than ATP and may be a partial agonist. AMP exhibited variable but generally weak activity. The stable analog of ATP, alpha,beta-methylene ATP (EC(50)=110+/-15 microM) also stimulated cAMP accumulation and exhibited similar efficacy to ATP. The P2Y(2) receptor agonist, UTP had no effect on intracellular cAMP levels. Adenosine and the A(2A)/A(2B) receptor agonist, 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) also stimulated cAMP accumulation in CLL lymphocytes. Adenosine deaminase inhibited the cAMP response to adenosine but had no effect on the ATP-induced cAMP response. On the other hand, the AMP analog, adenosine 5'-thiomonophosphate, (AMPS; 1.0 mM) inhibited ATP-induced and alpha,beta-methylene ATP-induced cAMP production but had no effect on adenosine-induced cAMP production. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed the presence of P2Y(11) receptor as well as A(2A) and A(2B) receptor mRNA in chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes. However, A(2B) receptors would appear to be relatively ineffective because the A(2A) selective agonist, CGS-21680 exhibited comparable efficacy to NECA. Furthermore, the A(2A)-selective antagonist 8-(3-chlorostyryl)-caffeine (CSC) right-shifted the concentration-response curve for NECA. Taken together, the data indicate that ATP induces cAMP accumulation via the activation of P2Y(11) receptors whereas adenosine induces cAMP accumulation via the activation of A(2A) receptors. Coordinate activation of P2Y(11) and A(2A) receptors may influence the developmental fate of normal B-lymphocytes.","['Conigrave, A D', 'Fernando, K C', 'Gu, B', 'Tasevski, V', 'Zhang, W', 'Luttrell, B M', 'Wiley, J S']","['Conigrave AD', 'Fernando KC', 'Gu B', 'Tasevski V', 'Zhang W', 'Luttrell BM', 'Wiley JS']","['Department of Biochemistry (G08), University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, 2006, Australia. a.conigrave@biochem.usyd.edu.au']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Eur J Pharmacol,European journal of pharmacology,1254354,IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Adenosine/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Monophosphate/pharmacology', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', ""Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide)/pharmacology"", 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2/*genetics/physiology', 'Receptors, Purinergic P2X7']",2001/08/31 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0014299901012225 [pii]', '10.1016/s0014-2999(01)01222-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Pharmacol. 2001 Aug 31;426(3):157-63. doi: 10.1016/s0014-2999(01)01222-5.,"['0 (P2RX7 protein, human)', '0 (P2RY11 protein, human)', '0 (Purinergic P2 Receptor Antagonists)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P2X7)', ""35920-39-9 (Adenosine-5'-(N-ethylcarboxamide))"", '415SHH325A (Adenosine Monophosphate)', '61D2G4IYVH (Adenosine Diphosphate)', '63HM46XPOW (KN 62)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)', ""NYX13NT29D (alpha,beta-methyleneadenosine 5'-triphosphate)""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intestinal segment-specific Bcl-2 homolog expression profiles are acquired as early as by mid-gestation (18-20 weeks) in man. In the present study, we examined the question whether such distinctions underlie segment-specific control mechanisms of intestinal cell survival. Using mid-gestation human jejunum and colon organotypic cultures, we analyzed the impact of growth factors (namely insulin; 10 microg/ml) and pharmacological compounds that inhibit signal transduction molecules/pathways (namely tyrosine kinases, Fak, P13-K/Akt, and MEK/Erk) on cell survival and Bcl-2 homolog expression (anti-apoptotic: Bcl-2, Bcl-X(L), Mcl-1; pro-apoptotic: Bax, Bak, Bad). The relative activation levels of p125Fak, p42Erk-2, and p57Akt were analyzed as well. Herein, we report that (1) the inhibition of signal transduction molecules/pathways revealed striking differences in their impact on cell survival in the jejunum and colon (e.g., the inhibition of p125Fak induced apoptosis with a significantly greater extent in the jejunum [approximately 43%] than in the colon [approximately 24%]); (2) sharp distinctions between the two segments were noted in the modulatory effects of the various treatments on Bcl-2 homolog steady-state levels (e.g., inhibition of tyrosine kinase activities in the jejunum down-regulated all anti-apoptotics analyzed while increasing Bax, whereas the same treatment in the colon down-regulated Bcl-X(L) only and increased all pro-apoptotics); and (3) in addition to their differential impact on cell survival and Bcl-2 homolog expression, the MEK/Erk and P13-K/Akt pathways were found to be distinctively regulated in the jejunum and colon mucosae (e.g., insulin in the jejunum increased p42Erk-2 activation without affecting that of p57Akt, whereas the same treatment in the colon decreased p42Erk-2 activation while increasing that of p57Akt). Altogether, these data show that intestinal cell survival is characterized by segment-specific susceptibilities to apoptosis, which are in turn linked with segmental distinctions in the involvement of signaling pathways and the regulation of Bcl-2 homolog steady-state levels. Therefore, these indicate that cell survival is subject to segment-specific control mechanisms along the proximal-distal axis of the intestine.","['Gauthier, R', 'Laprise, P', 'Cardin, E', 'Harnois, C', 'Plourde, A', 'Reed, J C', 'Vezina, A', 'Vachon, P H']","['Gauthier R', 'Laprise P', 'Cardin E', 'Harnois C', 'Plourde A', 'Reed JC', 'Vezina A', 'Vachon PH']","[""Departement d'anatomie et de biologie cellulaire, Faculte de medecine, Universite de Sherbrooke, QC, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics/*physiology', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Colon/*cytology/embryology/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Fetal Proteins/metabolism', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Gestational Age', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Intestinal Mucosa/*cytology/drug effects/embryology/metabolism', 'Jejunum/*cytology/embryology/metabolism', '*MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Organ Culture Techniques', 'Organ Specificity', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/metabolism/*physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', 'bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-Associated Death Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/08/31 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/jcb.1172 [pii]', '10.1002/jcb.1172 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2001;82(2):339-55. doi: 10.1002/jcb.1172.,"['0 (BAD protein, human)', '0 (BAK1 protein, human)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Fetal Proteins)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2 Homologous Antagonist-Killer Protein)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-Associated Death Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP3K1 protein, human)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The correct execution of this program requires the participation of multiple and complex groups of regulators. In addition to transcription factors, which are key tools in ontogenesis by providing sequential switch of different genes, the structure of the chromatin is a dominant determinant leading to gene expression. Through the novel and insightful work of several investigators, it appears that the architecture of the chromatin spanning the genes can and does influence the efficiency of RNA transcription, and therefore of gene expression. Several new enzymatic complexes have been identified that reversibly modify the chromatin architecture by methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation of the nucleosomal core proteins. These enzymes are crucial for the proper balance and maintenance of gene expression, and are often the target of mutations and alterations in human cancer. Here, we review briefly the current models proposing how some of these enzymes normally modify the chromatin structure and how their functional disruption leads to inappropriate gene expression and cell transformation.","['Chakraborty, S', 'Senyuk, V', 'Nucifora, G']","['Chakraborty S', 'Senyuk V', 'Nucifora G']","['Department of Medicine, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Medical Center, Maywood, IL 60153, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'CREB-Binding Protein', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Chromatin/genetics/*ultrastructure', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dimerization', 'Gene Expression Regulation/physiology', 'Gene Targeting', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Models, Genetic', 'Multigene Family', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/physiology', 'Nuclear Proteins/physiology', 'Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2', 'Nucleosomes/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/chemistry/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/physiology', 'Transcription Factors/physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",2001/08/31 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/jcb.1165 [pii]', '10.1002/jcb.1165 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2001;82(2):310-25. doi: 10.1002/jcb.1165.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Histones)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2)', '0 (Nucleosomes)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREB-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (CREBBP protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.1.48 (Crebbp protein, mouse)']",120,"['R01CA67189/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01CA72675/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We here report that apoptosis was induced by low concentrations (1-5 microM) of CEP in a human leukemia T cell line, Jurkat, and by slightly higher concentrations (5-10 microM) in a human chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) cell line K562, which expresses a p210 antiapoptotic Bcr-Abl fusion protein. Induction of apoptosis was confirmed in both Jurkat and K562 cells by DNA fragmentation and typical apoptotic nuclear change, which were preceded by disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential and were induced through a Fas-independent pathway. CEP treatment induced activation of caspase-9 and -3 accompanied by cleavage of PARP, Bid, lamin B1, and DFF45/ICAD in both Jurkat and K562 cells, whereas caspase-8 activation and Akt cleavage were observed only in Jurkat cells. The CEP-induced apoptosis was completely blocked by zVAD-fmk, a broad caspase inhibitor. Interestingly, CEP treatment induced remarkable degradation of the Bcr-Abl protein in K562 cells, and this degradation was prevented partially by zVAD-fmk. When used in combination with a nontoxic concentration of herbimycin A, lower concentrations (2-5 microM) of CEP induced obvious apoptosis in K562 cells with rapid degradation or decrease in the amount of Bcr-Abl and Akt proteins. Our results suggest that CEP, which does not have bone marrow toxicity, may possess therapeutic potential against human leukemias, including CML, which is resistant to anticancer drugs and radiotherapy.","['Wu, J', 'Suzuki, H', 'Zhou, Y W', 'Liu, W', 'Yoshihara, M', 'Kato, M', 'Akhand, A A', 'Hayakawa, A', 'Takeuchi, K', 'Hossain, K', 'Kurosawa, M', 'Nakashima, I']","['Wu J', 'Suzuki H', 'Zhou YW', 'Liu W', 'Yoshihara M', 'Kato M', 'Akhand AA', 'Hayakawa A', 'Takeuchi K', 'Hossain K', 'Kurosawa M', 'Nakashima I']","['Department of Immunology, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', 'Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein', 'Benzoquinones', 'Benzylisoquinolines', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fas Ligand Protein', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Membranes/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Jurkat Cells/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'K562 Cells/cytology/*drug effects/enzymology', 'Lactams, Macrocyclic', '*Lamin Type B', 'Lamins', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/physiology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/metabolism', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Quinones/pharmacology', 'Rifabutin/analogs & derivatives', 'fas Receptor/physiology']",2001/08/31 10:00,2002/02/16 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/jcb.1155 [pii]', '10.1002/jcb.1155 [doi]']",ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2001;82(2):200-14. doi: 10.1002/jcb.1155.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Amino Acid Chloromethyl Ketones)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (BID protein, human)', '0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Benzylisoquinolines)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (FASLG protein, human)', '0 (Fas Ligand Protein)', '0 (Lactams, Macrocyclic)', '0 (Lamin Type B)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Quinones)', '0 (benzyloxycarbonylvalyl-alanyl-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone)', '0 (caspase-activated DNase inhibitor)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '0 (lamin B1)', '1W306TDA6S (Rifabutin)', '70563-58-5 (herbimycin)', '7592YJ0J6T (cepharanthine)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are distinguished by their common means of replication involving reverse transcription, a process inhibited by nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and other compounds used in antiretroviral chemotherapy. Previous work on NRTIs has been limited to their effect on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (for review see Ho & Hitchcock, 1989; Weller, 1999) and little information exists regarding the efficacy and therapeutic potential of these drugs against other retroviruses. We have tested all six NRTIs licensed for HIV treatment [didanosine (ddI), zalcitabine (ddC), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), zidovudine (AZT) and abacavir (ABC)] against seven retroviruses representative of the traditional subfamilies: Spumavirinae, Lentivirinae and the Oncovirinae. As expected, each drug showed a range of activities against the panel of retroviruses, some drugs inhibiting other viruses at concentrations well below those required for HIV. Overall, AZT was the most active inhibitor (IC50 range, 0.032-1.0 microM), being most active against the Spuma (foamy) viruses. Abacavir was inhibitory for HIV-1, MN strain (HIV-1 MN), amphotrophic murine leukemia virus (MLV-A) and simian foamy virus type 6 (SFV-6). The least effective inhibitor, 3TC (IC50 range, 0.32->100 microM), was most potent against simian retrovirus types 1 and 2 (SRV-1, SRV-2) and HIV-1, but did not inhibit foamy viruses and MLV-A. Additionally, there were differences in the concentration of drug required to inhibit closely related viruses. Taken together, these data suggest that NRTIs have a wide spectrum of antiretroviral activity and the activity of compounds, even against closely related retroviruses, cannot be predicted.","['Rosenblum, L L', 'Patton, G', 'Grigg, A R', 'Frater, A J', 'Cain, D', 'Erlwein, O', 'Hill, C L', 'Clarke, J R', 'McClure, M O']","['Rosenblum LL', 'Patton G', 'Grigg AR', 'Frater AJ', 'Cain D', 'Erlwein O', 'Hill CL', 'Clarke JR', 'McClure MO']","['Department of GU Medicine & Communicable Diseases, Imperial College School of Medicine, at St Marys, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Antivir Chem Chemother,Antiviral chemistry & chemotherapy,9009212,IM,"['Animals', 'Antiviral Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Didanosine/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Lamivudine/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Mink', 'Nucleosides/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Retroviridae/*drug effects', 'Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Stavudine/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Zalcitabine/pharmacology/toxicity', 'Zidovudine/pharmacology/toxicity']",2001/08/31 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/095632020101200202 [doi]'],ppublish,Antivir Chem Chemother. 2001 Mar;12(2):91-7. doi: 10.1177/095632020101200202.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Nucleosides)', '0 (Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors)', '2T8Q726O95 (Lamivudine)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', '6L3XT8CB3I (Zalcitabine)', 'BO9LE4QFZF (Stavudine)', 'K3GDH6OH08 (Didanosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The utility of the compound for treating bone marrow (BM) stem cell transplantation-associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) [372946] and for ex vivo purging of BM to remove malignant T-cells [244056] is also being investigated. Additional potential therapeutic areas for which clinical trials are planned or ongoing include vasculitis, multiple sclerosis [288762] and organ transplantation [338304]. A Biologics License Application (BLA) was filed with the FDA in December 1999 by ILEX and Millennium [351523], [351524], [373873]. The FDA accepted the application for filing in February 2000 [355775] and returned a complete response letter in June 2000 [372172]. Millennium and ILEX submitted a response to the FDA in August 2000 [379766]. Alemtuzumab has received Fast Track designation [304771] and orphan drug status from the FDA [288762], and the drug was reviewed by the FDA's Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee on 14 December, 2000 [387228]. The committee voted 14 to 1 to recommend accelerated approval of alemtuzumab for patients with CLL who have been treated with alkylating agents and who have failed fludarabine therapy [393778], [393894]. In March 2000, Millennium and ILEX also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for alemtuzumab to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) [363595]. In October 2000, EMEA accepted the MAA for alemtuzumab under the agency's centralized approval procedure [387228]. Alemtuzumab was originally synthesized by Herman Waldmann and colleagues at Cambridge University and licensed to Burroughs Wellcome (BW) via the British Technology Group (BTG) [162622]. BW conducted phase I and II trials for a broad range of indications, but then discontinued development because of disappointing results in phase II rheumatoid arthritis trials [326848]. In April 1997, LeukoSite licensed rights to the antibody from BTG for the treatment of CLL and prolymphocytic leukemia, plus an option to develop it for other indications. BW agreed to supply LeukoSite with intellectual property [244056], [326848]. In May 1997, LeukoSite entered into a joint venture with ILEX Oncology for the further development of alemtuzumab [245986]. By the end of 1999, Millennium acquired LeukoSite with commitment to pursue development of the compound through the joint venture Millennium & ILEX Partners LP [351523], [370237]. In August 1999, Schering AG and its US affiliate Berlex Laboratories obtained exclusive worldwide marketing rights for alemtuzumab, excluding Japan and East Asia. In the US, Berlex, Millennium and ILEX will divide profits from alemtuzumab sales equally [337702], [338837].","['Dumont, F J']",['Dumont FJ'],"['Merck Research Laboratories, Department of Immunology, Rahway, NJ 07065, USA. frances_dumont@merck.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Curr Opin Investig Drugs,"Current opinion in investigational drugs (London, England : 2000)",100965718,IM,"['Alemtuzumab', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/adverse effects/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antirheumatic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy', 'Multiple Sclerosis/drug therapy', 'Organ Transplantation', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",2001/08/31 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/08/31 10:00'],"['2001/08/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/31 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Curr Opin Investig Drugs. 2001 Jan;2(1):139-60.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antirheumatic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At present, we do not know the long-term outcome of promising new therapies such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, East Hanover, NJ) (formerly STI571) and nonmyeloablative transplants. There is also no reliable way to predict which patients will respond to a particular therapy. The development of methods to predict therapeutic response will be of major benefit to patients, and the newly emerging science of gene array analysis may provide such a tool. In this context, given the proven likelihood of cure with allogeneic transplantation and the negative effects of delay, in Seattle we continue to suggest transplantation as the initial form of therapy for patients below age 55 years with matched sibling donors. For patients without matched donors below the age of 40, we would suggest an unrelated donor search and only proceed directly to transplant for those with allele-level matches. For younger patients without matches and those aged 40 to 55, an initial trial of imatinib mesylate might be preferred. For patients over age 55 with CML, initial therapy with imatinib mesylate, possibly an interferon-containing regimen or nonmyeloablative allogeneic transplantation may be considered.","['Appelbaum, F R']",['Appelbaum FR'],"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98109-1024, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Forecasting', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/standards/trends', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",2001/08/30 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2001/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['ashem0380035s8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90116-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2001 Jul;38(3 Suppl 8):35-42. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90116-7.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],17,['CA-18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

However, the use of this treatment is limited by the availability of suitable human leukocyte antigen (HLA) identical siblings or matched unrelated donors (MUD). As a consequence only a relatively small proportion of CML patients are eligible for a transplant, and of these not all are cured. The preliminary results of trials using the new Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (formerly CGP57-148B, STI571, Gleevec) to treat CML are very encouraging. However, a number of important questions cannot yet be answered: Can imatinib mesylate induce durable molecular remissions? Can the drug prolong survival in comparison with other nontransplant treatments? and, can it actually cure CML patients? Until answers to these questions are available, SCT and use of interferon-alfa (IFN-alpha) alone or in combination (perhaps with imatinib mesylate) must remain major therapeutic options. I summarize here the advantages and disadvantages associated with currently available therapy. I review three different approaches to initial treatment of the CML patient diagnosed in chronic phase, and make a tentative recommendation for one of these options.

When used as front-line therapy, IFN-alpha induces a state of tumor dormancy and delays progression to advanced phase. Unfortunately, IFN-alpha is associated with substantial toxicity at therapeutic doses. The introduction of pegylated IFN-alpha (PEG-IFN-alpha), a modified form of the protein that permits weekly administration, may alleviate some of the problems observed with IFN-alpha. Combination regimens of IFN-alpha with other drugs such as cytarabine (Ara-C) appear to enhance efficacy and are currently under investigation. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp, East Hanover, NJ) (formerly STI571) also is efficacious in chronic-phase CML, with a low toxicity profile. However, its potential to cure CML remains unknown even though it achieves frequent cytogenetic responses. To enhance treatment outcome, a combination of IFN-alpha and imatinib mesylate therapies is proposed. Low-dose IFN-alpha may be given after imatinib mesylate-induced remission as a specific immune stimulant to consolidate the remission. Recent data showing a possible additive effect of imatinib mesylate and IFN-alpha suggest that concurrent use of these agents may also be more effective than single use, particularly in advanced stages of CML where imatinib mesylate has activity but resistance develops.","['Talpaz, M']",['Talpaz M'],"['Division of Medicine, Department of Bioimmunotherapy, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Interferon-alpha/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",2001/08/30 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2001/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['ashem0380022s8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90114-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2001 Jul;38(3 Suppl 8):22-7. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90114-3.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",15,,,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

Molecular analysis for the presence of residual Bcr-Abl-positive cells in patients with a cytogenetic response following treatment with imatinib mesylate reveals that some patients have undetectable disease using quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays capable of detecting 1 in 10(5) Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph(+)) cells. To examine whether the leukemia is still Bcr-Abl-dependent in patients who have responded to imatinib mesylate but have relapsed, a quantitative assay that directly measures enzymatic activity of Bcr-Abl toward one of its major signaling substrates has been developed. This assay allows monitoring both of the imatinib mesylate sensitivity of patient cells in vitro, and of the endogenous inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase activity during imatinib mesylate treatment and relapse. Studies show that imatinib mesylate resistance is associated with restored activation of the Bcr-Abl signal transduction pathway in the majority of cases, indicating that Bcr-Abl remains a valid target for therapeutic intervention. Understanding resistance mechanisms of Ph(+) leukemia to imatinib mesylate will allow design of therapies to overcome such barriers to efficacy.","['Sawyers, C L']",['Sawyers CL'],"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology and Oncology, Molecular Biology Institute, University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzamides', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence']",2001/08/30 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2001/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['ashem0380015s8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90113-1 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2001 Jul;38(3 Suppl 8):15-21. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90113-1.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",17,,,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

An in vitro differentiation model was used to examine the role of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase in the pathogenesis of CML. A tetracycline-regulated promoter was developed to drive Bcr-Abl expression in differentiating embryonal stem cells. Enforced Bcr-Abl expression was sufficient to increase the number of multilineage progenitors. Myeloid progenitors were expanded in particular and erythroid development was suppressed, consistent with the phenotype of CML. A complementary approach was used to investigate the effect of specifically blocking Bcr-Abl-deregulated tyrosine kinase activity in transformed cells. For this purpose a fusion ""escort/phosphatase"" was created that binds to Bcr-Abl and effectively inhibits kinase activity in vitro and in vivo. Loss of function was demonstrated by growth inhibition of bcr-abl-transformed fibroblasts, reacquisition of growth factor dependence by Bcr-Abl-expressing hematopoietic cells, and normalization of erythroid differentiation in a human CML line. These studies reaffirm the central role of stem cell biology in understanding the causes and possible treatments for CML, and suggest that direct targeting and inhibition of Bcr-Abl kinase activity is a valid therapeutic approach to treating this disease.","['Witte, O']",['Witte O'],"['Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Animals', 'Benzamides', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism/physiology', 'Genetic Therapy/methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/etiology/*therapy', 'Piperazines/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Stem Cells/*metabolism']",2001/08/30 10:00,2002/03/07 10:01,['2001/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/07 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['ashem0380003s8 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90111-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2001 Jul;38(3 Suppl 8):3-8. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90111-8.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",30,,,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

In order to produce retrovirus vectors targeting ovarian cancer cells, which specifically overexpress alpha folate receptor (alphaFR), a single chain antibody was fused as an N-terminal extension of the ecotropic and amphotropic murine leukemia virus (MLV) envelope glycoproteins. Vector particles bearing the modified glycoproteins were produced and analysed. Although conventional FACS studies indicated that viral particles bearing the modified Env could bind to ovarian cancer cells, targeted infection was not achieved. The initial step of virus-cell interaction was further studied using an immunofluorescence technique, which allows visualisation of single retrovirus particles. Vectors bearing chimeric or wild-type glycoproteins bound equally well to cells with or without the targeted receptor, although soluble chimeric glycoproteins bound specifically to FBP. Our results indicate that the incorporation of specific ligands to the virus envelope does not necessarily result in significant enhancement of vector particle binding. A similar interaction was also observed using Env-defective virus particles, suggesting that cellular factors incorporated into the lipid envelope play a dominant role in promoting initial adsorption of virus particles to cells. Significant implications arise from these observations on the interpretation of previous reports on 'targeted' vectors, and for the development of vectors for in vivo gene therapy protocols.","['Pizzato, M', 'Blair, E D', 'Fling, M', 'Kopf, J', 'Tomassetti, A', 'Weiss, R A', 'Takeuchi, Y']","['Pizzato M', 'Blair ED', 'Fling M', 'Kopf J', 'Tomassetti A', 'Weiss RA', 'Takeuchi Y']","['Wohl Virion Centre, Windeyer Institute of Medical Sciences, University College London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Gene Ther,Gene therapy,9421525,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Adsorption', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Blotting, Western', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genetic Engineering', 'Genetic Therapy/*methods', 'Genetic Vectors/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*therapy', '*Receptors, Cell Surface']",2001/08/30 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2001/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.gt.3301494 [doi]'],ppublish,Gene Ther. 2001 Jul;8(14):1088-96. doi: 10.1038/sj.gt.3301494.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies demonstrate that TPA targets SAPK to mitochondria by a mechanism dependent on activation of protein kinase C (PKC) beta. Translocation of SAPK to mitochondria in response to TPA is associated with release of cytochrome c, caspase-3 activation and induction of apoptosis. The results show that TPA induces the association of SAPK with the mitochondrial anti-apoptotic Bcl-x(L) protein. Overexpression of Bcl-x(L) attenuated the apoptotic response to TPA treatment. Moreover, expression of Bcl-x(L) mutated at sites of SAPK phosphorylation (Thr-47, -115) was more effective than wild-type Bcl-x(L) in abrogating TPA-induced cytochrome c release and apoptosis. By contrast, expression of Bcl-x(L) had little effect on induction of the monocytic phenotype.

This method allows the study of nucleic acids in a unique and largely unfettered environment without the complicated lattice interactions typically observed in DNA-only crystal structures. Molecular-replacement phasing using only the protein provided readily interpretable electron density with no model bias for the DNA. The asymmetric unit of the structure consists of the protein molecule bound to the blunt end of a DNA 6/10-mer, which is composed of a six-base strand (5'-GTCGTC-3') and a ten-base strand (3'-CAGCAGGGCA-5'), resulting in a six-base-pair duplex with a four-base single-stranded overhang. In the crystal structure, the bases of the overhang reciprocally pair to yield a doubly nicked pseudo-hexadecamer primarily B-form DNA molecule. The pairing between the single strands gives two standard (G-C) Watson-Crick pairs and two G(anti)-A(anti) mispairs. The mispairs reside in a G-C-rich environment and the three consecutive guanines on the 10-mer impart interesting structural features to the pseudo-hexadecamer, such as the preference for a guanine stack, stretching the C-G base pairs flanking the mispair to the point of loss of intra-base-pair hydrogen bonding. The DNA was designed for the purpose of comparison with a previous structure, which was determined in the same crystal lattice. In all of the authors' previous fragment-DNA complexes, the nucleotide at the blunt-ended 3'-hydroxyl was a purine. Consistent with the proposed mechanistic role of interactions with the 3'-hydroxyl in processive DNA synthesis by RT, it was found that a pyrimidine at this position in the DNA makes indentical interactions with the strictly conserved Gly191 and the main chain of Leu115 of MMLV RT.","['Cote, M L', 'Georgiadis, M M']","['Cote ML', 'Georgiadis MM']","['Waksman Institute and Department of Chemistry, Rutgers University, 190 Frelinghuysen Road, Piscataway, NJ 08854, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Acta Crystallogr D Biol Crystallogr,"Acta crystallographica.

The translocation, which involves the AML1 gene on chromosome 21 and the ETO gene on chromosome 8, generates an AML1-ETO fusion transcription factor. To examine the effect of the AML1-ETO fusion protein on leukemogenesis, we made transgenic mice in which expression of AML1-ETO is under the control of the human MRP8 promoter (hMRP8-AML1-ETO). AML1-ETO is specifically expressed in myeloid cells, including common myeloid progenitors of hMRP8-AML1-ETO transgenic mice. The transgenic mice were healthy during their life spans, suggesting that AML1-ETO alone is not sufficient for leukemogenesis. However, after treatment of newborn hMRP8-AML1-ETO transgenic mice and their wild-type littermates with a strong DNA-alkylating mutagen, N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, 55% of transgenic mice developed AML and the other 45% of transgenic mice and all of the wild-type littermates developed acute T lymphoblastic leukemia. Our results provide direct evidence that AML1-ETO is critical for causing myeloid leukemia, but one or more additional mutations are required for leukemogenesis. The hMRP8-AML1-ETO-transgenic mice provide an excellent model that can be used to isolate additional genetic events and to further understand the molecular pathogenesis of AML1-ETO-related leukemia.","['Yuan, Y', 'Zhou, L', 'Miyamoto, T', 'Iwasaki, H', 'Harakawa, N', 'Hetherington, C J', 'Burel, S A', 'Lagasse, E', 'Weissman, I L', 'Akashi, K', 'Zhang, D E']","['Yuan Y', 'Zhou L', 'Miyamoto T', 'Iwasaki H', 'Harakawa N', 'Hetherington CJ', 'Burel SA', 'Lagasse E', 'Weissman IL', 'Akashi K', 'Zhang DE']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Calcium-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Calgranulin A', 'Carcinogens/toxicity', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8/genetics', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Ethylnitrosourea/toxicity', 'Gene Expression', 'Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*etiology/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/08/30 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/30 10:00'],"['2001/08/30 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/30 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.171321298 [doi]', '98/18/10398 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Aug 28;98(18):10398-403. doi: 10.1073/pnas.171321298.,"['0 (AML1-ETO fusion protein, human)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",,"['P01 CA072009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA72009/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC56972,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The MLL-ENL and the reciprocal ENL-MLL genomic fusions and their chimeric transcripts were characterized from samples collected at the time of t-AML diagnosis. We used PCR with patient-specific genomic primers to establish the emergence of the MLL-ENL fusion in serially obtained DNA samples. The MLL-ENL fusion was not detectable in bone marrow at the time of ALL diagnosis or after 2 months of chemotherapy (frequency <8.3 x 10(-7) cells(-1)). The genomic fusion was first detected in bone marrow after 6 months of treatment at a frequency of one in 4,000 mononuclear bone marrow cells; the frequency was one in 70 cells after 20 months of therapy. At the first detection of MLL-ENL, the only topoisomerase II inhibitors the patient had received were one dose of daunorubicin and two doses of etoposide. The MLL-ENL fusion was not detectable in blood at the time of ALL diagnosis or after 0.7, 2, 8, 10, and 12 months of therapy but was detectable in blood at 16 months (one in 2.3 x 10(4) cells).

Sixty eight percent of patients aged under 60 years were treated in a clinical trial compared with 24% of patients over 60. The major reasons given for not entering patients in a trial were ineligibility in the younger cohort and poor performance status in the older group. Twenty elderly patients (12.5%) refused to be entered in a trial. In an unselected cohort of patients with AML the accrual into clinical trials is impressively high for patients under 60 years. However, this is a disease of the elderly and comparable enrolment is not seen with elderly patients despite being managed by the same haematologists.

Recent discoveries promise to provide individualized treatment options, increased long-term survival for women with breast cancer, and the possibility of moving toward curative intent in the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Age, race, tumor size, histological tumor type, axillary nodal status, standardized pathological grade, and hormone-receptor status are accepted as established prognostic and/or predictive factors for selection of systemic adjuvant treatment of breast cancer. The role of other promising new factors, such as p53 mutations, HER-2 status, plasminogen activator system, histological evidence of vascular invasion, and quantitative parameters of angiogenesis will be determined in ongoing prospective studies. Currently, 5 years' treatment with adjuvant tamoxifen in women with hormone-positive receptor status, is regarded as the optimal duration of treatment. Long-term follow-up on the randomized trials will determine the added benefit of treatment beyond 5 years. Ovarian ablation has shown a reduction in recurrence and death, and the exact role and extent of adjuvant chemotherapy in premenopausal women with hormone-responsive tumors is under discussion. Combination hormonal and chemo-hormonal therapies are also being evaluated. There are no convincing data on the survival impact of tamoxifen as a preventative therapy for breast cancer: longer-term follow-up is required, and the planned meta-analyses in 2005 should help shed light on this issue. Statistically significant benefits have been observed with adjuvant chemotherapy (particularly with anthracycline-containing regimens in premenopausal women) versus no adjuvant chemotherapy. The optimal length of adjuvant anthracycline/cyclophosphamide (AC) regimens needs further evaluation as do randomized comparisons of AC to cyclophosphamide/ doxorubicin/5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cyclophosphamide/epirubicin/5-FU. Although taxanes promise to provide an additive benefit to adjuvant chemotherapy regimens, the Cancer and Leukemia Group B 9344 and the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project B-28 studies evaluating paclitaxel in the adjuvant setting have not yet demonstrated statistically significant benefits on disease-free survival and overall survival. In the year 2000, all adjuvant therapy studies conducted by the Co-operative Groups in both node-negative and node-positive disease involve a taxane. High-dose chemotherapy evaluations are still ongoing. The numerous prospective adjuvant therapy trials (hormonal; selective estrogen-receptor modulators; aromatase inhibitors; chemotherapy, involving anthracyclines/taxanes/platinum/trastuzumab; biological factors; elderly women (>70 years); high-risk patients; radiotherapy in 1-3 positive lymph nodes), and neoadjuvant studies might further define the chances to enhance cure rates in the treatment of primary breast cancer.","['Aapro, M S']",['Aapro MS'],"['Clinique de Genolier, Switzerland. aapro@cdg.ch']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Oncologist,The oncologist,9607837,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Radiotherapy, Adjuvant']",2001/08/29 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/08/29 10:00'],"['2001/08/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1634/theoncologist.6-4-376 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncologist. 2001;6(4):376-85. doi: 10.1634/theoncologist.6-4-376.,,68,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thiamine status was assessed prospectively in 14 untreated B-chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) patients, and in 14 age matched control patients with non-malignant disease. Patients with any known cause of absolute, relative, or functional thiamine deficiency were excluded. High (>15%) thiamine pyrophosphate effect (TPPE), indicating thiamine deficiency, was found in five out of 14 CLL patients (35.7%) and in none of the controls (p=0.057). Mean (SD) TPPE in the thiamine deficient patients group was 21.6 (3.4)%. In all the patients, thiamine deficiency was subclinical. No correlates for the thiamine deficiency have been found save for an increment of more than 20% in the total leucocyte count over the preceding three months, which was found in all five thiamine deficient patients compared with only one of the nine non-thiamine deficient CLL patients. Thus, CLL patients may be prone to develop primary thiamine deficiency possibly promoted by the increased leucocytes span, which may increase thiamine consumption. Since even subclinical thiamine deficiency may be detrimental to the patient's clinical course, and in view of the theoretical danger of thiamine promoted tumour cell proliferation, further large scale studies are warranted to confirm this observation, and to elucidate the issue of thiamine supplementation to CLL patients.","['Seligmann, H', 'Levi, R', 'Konijn, A M', 'Prokocimer, M']","['Seligmann H', 'Levi R', 'Konijn AM', 'Prokocimer M']","['Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Bnai Zion Medical Center, Technion Faculty of Medicine, Haifa, Israel. konijn@md2.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Postgrad Med J,Postgraduate medical journal,0234135,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*etiology', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prospective Studies', 'Thiamine Deficiency/*etiology']",2001/08/29 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/08/29 10:00'],"['2001/08/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/pmj.77.911.582 [doi]'],ppublish,Postgrad Med J. 2001 Sep;77(911):582-5. doi: 10.1136/pmj.77.911.582.,,,,,,,,,PMC1757892,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The STAT3 signal may be involved in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS). METHODS AND RESULTS: The effects of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or adenovirus-mediated transfection of constitutively activated STAT3 (caSTAT3) on the intracellular ROS formation induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) were examined using rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. Either LIF treatment or caSTAT3 significantly suppressed the increase of H/R-induced ROS evaluated by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin diacetate fluorescence. To assess whether ROS are really involved in H/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury, the amount of creatine phosphokinase in cultured medium was examined. Both LIF treatment and caSTAT3 significantly decreased H/R-induced creatine phosphokinase release. These results indicate that the gp130/STAT3 signal protects H/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury by scavenging ROS generation. To investigate the mechanism of scavenging ROS, the effects of LIF on the induction of antioxidant enzymes were examined. LIF treatment significantly increased the expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) mRNA, whereas the expression of the catalase and glutathione peroxidase genes were unaffected. This induction of MnSOD mRNA expression was completely blocked by adenovirus-mediated transfection of dominant-negative STAT3. Moreover, caSTAT3 augmented MnSOD mRNA and its enzyme activity. In addition, the antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide to MnSOD significantly inhibited both LIF and caSTAT3-mediated protective effects. CONCLUSIONS: The activation of STAT3 induces a protective effect on H/R-induced cardiomyocyte damage, mainly by inducting MnSOD. The STAT3-mediated signal is proposed as a therapeutical target of ROS-induced cardiomyocyte injury.","['Negoro, S', 'Kunisada, K', 'Fujio, Y', 'Funamoto, M', 'Darville, M I', 'Eizirik, D L', 'Osugi, T', 'Izumi, M', 'Oshima, Y', 'Nakaoka, Y', 'Hirota, H', 'Kishimoto, T', 'Yamauchi-Takihara, K']","['Negoro S', 'Kunisada K', 'Fujio Y', 'Funamoto M', 'Darville MI', 'Eizirik DL', 'Osugi T', 'Izumi M', 'Oshima Y', 'Nakaoka Y', 'Hirota H', 'Kishimoto T', 'Yamauchi-Takihara K']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Circulation,Circulation,0147763,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/drug effects', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Myocardium/cytology/*metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Superoxide Dismutase/genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Up-Regulation/drug effects']",2001/08/29 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/29 10:00'],"['2001/08/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1161/hc3401.095947 [doi]'],ppublish,Circulation. 2001 Aug 28;104(9):979-81. doi: 10.1161/hc3401.095947.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sixty African children were included in this study. At the time of cancer diagnosis, 67.7 per cent had not been exposed to hepatitis B, and none had active infection. After follow-up (median of 20 months; range 4-81 months) 23.3 per cent had active hepatitis B infection, which was subclinical in the majority of cases. The diagnosis of leukaemia/lymphoma posed a major risk factor for the acquisition of active hepatitis B infection (chi-square 7.0; p-value = 0.008), probably due to intensive chemotherapy regimens and severity of immunosuppression. No association with gender, age, place of origin, or number of blood transfusions was found. Patients with leukaemia/lymphoma were at an increased risk for horizontal transmission of hepatitis B. A policy of active surveillance for infective carriers of hepatitis B infection and passive immunization of seronegative immunosuppressed patients must be implemented to limit the endemic infection in paediatric oncology units.","['Willers, E', 'Webber, L', 'Delport, R', 'Kruger, M']","['Willers E', 'Webber L', 'Delport R', 'Kruger M']","['Department of Paediatrics, Kalafong Hospital, University of Pretoria, South Africa.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Trop Pediatr,Journal of tropical pediatrics,8010948,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'Female', 'Hepatitis B/etiology/*transmission', 'Hepatitis B e Antigens/blood', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'South Africa']",2001/08/29 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/29 10:00'],"['2001/08/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/29 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/tropej/47.4.220 [doi]'],ppublish,J Trop Pediatr. 2001 Aug;47(4):220-5. doi: 10.1093/tropej/47.4.220.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hepatitis B e Antigens)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",,,,,,,,,,,,10.1093/tropej/47.4.220 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum 1,25(OH)2vitaminD3 and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels were suppressed below normal ranges on admission. The circulating parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) value was within a normal range (< 1.1 pmol/L). Serum concentrations of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and soluble IL-2 receptor were increased to 72 pg/ml, 25.3 pg/ml, and 1469 U/ml, respectively. Following the induction chemotherapy, the serum calcium level was promptly normalized accompanied with decreases in serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 and soluble IL-2 receptor values to 34 pg/ml, 6.35 pg/ml, and 737 U/ml, respectively. Serum PTHrP values remained within detectable levels. To our knowledge, this is the first case of B-cell ALL in a patient who developed hypercalcemia with elevated concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and soluble IL-2 receptor, but not related to PTHrP. High circulating proinflammatory cytokines may have contributed to development of ALL-induced osteolysis and hypercalcemia in the present case.","['Fukasawa, H', 'Kato, A', 'Fujigaki, Y', 'Yonemura, K', 'Furuya, R', 'Hishida, A']","['Fukasawa H', 'Kato A', 'Fujigaki Y', 'Yonemura K', 'Furuya R', 'Hishida A']","['First Department of Medicine, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Japan. fukasawa@akiha.hama-med.ac.jp']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med Sci,The American journal of the medical sciences,0370506,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Neoplasms/*blood/*complications', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*blood/*complications/diagnostic imaging', 'Calcitriol/blood', 'Cytokines/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/blood/*etiology', 'Interleukin-6/blood', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/blood', 'Parathyroid Hormone/*blood', 'Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein', 'Proteins/metabolism', 'Radiography', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/blood', 'Skull Neoplasms/blood/complications', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/metabolism']",2001/08/29 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/29 10:00'],"['2001/08/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/29 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0002-9629(15)34616-4 [pii]', '10.1097/00000441-200108000-00009 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med Sci. 2001 Aug;322(2):109-12. doi: 10.1097/00000441-200108000-00009.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (PTHLH protein, human)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone)', '0 (Parathyroid Hormone-Related Protein)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The TUNEL immunohistochemical assay was used to study apoptosis of bone marrow cells in the histological specimens from 24 patients: 8 with refractory anemia (RA), 8 with acute small-proportion leukemias [RA with excessive blasts (RAEB) + RAEB in transformation (RAEBt)], 3 with acute non-lymphoblastic leukemia (ANLL), 5 with lymphogranulomatosis (LGM). Control apoptosis examination was made in 10 patients treated with CSA. The proliferative activity of bone marrow cell was evaluated by bone marrow histological specimens from 10 patients (8 patients with RA and 2 with RAEB + RAEBt) at the onset of disease and during CSA therapy in the immunohistochemical test with primary nuclear antigen Ki-67 antigen antibodies. Changes in the proliferative activity and degree of apoptosis of bone marrow cells were assessed in relation to the cellularity detectable by the histological specimens. RESULTS: Patients with RA showed an increase in bone marrow cell apoptosis to 25.375 +/- 6.874 (-10.8 +/- 5.122 and 8.333 +/- 5.84 in controls and ANLL patients, respectively). The cells of hemopoiesis and stromal microenvironment are in the process of cell death. Higher bone marrow cellularity is observed in CSA-treated patients at clinical and hematological remission, which is followed by rises in the index of proliferation and the degree of apoptosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients were examined after allogenic TBM, which was performed during the chronic phase of CML in 9 patients and during acceleration phase in 1. Two patients received therapy with donor lymphocytes during relapse after transplantation. Time course of chimerism and minimum residual illness was studied by standard cytogenetic methods, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with DNA probes to centromer sites of X and Y chromosomes and BCR and ABL genes. The studies were carried out 30, 60, 90, 180 days, 9 months, 1 year, and then every 6 months after transplantation. RESULTS: Mixed chimerism was observed in all patients during 9 months after TBM. The count of host cells was 0.1-5.8% in 8 patients; later the count of autologous cells was less than 1% in 5 patients, and in 3 patients complete donor chimerism was observed. Clinical hematological remission was stable in these patients. Relapses of leukemia with 40 and 83.1% host cells occurred in 2 patients 13 and 23 months after transplantation, respectively. Donor lymphocytes were transfused in order to induce the graft versus host effect, and in patient No. 2 restoration of donor hemopoiesis was attained. CONCLUSION: Highly sensitive FISH method with DNA probe to centromer sites of X and Y chromosomes detects early relapse of the disease and demonstrates the time course of donor hemopoiesis recovery after transfusion of donor lymphocytes. The data indicate that 9 months after transplantation molecular cytogenetic studies should be carried out more often (once a month), particularly in patients with poor prognosis, for earlier detection of the relapse and beginning of immunotherapy.","['Vinogradova, O A', 'Savchenko, V G', 'Neverova, A L', 'Diachenko, L V', 'Domracheva, E V', 'Liubimova, L S', 'Mendeleeva, L P']","['Vinogradova OA', 'Savchenko VG', 'Neverova AL', 'Diachenko LV', 'Domracheva EV', 'Liubimova LS', 'Mendeleeva LP']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Ter Arkh,Terapevticheskii arkhiv,2984818R,IM,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Recurrence', 'Time Factors', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/08/29 10:00,2002/03/19 10:01,['2001/08/29 10:00'],"['2001/08/29 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/03/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/29 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ter Arkh. 2001;73(7):26-34.,,,,,,Izuchenie dinamiki smeshannogo khimerizma metodom fliuorestsentnoi gibridizatsii in situ u bol'nykh khronicheskim mieloleikozom posle allogennoi transplantatsii kostnogo mozga.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When K562 cells were exposed to mild heat shock (42 degrees C, 30 min) or oxidative stress (50 microM H2O2, 20 min) and allowed to recover for 2 h, there was a severalfold induction of hGST5.8, which catalyzes the formation of glutathione-4-HNE conjugate (GS-HNE), and RLIP76, which mediates the transport of GS-HNE from cells (Awasthi, S., Cheng, J., Singhal, S. S., Saini, M. K., Pandya, U., Pikula, S., Bandorowicz-Pikula, J., Singh, S. V., Zimniak, P., and Awasthi, Y. C. (2000) Biochemistry 39, 9327-9334). Enhanced LPO was observed in stressed cells, but the major antioxidant enzymes and HSP70 remained unaffected. The stressed cells showed higher GS-HNE-conjugating activity and increased efflux of GS-HNE. Stress-pre-conditioned cells with induced hGST5.8 and RLIP76 acquired resistance to 4-HNE and H2O2-mediated apoptosis by suppressing a sustained activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and caspase 3. The protective effect of stress pre-conditioning against apoptosis was abrogated by coating the cells with anti-RLIP76 IgG, which inhibited the efflux of GS-HNE from cells, indicating that the cells acquired resistance to apoptosis by metabolizing and excluding 4-HNE at a higher rate. Induction of hGST5.8 and RLIP76 by mild, transient stress and the resulting resistance of stress-pre-conditioned cells to apoptosis appears to be a general phenomenon since it was not limited to K562 cells but was also evident in lung cancer cells, H-69, H-226, human leukemia cells, HL-60, and human retinal pigmented epithelial cells. These results strongly suggest a role of LPO products, particularly 4-HNE, in the initial phase of stress mediated signaling.","['Cheng, J Z', 'Sharma, R', 'Yang, Y', 'Singhal, S S', 'Sharma, A', 'Saini, M K', 'Singh, S V', 'Zimniak, P', 'Awasthi, S', 'Awasthi, Y C']","['Cheng JZ', 'Sharma R', 'Yang Y', 'Singhal SS', 'Sharma A', 'Saini MK', 'Singh SV', 'Zimniak P', 'Awasthi S', 'Awasthi YC']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas 77555-1067, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['*ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters', 'Aldehydes/*metabolism/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Carrier Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Culture Media', 'Enzyme Activation', '*GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Glutathione Transferase/*biosynthesis', 'Heat-Shock Response', '*Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'K562 Cells', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', '*Oxidative Stress']",2001/08/28 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/28 10:00'],"['2001/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M106838200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(20)77979-2 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Nov 2;276(44):41213-23. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M106838200.

This event fuses the genes MLL and ENL and creates the leukemogenic oncoprotein MLL-ENL. We studied the effect of retroviral MLL-ENL expression in primary mouse hematopoietic cells and show here that MLL-ENL requires the oncoprotein Myc to establish a reversible differentiation arrest of a myelomonocytic precursor population. MLL-ENL-transduced cells proliferated as immature myeloid cells in the presence of interleukin 3. The addition of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor reversed the maturation block set by MLL-ENL and induced the development of mature granulocytes and macrophages accompanied by growth arrest. Gene expression analysis indicated a down-regulation of the proto-oncogene c-myc and of several c-myc target genes during granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mediated differentiation. The role of c-myc in the MLL-ENL transformation pathway was tested by modulating the effective Myc protein concentrations in MLL-ENL transduced cells. Cotransduction of dominant-negative Myc neutralized the MLL-ENL effect and precluded transformation. In contrast, constitutive expression of Myc cooperated with MLL-ENL and caused the transformation of a cell population with an irreversible maturation arrest.","['Schreiner, S', 'Birke, M', 'Garcia-Cuellar, M P', 'Zilles, O', 'Greil, J', 'Slany, R K']","['Schreiner S', 'Birke M', 'Garcia-Cuellar MP', 'Zilles O', 'Greil J', 'Slany RK']","['Department of Genetics, University Erlangen, 91058 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/genetics/physiology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/pathology', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, myc/*physiology', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic']",2001/08/28 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/28 10:00'],"['2001/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Sep 1;61(17):6480-6.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MLL-ENL oncoprotein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overexpression of SCL and LMO1 in the thymus of transgenic mice leads to T-ALL at a young age. scid (severe combined immunodeficient) mice are unable to efficiently recombine antigen receptor genes and consequently display a developmental block at the CD4-CD8- to CD4+CD8+ transition. To test the hypothesis that this developmental block would protect SCL/LMO1 transgenic mice from developing T-ALL, we crossed the SCL and LMO1 transgenes onto a scid background. The age of onset for T-ALL in the SCL/LMO1/scid mice was significantly delayed (P < 0.001) compared with SCL/LMO1/wild-type mice. Intriguingly, all of the SCL/LMO1/scid malignancies displayed clonal, in-frame TCRbeta gene rearrangements. Taken together, these findings suggest that the ""leaky"" scid thymocyte that undergoes a productive TCRbeta gene rearrangement is susceptible to the oncogenic action of SCL and LMO1 and additionally suggests that TCRbeta gene rearrangements may be required for the oncogenic action of SCL and LMO1.","['Chervinsky, D S', 'Lam, D H', 'Melman, M P', 'Gross, K W', 'Aplan, P D']","['Chervinsky DS', 'Lam DH', 'Melman MP', 'Gross KW', 'Aplan PD']","['Genetics Department, Medicine Branch, Division of Clinical Sciences, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Clone Cells', 'Crosses, Genetic', 'DNA-Activated Protein Kinase', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, beta-Chain T-Cell Antigen Receptor/*immunology', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/immunology', 'Male', 'Metalloproteins/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, SCID', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Nuclear Proteins', '*Oncogene Proteins', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics/immunology', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogenes/genetics', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/immunology/*physiology', 'Thymus Gland/*cytology/immunology/physiology', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transgenes/genetics']",2001/08/28 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/28 10:00'],"['2001/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Sep 1;61(17):6382-7.,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (Lmo1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (DNA-Activated Protein Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present work was devoted to the study of A3 adenosine receptors in Jurkat cells, a human leukemia line. 2. The A3 subtype was found by means of RT-PCR experiments and characterized by using the new A3 adenosine receptor antagonist [3H]-MRE 3008F20, the only A3 selective radioligand currently available. Saturation experiments revealed a single high affinity binding site with K(D) of 1.9+/-0.2 nM and B(max) of 1.3+/-0.1 pmol mg(-1) of protein. 3. The pharmacological profile of [3H]-MRE 3008F20 binding on Jurkat cells was established using typical adenosine ligands which displayed a rank order of potency typical of the A3 subtype. 4. Thermodynamic data indicated that [3H]-MRE 3008F20 binding to A3 subtype in Jurkat cells was entropy- and enthalpy-driven, according with that found in cells expressing the recombinant human A3 subtype. 5. In functional assays the high affinity A3 agonists Cl-IB-MECA and IB-MECA were able to inhibit cyclic AMP accumulation and stimulate Ca(2+) release from intracellular Ca(2+) pools followed by Ca(2+) influx. 6. The presence of the other adenosine subtypes was investigated in Jurkat cells. A1 receptors were characterized using [3H]-DPCPX binding with a K(D) of 0.9+/-0.1 nM and B(max) of 42+/-3 fmol mg(-1) of protein. A2A receptors were studied with [3H]-SCH 58261 binding and revealed a K(D) of 2.5+/-0.3 nM and a B(max) of 1.4+/-0.2 pmol mg(-1) of protein. 7. In conclusion, by means of the first antagonist radioligand [3H]-MRE 3008F20 we could demonstrate the existence of functional A3 receptors on Jurkat cells.","['Gessi, S', 'Varani, K', 'Merighi, S', 'Morelli, A', 'Ferrari, D', 'Leung, E', 'Baraldi, P G', 'Spalluto, G', 'Borea, P A']","['Gessi S', 'Varani K', 'Merighi S', 'Morelli A', 'Ferrari D', 'Leung E', 'Baraldi PG', 'Spalluto G', 'Borea PA']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Pharmacology Unit, University of Ferrara, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Pharmacol,British journal of pharmacology,7502536,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive/drug effects', 'CHO Cells', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Cyclic AMP/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Kinetics', 'Phenylurea Compounds/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists', 'Pyrimidines/metabolism/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Adenosine A2A', 'Receptor, Adenosine A3', 'Receptors, Purinergic P1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'T-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Thermodynamics', 'Time Factors', 'Triazoles/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tritium', 'Xanthines/metabolism/pharmacology']",2001/08/28 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/28 10:00'],"['2001/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bjp.0704254 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Pharmacol. 2001 Sep;134(1):116-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.bjp.0704254.,"['0', '(5-amino-7-(2-phenylethyl)-2-(2-furyl)pyrazolo(4,3-e)-1,2,4-triazolo(1,5-c)pyrimi', 'dine)', '0 (MRE 3008-F20)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Purinergic P1 Receptor Agonists)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptor, Adenosine A2A)', '0 (Receptor, Adenosine A3)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic P1)', '0 (Triazoles)', '0 (Xanthines)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', '9PTP4FOI9E (1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,PMC1572937,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A report of 391 cases by GIMEMA Infection Program.,862-70,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the clinical characteristics of patients with hematologic malignancies developing a filamentous fungi infection (FFI) and to define the prognostic factors for their outcome. DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective study, conducted on patients admitted to 14 Hematology divisions of tertiary care or university hospitals, participating in the GIMEMA Infection Program, over a ten-year period (1988-1997). The study included patients with hematological malignancies and a histologically and/or microbiologically proven or probable FFI. RESULTS: We included 391 patients (male/female: 262/129, median age 49 years) with hematologic malignancies (225 acute myeloid leukemia, 67 acute lymphocytic leukemia, 30 chronic myeloid leukemia, 22 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 12 myelodysplastic syndrome, 10 aplastic anemia, 7 Hodgkin's disease, 8 chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 5 multiple myeloma, and 5 hairy cell leukemia) who developed a proven FFI. Eighty percent of the patients had been neutropenic for an average of 14 days before the infection, and 71% had an absolute neutrophil count lower than 0.5 x 10(9)/L at the time of FFI diagnosis. The primary sites of infection were: lungs (85%), nose and paranasal sinus (10%), and other sites (5%). The diagnosis was made while still alive in 310 patients (79%), and at autopsy in the remaining 81 patients (21%). Chest X-ray was diagnostic in 77% of patients with pulmonary FFI, while computed tomography (CT) scan of the thorax was positive in 95% of cases. A significant diagnostic advantage for CT scan was observed in 145 patients who had both a chest X-ray and CT scan. Aspergillus was identified as the cause of FFI in 296 patients, Mucorales in 45 patients, Fusarium in 6 patients and other filamentous fungi species in 4 patients, while in a further 40 patients no agent was identifiable. The overall mortality rate three months after the diagnosis of FFI was 74%, and fungal infection had been the cause of death in 51% of patients. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective study shows that FFI still remains a life-threatening complication in neutropenic patients. Despite appropriate treatment, half of the patients die due to this complication. The use of glucocorticoids and recovery from neutropenia are the most important prognostic factors. Mucorales infections are associated with a significantly poorer prognosis than those due to Aspergillus spp.","['Pagano, L', 'Girmenia, C', 'Mele, L', 'Ricci, P', 'Tosti, M E', 'Nosari, A', 'Buelli, M', 'Picardi, M', 'Allione, B', 'Corvatta, L', ""D'Antonio, D"", 'Montillo, M', 'Melillo, L', 'Chierichini, A', 'Cenacchi, A', 'Tonso, A', 'Cudillo, L', 'Candoni, A', 'Savignano, C', 'Bonini, A', 'Martino, P', 'Del Favero, A']","['Pagano L', 'Girmenia C', 'Mele L', 'Ricci P', 'Tosti ME', 'Nosari A', 'Buelli M', 'Picardi M', 'Allione B', 'Corvatta L', ""D'Antonio D"", 'Montillo M', 'Melillo L', 'Chierichini A', 'Cenacchi A', 'Tonso A', 'Cudillo L', 'Candoni A', 'Savignano C', 'Bonini A', 'Martino P', 'Del Favero A']","['Istituto di Semeiotica Medica, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, largo Francesco Vito 1, 00168 Rome, Italy. lpagano@rm.unicatt.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fungi', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/complications/*microbiology/mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/etiology/mortality/*pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/08/28 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2001/08/28 10:00'],"['2001/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2001/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Aug;86(8):862-70.,,,,,,,,,,,"['GIMEMA Infection Program', ""Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche dell'Adulto""]",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate this variable distribution we propose a model for its clinical assessment. DESIGN AND METHODS: We introduce the model for tumor distribution (TD) assessment based on TTM scoring system, where TD value represents percentage of total tumor mass infiltrating peripheral blood and bone marrow (TD=TM(1)/TTM). TD in B-CLL can be categorized into 3 subgroups: pure leukemia if TD=100%, predominantly leukemia if TD=50-99% and predominantly lymphoma TD<50%. RESULTS: Among 341 B-CLL patients there were 22.6%, 55.1%, 22.3%, pure leukemia, predominantly leukemia and predominantly lymphoma cases, respectively. TD parameter was strongly associated in univariate analysis with TTM size, Rai and Binet stages, spleen size and beta(2) microglobulin. TD was associated with response to therapy and survival, with higher TD values translated into higher response rates and longer survival. However, in univariate and multivariate Cox analysis TD displayed much stronger relationship with prognosis in female patients, where it is the strongest independent predictor of survival along with age and Binet stage. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: TD, a quantitative and simple clinical parameter, easily assessed in all patients, offers a reliable tool for evaluation of tumor cell distribution in B-CLL. It has independent and strong prognostic power in females, as opposed to males, possibly unmasking important, yet unrecognized, biological difference in B-CLL patients.","['Jaksic, O', 'Vrhovac, R', 'Kusec, R', 'Kardum, M M', 'Pandzic-Jaksic, V', 'Kardum-Skelin, I', 'Planinc-Peraica, A', 'Morabito, F', 'Brugiatelli, M', 'Jaksic, B']","['Jaksic O', 'Vrhovac R', 'Kusec R', 'Kardum MM', 'Pandzic-Jaksic V', 'Kardum-Skelin I', 'Planinc-Peraica A', 'Morabito F', 'Brugiatelli M', 'Jaksic B']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Merkur University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia. bjaksic@mef.hr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/mortality/*pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Biological', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Sex Factors', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/08/28 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2001/08/28 10:00'],"['2001/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2001/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Aug;86(8):827-36.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study aims to evaluate the presence of emotional and behavioral symptoms in children with acute leukemia exposed to chemotherapy from outpatient services at two university hospitals in Brazil. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, emotional and behavioral symptoms were assessed using the Children Behavior Checklist (CBCL) in three groups of children aged 5-14 years: a) children with acute leukemia (n = 21); b) children with blood dyscrasias (n = 21); c) children evaluated or treated in a pediatric outpatient service (n = 33). RESULTS: Children with blood dyscrasias had significantly few symptoms of externalization (delinquent and aggressive behavior) than pediatric controls (p< 0.05). Children with leukemia did not differ from the two other groups regarding symptoms of externalization. No significant difference on the scores of the CBCL internalization dimension (anxiety, depression, somatic symptoms and withdrawn) was found among the three groups. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These findings seem to indicate that children with acute leukemia do not have more emotional or behavioral symptoms than children with benign hematologic or physical diseases suggesting that comorbidity with mental disorders is not higher in children with acute leukemia than in children in the other two groups.","['Michalowski, M', 'Ketzer, C', 'Daudt, L', 'Rohde, L A']","['Michalowski M', 'Ketzer C', 'Daudt L', 'Rohde LA']","['Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Affective Symptoms/diagnosis/etiology', 'Behavioral Symptoms/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chi-Square Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/*psychology', 'Male']",2001/08/28 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2001/08/28 10:00'],"['2001/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2001/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Aug;86(8):821-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate whether aggressive salvage chemotherapy (CHT) results in an actual survival advantage in elderly patients with relapsed AML, as well as to compare hospitalization and load of supportive treatment between patients receiving aggressive management or only palliation. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and fifty consecutive patients with relapsed AML (median age 66 years) were analyzed. At relapse, 99 (66%) were treated with CHT, and 51 had palliative management. RESULTS: Second complete remission (CR2) was achieved in 36/99 patients (36%) receiving CHT, while no CR was observed in the other group (p<0.001). Induction death rate was 22%, while 41% were resistant to CHT. The median survival from relapse was 4 months for the whole patient population; according to management, it was 5 months and 3 months for CHT and palliation, respectively (p=0.01). As to patients given CHT, a CR1 duration of more than 12 months was the only parameter significantly related to a better clinical outcome (survival from relapse: 8 vs. 4 months, p=0.002; CR2 duration: 11 vs. 5 months, p=0.001, respectively). Finally, patients managed with palliation required less hospitalization and less supportive therapy as compared to the CHT group.

A report of the Spanish group PETHEMA.,807-13,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To analyze in patients with de novo acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) treated with an ATRA plus anthracyclin-based protocol if the presence of additional cytogenetic aberrations to the t(15;17) influences: 1. clinical and biological presenting features; 2. disease outcome. DESIGN AND METHODS: One hundred and thirteen patients with newly diagnosed APL enrolled in the APL-96 protocol of the Spanish PETHEMA group were studied by conventional karyotyping, FISH and RT-PCR for the PML-RARa fusion. Treatment was homogeneous in all cases and consisted of anthracyclines and ATRA. RESULTS: Additional chromosome aberrations were observed in 30% of cases. The most frequent secondary changes were +8 (14 cases), and abnormalities of chromosomes 9 or 3 (4 patients each), and of chromosomes 1 and 8 (3 cases each). No clinical, biological, morphological, immunophenotypic or molecular differences were observed between the group of APLs with t(15;17) alone and the group of patients with additional changes. Patients with additional changes had a higher rates of complete remission (CR) and 4-year disease-free survival (DFS) (97%, and 97%, respectively) than patients with t(15;17) alone (CR, 70% and DFS, 84%) but these differences were not statistically significant. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: Patients with APL and additional cytogenetic abnormalities do not show different clinical, biological, morphological or molecular features as compared to patients with t(15;17) alone. The prognosis of patients with APL and t(15;17) alone and those with additional changes is similar in both groups. This study indicates that there is no rationale for administering more intensive treatment in APL patients with additional cytogenetic abnormalities receiving ATRA plus anthracycline-based chemotherapy.","['Hernandez, J M', 'Martin, G', 'Gutierrez, N C', 'Cervera, J', 'Ferro, M T', 'Calasanz, M J', 'Martinez-Climent, J A', 'Luno, E', 'Tormo, M', 'Rayon, C', 'Diaz-Mediavilla, J', 'Gonzalez, M', 'Gonzalez-San Miguel, J D', 'Perez-Equiza, K', 'Rivas, C', 'Esteve, J', 'Alvarez, M del C', 'Odriozola, J', 'Ribera, J M', 'Sanz, M A']","['Hernandez JM', 'Martin G', 'Gutierrez NC', 'Cervera J', 'Ferro MT', 'Calasanz MJ', 'Martinez-Climent JA', 'Luno E', 'Tormo M', 'Rayon C', 'Diaz-Mediavilla J', 'Gonzalez M', 'Gonzalez-San Miguel JD', 'Perez-Equiza K', 'Rivas C', 'Esteve J', 'Alvarez Mdel C', 'Odriozola J', 'Ribera JM', 'Sanz MA']","['Servicio de Hematologia, Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Paseo San Vicente 58-182, 37007 Salamanca, Spain. jmhernandezr@aehh.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",2001/08/28 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2001/08/28 10:00'],"['2001/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2001/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Aug;86(8):807-13.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,,,,,,"['PETHA Cooperative Group, Spain']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aberrant phenotypes have been correlated with clinical, morphological and prognostic features but their occurrence in AML differs in the various studies. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 35 cases of AML, examining them for aberrant phenotypes by multiparametric flow cytometry. Co-expression of lymphoid-associated markers in myeloblasts and asynchronous antigen expression were correlated with clinical features. RESULTS: Aberrant phenotypes were found in 88.6% of the cases studied. In this group, cross-lineage antigen expression was present in 34.3% and asynchronous expression in 82.4% of the cases. CD7 was the most frequent lymphoid-associated antigen. Among the cases of asynchronous antigen expression, the most frequent phenotype was CD117(+) and/or CD34(+) in association with CD11c(+), followed by CD15(+) and CD65(+), corresponding to 67.6%, 61.7 and 50.0% of the cases, respectively. Twenty out of 33 patients were available for complete remission assessment. The CD117(+) CD15(+) phenotype correlated significantly with complete remission achievement and with the lack of unfavorable chromosome associations. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that aberrant phenotypes, as they are described here, are present in the great majority of cases of AML, asynchronous antigen expression being the most frequent example; and that CD117(+) CD15(+) phenotype shows a relevant association with clinical prognosis.","['Bahia, D M', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Chauffaille, M de L', 'Kimura, E Y', 'Bordin, J O', 'Filgueiras, M A', 'Kerbauy, J']","['Bahia DM', 'Yamamoto M', 'Chauffaille Mde L', 'Kimura EY', 'Bordin JO', 'Filgueiras MA', 'Kerbauy J']","['Disciplina de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Sao Paulo, Brasil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",2001/08/28 10:00,2002/09/26 06:00,['2001/08/28 10:00'],"['2001/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/26 06:00 [medline]', '2001/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Haematologica. 2001 Aug;86(8):801-6.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Incubation of leukemia or lymphoma cells with neuraminidase and recombinant alpha 1,3-galactosyltransferase results in the synthesis of many alpha-gal epitopes (Gal alpha 1-3Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc-R) on their cell membranes. Vaccination with such processed tumor cells results in the binding of the natural anti-Gal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to these epitopes and opsonization of these cells for effective phagocytosis by APCs, such as dendritic cells and macrophages. These APCs may transport the vaccine to adjacent draining lymph nodes for subsequent effective processing and presentation of tumor-associated antigens (TAA) peptides to activate TAA-specific helper and cytotoxic T cells. Once the TAA-specific cytotoxic T cells are activated, they can leave the lymph node, circulate in the body, and seek metastatic cells expressing TAA to destroy them. Alternatively, activated helper T cells may provide the help required for B cells to produce antibodies to TAA on the leukemia or lymphoma cells. Because every patient receives his or her own TAA within the vaccinating cells, such vaccines are customized for the patient. These autologous tumor vaccines may be used as an adjuvant treatment that complements currently used treatment regimens by providing the immune system with an additional opportunity to be exposed effectively to autologous TAA.","['Galili, U', 'Chen, Z C', 'Manches, O', 'Plumas, J', 'Preisler, H']","['Galili U', 'Chen ZC', 'Manches O', 'Plumas J', 'Preisler H']","['Department of Cardiovascular-Thoracic Surgery, Rush University, Chicago, IL 60612, USA.

Alternative splicing leads to the expression of at least nine p73 C-terminal mRNA splice variants (alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, zeta, eta, eta1, theta). In this survey, we analyse the expression of p73 by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, its known C-terminal variants with an RT-PCR-Southern technique and by Western blot in samples of 51 patients with B-CLL, normal B lymphocytes from eight individuals, and five haematopoetic cell lines. p73alpha protein expression positively correlated with higher risk B-CLL stages (P = 0.046). Total p73 mRNA expression was higher (P = 0.01) and p73alpha protein more frequently detected (P = 0.008) in B-CLL compared with normal CD19+-B-lymphocytes. p73 C-terminal mRNA variants were expressed both in B-CLL and in normal B-lymphocytes, but their expression was biased since the gamma (P = 0.041), the theta (P < 0.001), and the eta variant (P = 0.033) prevailed in normal B-lymphocytes.

Interindividual sensitivity to anthracyclines is highly variable and cannot be predicted for the individual patient. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study. Medical charts and autopsy reports of patients treated for acute leukemia between 1990 and 1996 at the University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland were reviewed and searched for anthracycline-associated acute cardiotoxicity. Patients with pre-existing heart disease known to be associated with cardiotoxicity were excluded. RESULTS: Seven patients treated for leukemia with proven anthracycline-associated acute cardiotoxicity were included. In six patients the direct cause of death was acute cardiotoxicity due to the treatment. One patient recovered from cardiac failure but died a few months later from refractory leukemia. Clinical symptoms were those of a heart failure. Pathological findings were dilatative cardiac hypertrophy and pericardial effusion. Microscopically the typical findings of myocardial fibrosis and perinuclear vacuolisated myocytes were seen. CONCLUSIONS: The awareness of acute adverse effects on cardiac performance by anthracyclines faciliates early recognition and prevention of heart failure.

While the value and direction of the treatment/HER2 interaction may vary, depending on the agents, dose, or schedule of drug administration, there is little disagreement that HER2 testing is an important part of breast cancer evaluation. In 1998, trastuzumab (Herceptin) was approved for the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients by the Food and Drug Administration of the USA. Patients with abnormal HER2 in their breast cancer cells (generally 2 or 3+ with the HercepTest, overexpression by other immunohistochemical assays or amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] assay) have demonstrated the greatest response to trastuzumab treatment. It is unclear which test (method, reagent, cut-off points, etc.) is best to use to evaluate HER2 for this purpose because parallel testing of the same cancers from patients who received trastuzumab has only recently been initiated and the data are limited. It is widely believed that breast cancers without HER2 alterations will not be responsive to trastuzumab, although a clinical trial to test this specific hypothesis has not been initiated. There are also concerns that clonal heterogeneity for HER2 within a tumor, or between primary and metastatic cancer foci, may affect treatment response; yet we do not currently evaluate these parameters. Consensus regarding the best methods, reagents, or cut-off points to define HER2 status for determining trastuzumab responsivity has not yet been reached. HER2 testing for other prognostic or predictive purposes, e.g. to determine whether patients are likely to respond to other agents, such as dose-intensive doxorubicin, may be less. Data from the Cancer and Leukemia Group B trial 8541 (companion 8869) suggest that, with proper controls in high-volume laboratories, many of the available methods produce comparable results.","['Thor, A']",['Thor A'],"['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois, USA. a-thor@northwestern.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Breast Neoplasms/*chemistry/*diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Doxorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'National Institutes of Health (U.S.)', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Receptor, ErbB-2/*analysis', 'Tamoxifen/therapeutic use', 'Trastuzumab', 'United States', 'United States Food and Drug Administration']",2001/08/28 10:00,2002/01/31 10:01,['2001/08/28 10:00'],"['2001/08/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/annonc/12.suppl_1.s101 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)54450-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2001;12 Suppl 1:S101-7. doi: 10.1093/annonc/12.suppl_1.s101.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '094ZI81Y45 (Tamoxifen)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, ErbB-2)', 'P188ANX8CK (Trastuzumab)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, it is unclear whether Bax translocation is associated with Bax induction by DNA damaging agents. The induction of Bax in response to DNA damaging agents has been considered to be linked with p53. In this study, we used the p53 negative human chronic myeloid leukaemia K562 cell line. Bax up-regulation occurred at the whole cell level after DNA damage induced by etoposide. However, after incubation with etoposide, Bax failed to translocate to mitochondria and as a result, the apoptotic process was blocked. A Bax stable transfectant, the K/Bax cell line, expressed more Bax protein in the cytosol, mitochondria and nuclei. This Bax overexpression induced cytochrome c release, a reduction of cytochrome c oxidase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta(Psi)m). However, Bax-induced apoptosis was blocked downstream of mitochondria in K562 cells. The increased levels of mitochondrial Bax sensitized cells to etoposide-induced activation of caspases-2, -3 and -9 and apoptosis. However, after transient transfection with the Apaf-1 gene, K/Bax cells were sensitized to etoposide-induced caspase activation and apoptosis to a larger extent compared with Bax or Apaf-1 transfection alone. We therefore conclude that two mechanisms contribute to the resistance of K562 cells to etoposide-induced apoptosis; firstly failure of Bax targeting to mitochondria and, secondly, deficiency of Apaf-1. Uncoupling of Bax translocation from Bax induction can occur in response to etoposide-induced DNA damage.","['Jia, L', 'Patwari, Y', 'Srinivasula, S M', 'Newland, A C', 'Fernandes-Alnemri, T', 'Alnemri, E S', 'Kelsey, S M']","['Jia L', 'Patwari Y', 'Srinivasula SM', 'Newland AC', 'Fernandes-Alnemri T', 'Alnemri ES', 'Kelsey SM']","[""Department of Haematology, St. Bartholomew's and The Royal London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, E1 2AD, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1', 'Biological Transport', 'Caspases/physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Proteins/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein']",2001/08/25 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2001/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2001/05/09 00:00 [revised]', '2001/05/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204628 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Aug 9;20(35):4817-26. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204628.,"['0 (APAF1 protein, human)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Apoptotic Protease-Activating Factor 1)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We showed previously that human erythroleukemia K562 cells are resistant to antineoplastic drug (taxol)-induced apoptosis through the atypical protein kinase C iota isozyme (PKC iota), a kinase downstream of Bcr-Abl. The mechanism(s) by which PKC iota mediates cell survival to taxol is unknown. Here we demonstrate that PKC iota requires the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) to confer cell survival. At apoptosis-inducing concentrations, taxol weakly induces IkappaB(alpha) proteolysis and NF-kappaB translocation in K562 cells, but potently induces its transcriptional activity. Inhibition of NF-kappaB activity (by blocking IkappaB(alpha) degradation) significantly sensitizes cells to taxol-induced apoptosis. Likewise, K562 cells expressing antisense PKC iota mRNA or kinase dead PKC iota (PKC iota-KD) are sensitized to taxol; these cells are rescued from apoptosis by NF-kappaB overexpression. Expression of constitutively active PKC iota (PKC iota-CA) upregulates NF-kappaB transactivation and rescues cells from apoptosis in the absence of Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase activity. Using a chimeric GAL4-RelA transactivator, we find that taxol potently activates GAL4-RelA-dependent transcription. This activation was further upregulated by expression of PKC iota-CA and inhibited by expression of PKC iota-KD. Our results indicate that RelA transactivation is an important downstream target of the PKC iota-mediated Bcr-Abl signaling pathway and is required for resistance to taxol-induced apoptosis.","['Lu, Y', 'Jamieson, L', 'Brasier, A R', 'Fields, A P']","['Lu Y', 'Jamieson L', 'Brasier AR', 'Fields AP']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Medical Branch, 301 University Blvd., Galveston, Texas, TX 77555-1060, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Cell Survival', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/physiology', 'Humans', 'I-kappa B Kinase', '*I-kappa B Proteins', 'Isoenzymes/*physiology', 'K562 Cells', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha', 'NF-kappa B/*physiology', 'Paclitaxel/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*physiology', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/physiology', 'Transcription Factor RelA', '*Transcriptional Activation']",2001/08/25 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2000/12/22 00:00 [received]', '2001/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2001/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204607 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Aug 9;20(35):4777-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204607.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (I-kappa B Proteins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (NFKBIA protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factor RelA)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (CHUK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (I-kappa B Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKB protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.10 (IKBKE protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (protein kinase C lambda)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",,"['AI40218/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56869/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES06676/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the typical promyelocytic AMLs, 34% were reclassified as early pre-B lympho-myeloid leukemias (L-ML) based on leukemic blood cell morphology, immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene re-arrangements (IgH(R)), or expression of both lymphoid (Vpre-B1 and Rag1) and myeloid (myeloperoxidase and lysozyme M) genes. Allelic loss on chromosome 4 was frequently detected in AMLs (53%) and L-MLs (more than 95%), and the preferential loss of the maternally transmitted allele suggests the locus may be imprinted. A minimally deleted region (MDR) maps to a 3.4-cM interval, which is frequently deleted in radiation-induced thymic lymphomas (TLSR5) and contains a recessive, maternally transmitted genetic locus (Lyr2) that confers resistance to spontaneous and radiation-induced pre-B and T cell lymphomas, suggesting they are one and the same. Thus, the Lyr2/TLSR5 locus is frequently implicated in myeloid, lymphoid (B and T), and mixed-lineage mouse leukemias and lymphomas. Epigenetic inactivation of one Lyr2/TLSR5 allele during normal mouse development suggests that only a single hit is required for its inactivation during leukemogenesis, and this may be a significant contributing factor to the efficiency of the leukemogenic process in the mouse.","['Cleary, H', 'Boulton, E', 'Plumb, M']","['Cleary H', 'Boulton E', 'Plumb M']","['MRC Radiation and Genome Stability Unit, Chilton, Didcot, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Alleles', 'Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genomic Imprinting', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/etiology/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/classification/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/etiology/genetics/pathology', '*Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Lymphoma/etiology/genetics', 'Mice/*genetics', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/etiology/genetics']",2001/08/25 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.5.1549 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)61429-X [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 1;98(5):1549-54. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.5.1549.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar to what occurs in normal immature thymocytes, prevention of spontaneous apoptosis by IL-7 in precursor T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells correlates with up-regulation of bcl-2. IL-7 is also implicated in leukemogenesis because IL-7 transgenic mice develop lymphoid malignancies, suggesting that IL-7 may regulate the generation and expansion of malignant cells. This study shows that in the presence of IL-7, T-ALL cells not only up-regulated bcl-2 expression and escaped apoptosis but also progressed in the cell cycle, resulting in sequential induction of cyclin D2 and cyclin A. Down-regulation of p27kip1 was mandatory for IL-7-mediated cell cycle progression and temporally coincided with activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk)4 and cdk2 and hyperphosphorylation of Rb. Strikingly, forced expression of p27kip1 in T-ALL cells not only prevented cell cycle progression but also reversed IL-7-mediated up-regulation of bcl-2 and promotion of viability. These results show for the first time that a causative link between IL-7-mediated proliferation and p27kip1 down-regulation exists in malignant T cells. Moreover, these results suggest that p27kip1 may function as a tumor suppressor gene not only because it is a negative regulator of cell cycle progression but also because it is associated with induction of apoptosis of primary malignant cells.","['Barata, J T', 'Cardoso, A A', 'Nadler, L M', 'Boussiotis, V A']","['Barata JT', 'Cardoso AA', 'Nadler LM', 'Boussiotis VA']","['Department of Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Cyclins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Genes, Tumor Suppressor', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-7/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sirolimus/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/08/25 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.5.1524 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)61426-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 1;98(5):1524-31. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.5.1524.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cyclins)', '0 (Interleukin-7)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'W36ZG6FT64 (Sirolimus)']",,"['AI 41584/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI 43552/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 68484/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 54785/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Substitution of valine for aspartic acid 816 (D816V) constitutively actives human c-Kit, and this mutation is found in patients with mastocytosis, leukemia, and germ cell tumors. Immortalized murine progenitor cells (MIHCs) transduced with wild-type c-Kit proliferate in response to SCF, whereas cells expressing D816V c-Kit (MIHC-D816V) are factor-independent and tumorigenic. However, the mechanisms mediating transformation by D816V c-Kit are unknown. The objective of this study was to identify signaling components that contribute to D816V c-Kit-mediated transformation. SCF stimulates association of p85PI3K with phosphorylated tyrosine 721 of wild-type c-Kit. Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K) subsequently contributes to the activation of Akt and Jnks. In contrast, these studies demonstrated that the D816V c-Kit mutant was constitutively associated with phosphorylated p85PI3K, and, downstream of PI3K, Jnk 1 and Jnk 2 were activated but Akt was not. Interestingly, Erks 1 and 2 were not constitutively activated by D816V c-Kit. Thus, D816V c-Kit maintains the activity of PI3K but not of all signaling pathways activated by wild-type c-Kit. Further, all pathways downstream of PI3K are not constitutively active in MIHC-D816V cells. Studies with a PI3K inhibitor and D816V/Y721F c-Kit, a mutant incapable of recruiting PI3K, indicate that constitutive activation of PI3K through direct recruitment by D816V c-Kit plays a role in factor-independent growth of MIHC and is critical for tumorigenicity.","['Chian, R', 'Young, S', 'Danilkovitch-Miagkova, A', 'Ronnstrand, L', 'Leonard, E', 'Ferrao, P', 'Ashman, L', 'Linnekin, D']","['Chian R', 'Young S', 'Danilkovitch-Miagkova A', 'Ronnstrand L', 'Leonard E', 'Ferrao P', 'Ashman L', 'Linnekin D']","['Basic Research Laboratory and the Laboratory of Immunobiology, Division of Basic Sciences, National Cancer Institute-Frederick, MD 21702, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/genetics', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Mutation, Missense', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/chemistry/*physiology', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein Subunits', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cell Factor/physiology', 'Transfection']",2001/08/25 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.5.1365 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)61407-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 1;98(5):1365-73. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.5.1365.,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Subunits)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Stem Cell Factor)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.1.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 9)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rituximab has significant activity in follicular non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Much less is known about the effects in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have initiated a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rituximab in patients with CD20+ pretreated CLL. To avoid the rituximab-associated toxicity, we restricted the tumor cell load, as measured by the number of circulating lymphocytes and the spleen size, in the first 2 cohorts of patients included in the study. Patients received 4 intravenous infusions of 375 mg/m2 once a week over a period of 1 month. Of the 28 patients evaluable for response, 7 patients showed a partial remission (National Cancer Institute criteria) lasting for a median of 20 weeks, with 1 patient still in remission after 71 weeks. Based on lymphocyte counts only, we found at least a 50% reduction of lymphocyte counts lasting for at least 4 weeks in 13 (45%) of 29 patients. Fifteen patients from 3 institutions were monitored for the immunophenotype profile of lymphocyte subsets. The number of CD5+CD20+ cells decreased significantly and remained low until day 28 after therapy. T-cell counts were not affected.

In younger patients, treatment stratification is frequently based upon diagnostic karyotype, which was the most important prognostic factor in the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) AML10 trial. Considered here is whether karyotype is also predictive in older adults; this is done by studying 1065 cases from MRC AML11 (median age, 66 years). Three prognostic groups were distinguished on the basis of response to induction therapy and overall survival (OS). Those with t(15;17), t(8;21), or inv(16) composed the favorable risk group. Overall, these abnormalities predicted a superior complete remission (CR) rate (72%), reflecting relatively low levels of resistant disease (RD) (8%), and lower relapse risk (RR) (56%) associated with superior OS (34% at 5 years). Normal karyotype (CR, 63%; RD, 17%; RR, 78%; OS, 15%) and other noncomplex abnormalities (CR, 53%; RD, 32%; RR, 85%; OS, 10%) composed the intermediate group; while complex karyotype predicted an extremely poor prognosis (CR, 26%; RD, 56%; RR, 91%; OS, 2%). Combining MRC AML10 and AML11 (n = 2677) revealed that the most favorable changes were rarer in older patients (younger than 55 years, 24%; 55 years or older, 7%), while complex abnormalities were more common (6% vs 13%). This study suggests that hierarchical cytogenetic classification identifies biologically distinct subsets of AML that are represented in all age groups. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of karyotype as a critical independent determinant of outcome in older patients with AML, providing a potential framework for stratified treatment approaches.","['Grimwade, D', 'Walker, H', 'Harrison, G', 'Oliver, F', 'Chatters, S', 'Harrison, C J', 'Wheatley, K', 'Burnett, A K', 'Goldstone, A H']","['Grimwade D', 'Walker H', 'Harrison G', 'Oliver F', 'Chatters S', 'Harrison CJ', 'Wheatley K', 'Burnett AK', 'Goldstone AH']","['Department of Haematology, University College London Hospitals and Medical School, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Lenograstim', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*classification/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",2001/08/25 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1182/blood.v98.5.1312 [doi]', 'S0006-4971(20)61399-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood. 2001 Sep 1;98(5):1312-20. doi: 10.1182/blood.v98.5.1312.,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'COAP protocol', 'DAT protocol 1', 'DAV regimen']",,,,,,,,,,['Medical Research Council Adult Leukemia Working Party'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the potential role of conventional chemotherapy, high dose chemotherapy with autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation remains to be defined. Important progress was achieved in the treatment of ATL with the combination of zidovudine (AZT) and interferon-alpha (IFN) which produces a high response rate in ATL patients with minimal side effects. This treatment seems to prolong the survival of patients much more than intensive chemotherapy. The success of this potentially anti-retroviral approach in the treatment of ATL suggests the existence of continuous HTLV-I replication in vivo. These encouraging results may be improved by the use of higher doses of AZT and IFN combined with other anti-retroviral agents. However, since cure seems still elusive, new therapeutic approaches or new combinations are required. For example, biological mediators such as retinoid acid, which induces apoptosis of ATL cells in vitro, may reduce drug resistance and stimulates immunity to restore anti-tumour activity against ATL cells. Alternatively, immunotherapy with anti-interleukin-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies or injection of cytotoxic T-cells directed against virus antigens could be interesting approaches which may merit further investigations in the near future. Finally, the recent demonstration that the combination of arsenic trioxide (As) and IFN induces a specific degradation of the viral transactivator Tax followed by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of HTLV-I positive cells may constitute a valuable addition to ATL treatment.","['Bazarbachi, A', 'Hermine, O']","['Bazarbachi A', 'Hermine O']","['Department of Internal Medicine, American University of Beirut, PO Box 113, 6044, Beirut, Lebanon. bazarbac@aub.edu.lb']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Antiviral Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Oxides/therapeutic use', 'Retinoids/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*drug therapy', 'Zidovudine/therapeutic use']",2001/08/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0168170201002866 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00286-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2001 Oct 30;78(1-2):79-92. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00286-6.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Retinoids)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",79,,,,,,['Virus Res. 2001 Oct 30;78(1-2):1-4.

The smallest sequence necessary and sufficient for dimer formation, in vitro, was ascertained to be a 37 nucleotide (nt) region downstream of the splice donor and just upstream of the primer binding site. Deletion of a 32 base-pair sequence encompassing this region within the provirus was associated with a minor decrease in infectivity of the virus in an in vitro system. To further map and help elucidate the nature of the dimer linkage, we used RNA and DNA oligonucleotide competition assays to define the nucleotides involved. These experiments revealed that a 14 nt sequence containing a potential stem loop structure, formed from a palindromic sequence, is important for dimer formation. This was confirmed by the ability of this RNA sequence to form heterodimers with larger RNA transcripts from the same region, while sequences lacking this motif could not. RNA transcripts containing the reverse sequence, the same nucleotides in a random arrangement, and complementary DNA oligos, all failed to form heterodimers with the 14 nt sequence. The primary dimer initiation site of HTLV-1 has thus been located to a 14 nt palindrome containing sequence, and dimerisation is shown to be dependent on specific sense-sense RNA interactions.","['Monie, T', 'Greatorex, J', 'Lever, A M']","['Monie T', 'Greatorex J', 'Lever AM']","[""Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, Level 5, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Hills Road, CB2 2QQ, Cambridge, UK.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,"['Computer Simulation', 'Dimerization', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*chemistry/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Models, Molecular', 'Nucleic Acid Conformation', 'Oligonucleotides/*chemistry', 'RNA, Viral/*chemistry']",2001/08/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0168170201002830 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00283-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2001 Oct 30;78(1-2):45-56. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00283-0.,"['0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The gp46 surface glycoprotein binds to an as yet unidentified cell surface receptor, thereby, allowing the gp21 transmembrane glycoprotein to initiate fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. In the absence of membrane fusion viral penetration and entry into the host cell cannot occur. The envelope glycoproteins are also a major target for neutralising antibodies and cytotoxic T lymphocytes following a protective immune response, and represent ideal constituents for a recombinant HTLV-1 vaccine. Given the importance of the envelope proteins in HTLV-1 pathogenesis there is increasing interest in obtaining sufficient quantities of these proteins for biochemical, biophysical and biological analyses. We have now developed a system for production of large amounts of a glycosylated and functional form of soluble recombinant gp46 (sRgp46), and have used this recombinant material for analysis of envelope function and receptor binding activity. We find that, the sRgp46 molecules expressed in our system are immunologically indistinguishable from the native virally expressed surface glycoproteins; that sRgp46 binds to T-cells in a dose dependent and saturable manner; and that cell surface binding by sRgp46 can be inhibited by neutralising antibodies. Importantly, we demonstrate that these sRgp46 molecules potently inhibit syncytia formation and viral infection of target cells, and that regions outwith the SU domain of envelope are not required for binding to target cells or for inhibiting membrane fusion. The sRgp46 produced in our study will provide new opportunities to investigate envelope-receptor interactions, and will be of utility in defining the conformationally sensitive antigenic determinants of the HTLV-1 surface glycoprotein.","['Jassal, S R', 'Lairmore, M D', 'Leigh-Brown, A J', 'Brighty, D W']","['Jassal SR', 'Lairmore MD', 'Leigh-Brown AJ', 'Brighty DW']","['Biomedical Research Centre, Level 5, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, The University, Scotland DD1 9SY, Dundee, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Virus Res,Virus research,8410979,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drosophila', 'Gene Products, env/*pharmacology', 'Giant Cells/*drug effects/virology', 'HTLV-I Antigens/biosynthesis/*pharmacology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*virology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/pathogenicity/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Neutralization Tests', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, Virus/metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",2001/08/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0168170201002799 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00279-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Virus Res. 2001 Oct 30;78(1-2):17-34. doi: 10.1016/s0168-1702(01)00279-9.,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (HTLV-I Antigens)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",,['RR14324/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These tethered platinum complexes, including hydroxy-tethered, phosphoramidite-tethered, and monodeoxyribonucleotide-tethered platinum(II) and -(IV) complexes, have been examined in vitro for antitumor activity in both leukemia and ovarian cancer cell lines. Activity of some of these complexes was similar to cis-platin, and most of them showed much better potency than carboplatin. We observed an interesting structure-activity correlation for platinum(II) complexes for both PA-1 and SK-OV-3 ovarian cancer cell lines. However, platinum(IV) complexes showed much more diversified response among cancer cell lines studied. We observed enhanced selectivity among different cancer cell lines for some agents. The most promising is the monodeoxyribonucleotide-tethered platinum(IV) complex, which is the first analogue of the conjugates between a platinum fragment and monodeoxyribonucleotides, showing antitumor activity and selectivity among the cell lines.

We have recently shown that cytokines which instruct cell division and differentiation within the hematopoeitic system may provide similar functions in the central nervous system. We have shown that mitotic progenitor cells can be isolated from embryonic rat mesencephalon and that these cells respond to a combination of interleukin-1, interleukin-11, leukemia inhibitory factor, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor yielding a tyrosine hydroxylase-immunoreactive (THir) phenotype in 20-25% of total cells. In the present study, 24 clonal cell lines derived from single cells of mesencephalic proliferation spheres were examined for their response to the cytokine mixture. The clone yielding the highest percentage of THir neurons (98%) was selected for further study. This clone expressed several phenotypic characteristics of DA neurons and expression of Nurr1. The response to cytokines was stable for several passages and after cryopreservation for several months. When grafted into the striatum of DA-depleted rats, these cells attenuated rotational asymmetry to the same extent as freshly harvested embryonic DA neurons. These data demonstrate that mesencephalic progenitor cells can be clonally expanded in culture and differentiated in the presence of hematopoietic cytokines to yield enriched populations of DA neurons.

Here we demonstrate that treatment of promonocytic U937 cells with arsenic trioxide leads to G2/M arrest which was associated with a dramatic increase in the levels of cyclin B and cyclin B-dependent kinase and apoptosis. We further show that apoptosis occurs after bcl-2 phosphorylation and caspase-3 activation followed by cleavage of PARP and PLC-gamma1 degradation and DNA fragmentation. The arsenic trioxide-induced apoptosis could be blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. In addition, pretreatment of U937 cells with the DNA polymerase inhibitor aphidicolin also blocked apoptosis, but did not cause the arrest of cells in the G2/M phase. The findings suggest that arsenic trioxide exerts its growth-inhibitory effects by modulating expression and/or activity of several key G2/M regulatory proteins. Furthermore, arsenic trioxide-mediated G2/M arrest correlates with the onset of apoptosis.","['Park, J W', 'Choi, Y J', 'Jang, M A', 'Baek, S H', 'Lim, J H', 'Passaniti, T', 'Kwon, T K']","['Park JW', 'Choi YJ', 'Jang MA', 'Baek SH', 'Lim JH', 'Passaniti T', 'Kwon TK']","['Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Taegu, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'G2 Phase', 'Growth Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Mitosis', 'Monocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Myeloid Progenitor Cells/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Synthesis Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*metabolism', 'U937 Cells']",2001/08/25 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2001.5416 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)95416-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Aug 31;286(4):726-34. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.5416.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (Protein Synthesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He named the new syndrome infantile genetic agranulocytosis. Today it is known as Kostmann's syndrome or severe congenital neutropenia. In 1975 an additional 10 cases from northern Sweden were published. This article reports on the only long-term survivor from the 1975 report plus another five patients born after 1975 who belong to the original ""Kostmann family"". Treatment and survival have changed dramatically since Kostmann's first publication. In the pre-antibiotic era, Kostmann's syndrome was inevitably fatal during the first year of life. CONCLUSION: Since the introduction of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) about 10 y ago, most patients now enjoy a normal life span and a greatly improved quality of life. Although the threat of death has disappeared, patients still have problems with infections, especially chronic gingivitis and periodontitis. In other groups of severe neutropenia, not related to the original ""Kostmann family"", an increased incidence of myeloid leukaemia has been observed. However, in this small cohort none of the children on chronic G-CSF therapy have developed malignancies.","['Carlsson, G', 'Fasth, A']","['Carlsson G', 'Fasth A']","['Department of Pediatrics, Sunderby Hospital, Lulea, Sweden. goran048@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Norway,Acta Paediatr,"Acta paediatrica (Oslo, Norway : 1992)",9205968,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agranulocytosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Quality of Life', 'Sweden', 'Syndrome']",2001/08/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Paediatr. 2001 Jul;90(7):757-64.,['143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)'],15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: This ecologic study was based on incidence rates of leukemia in children aged 0-14 years. The Ontario Cancer Registry was used to identify the residence of 1394 leukemia cases between 1978 and 1992. Ecologic units were composed of census subdivisions in a 5-year period. Percent population change, determined from the Census of Canada, was employed as a measure of population mixing. The relationship between population mixing and childhood leukemia was examined separately after stratifying by the level of geographic isolation, defined according to urban-rural status. Analyses were also conducted separately in specific age groups and for the ALL subtype. RESULTS: Population growth in rural areas was associated with an increased incidence of leukemia, particularly for the ALL subtype in children aged 0-4 years (rate ratio = 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1-2.8, for a greater than 20% population change relative to no increase in population). In contrast, an elevated risk due to population mixing was not observed in urban areas. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this study are consistent with results from similar studies conducted in the United Kingdom, which are suggestive of a role for an infectious agent in the etiology of childhood leukemia, as proposed in the Kinlen hypothesis.","['Koushik, A', 'King, W D', 'McLaughlin, J R']","['Koushik A', 'King WD', 'McLaughlin JR']","[""Department of Community Health and Epidemiology, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Distribution', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Confidence Intervals', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Population Dynamics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*epidemiology', 'Rural Population/*statistics & numerical data', 'Urban Population/statistics & numerical data']",2001/08/25 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/25 10:00'],"['2001/08/25 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/25 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1023/a:1011266413087 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 2001 Aug;12(6):483-90. doi: 10.1023/a:1011266413087.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relative impact of these mechanisms in the same tumor cell, however, has not been assessed yet. We have analyzed the interaction of the human erythroleukemia tumor cell line K562 with human complement. K562 cells express the membrane complement regulatory proteins CD59, CD55 and CD46. As shown here for the first time, K562 also spontaneously release the soluble regulators C1 inhibitor, factor H, and soluble CD59. Complement resistance of K562 cells is augmented upon treatment with PMA, TNF or even with sublytic complement. Unlike TNF and sublytic complement, PMA enhanced the expression of membrane-bound CD55 and CD59 and led to increased secretion of soluble CD59. In addition, we show that complement-resistant K562 cells express a membrane-associated proteolytic activity, higher than the complement-sensitive K562/S cells. Treatment of complement-resistant K562 cells with serine protease inhibitors enhance their sensitivity to complement-mediated lysis. Inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) also sensitize K562 cells to complement lysis, implicating PKC-mediated signaling in cell resistance to complement. Neutralization of the CD55 and CD59 but not of CD46 regulatory activity with specific antibodies significantly increases complement-mediated K562 cell lysis. Treatment of K562 cells with a mixture of inhibitory reagents results in a significant additive enhancing effect on complement-mediated lysis of K562. In conclusion, K562 cells resist a complement attack by concomitantly using multiple molecular evasion strategies. Future attempts in antibody-based tumor therapy should include strategies to interfere with those resistance mechanisms.","['Jurianz, K', 'Ziegler, S', 'Donin, N', 'Reiter, Y', 'Fishelson, Z', 'Kirschfink, M']","['Jurianz K', 'Ziegler S', 'Donin N', 'Reiter Y', 'Fishelson Z', 'Kirschfink M']","['Institute of Immunology, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'CD55 Antigens/immunology', 'CD59 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Complement Activation', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Erythrocytes/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', 'Membrane Cofactor Protein', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Naphthalenes/pharmacology', 'Neutrophils/metabolism', 'Plant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trypsin Inhibitors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology', 'alpha-Amylases/antagonists & inhibitors']",2001/08/24 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/24 10:00'],"['2001/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/ijc.1406 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.1406 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Sep;93(6):848-54. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1406.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD46 protein, human)', '0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Membrane Cofactor Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Naphthalenes)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Trypsin Inhibitors)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.2.1.1 (alpha-Amylases)', 'I271P23G24 (calphostin C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As variant VDR gene transcripts indicated possible N-terminally extended receptors, we investigated their natural occurrence, transactivation capacity, and subcellular localization. A novel 54-kDa VDRB1 protein, in addition to the previously recognized 48-kDa VDRA form, was detected in human kidney tissue as well as in osteoblastic (MG63), intestinal (Int-407, DLD-1, and COLO 206F), and kidney epithelial (786) human cell lines by Western blots using isoform-specific and nonselective anti-VDR antibodies. VDRB1 was present at approximately one-third the level of VDRA. Isoform-specific VDRB1 expression constructs produced lower ligand-dependent transactivation than VDRA when transiently transfected with a vitamin D-responsive promoter into cell lines with low endogenous VDR. Intracellular localization patterns of the green fluorescent protein-tagged VDR isoforms differed. VDRB1 appeared as discrete intranuclear foci in the absence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, whereas VDRA produced diffuse nuclear fluorescence. After 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment, both VDR isoforms exhibited similar diffuse nuclear signal. In the absence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, the VDRB1 foci partially colocalized with SC-35 speckles and a subset of promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies. These data provide the first evidence of VDRB1, a novel N-terminally variant human VDR that is expressed at a level comparable to VDRA in human tissue and cell lines. It is characterized by reduced transactivation activity and a ligand-responsive speckled intranuclear localization. The intranuclear compartmentalization and altered functional activity of VDRB1 may mediate a specialized physiological role for this receptor isoform.","['Sunn, K L', 'Cock, T A', 'Crofts, L A', 'Eisman, J A', 'Gardiner, E M']","['Sunn KL', 'Cock TA', 'Crofts LA', 'Eisman JA', 'Gardiner EM']","['Bone and Mineral Research Program, Garvan Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, New South Wales, 2010 Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Endocrinol,"Molecular endocrinology (Baltimore, Md.)",8801431,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Humans', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Ribonucleoproteins', 'Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/08/24 10:00,2002/01/15 10:01,['2001/08/24 10:00'],"['2001/08/24 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/15 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/24 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1210/mend.15.9.0693 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Endocrinol. 2001 Sep;15(9):1599-609. doi: 10.1210/mend.15.9.0693.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '136882-81-0 (p80-coilin)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147153-65-9 (SRSF2 protein, human)', '170974-22-8 (Serine-Arginine Splicing Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because integration is essentially random, this phenomenon can be exploited for random mutagenesis of the genome, and analysis of integration sites in tumors may identify potential oncogenes. Here we have investigated this strategy in the context of astrocytoma progression. Neuroectodermal explants from astrocytoma-prone GFAP-v-src transgenic mice were infected with the ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus (Mo-MuLV). In situ hybridization and FACS analysis indicated that astrocytes from E12.5-13.5 embryos were highly susceptible to retroviral infection and expressed viral RNA and proteins both in vitro and in vivo. In average 80% of neuroectodermal cells were infected in vitro with 9-14 proviral integrations per cell. Virus mobility assays confirmed that Mo-MuLV remained transcriptionally active and replicating in neuroectodermal primary cultures even after 45 days of cultivation. Proviral insertion sites were investigated by inverse long-range PCR. Analysis of a limited number of provirus flanking sequences in clones originated from in vitro infected GFAP-v-src neuroectodermal cells identified loci of possible relevance to tumorigenesis. Therefore, the approach described here might be suitable for acceleration of tumorigenesis in preneoplastic astrocytes. We expect this method to be useful for identifying genes involved in astrocytoma development/progression in animal models.","['Afanasieva, T A', 'Pekarik, V', ""Grazia D'Angelo, M"", 'Klein, M A', 'Voigtlander, T', 'Stocking, C', 'Aguzzi, A']","['Afanasieva TA', 'Pekarik V', ""Grazia D'Angelo M"", 'Klein MA', 'Voigtlander T', 'Stocking C', 'Aguzzi A']","['Institute of Neuropathology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"[""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Technical Report']",United States,J Neurovirol,Journal of neurovirology,9508123,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/*cytology/virology', '*Astrocytoma', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', '*Brain Neoplasms', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Genes, src', 'Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/genetics', 'In Situ Hybridization', '*Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*methods', 'Virus Integration']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13550280152058834 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurovirol. 2001 Apr;7(2):169-81. doi: 10.1080/13550280152058834.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The LCR contains multiple binding sites for transactivators, including Maf-recognition elements (MAREs). However, little is known about the specific proteins that bind to these sites or the time at which they bind during erythroid differentiation. We have performed chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to determine the recruitment of the erythroid-specific transactivator p45 NF-E2/MafK (p18 NF-E2) heterodimer and small Maf proteins to various regions in the globin gene locus before and after the induction of murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cell differentiation. We report that, before induction, the LCR is occupied by small Maf proteins, and, on erythroid maturation, the NF-E2 complex is recruited to the LCR and the active globin promoters, even though the promoters do not contain MAREs. This differentiation-coupled recruitment of NF-E2 complex correlates with a greater than 100-fold increase in beta-major globin transcription, but is not associated with a significant change in locus-wide histone H3 acetylation. These findings suggest that the beta-globin gene locus exists in a constitutively open chromatin conformation before terminal differentiation, and we speculate that recruitment of NF-E2 complex to the LCR and active promoters may be a rate-limiting step in the activation of beta-globin gene expression.","['Sawado, T', 'Igarashi, K', 'Groudine, M']","['Sawado T', 'Igarashi K', 'Groudine M']","['Division of Basic Sciences, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA 98109, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Bacterial Proteins/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Locus Control Region', 'MafK Transcription Factor', 'Mice', 'Models, Biological', 'Multigene Family', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor', 'NF-E2 Transcription Factor, p45 Subunit', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1073/pnas.181344198 [doi]', '181344198 [pii]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001 Aug 28;98(18):10226-31. doi: 10.1073/pnas.181344198.

It arises spontaneously or as a result of exposure to aneugenic agents through non-disjunction. Two spindle poisons, colchicine (COL) and vinblastine (VBL) are mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma assay (MLA), a gene mutation assay that targets the heterozygous thymidine kinase (tk) gene on chromosome 11 in mouse lymphoma L5178Y tk+/- 3.7.2c cells. To investigate the mechanisms of spindle poison mutagenesis, we analyzed the COL- and VBL-induced TK mutants at the molecular and cytogenetic level. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis employing a microsatellite region within the tk locus revealed that almost all mutants had lost the functional tk allele. To determine the extent of the LOH, we further examined LOH mutants for heterozygosity at nine microsatellite loci spanning the entire chromosome 11. Interestingly, every microsatellite marker showed LOH in all COL- and VBL-induced LOH mutants, suggesting that these mutants were generated by loss of the whole chromosome 11 through mitotic non-disjunction. Chromosome painting analysis supported this hypothesis; there were no mutants showing structural changes such as deletions or translocations involving chromosome 11. In contrast, spontaneous TK mutants followed from point mutations, deletions and recombinational events as well as whole chromosome loss. Our present study indicates that spindle poisons induce mutations through mitotic non-disjunction without structural DNA changes and supports a possible mechanism in which a recessive mutation mediated by aneuploidy may develop tumors.","['Honma, M', 'Momose, M', 'Sakamoto, H', 'Sofuni, T', 'Hayashi, M']","['Honma M', 'Momose M', 'Sakamoto H', 'Sofuni T', 'Hayashi M']","['Division of Genetics and Mutagenesis, National Institute of Health Sciences, 1-18-1 Kamiyoga, Setagaya-ku, Tokyo 158-8501, Japan. honma@nihs.go.jp']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,IM,"['Alleles', 'Aneuploidy', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromosome Painting', 'Colchicine/*toxicity', 'DNA Primers/genetics', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Mutagens/*toxicity', 'Spindle Apparatus/drug effects', 'Thymidine Kinase/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*toxicity']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']","['S138357180100167X [pii]', '10.1016/s1383-5718(01)00167-x [doi]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 2001 Jun 27;493(1-2):101-14. doi: 10.1016/s1383-5718(01)00167-x.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (Mutagens)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of the present study was to establish an interphase-FISH assay for the detection of all diverse BCL6 translocations in B-NHL. Two different approaches were tested, one using a PAC-clone spanning the major breakpoint region (MBR) of BCL6 (span-assay), and another using two BAC clones flanking the MBR (flank-assay). Interphase FISH with the span-assay detected the various BCL6 translocations in seven B-NHL cell lines. The dual-color flank-assay was evaluated in two laboratories independently: in normal controls, the cutoff level for false-positive signals was 2.6%, whereas the cutoff level for false-negatives in the seven cell lines was 7.5%. To test the feasibility of the FISH strategies, 30 samples from patients with B-NHL with cytogenetic abnormalities of 3q27 were evaluated with both assays. In 21 cases, the span-assay indicated a BCL6 rearrangement. In 18 of the 21 cases, the dual-color flank-assay confirmed the translocation including 12 different partner chromosomal loci. The three false-positive cases detected with the span-assay showed trisomy of chromosome 3 by cytogenetic analyses, and they were correctly classified as non-rearranged with the flank-assay. In summary, our FISH strategy using two differently labeled flanking BCL6 BAC probes provides a robust, sensitive, and reproducible method for the detection of common and uncommon abnormalities of BCL6 gene in interphase nuclei. The routine application of this assay to patients with B-NHL will allow the assessment of the diagnostic and prognostic significance of BCL6 rearrangements.","['Sanchez-Izquierdo, D', 'Siebert, R', 'Harder, L', 'Marugan, I', 'Gozzetti, A', 'Price, H P', 'Gesk, S', 'Hernandez-Rivas, J M', 'Benet, I', 'Sole, F', 'Sonoki, T', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Schlegelberger, B', 'Dyer, M J', 'Garcia-Conde, J', 'Martinez-Climent, J A']","['Sanchez-Izquierdo D', 'Siebert R', 'Harder L', 'Marugan I', 'Gozzetti A', 'Price HP', 'Gesk S', 'Hernandez-Rivas JM', 'Benet I', 'Sole F', 'Sonoki T', 'Le Beau MM', 'Schlegelberger B', 'Dyer MJ', 'Garcia-Conde J', 'Martinez-Climent JA']","['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinico, University of Valencia, Spain.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Chromosome Banding', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 3', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Translocation, Genetic']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402207 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1475-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402207.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The average time spent in these health states (TOX, CT, TWiST and REL, respectively) were then weighted by utility coefficients reflecting relative QoL value according to that of TWiST and summed up giving the so-called Q-TWiST. No difference was found between randomized groups in terms of mean CT. Mean TOX in the two groups were similarly close except when considering alopecia as a relevant toxic event. By contrast, mean TWiST was 5.9 months longer in the FAMP group than in the CAP group (P = 0.006). Unsurprisingly, given the absence of difference in OS but the difference in EFS in favor of the FAMP group, mean REL was increased by 6.8 months in the CAP group (P = 0.047). As a result, benefit of FAMP in terms of average Q-TWiST only relied on the value of the utility coefficient attributed to REL (U(REL)), with a significant benefit when UREL ranged from 0 to 0.28, ie in patients undergoing poor QoL after relapse, which is likely.","['Levy, V', 'Porcher, R', 'Leblond, V', 'Fermand, J P', 'Cazin, B', 'Maloisel, F', 'Harousseau, J L', 'Remenieras, L', 'Guibon, O', 'Chevret, S']","['Levy V', 'Porcher R', 'Leblond V', 'Fermand JP', 'Cazin B', 'Maloisel F', 'Harousseau JL', 'Remenieras L', 'Guibon O', 'Chevret S']","['Departement de Biostatistique et Informatique Medicale, Hjpital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Doxorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Health Status Indicators', 'Humans', 'Prednisone/*therapeutic use', '*Quality of Life', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/*therapeutic use', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*drug therapy']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402221 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1466-70. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402221.,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'P2K93U8740 (fludarabine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'ACP protocol']",,,,,,,,,,['French Cooperative Group on CLL and Macroglobulinemia'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this work was to compare the immunophenotype and the morphology of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma, to help in the differential diagnosis of CD5 positive monoclonal B cells. Frozen/thawed samples from 91 patients were analysed retrospectively. Fresh samples from 17 mixed/atypical CLL and 13 MCL were tested to corroborate the results. Markers were analysed as percentage (%) of positive B lymphocyte subpopulation, and in terms of median fluorescence intensity (MFI). Matutes's CLL score clearly allowed distinguishing between classical CLL on the one hand, and atypical CLL and MCL on the other hand. The percentage of CD54-positive cells and the median fluorescence intensity of CD20 and CD54 were the only parameters which were significantly higher in MCL than in atypical CLL (P < 0.05), allowing an immunological distinction between these two entities. Nevertheless, due to a quenching problem when using CD20 and CD54 together, and because CD18 showed a statistically different expression between classical and atypical CLL, the combination of CD18/CD54 has been preferred and showed a different pattern in the three entities. Immunophenotyping could be helpful in the differential diagnosis of CD5-positive B cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders with atypical features that do not fit exactly into any of the morphologic proposed groups.","['Deneys, V', 'Michaux, L', 'Leveugle, P', 'Mazzon, A M', 'Gillis, E', 'Ferrant, A', 'Scheiff, J M', 'De Bruyere, M']","['Deneys V', 'Michaux L', 'Leveugle P', 'Mazzon AM', 'Gillis E', 'Ferrant A', 'Scheiff JM', 'De Bruyere M']","['Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Universite Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antigens, CD20/*biosynthesis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD5 Antigens/analysis', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402200 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1458-65. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402200.,"['0 (Antigens, CD20)', '0 (CD5 Antigens)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",,,['Leukemia 2002 Mar;16(3):402'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection of lymphoma B cells with Ad-CD154 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) ratio of 100 or higher resulted in high-level transgene expression. Additionally, upon infection of lymphoma B cells, only Ad-CD154 resulted in surface expression of CD154, despite similar, high-level expression of either human or mouse CD154 by HeLa cells infected with Ad-hCD154 or Ad-CD154, respectively. Moreover, infection of lymphoma B cells with Ad-CD154, but not Ad-hCD154 or adenovirus encoding Eschericheria coli beta-galactosidase (Ad-LacZ), induced the neoplastic B cells to express higher levels of immune co-stimulatory molecules that are required for proficient presentation of antigen to T cells. Consistent with this, we found that Ad-CD154 infected lymphoma B cells could stimulate T cells to proliferate or produce interferon-gamma in allogeneic or autologous mixed lymphocyte interactions. We conclude that lymphoma B cells can be infected with Ad-CD154 and that this significantly enhances their recognition by allogeneic or autologous T cells. As such, Ad-CD154-transduced lymphoma B cells may have potential for the active immune therapy of patients with follicle center lymphoma.","['Cantwell, M J', 'Wierda, W G', 'Lossos, I S', 'Levy, R', 'Kipps, T J']","['Cantwell MJ', 'Wierda WG', 'Lossos IS', 'Levy R', 'Kipps TJ']","['Immunogenex, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Adenoviridae', 'Animals', 'CD40 Ligand/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Lymph Nodes/pathology/virology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocyte Culture Test, Mixed', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*immunology/virology', 'Mice', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402208 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1451-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402208.,['147205-72-9 (CD40 Ligand)'],,"['P01-CA34233/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA72103/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-CA81534/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene is strongly implicated in the CP, the molecular changes underlying BC are largely unknown. The ataxia telangiectasia gene, ATM, is a candidate gene for this transformation because the complex karyotypes associated with BC of CML suggest that DNA double-strand break repair is defective and because the ABL pathway involves the interaction between the Abl and the Atm proteins. We performed a mutational analysis for ATM in CML using genomic DNA from 14 CML cell lines and 59 CML patients in BC. No clearly deleterious nucleotide changes were observed. A new polymorphism C4138T was discovered which results in a non-conservative amino acid substitution (H1380Y). This variant lies in the Atm recognition motif for the Abl protein. While ATM is unlikely to contribute substantially to CML, further investigation of the H1380Y substitution should clarify whether it has any functional effect.","['Melo, J V', 'Kumberova, A', 'van Dijk, A G', 'Goldman, J M', 'Yuille, M R']","['Melo JV', 'Kumberova A', 'van Dijk AG', 'Goldman JM', 'Yuille MR']","['Department of Haematology, Imperial College School of Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Cycle Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402223 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1448-50. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402223.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the translocation may initiate the leukemic process, critical secondary genetic events are currently believed to be pivotal for leukemogenesis. We investigated 12 cases of childhood ALL with TEL/AML1 gene fusion by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and documented additional or secondary genetic changes in seven patients (58%). Three patients showed extra copies of chromosome 21 including a case in which the trisomy 21 (+21) clone was distinct from the one harboring TEL/AML1 gene fusion. Interestingly, one patient without +21 showed amplification of the AML1 gene on chromosome 21q, supporting the contention that AML1 amplification may be an important additional genetic event. Gene expression study by semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in two of these four patients showed an increase in AML1 transcripts that paralleled the increase in gene copy number. Deletion of the normal TEL allele was detected in two patients, with one of them showing loss of chromosome 12 together with duplication of the der(12)t(12;21). Finally, one patient showed duplication of the fusion signal. Our findings confirm that additional or secondary genetic changes including AML1 amplification are commonly encountered in childhood ALL with TEL/AML1 gene fusion, which are envisaged to play significant roles in disease progression.","['Ma, S K', 'Wan, T S', 'Cheuk, A T', 'Fung, L F', 'Chan, G C', 'Chan, S Y', 'Ha, S Y', 'Chan, L C']","['Ma SK', 'Wan TS', 'Cheuk AT', 'Fung LF', 'Chan GC', 'Chan SY', 'Ha SY', 'Chan LC']","[""Department of Pathology, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', '*Artificial Gene Fusion', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Down Syndrome/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402202 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1442-7. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402202.,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The VEGF signaling pathway, however, might have some role in malignant hematopoiesis, since malignant hematopoietic cells, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells, have been shown to express VEGF and its receptors. In endothelial cells, the VEGF/Flk-1/KDR signal system is a very important generator of nitric oxide (NO) through the activation of its downstream effectors phosphatidylinositol-3-OH-kinase (PI3-K), Akt kinase and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS). It is known that NO regulates hematopoiesis and modulates AML cell growth. The role of the VEGF signaling pathway in the control of AML cell growth through eNOS, however, has not been studied. By using the OCI/AML-2 cell line, which expresses VEGF receptor-2, ie Flk-1/KDR, eNOS and VEGF, as analyzed by flow cytometry, and produces VEGF into growth medium, as analyzed by ELISA, we showed that the Akt kinase and NOS activities in these cells were decreased by the inhibitors of VEGF, Flk-1/KDR and PI3-K, and NOS activity also by the direct inhibitor of NOS. The decreased NOS activity led to inhibition of clonogenic cell growth and, to some extent, induction of apoptosis. We also found that blast cells of bone marrow samples randomly taken from 14 AML patients uniformly expressed Flk-1/KDR and to varying degrees eNOS and VEGF, as analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We conclude that autocrine VEGF through Flk-1/KDR, by activating eNOS to produce NO through PI3-K/Akt kinase, maintains clonogenic cell growth in the OCI/AML-2 cell line. Since the patient samples did not express VEGF in all cases, it is possible that in vivo the regulatory connection between these two signal systems is also mediated via endocrine VEGF in addition to autocrine or paracrine VEGF.","['Koistinen, P', 'Siitonen, T', 'Mantymaa, P', 'Saily, M', 'Kinnula, V', 'Savolainen, E R', 'Soini, Y']","['Koistinen P', 'Siitonen T', 'Mantymaa P', 'Saily M', 'Kinnula V', 'Savolainen ER', 'Soini Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Oulu University Hospital, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Endothelial Growth Factors/*physiology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase/*metabolism', 'Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A', 'Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402217 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1433-41. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402217.,"['0 (Endothelial Growth Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Growth Factor)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A)', '0 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (NOS3 protein, human)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase)', 'EC 1.14.13.39 (Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under the same conditions, expression of SHP-2, a close relative of SHP-1, and the more distantly related PTP-1 B remained unchanged. Induction of SHP-1 expression correlates with dephosphorylation of a specific and limited set of tyrosyl phosphoproteins, suggesting that dephosphorylation of these proteins may be important for the differentiation process. Importantly, expression of exogenous SHP-1 inhibits K562 proliferation and alters the adhesion properties of these cells, indicating a more differentiated phenotype. Moreover, SHP-1 is found in a complex with both p210 Bcr-Abl and p190 Bcr-Abl, suggesting that it may regulate Bcr-Abl or Bcr-Abl-associated phosphotyrosyl proteins.

Rearrangements were found by Southern blotting in all but three patients (97%) and in 30 cases (31%) we observed oligoclonal IGH gene rearrangements. Heteroduplex PCR analysis revealed at least one clonal PCR product in all Southern blot-positive cases. In 89 patients (92%) complete V(D)J rearrangements were found, while incomplete D(H)-J(H) rearrangements occurred in only 21 patients (22%). In 5% of cases the D(H)-J(H) rearrangements were the sole IGH gene rearrangements.

While D(H)2 and D(H)3 gene rearrangements occur frequently in normal B cells and B cell precursors, the relatively frequent usage of D(H)7-27 (19%) in precursor-B-ALL patients is suggestive of leukemic transformation during prenatal lymphopoiesis. Among J(H) gene segments in the incomplete D(H)-J(H) rearrangements, the J(H)6 segment was significantly overrepresented (61%). This observation together with the predominant usage of the most upstream D(H) genes indicates that many of the identified clonal D(H)-J(H) gene rearrangements in precursor-B-ALL probably represent secondary recombinations, having deleted pre-existing D(H)-J(H) joinings. The patients with incomplete D(H)-J(H) gene rearrangements were frequently characterized by hyperdiploid karyotype with additional copies of chromosome 14 and/or by IGH oligoclonality. The presence of incomplete D(H)-J(H) joinings was also significantly associated with a less mature immunogenotype: overrepresentation of V(H)6-1 gene segment usage, absence of biallelic TCRD deletions, and low frequency of TCRG gene rearrangements. This immature immunogenotype of precursor-B-ALL with incomplete IGH gene rearrangements was not associated with more aggressive disease.","['Szczepanski, T', 'Willemse, M J', 'van Wering, E R', 'van Weerden, J F', 'Kamps, W A', 'van Dongen, J J']","['Szczepanski T', 'Willemse MJ', 'van Wering ER', 'van Weerden JF', 'Kamps WA', 'van Dongen JJ']","['Department of Immunology, University Hospital Rotterdam/Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain/*genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Genotype', 'Heteroduplex Analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunogenetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/*genetics', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402206 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1415-23. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402206.,['0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In one patient, we observed that 80% of CD34+ cells were t(8;21)+ at 2 months from initial clinical and cytogenetic remission. However, by 5 months the pre- and post-sorted populations contained 0.15% and 0.06% t(8;21) cells, respectively. Whereas essentially all t(8;21) cells in the initial specimen expressed CD34, only 0.6% were subsequently CD34+. These results are consistent with in vitro assays showing that residual t(8;21) cells undergo differentiation. Thus, FISH can identify MRD in a majority of t(8;21) patients and, combined with CD34+ selection, may provide an indirect assessment of the differentiation state of residual t(8;21) cells.","['Varella-Garcia, M', 'Hogan, C J', 'Odom, L F', 'Murata-Collins, J L', 'Ai, H', 'Chen, L', 'Richkind, K', 'Paskulin, G', 'Andreeff, M', 'Brizard, A', 'McGavran, L', 'Gemmill, R M', 'Berger, R', 'Drabkin, H A']","['Varella-Garcia M', 'Hogan CJ', 'Odom LF', 'Murata-Collins JL', 'Ai H', 'Chen L', 'Richkind K', 'Paskulin G', 'Andreeff M', 'Brizard A', 'McGavran L', 'Gemmill RM', 'Berger R', 'Drabkin HA']","['Division of Medical Oncology, University of Colorado Health Sciences and Cancer Centers, Denver 80262, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Cell Separation', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 21', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 8', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/*pathology', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Remission Induction', 'Translocation, Genetic']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402219 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1408-14. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402219.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",,['P01 CA 55164/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously reported that lovastatin induces a significant apoptotic response in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. To identify the critical biochemical mechanism(s) essential for lovastatin-induced apoptosis, add-back experiments were conducted to determine which downstream product(s) of the mevalonate pathway could suppress this apoptotic response. Apoptosis induced by lovastatin was abrogated by mevalonate (MVA) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), and was partially inhibited by farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). Other products of the mevalonate pathway including cholesterol, squalene, lanosterol, desmosterol, dolichol, dolichol phosphate, ubiquinone, and isopentenyladenine did not affect lovastatin-induced apoptosis in AML cells. Our results suggest that inhibiting geranylgeranylation of target proteins is the predominant mechanism of lovastatin-induced apoptosis in AML cells. In support of this hypothesis, the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI-298) mimicked the effect of lovastatin, whereas the farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI-277) was much less effective at triggering apoptosis in AML cells. Inhibition of geranylgeranylation was monitored and associated with the apoptotic response induced by lovastatin and GGTI-298 in the AML cells. We conclude that blockage of the mevalonate pathway, particularly inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation holds a critical role in the mechanism of lovastatin-induced apoptosis in AML cells.","['Xia, Z', 'Tan, M M', 'Wong, W W', 'Dimitroulakos, J', 'Minden, M D', 'Penn, L Z']","['Xia Z', 'Tan MM', 'Wong WW', 'Dimitroulakos J', 'Minden MD', 'Penn LZ']","['Department of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, University Health Network, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/pharmacology', 'Deoxyuracil Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases/metabolism', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lovastatin/*pharmacology', 'Methionine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mevalonic Acid/pharmacology', 'Polyisoprenyl Phosphates/pharmacology', 'Protein Prenylation/*drug effects', 'Sesquiterpenes', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402196 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1398-407. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402196.,"['0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '0 (FTI 277)', '0 (GGTI 298)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '0 (Polyisoprenyl Phosphates)', '0 (Sesquiterpenes)', '1173-82-6 (deoxyuridine triphosphate)', '79W6B01D07 (farnesyl pyrophosphate)', '9LHU78OQFD (Lovastatin)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 1.1.1.- (Hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA Reductases)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)', 'N21T0D88LX (geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate)', 'S5UOB36OCZ (Mevalonic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This pro-apoptotic effect occurs in cells from patients at all stages of the disease, including those resistant to conventional chemotherapy, suggesting that proteasome inhibitors may be useful for treatment of B-CLL. Following initial inhibition of proteasomal activity, these agents induce mitochondrial cytochrome c release and caspase-dependent apoptosis, involving cleavage/activation of caspases -2, -3, -7, -8 and -9. Pre-treatment with the cell permeable caspase inhibitor, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp (OMe)fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD.fmk), did not prevent the release of cytochrome c or partial processing of caspase-9 but prevented activation of effector caspases and the induction of apoptosis. These results suggest that the release of cytochrome c is caspase independent and that caspase-9 is the initiator caspase in proteasome inhibitor-induced apoptosis of B-CLL cells. Activation of B-CLL lysates with dATP results in the formation of an approximately 700 kDa caspase-activating apoptosome complex containing Apaf-1.

During the induction of chemoresistance, the appearance of a functional P-glycoprotein (P-gp), in addition to the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and pro-apoptotic Bax proteins was assessed. Parental cells which are sensitive to dox, have no P-gp activity and express Bcl-2 and Bax. After 4 weeks of treatment, a functional P-gp was detected in HL-60/Dox cells. In addition, the synthesis of Bcl-2 appeared to be replaced by Bcl-XL while that of Bax remained unchanged. These cells were also resistant to apoptosis induced by both P-gp and non-P-gp substrates. This inability to induce apoptosis could have resulted from the induction of the expression of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP). Our data show that acquired chemoresistance could involve a parallel induction of P-gp and an impairment of the apoptotic pathway.","['Campone, M', 'Vavasseur, F', 'Le Cabellec, M T', 'Meflah, K', 'Vallette, F M', 'Oliver, L']","['Campone M', 'Vavasseur F', 'Le Cabellec MT', 'Meflah K', 'Vallette FM', 'Oliver L']","['INSERM U419, Nantes, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/*biosynthesis', '*Apoptosis', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Probenecid/pharmacology', 'Protein Biosynthesis', '*Proteins', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/biosynthesis', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein', 'bcl-2-Associated X Protein', 'bcl-X Protein']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402222 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1377-87. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402222.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (BAX protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (X-Linked Inhibitor of Apoptosis Protein)', '0 (XIAP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-2-Associated X Protein)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 3.4.99.- (DEVDase)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)', 'V0YM2B16TS (fluorexon)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantitation of microvessel density (MVD), area, total vascular area (TVA), major and minor axis length, perimeter, compactness, shape factor, Feret diameter, and the number of branching vessels was performed by image analysis. Overall, the MDS group had significantly higher MVD, TVA, minor axis and shape factor values and significantly lower compactness than the control group. AML was characterized by increased vascularity compared to MDS and CMML, as well as by the presence of flattened microvessels (lower values of shape factor). Hypercellular MDS showed higher MVD. RA/RARS displayed larger caliber vessels than RAEB, which explains the favorable prognostic effect of increased size-related parameters on progression and/or survival. Moreover, decreased compactness and MVD were independent predictors of longer progression-free survival. It is concluded that angiogenesis is involved in the conversion of normal marrow to MDS and ultimately to AML and that disease progression within MDS is accompanied by qualitative alterations of the microvascular network. Furthermore, size-related parameters affect survival, while shape-related parameters and MVD are more influential with regard to progression-free survival.","['Korkolopoulou, P', 'Apostolidou, E', 'Pavlopoulos, P M', 'Kavantzas, N', 'Vyniou, N', 'Thymara, I', 'Terpos, E', 'Patsouris, E', 'Yataganas, X', 'Davaris, P']","['Korkolopoulou P', 'Apostolidou E', 'Pavlopoulos PM', 'Kavantzas N', 'Vyniou N', 'Thymara I', 'Terpos E', 'Patsouris E', 'Yataganas X', 'Davaris P']","['Department of Pathology, University of Athens, Medical School, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Factor VIII/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/pathology', 'Male', 'Microcirculation/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*pathology', 'Prognosis']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402220 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1369-76. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402220.,['9001-27-8 (Factor VIII)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donors were HLA-identical siblings. Patients without significant acute (>grade 1) and/or chronic GVHD were scheduled to be treated with DLI (35 patients) and 31 actually received DLI. Patients who developed acute GVHD >grade 1 and/or chronic GVHD were not scheduled to receive DLI and served as a comparison group (47 patients). The median interval between BMT and DLI was 22 weeks. The first six patients received 0.7 x 10(8) CD3+ cells/kg body weight (b.w.). Five out of these six patients developed acute GVHD (grade 1: n = 2, grade 3: n = 2 and grade 4: n= 1) which was more frequent and more severe than we had anticipated. In the next 25 patients the number of T lymphocytes was diminished to 0.1 x 10(8) CD3+ cells/kg b.w. which resulted in less frequent and less severe GVHD. Eight patients in this group developed acute GVHD (grade 1: n = 4, grade 2: n = 4) and three patients had limited chronic GVHD. Patients in the DLI group needed more time to establish complete donor chimerism confirmed by a higher number of mixed chimeras at 6 months after BMT. The projected 3-year probability of disease-free survival was 77% for the 35 patients intended to treat with DLI and 45% for the patients of the comparison group (P = 0.024). Relapse rate at 36 months after transplantation was 18% in the patients who were intended to treat with DLI and 44% in the comparison group (P = 0.026). We conclude that pre-emptive DLI is feasible and generates favorable relapse rates in patients who are at high risk for relapse.

Patients were randomised to receive lenograstim (glycosylated recombinant human G-CSF) 5 microg per kg body weight subcutaneously daily from day 8 after starting chemotherapy, or no cytokine, following chemotherapy with cytarabine 3 g/m2 every 12 h on days 1, 3, 5, and 7, together with idarubicin 9 or 12 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, and 3, plus etoposide 75 mg/m2 on days 1 to 7 inclusive. Patients had untreated AML, and were aged 16 to 60 years. Overall, 54 evaluable patients were randomised to receive lenograstim and 58 to no cytokine. Patients in the lenograstim arm had a significantly shorter duration of neutropenia <0.5 x 10(9)/l compared to patients in the no cytokine arm (median 18 vs 22 days; P = 0.0005), and also shorter duration of total leucopenia <1.0 x 10(9)/l (17 vs 19 days; P = 0.0002), as well as a reduction in duration of treatment with therapeutic intravenous antibiotics (20 vs 24 days; P= 0.015) and a trend to reduced number of days with fever >38.0 degrees C (9 vs 12 days; P = 0.18). There were no differences between the two groups in platelet recovery, red cell or platelet transfusions, or non-haematological toxicities. For patients achieving CR after their first induction course, a reduction in the time to the start of the next course of therapy was observed in the lenograstim arm, from a median of 40.5 days to a median of 36 days (P = 0.082). The overall complete response rates to chemotherapy were similar, 81% in the lenograstim arm vs 75% for the no cytokine arm (P = 0.5), and there was no significant difference in the survival durations. We conclude that the granulopoietic stimulating effect of G-CSF is observed after induction therapy for AML intensified by high-dose cytarabine, resulting in an improvement in a number of clinically important parameters with no major adverse effects.","['Bradstock, K', 'Matthews, J', 'Young, G', 'Lowenthal, R', 'Baxter, H', 'Arthur, C', 'Bashford, J', 'Brighton, T', 'Cannell, P', 'Dunlop, L', 'Durrant, S', 'Enno, A', 'Eliadis, P', 'Gill, D', 'Gillett, A', 'Gottlieb, D', 'Januszewicz, H', 'Joshua, D', 'Leahy, M', 'Schwarer, A', 'Taylor, K']","['Bradstock K', 'Matthews J', 'Young G', 'Lowenthal R', 'Baxter H', 'Arthur C', 'Bashford J', 'Brighton T', 'Cannell P', 'Dunlop L', 'Durrant S', 'Enno A', 'Eliadis P', 'Gill D', 'Gillett A', 'Gottlieb D', 'Januszewicz H', 'Joshua D', 'Leahy M', 'Schwarer A', 'Taylor K']","['Haematology Department, Westmead Hospital, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adjuvants, Immunologic/economics/therapeutic use', 'Adult', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Glycosylation', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/economics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/economics/therapeutic use', 'Lenograstim', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/economics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins/economics/therapeutic use', 'Survival Rate']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402218 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1331-8. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402218.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6WS4C399GB (Lenograstim)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,['Australian Leukaemia Study Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine patients were treated during era 1 (1980 to 1987), and 10 were treated during era 2 (1988 to 1996). All entered complete remission (CR) with induction therapy. Eight of the nine children treated in era 1 died, seven of relapsed leukemia. In contrast, three of 10 patients treated during era 2 have died, all of non-disease-related causes. Event-free survival (EFS) estimates were significantly higher for patients treated during era 2 than for those treated during era 1 (P = 0.03); the 6-year estimates were 70 +/- 15% (s.e.) and 11 +/- 7%, respectively. Era 2 treatment protocols differed from those of era 1 in their use of higher doses of cytarabine and etoposide during induction and consolidation chemotherapy and in their use of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA). These results suggest that dose intensification of cytarabine benefits children with AML and inv(16), as is the case in adults. They also suggest that dose intensification of etoposide and addition of 2-CDA may also offer an advantage.

Many questions regarding patient selection, efficacy and outcome are unresolved, hence a review of the literature through Medline search. Autologous transplantation for CLL has been used mainly in selected patients under the age of 60. Conditioning typically involves total body irradiation (TBI). Bone marrow and more recently peripheral blood stem cells are used. Treatment-related mortality in most series is less than 10%. Molecular remissions after autologous transplantation are common, and clinical remissions can be prolonged in some patients. Randomized studies are needed to establish whether autologous transplantation confers a survival benefit over standard chemotherapy approaches. Allogeneic transplantation has a considerable treatment-related mortality, but durable remissions sometimes occur in patients with advanced disease. The use of non-myeloablative 'mini-transplants' has been investigated as a method to reduce treatment-related mortality, but prolonged follow-up will be required to establish the cure rate obtained with this procedure. Autologous and allogeneic transplantation are promising treatment modalities. Further refinements of transplant techniques and properly designed prospective studies are necessary to establish the role of stem cell transplantation in the overall management of CLL.","['van Besien, K', 'Keralavarma, B', 'Devine, S', 'Stock, W']","['van Besien K', 'Keralavarma B', 'Devine S', 'Stock W']","['University of Illinois at Chicago, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'MEDLINE', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care', 'Patient Selection', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2001/08/23 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402178 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Sep;15(9):1317-25. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402178.,,76,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HSV expression vectors overcome these disadvantages, but, because they persist in target cells as nonreplicative episomes, they are not retained in all the progeny of dividing cells. Chimeric HSV/AAV products that can mediate transgene integration in human mitotic cells have been constructed, but, to date, genetic modification of dividing cells in animal models using HSV products has not been possible. Here, we report the construction of hybrid HSV/retroviral vectors that exhibit up to 50-fold higher transgene integration efficiency compared to vectors containing only HSV-1 components. Efficient integration of a retroviral transgene cassette encoding pac in human cells required expression of the Moloney murine leukemia virus gag-pol genes, but in murine cells, could also be mediated by endogenous activities, albeit at a lower level. Gene delivery was equally efficient in BHK21, a cell line resistant to retroviral infection, and transgene retention and expression were observed to be stable for least one month in Hs683 human glioma cells. These vectors have wide applications for the genetic modification of many cell types.","['de Felipe, P', 'Izquierdo, M', 'Wandosell, F', 'Lim, F']","['de Felipe P', 'Izquierdo M', 'Wandosell F', 'Lim F']","['Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biotechniques,BioTechniques,8306785,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'Cricetinae', 'Genes, gag', 'Genes, pol', 'Genetic Markers', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glioma', 'Herpesvirus 1, Human/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kidney/cytology', 'Mitosis', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional/*methods', 'Puromycin', 'Transgenes/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/genetics', 'Virus Integration']",2001/08/23 10:00,2002/01/26 10:01,['2001/08/23 10:00'],"['2001/08/23 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/23 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2144/01312rr01 [doi]'],ppublish,"Biotechniques. 2001 Aug;31(2):394-402, 404-5. doi: 10.2144/01312rr01.","['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '147015-70-1 (SPP1 pac region protein, Bacteriophage SPP1)', '4A6ZS6Q2CL (Puromycin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DATA SOURCES: A local case of mucormycosis; MEDLINE and non-MEDLINE search of the literature. STUDY SELECTION: Key words for the literature search were 'mucormycosis' and 'Mucorales'; all available years of study were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Original articles, review papers, meta-analyses, and relevant book chapters were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that is rare but increasingly recognised in the growing population of immunocompromised patients. It is caused by saprophytic non-septate hyphae of the order Mucorales. The pulmonary and disseminated forms commonly occur in patients with haematological malignancy, especially acute leukaemia and lymphoma, and those receiving treatment with immunosuppressive effects. The rhinocerebral form is more prevalent in patients with diabetes mellitus, particularly those with the complication of diabetic ketoacidosis. The use of amphotericin B combined with surgery remains the mainstay of treatment. The prognosis largely depends on prompt correction of the underlying risk factors. New strategies to combat this life-threatening infection will result from better understanding of its pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: A high index of suspicion is needed, in appropriate clinical settings, to diagnose and aggressively treat this infection in view of the high mortality rate for susceptible patients.","['Yeung, C K', 'Cheng, V C', 'Lie, A K', 'Yuen, K Y']","['Yeung CK', 'Cheng VC', 'Lie AK', 'Yuen KY']","['Division of Haematology, Department of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Queen Mary Hospital, Pokfulam, Hong Kong.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",China,Hong Kong Med J,Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi,9512509,IM,"['Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mucormycosis/*complications/drug therapy/microbiology']",2001/08/22 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/22 10:00'],"['2001/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hong Kong Med J. 2001 Jun;7(2):180-8.,,55,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Certain genome regions of these animal retroviruses are highly conserved between different animal species. It should be possible to detect new members of the retrovirus family with consensus PCR primers derived from these conserved sequence motifs. The consensus PCR primers developed in this study are generic enough to detect nearly all known oncogenic mammalian and avian exogenous C- and D-type retroviruses but do not amplify human endogenous retroviral sequences. In contrast to previous investigations, the present study involved highly stringent PCR conditions and truly generic PCR primers. Forty-four samples from patients with various immunophenotyped malignant diseases (acute and chronic T-/B-cell lymphocytic leukaemias, acute myeloid leukaemias, T-/B-cell lymphomas, chronic myeloproliferative disorders) and three cell lines (Hodgkin's lymphoma, Burkitt's lymphoma) have thus far been investigated using these PCR primers. The fact that no retroviruses have been found argues against an involvement of known animal oncoretroviruses or related hitherto undetected human retroviruses in the aetiopathogenesis of these diseases. The retrovirus detection system developed here may be used to confirm suspected retroviral involvement in other (malignant or nonmalignant) human diseases as well as to identify new animal retroviruses.","['Burmeister, Thomas', 'Schwartz, Stefan', 'Thiel, Eckhard']","['Burmeister T', 'Schwartz S', 'Thiel E']","['Freie Universitat Berlin, Medizinische Klinik III, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200 Berlin, Germany1.', 'Freie Universitat Berlin, Medizinische Klinik III, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200 Berlin, Germany1.', 'Freie Universitat Berlin, Medizinische Klinik III, Hindenburgdamm 30, 12200 Berlin, Germany1.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Betaretrovirus/isolation & purification', 'Conserved Sequence', 'DNA, Viral/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*virology', 'Lymphoma/*virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Retroviridae/*isolation & purification']",2001/08/22 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/22 10:00'],"['2001/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/0022-1317-82-9-2205 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2001 Sep;82(Pt 9):2205-2213. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-82-9-2205.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,10.1099/0022-1317-82-9-2205 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have found that the rate constants of single-electron enzymatic reduction, and the enthalpies of single-electron reduction of nitroaromatic compounds (DeltaHf(ArNO(2)(-*)), obtained by quantum mechanical calculation, may serve as useful tools for the analysis of cytotoxicity of nitroaromatic explosives with respect to the possible involvement of oxidative stress. The single-electron reduction rate constants of a number of explosives including 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) and 2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-N-methylnitramine (tetryl), and model nitroaromatic compounds by ferredoxin:NADP(+) reductase (FNR, EC 1.18.1.2) and NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase (P-450R, EC 1.6.2.4) increased with a decrease in DeltaHf(ArNO(2)(-*)). This indicates that the reduction rates are determined by the electron transfer energetics, but not by the particular structure of the explosives. The cytotoxicity of explosives to bovine leukemia virus-transformed lamb kidney fibroblasts (line FLK) increased with a corresponding increase in their reduction rate constant by P-450R and FNR, or with a decrease in their DeltaHf(ArNO(2)(-*)). This points to an importance of oxidative stress in the toxicity of explosives in this cell line, which was further evidenced by the protective effects of desferrioxamine and the antioxidant N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylene diamine, and an increase in lipid peroxidation. DT-diaphorase (EC 1.6.99.2) exerted a minor and equivocal role in the cytotoxicity of explosives to FLK cells.","['Cenas, N', 'Nemeikaite-Ceniene, A', 'Sergediene, E', 'Nivinskas, H', 'Anusevicius, Z', 'Sarlauskas, J']","['Cenas N', 'Nemeikaite-Ceniene A', 'Sergediene E', 'Nivinskas H', 'Anusevicius Z', 'Sarlauskas J']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Vilnius, Lithuania. ncenas@bchi.lt']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Aniline Compounds/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase/chemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Models, Chemical', 'Molecular Structure', 'NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone)/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry', 'NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase/chemistry', 'Nitrobenzenes/chemistry/*toxicity', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Quantum Theory', 'Sheep', 'Trinitrotoluene/chemistry/*toxicity']",2001/08/22 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/08/22 10:00'],"['2001/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0304416501001696 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-4165(01)00169-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2001 Sep 3;1528(1):31-8. doi: 10.1016/s0304-4165(01)00169-6.,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Nitrobenzenes)', '118-96-7 (Trinitrotoluene)', 'EC 1.18.1.2 (Ferredoxin-NADP Reductase)', 'EC 1.6.2.4 (NADPH-Ferrihemoprotein Reductase)', 'EC 1.6.5.2 (NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone))', 'EF9BEM54XJ (pentryl)', 'GJ18911991 (nitramine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this review is to conduct a critical analysis of epidemiologic results currently available concerning the relationship between radon exposure and the risk of leukemia. Nineteen ecological studies, six miner cohort studies, and eight case-control studies published between 1987 and 2000 are included in this review. The limitations associated with each of these studies are discussed. The results of the ecological studies are relatively concordant and suggest an association between radon concentrations and the risk of leukemia at a geographic level. But these ecological studies present important limitations, and some are only crude analyses. Moreover, the results of the cohort and case-control studies, based on individual data, do not show any significant association between radon exposure and leukemia risk.

Here we report data on p75/adhesion receptor molecule 1 (AIRM1), a surface inhibitory receptor of the sialoadhesin family originally identified in NK cells that is also expressed by normal and leukemic myeloid cells. Given the homology between p75/AIRM1 and CD33, we also reanalyzed CD33, a major myeloid marker of still unknown function. We discuss recent data indicating that engagement of p75/AIRM1 or CD33 sharply inhibits the in vitro proliferation/differentiation of CD34+ myeloid precursors induced by stem cell factor and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Importantly, a similar in vitro inhibitory effect occurs in monocyte/macrophages as well as in chronic or acute myeloid leukemias. While CD33 appears to act via the induction of apoptosis, p75/AIRM1 blocks cell proliferation but does not appear to induce apoptosis. A synergistic effect in the induction of apoptosis has also been documented between antibodies specific for CD33 and the chemotherapic agent etoposide. Taken together, the use of appropriate ligands against CD33 or p75/AIRM1 may represent a new therapeutic tool for treatment of myeloid leukemias or diseases characterized by overwhelming macrophage activation.","['Mingari, M C', 'Vitale, C', 'Romagnani, C', 'Falco, M', 'Moretta, L']","['Mingari MC', 'Vitale C', 'Romagnani C', 'Falco M', 'Moretta L']","['Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Centro Biotecnologie Avanzate, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,IM,"['Antigens, CD/*physiology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*physiology', 'Apoptosis/physiology', 'Cell Division/physiology', 'Cell Survival/physiology', 'Cross-Linking Reagents', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/*pathology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3']",2001/08/22 10:00,2002/02/20 10:01,['2001/08/22 10:00'],"['2001/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/20 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1034/j.1600-065x.2001.1810122.x [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2001 Jun;181:260-8. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-065x.2001.1810122.x.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (CD33 protein, human)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Sialic Acid Binding Ig-like Lectin 3)', '0 (adhesion inhibitory receptor molecule 1)']",39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The percentage of people supplied with ""optimally"" fluoridated drinking water (FD) obtained from the Fluoridation Census 1985, U.S.A. were used for regression analysis of incidence rates of cancers at thirty six sites (ICD-WHO, 1957). About two-thirds of sites of the body (ICD) were associated positively with FD, but negative associations were noted for lip cancer, melanoma of the skin, and cancers of the prostate and thyroid gland. In digestive organs the stomach showed only limited and small intestine no significant link. However, cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, colon and rectum, hepato-biliary and urinary organs were positively associated with FD. This was also the case for bone cancers in male, in line with results of rat experiments. Brain tumors and T-cell system Hodgkin's disease, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, melanoma of the skin and monocytic leukaemia were also correlated with FD.

In the allogeneic setting, conditioning regimens containing FTBI and high dose VP-16 produce high rates of long-term progression-free survival in patients with AML and ALL. Because of more rapid engraftment, peripheral blood stem cells are increasingly being used for allogeneic HSCT, however, longer follow-up will be required to determine whether there are differences in overall survival and long-term complications such as chronic graft-versus host disease (GVHD). Results of autologous transplantation for acute leukemias are improving as new strategies are used to decrease the risk of relapse. For diffuse aggressive NHL, high-dose therapy and autologous HSCT has been established as a potentially curative therapy when performed at the time of relapse or as part of the frontline treatment in selected patients with poor prognostic features at presentation. Patients with HIV-associated NHL may also benefit from autologous HSCT. In other subtypes of NHL such as mantle cell lymphoma and low-grade lymphoma, the curative potential of autologous transplantation is less certain and the graft-versus-lymphoma effect which can be seen in allogeneic HSCT may be required for cure of these histologic subtypes. Our current research efforts focus on reducing the risk of relapse as well as acute and long-term complications.","['Molina, A', 'Popplewell, L', 'Kashyap, A', 'Nademanee, A']","['Molina A', 'Popplewell L', 'Kashyap A', 'Nademanee A']","['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Clin Transpl,Clinical transplants,8812419,IM,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Autoimmune Diseases/therapy', 'California/epidemiology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods/mortality/trends', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Lymphoma, AIDS-Related/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/08/22 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/08/22 10:00'],"['2001/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Transpl. 2000:317-42.,,164,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Past medical history revealed the following diagnoses: liver cirrhosis, splenomegaly, thrombocytopenia, macrocytic anaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type IIa diabetes mellitus and peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs with chronic leg ulcers. Within 6 weeks the patient developed an increasing number of pigmented lanugo type hair over both cheeks, zygomatic arches and temples. The diagnosis of circumscribed acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa (AHL) was established. Bone marrow biopsy revealed presence of acute myeloid leukemia. THERAPY AND CLINICAL COURSE: Chemotherapy with hydroxycarbamide (Syrea) was started without effect on haematologic parameters. The patient was transferred to the oncology unit where he died soon afterwards. CONCLUSION: Acquired hypertrichosis lanuginosa (AHL) is a paraneoplastic syndrome. It is mainly associated with adenocarcinoma of lung and bowel, however other histologic types of tumours and localisations have been described. About 50 cases have been reported in the literature until 1998. To our knowledge this is the first case of AHL described in association with acute myeloid leukemia.","['Bauer, H I', 'Kaatz, M', 'Elsner, P']","['Bauer HI', 'Kaatz M', 'Elsner P']",['Klinik fur Dermatologie und dermatologische Allergologie der Friedrich-Schiller-Universitat Jena. heike.bauer@med.derma.uni-jena.de'],['ger'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Dtsch Med Wochenschr,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),0006723,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Hypertrichosis/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Paraneoplastic Syndromes/*etiology']",2001/08/22 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/22 10:00'],"['2001/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-2001-16016 [doi]'],ppublish,Dtsch Med Wochenschr. 2001 Jul 27;126(30):845-6. doi: 10.1055/s-2001-16016.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,Umschriebene Hypertrichosis lanuginosa bei akuter myeloischer Leukamie.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This inhibition was competitive, yielding Ki values in the range of 1.96 to 48.9 microM. The inhibition of Type II IMPDH correlated positively with the inhibition of the growth of Tmolt4 cells, the syntheses of DNA and purine, and the activity of crude IMPDH. The Type II IMPDH isoform is found in rapidly proliferating cells. The isoform present in normal resting cells, Type I IMPDH, was elevated by the compounds at 100 microM. In addition, Compound 5 significantly increased the Type I enzyme activity in a concentration and time dependent manner. The selectivity of these derivatives towards Type II IMPDH will allow for the separation of cellular effects, which should reduce clinical toxicity when treating with antimetabolite IMPDH inhibitors.","['Hall, I H', 'Barnes, B J', 'Ward, E S', 'Wheaton, J R', 'Shaffer, K A', 'Cho, S E', 'Warren, A E']","['Hall IH', 'Barnes BJ', 'Ward ES', 'Wheaton JR', 'Shaffer KA', 'Cho SE', 'Warren AE']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7360, USA. iris_hall@unc.edu']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Arch Pharm (Weinheim),Archiv der Pharmazie,0330167,IM,"['DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors/biosynthesis', 'Imides/*chemical synthesis/*pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/22 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/22 10:00'],"['2001/08/22 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/22 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1521-4184(200107)334:7<229::AID-ARDP229>3.0.CO;2-O [pii]', '10.1002/1521-4184(200107)334:7<229::aid-ardp229>3.0.co;2-o [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Pharm (Weinheim). 2001 Jul;334(7):229-34. doi: 10.1002/1521-4184(200107)334:7<229::aid-ardp229>3.0.co;2-o.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Imides)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fusion of promyelocytic leukemia alpha gene (PML) with retinoic acid receptor gene with the t (15;17) translocation causes disassembly of PML NBs, leading to development of acute promyelocytic leukemia. In contrast, PML overexpression as well as different morphological changes of PML NBs were described in a few solid tumors. In this study, the expression of PML through the multistep hepatocarcinogenesis was analyzed in 95 cases of human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) for comparison along with dysplastic nodules (DNs) and background liver cirrhosis (LC) or chronic hepatitis by immunohistochemistry and immunoblot. In addition, cases of HCCs were further evaluated according to their histologic grade and etiology. The amount of PML as well as the number and size of PML NBs increased gradually through the progression from LC, DNs to HCCs. The overexpression of PML in HCCs was much more closely associated with HBV infection than HCV infection or alcoholic liver disease. The PML expression, however, was not correlated with histologic grade of HCCs. These results suggest that PML is involved in the early stage of multistep hepatocarcinogenesis, and HBV infection may be associated with the overexpression of PML and the morphological alteration of PML NBs.","['Yoon, G S', 'Yu, E']","['Yoon GS', 'Yu E']","['Department of Pathology, University of Ulsan College of Medicine Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Korea (South),J Korean Med Sci,Journal of Korean medical science,8703518,IM,"['Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Cell Nucleus/*chemistry', 'Humans', 'Liver/chemistry', 'Liver Neoplasms/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*analysis', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Precancerous Conditions/*chemistry/ultrastructure', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Transcription Factors/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/08/21 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/08/21 10:00'],"['2001/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']","['200108433 [pii]', '10.3346/jkms.2001.16.4.433 [doi]']",ppublish,J Korean Med Sci. 2001 Aug;16(4):433-8. doi: 10.3346/jkms.2001.16.4.433.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",,,,,,,,PMC3054776,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study was carried out in 12 patients (3 men and 9 women) with tumorous diseases of the blood system, in whom NVL was used for treating ARF. Central hemodynamic and oxygen transport parameters were studied using Swan-Hanz catheter. NVL was uneventfully carried out in 5 (41.7%) of 12 patients (group 1). Group 2 consisted of 7 patients intubated after the beginning of NVL: 2 had to be transferred to forced ventilation of the lungs (FVL) because of loss of consciousness and 5 because of augmenting severity of ARD. All patients transferred to FVL died. During the first 3 h of NVL, oxygen delivery increased from 371.3 +/- 84.9 to 443.9 +/- 92.7 gm/m2 and oxygen consumption from 123.9 +/- 35.9 to 173.5 +/- 34 m/m2, oxygen alveolar-arterial difference decreased from 400.8 +/- 165.3 to 210 +/- 57.5 mm Hg, pulmonary shunt from 41.8 +/- 11.9 to 19 +/- 7.9%, PaO2/FiO2 from 140.4 +/- 210 +/- 84.9, left-ventricular stroke index increased from 38.2 +/- 14.9 to 50.6 +/- 21.8 ml/m2, left-ventricular output index from 37 +/- 19.5 to 47.4 +/- 23.7 gm/m2, and heart rate decreased from 119.2 +/- 17.5 to 111.4 +/- 23.8 min-1. In group 2 greater fraction of inhaled oxygen and higher positive pressure at the end of inspiration were required than in group 1. Heart rate and oxygen alveolar-arterial difference were higher in group 2. Side effects of NVL were skin maceration, hematomas on the bridge of the nose, and conjunctivitis. A specific complication associated with thrombocytopenia was the hemorrhagic syndrome (nasal bleeding, hemorrhagic stomatitis). Hence, NVL is the first stage of respiratory support in hypoxemic ARF. In immunocompromised patients NVL is effective only in cases when the cause of damage to the lung is rapidly diagnosed and effective pathogenetic therapy promptly started.","['Galstian, G M', 'Fedanov, A V', ""Kesel'man, S A"", 'Shulutko, E M', 'Gorodetskii, V M']","['Galstian GM', 'Fedanov AV', ""Kesel'man SA"", 'Shulutko EM', 'Gorodetskii VM']",,['rus'],"['Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Russia (Federation),Anesteziol Reanimatol,Anesteziologiia i reanimatologiia,7705399,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hemodynamics', 'Humans', '*Immunocompromised Host', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology', 'Male', 'Oxygen Consumption', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/*immunology', 'Respiration, Artificial/*methods', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/*therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",2001/08/21 10:00,2002/01/17 10:01,['2001/08/21 10:00'],"['2001/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anesteziol Reanimatol. 2001 May-Jun;(3):23-7.,,,,,,Neinvazivnaia ventiliatsiia legkikh v lechenii ostroi dykhatel'noi nedostatochnosti u immunokomprometirovannykh bol'nykh.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AIM: To study the frequency of the cytogenetic alteration of 11q23 chromosome or the recombination of MLL gene in infants less than 18 months old, with acute leukemia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed 37 cases of AL in infants less than 18 months of age diagnosed in Chile from 1989 to 1999. The clinical features and cytogenetic/molecular defects of 11q23MLL gene rearrangement and their influence in prognosis were determined. RESULTS: There were 18 cases of acute Lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) characterized by female sex (67%) high presenting leukocyte count (median 99 x 109/L), blast cells with a CD10 negative phenotype (50%) and 11q23/MLL rearrangement (39%). Molecular abnormalities of 11q23 were significantly associated with adverse prognosis, with an event free survival (EFS) of only 14 +/- 12%. Interestingly, infants with germ line 11q23 had a very good outcome with an EFS of 73 +/- 11% (p < 0.025). There were 19 cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) characterized by male sex (63%) high leukocyte count (median 93 x 109/L), FAB-MS morphology (53%) and 11q23/MLL rearrangement (53%). EFS was very poor, 20 +/- 9% and 33 +/- 4% for rearranged and germinal group respectively (p = NS), due to a high mortality rate during the first month of diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that Chilean ALL infants with 11q23 abnormalities have a very poor prognosis. However those with germinal state can enjoy a prolonged disease free survival with the current treatment protocols.","['Cabrera, M E', 'Campbell, M', 'Quintana, J', 'Undurraga, M S', 'Ford, A A', 'Greaves, M F']","['Cabrera ME', 'Campbell M', 'Quintana J', 'Undurraga MS', 'Ford AA', 'Greaves MF']","['Departamento de Medicina, Campus Oriente, Facultad de Medicina Universidad de Chile. mcabrera@mi-mail.cl']",['spa'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Chile,Rev Med Chil,Revista medica de Chile,0404312,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Chile/epidemiology', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",2001/08/21 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/21 10:00'],"['2001/08/21 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/21 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Med Chil. 2001 Jun;129(6):634-42.,,,,,,Significado clinico y frecuencia de la alteracion genetico/molecular 11q23/MLL en lactantes con leucemia aguda en Chile.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, an in vivo application of the SNV vector system in gene transfer protocols is hampered by its lack of resistance against human complement. To overcome this limitation we established pseudotyping of MLV vector particles produced in human packaging cell lines with the SNV envelope (Env) protein. Three variants of SNV Env proteins differing in the length of their cytoplasmic domains were all efficiently incorporated into MLV core particles. These pseudotype particles infected the SNV permissive cell line D17 at titers of up to 10(5) IU/ml. A stable packaging cell line (MS4) of human origin released MLV(SNV) pseudotype vectors that were resistant against human complement inactivation. To redirect their tropism to human T cells, MS4 cells were transfected with the expression gene encoding the scFv 7A5 in fusion with the transmembrane domain (TM) of the SNV Env protein, previously shown to retarget SNV vector particles to human lymphocytes. MLV(SNV-7A5)-vector particles released from these cells were selectively infectious for human T cell lines.

In this study, the commercialized Murex CMV DNA Hybrid Capture assay (version 2.0) (HCS) was prospectively compared to an in-house CMV-DNA PCR assay from whole blood in patients after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Overall, a high concordance between HCS and PCR was documented (kappa = 0.686; n = 385). The HCS assay was found to be as sensitive as the PCR indicating active CMV infection at a median of 35 and 34 days after transplantation, respectively.

We examined serum HGF concentrations in 38 patients receiving allogeneic bone marrow transplants, and investigated the relationship of serum HGF concentrations to severity of acute GVHD. More HGF was present in sera from patients with than without acute GVHD. Serum HGF correlated significantly with grade of acute GVHD. Furthermore, serum HGF correlated with serum concentrations of C-reactive protein, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GTP), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Serum concentrations of HGF in transplanted patients without GVHD were consistently low, while those in patients with acute GVHD increased with exacerbation.

The dose of intravenous immunoglobulin also had no effect on the types of infection, relapse of hematological malignancy or survival. Except for more frequent chills (P = 0.007) and headaches (P = 0.015) in patients given the 500 mg/kg or 250 mg/kg dose of immunoglobulin, adverse events were similar for all three doses.

The overall leukemia relapse rate was not significantly different between the tacrolimus and cyclosporine groups (19.6% and 11.4%, respectively). However, the relapse rate among recipients from HLA-matched siblings was significantly higher in the tacrolimus group (30.9%) compared with the cyclosporine group (3.6%, P = 0.013).

The four other patients only achieved partial donor T cell chimerism. BM and PBMC donor chimerism was lost between day 40 and 209 despite DLI. Three patients are alive with disease and one is in CR. We conclude that T cell-reduced SCT using 200 cGy as the conditioning regimen does not result in stable hematopoietic engraftment.

From October 1994 to July 1999, 20 patients (median age 9.9 years, range 0.11-16.2) were treated in six centers. Eighteen had de novo AML and two had secondary AML. According to BFM criteria, 10 were classified as standard- and 10 as high-risk patients, respectively. The median time from diagnosis to CR1 and from diagnosis to Auto-HSCT were 1.1 months (range 0.8-1.6) and 4.3 months (range 3.1-6.2), respectively. Purging with either mafosfamide (three) or in vivo interleukin-2 (four) was performed in seven of 20 patients. Melphalan was administered at a dosage of 150-220 mg/m(2) (median 180). Median total number of nucleated cells infused was 2.5 x 10(8)/kg (range 1.1-8.9). The myeloablative regimen was well tolerated with no toxic death, veno-occlusive disease or life-threatening complications.

The 3-year cumulative probability of survival and event-free-survival (EFS) is 62% and 56%, respectively. This study showed that in pediatric patients with AML consolidation of CR1 with high-dose melphalan allows survival and EFS to be obtained comparable to other auto-HSCT or chemotherapy published series with a potential sparing effect both on duration of treatment (with respect to chemotherapy) and on long-term side-effects (with respect to auto-HSCT with TBI or busulfan containing regimens).","['Cesaro, S', 'Meloni, G', 'Messina, C', 'Pillon, M', 'Proglia, A', 'Lanino, E', 'Caniggia, M', 'Bagnulo, S', 'Pession, A', 'Locatelli, F']","['Cesaro S', 'Meloni G', 'Messina C', 'Pillon M', 'Proglia A', 'Lanino E', 'Caniggia M', 'Bagnulo S', 'Pession A', 'Locatelli F']","['Clinica di Oncoematologia Pediatrica, Dipartimento di Pediatria, Universita di Padova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Purging/methods', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Interleukin-2/therapeutic use', 'Italy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/genetics/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Melphalan/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Patient Selection', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",2001/08/18 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/18 10:00'],"['2000/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2001/05/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/08/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1703122 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Jul;28(2):131-6. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1703122.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)']",,,,,,,,,,['Italian Pediatric Group for Bone Marrow Transplantation'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Practical applicability of the HBc particles as carriers was enabled by their ability to high level synthesis and correct self-assembly in heterologous expression systems. The interest in the HBc VLPs was reinforced by the resolution of their fine structure by electron cryomicroscopy and X-ray crystallography, which revealed an unusual alpha-helical organization of dimeric units of HBc shells, alternative packing into icosahedrons with T = 3 and T = 4 symmetry, and the existence of long protruding spikes. The tips of the latter seem to be the optimal targets for the display of foreign sequences up to 238 amino acid residues in length.

Unique to Fes is a long N-terminal sequence with two regions of strong homology to coiled-coil oligomerization domains. We introduced leucine-to-proline substitutions into the coiled coils that were predicted to disrupt the coiled-coil structure. The resulting mutant proteins, together with wild-type Fes, were fused to green fluorescent protein and expressed in Rat-2 fibroblasts. We observed that a point mutation in the first coiled-coil domain (L145P) dramatically increased Fes tyrosine kinase and transforming activities in this cell type. In contrast, a similar point mutation in the second coiled-coil motif (L334P) was without effect. However, combining the L334P and L145P mutations reduced transforming and kinase activities by approximately 50% relative to the levels of activity produced with the L145P mutation alone. To study the effects of the coiled-coil mutations in a biologically relevant context, we expressed the mutant proteins in the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent myeloid leukemia cell line TF-1. In this cellular context, the L145P mutation induced GM-CSF independence, cell attachment, and spreading. These effects correlated with a marked increase in L145P protein autophosphorylation relative to that of wild-type Fes. In contrast, the double coiled-coil mutant protein showed greatly reduced kinase and biological activities in TF-1 cells. These data are consistent with a role for the first coiled coil in the negative regulation of kinase activity and a requirement for the second coiled coil in either oligomerization or recruitment of signaling partners.

These properties suggest roles in both exocytosis and endocytosis, but little is known of the dynamics of Annexin 2 distribution in live cells during these processes. We have used evanescent field microscopy to image Annexin 2-GFP in live, secreting rat basophilic leukemia cells and in cells performing pinocytosis. Although we found no evidence of Annexin 2 involvement in exocytosis, we observed an enrichment of Annexin 2-GFP in actin tails propeling macropinosomes. The association of Annexin 2-GFP with rocketing macropinosomes was specific because Annexin 2-GFP was absent from the actin tails of rocketing Listeria. This finding suggests that the association of Annexin 2 with macropinocytic rockets requires native pinosomal membrane. Annexin 2 is necessary for the formation of macropinocytic rockets since overexpression of a dominant-negative Annexin 2 construct abolished the formation of these structures. The same construct did not prevent the movement of Listeria in infected cells. These results show that recruitment of Annexin 2 to nascent macropinosome membranes 16656is an essential prerequisite for actin polymerization-dependent vesicle locomotion.","['Merrifield, C J', 'Rescher, U', 'Almers, W', 'Proust, J', 'Gerke, V', 'Sechi, A S', 'Moss, S E']","['Merrifield CJ', 'Rescher U', 'Almers W', 'Proust J', 'Gerke V', 'Sechi AS', 'Moss SE']","['Vollum Institute, 3181 Sam Jackson Park Road, Oregon 97201, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Curr Biol,Current biology : CB,9107782,IM,"['Actins/*physiology', 'Animals', 'Annexin A2/*physiology', 'Exocytosis/physiology', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Movement', 'Osmotic Pressure', 'Pinocytosis/*physiology', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/18 10:00'],"['2001/08/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0960-9822(01)00321-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00321-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Curr Biol. 2001 Jul 24;11(14):1136-41. doi: 10.1016/s0960-9822(01)00321-9.,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Annexin A2)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For example, it is still unknown whether selection or induction processes are responsible for drug resistance here or whether protein kinase C (PKC) isozymes contribute to the resistant phenotype. Therefore, inducibility of resistance factors or PKC isozymes genes was examined in CCRF-CEM cells treated with diverse anticancer drugs--adriamycin, camptothecin, etoposide or vincristine--at sublethal concentrations for 24 h. MDR1, MRP1, LRP and PKC isozyme alpha, beta(1), beta(2), epsilon, iota, eta, theta, zeta gene expression was determined by cDNA-PCR. We found significant dose-dependent, mostly combined, induction of the MDR1, MRP1 and LRP genes. Significantly enhanced gene expression of the majority of PKC isozyme genes was found after treatment with camptothecin. PKCzeta was upregulated throughout by each anticancer drug applied in this setting. A series of selected CCRF-CEM-derived multidrug resistance (MDR) sublines also showed enhanced expression of the PKC isozymes compared to the parental cell line. MDR1 and PKCeta gene expression levels were correlated highly significantly. Blasts from two patients with ALL during the first week of monotherapy with steroids revealed combined induction of the MDR1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1), lung cancer resistance-related protein (LRP) and most PKC isozymes, predominantly PKCzeta. Another patient with T-ALL, who failed to respond to four months of intensive chemotherapy, showed an enhanced MRP1 gene expression combined with markedly overexpression of PKCeta and PKCtheta. Furthermore, the camptothecin and etoposide-mediated induction of resistance factors in the CCRF-CEM cell line could be suppressed by staurosporine, a rather unspecific inhibitor of protein kinases. However, selective inhibitors of PKC isozymes (bisindolylmaleimide GO 6850, indolocarbazole GO 6976) produced no significant effects here. Therefore, the PKC isozymes eta, theta and zeta are of interest as potential targets to overcome drug resistance in ALL.","['Beck, J F', 'Brugger, D', 'Brischwein, K', 'Liu, C', 'Bader, P', 'Niethammer, D', 'Gekeler, V']","['Beck JF', 'Brugger D', 'Brischwein K', 'Liu C', 'Bader P', 'Niethammer D', 'Gekeler V']","['Department of Pediatric Haematology/Oncology, University of Greifswald, Soldmannstr. 15, D-17487 Greifswald, Germany. beck@mail.uni-greifswald.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/genetics/metabolism', 'Maleimides/pharmacology', '*Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins', 'MutS Homolog 3 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles/genetics/metabolism']",2001/08/18 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/18 10:00'],"['2001/08/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01178.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2001 Aug;92(8):896-903. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01178.x.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (MSH3 protein, human)', '0 (Maleimides)', '0 (Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins)', '0 (MutS Homolog 3 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vault Ribonucleoprotein Particles)', '0 (major vault protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'L79H6N0V6C (bisindolylmaleimide I)', 'Y49M64GZ4Q (multidrug resistance-associated protein 1)']",,,,,,,,PMC5926830,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anorexia and weight loss developed within 7-10 days in mice injected i.c. with A431 or OVCAR3 cells well before a large tumour developed, while i.c.-injected GBLF cells did not induce cachexia until day 20, when the tumour was large. By contrast, mice injected i.p. or s.c. developed tumours without evidence of anorexia. Thus, intracerebrally-growing A431 and OVCAR3 resulted in cancer cachexia independent of tumour mass, and we investigated their cytokine pattern. Serum levels of murine and human cytokines are not predictive of cancer cachexia development. Reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis revealed in the brain of i.c.-injected A431 tumour-bearing mice expression of human interleukin-(IL-)1alpha, IL-1beta and LIF in all samples and IL-6 in two of four samples while in i.c.-injected OVCAR3 tumour-bearing animals IL-6, and LIF were detected in all samples and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in two of four samples. Only LIF was expressed in brains of mice injected with GBLF cells. Murine IL-6 was increased only in the brains of A431-bearing mice. Only mice injected i.c. simultaneously with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the murine IL-6 receptor and OVCAR3 cells, but not those with mAb and A431 cells, showed a significant increase in survival time with a partial and temporary attenuation of cachexia symptoms. These results suggest that IL-6 in OVCAR3 model may be important cachectogenic factor when centrally released by even a limited number of tumour cells.","['Negri, D R', 'Mezzanzanica, D', 'Sacco, S', 'Gadina, M', 'Benigni, F', 'Cajola, L', 'Finocchiaro, G', 'Ghezzi, P', 'Canevari, S']","['Negri DR', 'Mezzanzanica D', 'Sacco S', 'Gadina M', 'Benigni F', 'Cajola L', 'Finocchiaro G', 'Ghezzi P', 'Canevari S']","['Unit of Molecular Therapies, Department of Experimental Oncology, Istituto Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori, Via Venezian 1, Milano, 20133, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Animals', 'Anorexia/metabolism', 'Body Weight', 'Brain/metabolism', 'Brain Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cachexia/*metabolism', 'Central Nervous System/metabolism', 'Cytokines/blood/*physiology', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Feeding Behavior', 'Female', 'Growth Inhibitors/blood/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/blood/metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/blood/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/blood/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/18 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/08/18 10:00'],"['2001/08/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/18 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/cyto.2001.0899 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(01)90899-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2001 Jul 7;15(1):27-38. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2001.0899.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,['Cytokine. 2001 Jul 7;15(1):1-3.

We also demonstrated the production of 24R,25(OH)2-3-epi-D, in two other cell lines [human colon carcinoma cells (Caco-2) and porcine kidney cells (LLC-PK1)] which were previously shown to convert 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 into 1alpha,25(OH)2-3-epi-D3. It can be seen that the production of 24R,25(OH)2- 3-epi-D3 from 24R,25(OH)2D3 is lower than that of 1alpha,25(OH)2-3-epi-D3 from 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 in all the cells studied. 24R,25(OH)2-3-epi-D3 was found to be inactive in terms of its ability to bind to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), in inhibiting proliferation and in inducing differentiation of human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). Thus, our study indicates that the C-3 epimerization pathway is common to both 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and 24R,25(OH)2D3 and may play an important role in modulating the concentration and the biological activity of these two major vitamin D3 metabolites in target tissues.","['Kamao, M', 'Tatematsu, S', 'Reddy, G S', 'Hatakeyama, S', 'Sugiura, M', 'Ohashi, N', 'Kubodera, N', 'Okano, T']","['Kamao M', 'Tatematsu S', 'Reddy GS', 'Hatakeyama S', 'Sugiura M', 'Ohashi N', 'Kubodera N', 'Okano T']","['Department of Hygienic Sciences, Kobe Pharmaceutical University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Japan,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo),Journal of nutritional science and vitaminology,0402640,IM,"['24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3/*metabolism', 'Angiogenesis Inhibitors/chemistry/*isolation & purification/physiology', 'Animals', 'Bone Neoplasms', 'Caco-2 Cells', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Osteosarcoma', 'Swine', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin D/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*isolation & purification/physiology']",2001/08/18 10:00,2002/04/18 10:01,['2001/08/18 10:00'],"['2001/08/18 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/18 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/18 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.3177/jnsv.47.108 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nutr Sci Vitaminol (Tokyo). 2001 Apr;47(2):108-15. doi: 10.3177/jnsv.47.108.,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (dihydroxy-vitamin D3)', '1406-16-2 (Vitamin D)', '40013-87-4 (24,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D 3)']",,['DK52488/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mutations produced by these compounds were predominantly G-->T and G-->C transversions that we suspect arose from oxidative damage to DNA. To test this, we employed the single cell electrophoresis (Comet) assay that detects alkali-labile lesions in cells sustaining DNA damage. Human myeloid leukemia K562 cells were treated with non-cytotoxic doses of the above compounds for 3 h, then placed on slides containing low melting point agarose. Cells were lysed, exposed to alkaline buffer, electrophoresed and analyzed by microscopy for the existence of DNA damage. Extensive DNA damage, most likely due to the existence of single- and double-strand breaks and apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites, was observed in cells exposed to oxazepam (1 mM) and Wyeth 14,643 (0.5 mM). On the other hand, damage of this sort was not observed in cells exposed to phenobarbital (1 mM). However, the addition of S9 liver extracts to cells exposed in the presence of phenobarbital resulted in significant amounts of DNA damage.

This report shows that a 5 h exposure to 0.1 or 0.01 microg/ml metavanadate during the initial period of erythroid differentiation induction was sufficient to permanently damage the ability of treated Mel cells and their progeny to undergo erythroid differentiation, without affecting cell viability and proliferation. Conversely, a 5 h pulse of metavanadate at 1 or 10 microg/ml inhibited both differentiation and cell proliferation. The cell cycle-dependent period of mutagenesis was essential for fixation of damage in the cell genome and the progeny of the cells treated with 0.1 or 0.01 microg/ml metavanadate stably inherited an impaired capacity to differentiate. The efficiency of the DNA repair synthesis machinery during the specific period of exposure of Mel cells seemed directly involved in damage fixation. In fact, the mutagenic effects of a 0.1 microg/ml metavanadate pulse was further increased in the presence of 1 mM hydroxyurea, an inhibitor of DNA repair synthesis. In contrast, 5 microg/ml vanillin, an antimutagenic agent that stimulates repair, completely restored the capacity of progeny of cells treated with 0.1 microg/ml metavanadate to complete differentiation. Determination of [(3)H]deoxythymidine in acid-insoluble DNA indicated that incorporation was stimulated by metavanadate alone and was further increased by metavanadate plus vanillin; conversely, incorporation of thymidine was reduced in the presence of hydroxyurea. The capacity of metavanadate to permanently damage Mel cell erythroid differentiation appeared to depend on the cell cycle-related efficiency of the DNA repair systems, activated to correct the induced alteration, rather than on a specific concentration.","['Foresti, M', 'Scippa, S', 'Mele, F', 'Palladino, G', 'de Vincentiis, M']","['Foresti M', 'Scippa S', 'Mele F', 'Palladino G', 'de Vincentiis M']","[""Dipartimento di Genetica, Biologia Generale e Molecolare, Universita degli Studi di Napoli 'Federico II', Naples, Italy. foresti@dgbm.unina.it""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vanadates/*toxicity']",2001/08/17 10:00,2001/11/03 10:01,['2001/08/17 10:00'],"['2001/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/11/03 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/16.5.395 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 2001 Sep;16(5):395-400. doi: 10.1093/mutage/16.5.395.,['3WHH0066W5 (Vanadates)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the JSRV vector was stable during centrifugation, allowing facile vector concentration, and showed no loss of activity after six freeze-thaw cycles.

EBV infects and efficiently transforms human primary B lymphocytes in vitro. A number of EBV-encoded genes are critical for EBV-mediated transformation of human B lymphocytes. In this study we show that an EBV-infected lymphoblastoid cell line obtained from the spontaneous outgrowth of B cells from a leukemia patient contains a deletion, which involves a region of approximately 16 kbp. This deletion encodes major EBV genes involved in both infection and transformation of human primary B lymphocytes and includes the glycoprotein gp350, the entire open reading frame of EBNA3A, and the amino-terminal region of EBNA3B. A fusion protein created by this deletion, which lies between the BMRF1 early antigen and the EBNA3B latent antigen, is truncated immediately downstream of the junction 21 amino acids into the region of the EBNA3B sequence, which is out of frame with respect to the EBNA3B protein sequence, and indicates that EBNA3B is not expressed. The fusion is from EBV coordinate 80299 within the BMRF1 sequence to coordinate 90998 in the EBNA3B sequence. Additionally, we have shown that there is no detectable induction in viral replication observed when SNU-265 is treated with phorbol esters, and no transformants were detected when supernatant is used to infect primary B lymphocytes after 8 weeks in culture. Therefore, we have identified an EBV genome with a major deletion in critical genes involved in mediating EBV infection and the transformation of human primary B lymphocytes that is incompetent for replication of this naturally occurring EBV isolate.","['Lee, W', 'Hwang, Y H', 'Lee, S K', 'Subramanian, C', 'Robertson, E S']","['Lee W', 'Hwang YH', 'Lee SK', 'Subramanian C', 'Robertson ES']","['Department of Biological Sciences, Myongji University, Yongin Kyunggi-do, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology', 'Blotting, Southern/methods', 'Blotting, Western/methods', 'Callithrix', 'Cell Line', 'Deoxyribonuclease BamHI', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Genome, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*genetics', 'Open Reading Frames', 'Phorbol Esters', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Sequence Deletion', 'Viral Matrix Proteins/*genetics']",2001/08/17 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/08/17 10:00'],"['2001/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.75.18.8556-8568.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Sep;75(18):8556-68. doi: 10.1128/jvi.75.18.8556-8568.2001.,"['0 (EBNA-3B antigen)', '0 (Epstein-Barr Virus Nuclear Antigens)', '0 (GP 300-350, Epstein-Barr virus)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Viral Matrix Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease BamHI)']",,"['R01 DE014136/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA072150/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R29 CA072150/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA072150-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DE4136-01/DE/NIDCR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC115101,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Valsesia-Wittmann et al., J. Virol. 70:2059-2064, 1996). The resulting chimeric envelopes share two BDs: an additional N-terminal BD (Pit-2 BD) and the BD of the ecotropic envelope (mCAT-1 BD). By inserting a variety of different amino acid spacers between the two binding domains, we showed that retroviruses can potentially use the targeted cell surface receptor Pit-2, the ecotropic retroviral receptor mCAT-1, or both receptors cooperatively for entry into target cell (S. Valsesia-Wittmann et al., EMBO J 6:1214-1223, 1997). An extreme example of receptor cooperativity was encountered when envelopes with specific proline-rich interdomain spacers (PRO spacers) were tested: both receptors had to be coexpressed at the surface of the targeted cells to cooperatively allow infection. Here, we characterized the role of PRO spacer in the cooperation of receptors. We have shown that the particular organization of the PRO spacer-a beta-turn polyproline-was responsible for the cooperative effect. In the native configuration of the viruses, the structure masked the regions located downstream of the PRO spacer, thus the mCAT-1 BD. After interaction with the targeted Pit-2 receptor, the BD of the backbone envelope became accessible, and we demonstrated that interaction between the mCAT-1 BD and the mCAT-1 receptor is absolutely necessary. This interaction leads to natural fusion triggering and entry of viruses into targeted cells.","['Valsesia-Wittmann, S']",['Valsesia-Wittmann S'],"['Vectorologie Retrovirale et Therapie Genique, Ecole Normale Superieure de Lyon, INSERM U412, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07, France. sandrinewittmann@yahoo.fr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cricetinae', 'Gene Products, env/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Membrane Fusion', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Proline/genetics', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', '*Symporters']",2001/08/17 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/08/17 10:00'],"['2001/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.75.18.8478-8486.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Sep;75(18):8478-86. doi: 10.1128/jvi.75.18.8478-8486.2001.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (SLC20A2 protein, human)', '0 (Slc20a2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (ecotropic murine leukemia virus receptor)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",,,,,,,,PMC115093,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous difficulties with the low infectivity and restricted expression of the virus have prevented a clear understanding of these events. Virus stocks were generated by transfecting cells with three plasmids: (i) a packaging plasmid encoding HTLV-1 structural and regulatory proteins, (ii) an HTLV-1 transfer vector containing either firefly luciferase or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein genes, and (iii) an envelope expression plasmid. Single-round infections were initiated by exposing target cells to filtered supernatants and quantified by assaying for luciferase activity in cell extracts or by enumerating transduced cells by flow cytometry. Transduction was dependent on reverse transcription and integration of the recombinant virus genome, as shown by the effects of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) and by mutation of the integrase gene in the packaging vector, respectively. The 50% inhibitory concentration of AZT was determined to be 30 nM in this HTLV-1 replication system. The stability of HTLV-1 particles, pseudotyped with either vesicular stomatitis virus G protein or HTLV-1 envelope, was typical of retroviruses, exhibiting a half-life of approximately 3.5 h at 37 degrees C. The specific infectivity of recombinant HTLV-1 virions was at least 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of analogous HIV-1 particles, though both were pseudotyped with the same envelope.

The phosphorylation of HTLV type 2 Rex (Rex-2), predominantly on serine residues, correlates with an altered conformation, as detected by a gel mobility shift, and is required for specific binding to its viral RNA target sequence. Thus, the phosphorylation state of Rex in the infected cell may be a switch that determines whether the virus exists in a latent or a productive state. A mutational analysis of Rex-2 that focused on serine and threonine residues was performed to identify regions or domains within Rex-2 important for function, with a specific emphasis on identifying Rex-2 phosphorylation mutants. We identified mutations near the carboxy terminus that disrupted a novel region or domain and abrogated Rex-2 function. Mutant M17 (with S151A and S153A mutations) displayed reduced phosphorylation that correlated with reduced function. Replacement of both serine residues 151 and 153 with phosphomimetic aspartic acid restored Rex-2 function and locked Rex-2 in a phosphorylated active conformation. A mutant containing threonine residues at positions 151 and 153 displayed a phenotype indistinguishable from that of wild-type Rex. Furthermore, this same mutant showed increased threonine phosphorylation and decreased serine phosphorylation, providing conclusive evidence that one or both of these residues are phosphorylated in vivo. Our results provide the first direct evidence that the phosphorylation of Rex-2 is important for function. Further understanding of HTLV Rex phosphorylation will provide insight into the regulatory control of HTLV replication and ultimately the pathobiology of HTLV.","['Narayan, M', 'Kusuhara, K', 'Green, P L']","['Narayan M', 'Kusuhara K', 'Green PL']","['Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acid Substitution', 'Binding Sites', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Products, rex/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', '*Human T-lymphotropic virus 2/genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis', 'Phosphorylation', 'Serine/metabolism']",2001/08/17 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/08/17 10:00'],"['2001/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.75.18.8440-8448.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Sep;75(18):8440-8. doi: 10.1128/jvi.75.18.8440-8448.2001.,"['0 (Gene Products, rex)', '452VLY9402 (Serine)']",,['CA 59581/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC115089,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Steel factor (SF) or Kit ligand is produced as a membrane-bound form (mSF) and a soluble form. Because both primary gynecological tumors and primary leukemic cells from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) have been shown to coexpress c-Kit and SF, we addressed the question of whether mSF could contribute to cell interaction in these cancers. Investigations on primary cervical carcinomas have been hindered by the fact that the cells do not grow in culture. We report herein the establishment of two cervical carcinoma cell lines, CALO and INBL, that reproduce the pattern of SF/c-Kit expression observed in primary tumor samples. In addition, these cells exhibit marked density-dependent growth much in the same way as AML blasts. Using an antisense strategy with phosphorothioate-modified oligonucleotides that specifically target SF without affecting other surface markers, we provide direct evidence for a role of mSF and c-Kit in cell interaction and cell survival in these gynecological tumor cell lines as well as in primary AML blasts.

After a single injection, lentivectors encoding human erythropoietin (EPO) produced dose-dependent increases in serum human EPO levels and hematocrit that increased rapidly within one month and remained stable subsequently. Delivered gene expression was confined locally at the injection site. Excision of engineered skin led to rapid and complete loss of human EPO in the bloodstream, confirming that systemic EPO delivery was entirely due to lentiviral targeting of cells within skin rather than via spread of the injected vector to visceral tissues.

The present case indicates that a combined medical and surgical approach is mandatory to treat patients with brain abscesses.","['Sakai, C', 'Iuchi, T', 'Ishii, A', 'Kumagai, K', 'Takagi, T']","['Sakai C', 'Iuchi T', 'Ishii A', 'Kumagai K', 'Takagi T']","['Division of Hematology and Chemotherapy, Chiba Cancer Center Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,IM,"['Aged', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', '*Bacillus cereus/isolation & purification', 'Brain Abscess/diagnosis/drug therapy/*microbiology/*therapy', 'Drainage', 'Female', 'Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections/drug therapy/*microbiology/*therapy', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Severity of Illness Index', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/08/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/17 10:00'],"['2001/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.40.654 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med. 2001 Jul;40(7):654-7. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.40.654.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nevertheless, its efficacy is limited because of the development of resistance to IFN-alpha therapy. Previously, we established the novel human CML cell line KT-1, which is sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha. Here, we report the establishment of an IFN-alpha-resistant subline, KT-1/A3R alpha 1000, by culturing KT-1/A3 cells (IFN-alpha-sensitive subline of KT-1) with increasing concentrations of IFN-alpha, in order to analyze the mechanism of acquisition of IFN-alpha resistance in CML cells after IFN-alpha therapy. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We developed an IFN-alpha-resistant tumor cell variant, KT-1/A3R alpha 1000, from the KT-1/A3 cell line by culturing cells with increasing concentrations of IFN-alpha. This subline was examined for its ability to proliferate and its resistance to apoptosis in high concentrations of IFN-alpha. The induction of the ISGF3 complex in response to IFN-alpha alpha in KT-1/A3R alpha 1000 was compared with that in the parental cell. RESULTS: The levels of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 components (STAT1, STAT2, and p48) proteins and STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation induced after IFN-alpha treatment were unchanged, but formation of the ISGF3 complex was remarkably reduced in KT-1/A3R alpha 1000 cells compared to parental cells. CONCLUSION: The KT-1/A3R alpha 1000 subline is a useful model for studying the mechanism of IFN-alpha resistance after IFN-alpha therapy.","['Yamauchi, H', 'Sakai, I', 'Narumi, H', 'Takeuchi, K', 'Soga, S', 'Fujita, S']","['Yamauchi H', 'Sakai I', 'Narumi H', 'Takeuchi K', 'Soga S', 'Fujita S']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Ehime University School of Medicine.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Intern Med,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",9204241,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Transformed/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2001/08/17 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/17 10:00'],"['2001/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2169/internalmedicine.40.607 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med. 2001 Jul;40(7):607-12. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine.40.607.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CASE REPORTS: The first patient was a 42-year old man who received an allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for chronic myelogenous leukemia. A severe graft-versus-host reaction occurred. Three months after discontinuing VZV prophylaxis, VZV transverse myelitis was diagnosed, leading to death despite prompt treatment with acyclovir. The second patient was a 42-year-old woman treated with autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoma. She developed acute viral pancreatitis one month after discontinuing VZV prophylaxis. Recovery was achieved with intravenous treatment. DISCUSSION: These two cases illustrate the potential gravity of VZV infection after bone marrow transplantation. These observations point to the need for revisiting the duration of VZV prophylaxis.","['Ladriere, M', 'Bibes, B', 'Rabaud, C', 'Delaby, P', 'May, T', 'Canton, P']","['Ladriere M', 'Bibes B', 'Rabaud C', 'Delaby P', 'May T', 'Canton P']","['Service de Maladies infectieuses et tropicales, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nancy.']",['fre'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",France,Presse Med,"Presse medicale (Paris, France : 1983)",8302490,IM,"['Adult', 'Antiviral Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/drug therapy', 'Herpes Zoster/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma, Large-Cell, Immunoblastic/*therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Myelitis, Transverse/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Opportunistic Infections/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Pancreatitis/*diagnosis/prevention & control', 'Spinal Cord/pathology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",2001/08/17 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/08/17 10:00'],"['2001/08/17 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/17 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Presse Med. 2001 Jul 7-13;30(23):1151-4.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)']",,,,,Infection par le virus varicelle-zona apres greffe de moelle osseuse.

The authors examined clinician perspectives on informed consent for pediatric research by surveying clinicians at five major medical centers that routinely enroll patients in Children's Cancer Group studies. METHODS: Building on a pilot study, a questionnaire was designed to elicit clinicians' general opinions, approaches, and suggestions related to informed consent in pediatric leukemia trials. Questionnaires were mailed to 132 clinicians. Eighty-nine questionnaires were returned, along with 13 nonparticipant forms notifying us of the clinician's inability to participate because of a lack of experience in pediatric informed consent. The response rate was 75%. RESULTS: Providing information so that families can decide about study entry was ranked as the most important goal of the informed consent process, whereas parents' state of shock was rated the most significant obstacle to good informed consent. Clinicians cited high levels of parental comprehension of key aspects of clinical research studies and reported information overload and increased anxiety as effects of the informed consent process on parents. Several key items were associated with clinicians' gender, race, and professional experience. Finally, one open-ended question yielded 126 suggestions for how to improve the informed consent process that were grouped into 10 meaningful categories. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians report a range of approaches, opinions, concerns, and suggestions for improving the informed consent process. The article proposes that their views and suggestions be integrated with those of parents and patients in attempts to survey and improve informed consent in pediatric oncology.","['Simon, C', 'Eder, M', 'Raiz, P', 'Zyzanski, S', 'Pentz, R', 'Kodish, E D']","['Simon C', 'Eder M', 'Raiz P', 'Zyzanski S', 'Pentz R', 'Kodish ED']","[""Rainbow Center for Pediatric Ethics, Department of Pediatrics, Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital/University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/standards', 'Female', 'Health Care Surveys', 'Humans', '*Informed Consent', 'Leukemia', 'Male', '*Mental Competency', 'Middle Aged', '*Parents', 'Pediatrics/standards', ""Practice Patterns, Physicians'"", '*Research/standards', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",2001/08/16 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0142(20010801)92:3<691::AID-CNCR1372>3.0.CO;2-4 [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0142(20010801)92:3<691::aid-cncr1372>3.0.co;2-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer. 2001 Aug 1;92(3):691-700. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(20010801)92:3<691::aid-cncr1372>3.0.co;2-4.,,,['R01 CA83267/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Copyright 2001 American Cancer Society.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results for lymphoma, leukemia, and possibly also for stomach cancer might reflect a suppression of the immune system from ultraviolet light in outdoor workers.","['Hakansson, N', 'Floderus, B', 'Gustavsson, P', 'Feychting, M', 'Hallin, N']","['Hakansson N', 'Floderus B', 'Gustavsson P', 'Feychting M', 'Hallin N']","['Division of Occupational Epidemiology, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Box 210, 171 77 Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,IM,"['Adult', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Risk Factors', 'Sunlight/*adverse effects', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",2001/08/16 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001648-200109000-00015 [doi]'],ppublish,Epidemiology. 2001 Sep;12(5):552-7. doi: 10.1097/00001648-200109000-00015.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This fact has led to recommendations to use a broad definition of exposure when estimating attributable fractions. I here review the assumptions underlying exposure simplification, focusing on the assumptions that the source and target populations have the same exposure distribution and that complete risk removal is possible. I argue that attributable fraction estimates based on dichotomization can be especially sensitive to violations of these assumptions, and hence misleading for projecting the impact of exposure reduction. I conclude that it is important to obtain and use detailed exposure and covariate information for attributable-fraction estimation.","['Greenland, S']",['Greenland S'],"['Department of Epidemiology, UCLA School of Public Health, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Epidemiology,"Epidemiology (Cambridge, Mass.)",9009644,IM,"['*Bias', 'Biometry', 'Child', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', '*Environmental Exposure', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sweden/epidemiology', 'United States/epidemiology']",2001/08/16 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001648-200109000-00010 [doi]'],ppublish,Epidemiology. 2001 Sep;12(5):518-20. doi: 10.1097/00001648-200109000-00010.,,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we showed that carnosic acid potentiates the effects of 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1alpha,25[OH]2D3) and of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) on differentiation of human leukemia cells. We now examine the mechanisms associated with carnosic acid-induced enhancement of cell differentiation (in subline HL60-G) initiated by 1alpha,25(OH)2D3, ATRA, or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). METHODS: We evaluated monocytic differentiation markers (CD11b, CD14, and monocytic serine esterase), cell cycle parameters, and cell proliferation rates after treatment of cells with different agents with or without carnosic acid. We also assessed the abundance of the vitamin D receptor (VDR), retinoid X receptor (RXR)-alpha, retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-alpha, and cell cycle-associated proteins by immunoblot analysis (p27, early growth response gene [EGR]-1, and p35Nck5a), the expression of corresponding genes by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the activity of VDR by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. The two-sided nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis-of-variance test with Dunn's adjustment was used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Monocytic differentiation induced by low (1 nM) concentrations of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3, ATRA, or TPA was enhanced by carnosic acid (10 microM), as shown by the increased expression of monocytic serine esterase (P<.001, P<.001, and P =.043, respectively) and of CD11b (P =.008, P =.046, and P =.041, respectively). Increased expression of CD14 was seen only for 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and ATRA (P =.009 and P =.048, respectively) and also for several cell cycle-associated proteins. Carnosic acid in combination with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and ATRA resulted in decreased cell proliferation and blocked the cell cycle transition from G1 to S phase (P<.05). Carnosic acid alone increased the expression of VDR and RXR-alpha, but the expression was greatly enhanced in the presence of 1alpha,25(OH)2D3 and ATRA. In combination with TPA, carnosic acid potentiated the expression of VDR and RAR-alpha. CONCLUSION: Carnosic acid enhances a program of gene expression consistent with 1alpha,25(OH)2D3-, ATRA-, or TPA-induced monocytic differentiation of HL60-G cells.","['Danilenko, M', 'Wang, X', 'Studzinski, G P']","['Danilenko M', 'Wang X', 'Studzinski GP']","['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, UMD-New Jersey Medical School, Newark 07103, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Abietanes', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Antioxidants/*pharmacology', 'Blotting, Western', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/analysis', 'Diterpenes/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Granulocytes/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Monocytes/*drug effects', 'Plant Extracts/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Calcitriol/analysis', 'Receptors, Retinoic Acid/administration & dosage/analysis', 'Retinoid X Receptors', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/analysis', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",2001/08/16 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/93.16.1224 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 2001 Aug 15;93(16):1224-33. doi: 10.1093/jnci/93.16.1224.,"['0 (Abietanes)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antioxidants)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Receptors, Calcitriol)', '0 (Receptors, Retinoic Acid)', '0 (Retinoid X Receptors)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'LI791SXT24 (salvin)']",,['CA44722/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We performed a meta-analysis of all trials comparing the incidence of acute and chronic GVHD after PBSCT and BMT reported as of June, 2000. Secondary analyses examined relapse rates after the two procedures. METHODS: An extensive MEDLINE search of the literature was undertaken. Primary authors were contacted for clarification and completion of missing information. A review of cited references was also undertaken. Sixteen studies (five randomized controlled trials and 11 cohort studies) were included in this analysis. Data was extracted by two pairs of reviewers and analyzed for the outcomes of interest. Meta-analyses, regression analyses, and assessments of publication bias were performed. RESULTS: Using a random effects model, the pooled relative risk (RR) for acute GVHD after PBSCT was 1.16 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04 to 1.28; P=.006) when compared with traditional BMT. The pooled RR for chronic GVHD after PBSCT was 1.53 (95% CI, 1.25 to 1.88; P <.001) when compared with BMT. The RR of developing clinically extensive chronic GVHD was 1.66 (95% CI, 1.35 to 2.05; P <.001). The excess risk of chronic GVHD was explained by differences in the T-cell dose delivered with the graft in a meta-regression model that did not reach statistical significance. There was a trend towards a decrease in the rate of relapse after PBSCT (RR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62 to 1.05). CONCLUSION: Both acute and chronic GVHD are more common after PBSCT than BMT, and this may be associated with lower rates of malignant relapse. The magnitude of the transfused T-cell load may explain the differences in chronic GVHD risk.","['Cutler, C', 'Giri, S', 'Jeyapalan, S', 'Paniagua, D', 'Viswanathan, A', 'Antin, J H']","['Cutler C', 'Giri S', 'Jeyapalan S', 'Paniagua D', 'Viswanathan A', 'Antin JH']","['Division of Hematologic Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA. corey_cutler@dfci.harvard.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis']",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Studies', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*etiology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Risk Factors']",2001/08/16 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.16.3685 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Aug 15;19(16):3685-91. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.16.3685.,,,,,,,,['J Clin Oncol. 2002 Jan 15;20(2):603-6.

To identify prognostic factors affecting the outcome of second HSCT, we performed a retrospective study on patients with acute leukemia (AL) undergoing second HSCT who reported to the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Cooperative Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry. PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred seventy patients who received second HSCTs for AL experienced relapse after first HSCTs were performed from 1978 to 1997. Status at second HSCT, time between first and second HSCT, conditioning regimen, source of stem cells, treatment-related mortality (TRM), acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), leukemia-free survival (LFS), overall survival (OS), and relapse were considered. RESULTS: Engraftment occurred in 97% of patients. Forty-two patients were alive at last follow-up, with a 5-year OS rate of 26%. The 5-year probability for TRM, LFS, and relapse was 46%, 25%, and 59%, respectively. Grade > or = 2 aGVHD occurred in 59% of patients, and chronic GVHD occurred in 32%. In multivariate analysis, diagnosis, interval to relapse after first HSCT > 292 days, aGVHD at first HSCT, complete remission status at second HSCT, use of total-body irradiation at second HSCT, acute GVHD at second HSCT, and use of bone marrow as source of stem cells at second HSCT were associated with better outcome. CONCLUSION: Second HSCT represents an effective therapeutic option for AL patients relapsed after allogeneic HSCT, with a 3-year LFS rate of 52% for the subset of patients who experienced relapse more than 292 days after receiving the first HSCT and who were in remission before receiving the second HSCT.","['Bosi, A', 'Laszlo, D', 'Labopin, M', 'Reffeirs, J', 'Michallet, M', 'Gluckman, E', 'Alessandrino, P E', 'Locatelli, F', 'Vernant, J P', 'Sierra, J', 'Jouet, J P', 'Frassoni, F']","['Bosi A', 'Laszlo D', 'Labopin M', 'Reffeirs J', 'Michallet M', 'Gluckman E', 'Alessandrino PE', 'Locatelli F', 'Vernant JP', 'Sierra J', 'Jouet JP', 'Frassoni F']","['Blood and Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Hematology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy. a.bosi@dfc.unifi.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Europe/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reoperation', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/08/16 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.2001.19.16.3675 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2001 Aug 15;19(16):3675-84. doi: 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.16.3675.,,,,,,,,,,,['Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Blood and Marrow Transplant Group'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Five hundred fifty-four previously untreated CLL patients with intermediate/high-risk Rai-stage disease were enrolled onto an intergroup protocol. Patients were randomized to therapy with chlorambucil, fludarabine, or fludarabine plus chlorambucil. Data pertaining to infection were available on 518 patients. Differences in infections among treatment arms were tested with the Kruskal-Wallis, Wilcoxon, and chi(2) tests. RESULTS: A total of 1,107 infections (241 major infections) occurred in 518 patients over the infection follow-up period (interval from study entry until either reinstitution of initial therapy, therapy with a second agent, or death). Patients treated with fludarabine plus chlorambucil had more infections than those receiving either single agent (P <.0001). Comparing the two single-agent arms, there were more infections on the fludarabine arm (P =.055) per month of follow-up. Fludarabine therapy was associated with more major infections and more herpesvirus infections compared with chlorambucil (P =.008 and P =.004, respectively). Rai stage and best response to therapy were not associated with infection. A low serum immunoglobulin G was associated with number of infections (P =.02).

The potential benefit of HDAC inhibition has been established by the use of enzyme inhibitors in vitro and in a single reported case of experimental therapy. Because recently identified HDAC inhibitors appear to overcome many drawbacks of early inhibitory compounds in clinical use, the stage is set to test the therapeutic value of HDAC inhibition in leukemias and in other diseases, including solid tumors and aberrant hormonal signaling.

Similar changes occurring in the bone marrow may play an important role in the development of leukemia. The objective of this research has been to characterize chromosomal alterations induced by benzene in mice and humans and to investigate the potential role of inhibition of topoisomerase II in the myelotoxic effects of benzene. The research is presented in three sections corresponding to the specific aims of the project: genotoxicity studies in the mouse, topoisomerase II studies, and initial studies using a new fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) approach to detect chromosome alterations in benzene-exposed workers. The results of the mouse experiments indicate that both chromosome breakage and aneuploidy are induced in the bone marrow of B6C3F1 mice following benzene administration. Chromosome breakage is the predominant effect, and this occurs primarily in the mouse euchromatin. Significant breakage within the mouse heterochromatin was also observed, as was aneuploidy. Breakage in the mouse bone marrow erythrocytes increased as a function of both dose and duration of benzene administration. The aneuploidy resulting from benzene exposure in mice was a relatively infrequent event, with increases of both chromosome loss and hyperdiploidy being observed. In the topoisomerase studies, benzene or its metabolites were shown to inhibit topoisomerase II enzyme activity in an isolated enzyme system, in a human bone marrow-derived leukemia cell line, and in vivo in the bone marrow of treated mice. The decreased activity was probably due to the rapid degradation of the topoisomerase II protein in the treated cells. In the human biomonitoring studies, the feasibility of using FISH with tandem DNA probes to detect chromosome alterations in interphase granulocytes and lymphocytes of benzene-exposed workers was demonstrated. The results from the two worker studies were somewhat inconsistent, however. In the study of Estonian workers, characterized by lower exposures and a smaller sample size, the benzene-exposed workers exhibited elevated frequencies of breakage in the lq12 region as compared with those seen in controls. A suggestive trend toward increased hyperdiploidy was also seen, although the frequencies in the exposed workers were low and within the range of our laboratory's historical control frequencies. In the larger study of more highly exposed Chinese workers, no increase in breakage affecting the 1q12 region was seen among the exposed workers. A trend toward increased hyperdiploidy of chromosome 1 was seen in the exposed workers when the concentration of urinary benzene metabolites was used in conjunction with the frequency of hyperdiploidy observed in the lymphocytes of the individual workers. The results of these studies indicate that benzene exposure is characterized by chromosome breakage, primarily within the euchromatin, and modest increases in aneuploidy. These findings also provide the first direct evidence that benzene is capable of inhibiting the enzymatic activity of topoisomerase II in vivo, providing additional support for the hypothesis that inhibition of topoisomerase II contributes to benzene-induced toxicity and leukemogenesis.","['Eastmond, D A', 'Schuler, M', 'Frantz, C', 'Chen, H', 'Parks, R', 'Wang, L', 'Hasegawa, L']","['Eastmond DA', 'Schuler M', 'Frantz C', 'Chen H', 'Parks R', 'Wang L', 'Hasegawa L']","['Environmental Toxicology Program, University of California, Riverside, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Res Rep Health Eff Inst,Research report (Health Effects Institute),8812230,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Benzene/*adverse effects', 'Carcinogens/*adverse effects', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*chemically induced', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Topoisomerases, Type II/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Euchromatin', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Lymphocytes', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', '*Occupational Exposure', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics']",2001/08/16 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Res Rep Health Eff Inst. 2001 Jun;(103):1-68; discussion 69-80.,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Euchromatin)', 'EC 5.99.1.3 (DNA Topoisomerases, Type II)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the sensitivity of leukaemias to chemotherapy and irradiation, conventional conditioning before SCT is limited by significant organ toxicity. Targeted irradiation of bone marrow and spleen by radioimmunotherapy may provide considerable dose escalation, with limited toxicity to non-target organs. In this study, 27 patients with high-risk or relapsing leukaemia were treated with rhenium-188-labelled CD66a,b,c,e radioimmunoconjugates (188Re-mAb) specific for normal bone marrow in addition to conventional conditioning with high-dose chemotherapy and 12 Gy total body irradiation prior to SCT. A mean activity of 10.2+/-2.1 (range 6.9-15.8) GBq 188Re-mAb was administered intravenously. Acute side-effects were assessed according to the CTC classification and patient outcome was determined. Mean radiation doses (Gy; range in parentheses) to relevant organs and whole body were as follows: 13.1 (6.5-22) to bone marrow, 11.6 (1.7-31.1) to spleen, 5.0 (2.0-11.7) to liver, 7.0 (2.3-11.6) to kidneys, 0.7 (0.3-1.3) to lungs and 1.4 (0.8-2.1) to the whole body. Stem cells engrafted in all patients within 9-18 days post SCT. Acute organ toxicity of grade II or less was observed. During follow-up for 25.4+/-5.3 (range 18-34) months, 4/27 (15%) patients died from relapse, and 9/27 (33%) from transplantation-related complications. Fourteen patients (52%) are still alive and in ongoing complete clinical remission. Radioimmunotherapy with the bone marrow-seeking 188Re-labelled CD66 mAb can double the dose to bone marrow and spleen without undue extramedullary acute organ toxicity, when given in addition to high-dose chemotherapy and 12 Gy TBI before allogeneic SCT.

Although acquisition of IL-2-independent growth has been correlated with activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs), the precise mechanism of IL-2-independent growth is unknown.

Furthermore, MT2 cells treated with Gfi-1 antisense oligonucleotide had reduced [3H]thymidine uptake compared with MT2 cells treated with Gfi-1 sense oligonucleotide.

We studied the expression of this molecule on the leukocytes of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs) in an effort to detect acquired deficiencies of this molecule. We used immunofluorescence flow cytometry in analyzing whole blood and isolated neutrophils from 49 MDS patients, 33 men and 16 women aged 33 to 85 years (median, 75 years), and 18 healthy individuals aged 35 to 80 years (median, 72 years). According to French-American-British classification criteria, 13 patients had refractory anemia, 18 had refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts, 9 had refractory anemia with excess of blasts, 4 had refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation to acute leukemia, and 5 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. We found decreased expression of CD43 on the neutrophils of these patients, and we correlated this finding with the activation status of these cells as it is defined by their phenotypes. We studied the expression of CD11b, CD18, CD35, CD67, CD69, CD44, and CD53 molecules known to be changed in the activated form of neutrophils. CD43 expression correlated positively with CD53 and CD44 expression and negatively with CD11b, CD18, CD35, CD67, and CD69 expression. Additionally, increased levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecules were detected in these patients, suggesting endothelial cell activation. In conclusion, we believe that the decreased expression of CD43 on the neutrophils of MDS patients is associated with activation of these cells and is probably due to cleavage of the molecule from the cell surface and that the same mechanism is possibly responsible for the parallel down-regulation of CD44 and CD53.","['Kyriakou, Despina', 'Alexandrakis, Michael G', 'Kyriakou, Elias S', 'Liapi, Dimitra', 'Kourelis, Taxiarchis V', 'Mavromanolakis, M', 'Vlachonikolis, Ioannis', 'Eliakis, Polyvios']","['Kyriakou D', 'Alexandrakis MG', 'Kyriakou ES', 'Liapi D', 'Kourelis TV', 'Mavromanolakis M', 'Vlachonikolis I', 'Eliakis P']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Herakleion, Crete, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Herakleion, Crete, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Venizelion Hospital of Herakleion, Crete, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Venizelion Hospital of Herakleion, Crete, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital of Herakleion, Crete, Greece.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Medical School, University of Crete, Crete, Greece.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Medical School, University of Crete, Crete, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Venizelion Hospital of Herakleion, Crete, Greece.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Antigens, CD', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infections/etiology', 'Leukosialin', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*blood/complications', 'Neutrophil Activation', 'Neutrophils/immunology/*metabolism', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*metabolism']",2001/08/16 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/BF02994011 [pii]', '10.1007/BF02994011 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Jun;73(4):483-491. doi: 10.1007/BF02994011.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/BF02994011 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have developed a novel strategy for targeted gene transfer into HIV-1-infected cells based on 2-step gene transfer. The first step involves the stable introduction of the HIV vector containing the ecotropic Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) receptor gene (EcoRec) into human CD4+ T cells as a molecular switch. Because the HIV-long terminal repeat (HIV-LTR) is Tat inducible, it is expected that EcoRec is expressed only after HIV-1 infection. Northern blot analysis and a retrovirus binding assay confirmed that the HIV-LTR of the integrated vector was silent in transduced cells but strongly transactivated in HIV-1 infection. High levels of EcoRec expression were observed only in HIV-1-infected cells. These cells became highly susceptible to ecotropic MMLV infection and, therefore, in the second step, HIV-1-infected cells were selectively transduced with ecotropic MMLV vectors. More than 70% of HIV-1-infected cells were transduced by this strategy. These findings indicate that this 2-step method can be used for selective and stable gene transfer into HIV-1-infected cells.","['Sakai, Noriyasu', 'Miyake, Koichi', 'Suzuki, Noriko', 'Shimada, Takashi']","['Sakai N', 'Miyake K', 'Suzuki N', 'Shimada T']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Advanced Medical Technology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Dermatology;Center for Advanced Medical Technology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Advanced Medical Technology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Therapy Research, Center for Advanced Medical Technology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Advanced Medical Technology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Division of Gene Therapy Research, Center for Advanced Medical Technology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Center for Advanced Medical Technology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan. tshimada@nms.ac.jp.', 'Division of Gene Therapy Research, Center for Advanced Medical Technology, Nippon Medical School, Tokyo, Japan. tshimada@nms.ac.jp.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Nippon Medical School, 1-1-5 Sendagi, Bunkyo-ku, 113-8602, Tokyo, Japan. tshimada@nms.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Genetic Vectors', 'HIV Infections/therapy', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism/*virology', 'Transduction, Genetic/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/16 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/BF02994010 [pii]', '10.1007/BF02994010 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Jun;73(4):476-482. doi: 10.1007/BF02994010.,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/BF02994010 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it is accepted that MDS is a clonal disorder, the exact nature of the involvement of multipotent stem cells and progenitor cells has not been resolved. Most clonality studies of MDS support the proposal that the primary neoplastic event occurs, in most patients, at the level of a committed myeloid progenitor cell, capable of differentiation into multiple myeloid lineages. The extent of the involvement of T and B lymphocytes in MDS remains controversial. Much of the variation reported may result from disease heterogeneity and technical issues such as skewed methylation patterns occurring in studies analyzing X-chromosome inactivation patterns (XCIP) and possible impurities in lymphocyte preparation. A great deal of the evidence in support of T-lymphocyte involvement in MDS has been generated by XCIP studies, and some of these data need to be treated with caution, especially data from studies in which appropriate controls were omitted. In contrast, B-lymphocyte involvement in some patients with MDS is based on studies using more robust technology including combined immunophenotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Clonality studies involving myeloid and lymphoid cells in MDS have yielded discrepant results with regard to the potential involvement of multipotent (lympho-myeloid) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). However, failure to detect a clonal marker in all cells of all lineages does not preclude multipotent-HSC involvement. Some recent studies have produced compelling evidence to show that, in some patients with MDS, the multipotent HSC is the target of the primary neoplastic event. It now seems probable that MDS arises in multipotent HSCs more commonly than previously recognized. Such data not only provide important new insights into the biology of MDS but also may have therapeutic implications. The determination of whether multipotent HSCs are involved in the MDS clone may be important for the use of autologous stem cell transplantation in these patients.","['Boultwood, Jacqueline', 'Wainscoat, James S']","['Boultwood J', 'Wainscoat JS']","['Leukaemia Research Fund Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK. jboultwo@enterprise.molbiol.ox.ac.uk.', 'Leukaemia Research Fund Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,IM,"['Cell Lineage', 'Clone Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Myeloid Cells/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells']",2001/08/16 10:00,2002/09/13 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/09/13 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/BF02994002 [pii]', '10.1007/BF02994002 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2001 Jun;73(4):411-415. doi: 10.1007/BF02994002.,,49,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/BF02994002 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,

Effective induction as well as maintenance therapy for APL can be achieved using this combination of anti-leukaemic agents. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four consecutive patients with newly-diagnosed APL were treated with ATRA daily together with either daunorubicin or idarubicin. Therapy with ATRA was continued until complete remission (CR) was achieved; thereafter, patients were treated with 2 cycles of an anthracycline-based consolidation chemotherapy (either daunorubicin or idarubicin). Maintenance therapy was achieved using 5 alternating cycles of low-dose methotrexate (MTX) plus 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) followed by ATRA alone. RESULTS: Twenty-three out of 24 patients (96%) completed induction therapy and achieved haematological CR (HCR) as well as molecular remission (MR); however, 1 patient (5%) died from retinoic acid syndrome. Twenty-one out of 23 evaluable patients (91%) completed consolidation chemotherapy, and 2 patients (10%) died, 1 from neutropenic sepsis and the other from relapse following non-compliance to therapy. All 21 surviving patients in the present study received maintenance chemotherapy and are still in HCR and MR at a median follow-up of 23 months. The estimated actuarial 2-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) rates were both 84% +/- 9%. CONCLUSION: The combination of ATRA with an anthracycline is an effective remission-induction therapy for newly-diagnosed APL. Maintenance therapy using alternating cycles of MTX plus 6MP followed by ATRA alone is effective in maintaining CR and MR as well as prolonging the survival of patients with APL.","['Koh, L P', 'Goh, Y T', 'Teoh, G', 'Tan, P']","['Koh LP', 'Goh YT', 'Teoh G', 'Tan P']","['Department of Haematology, Singapore General Hospital, 1 Hospital Drive, Singapore 169608.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Ann Acad Med Singap,"Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",7503289,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/therapeutic use', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",2001/08/16 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Acad Med Singap. 2001 Jul;30(4):401-8.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, only angiomyolipoma can be recognised preoperatively from results of the graphical examination. Other types can be recognised only on the bases of histological examination. Completely benign tumor is oncocytoma (it represents about 5% of all kidney tumors). Angiomyolipoma (2%) is also benign, though some case reports describing its malign transformation has been published. Angiomyolipoma under 4 cm can be only monitored, the larger tumors should be resected or selectively embolised the arterial blood supply to prevent spontaneous rupture. From the group of benign tumors only cystic nephroma can be diagnosed more often (up to 1%). One of the criteria for diagnosing the renal cortical adenoma is its size under 5 mm. That is why any adenoma, which could be diagnosed by means of graphical examination and therefore clinically significant does not exist. Most of tumors are malign epithelial tumors--renal carcinomas (RC). The are classified according Heidelberg classification into 5 elementary types: clear cell, papillary, chromophobe, originating form collecting ducts and not classifiable. Clear cell (conventional) renal carcinoma (CRC) comes most often (70 to 80%), its malign potential rise with increased size of tumor and with the gradient. Five-year survival is achieved in 30-50%. Granular form of CRC carcinoma (7% of all CRC) is the equivalent of poorly differentiated PRC and it has an adverse prognosis. In contrary, the cystic form of CRC (about 6%) in benign. Papillary form of RC has the five-year survival in 84%, malignant are only tumors poorly differentiated. These are tumors with extensive necroses, which brings a fragile consistency and they can be distinguished by graphical examination. Chromophobe type of RC (5%) has the five-year survival in 90%. Poor prognosis has its sarcomatoid form, which can originate from any RC, but most frequently it is derived from the chromophobe type. The form originating from collecting ducts is highly infrequent and very malignant with the five-year survival in 20% only. The unclassified form of RC (3-5%) includes tumors not suiting to the criteria of the previous RC. Other primary renal malignant tumors (sarcomas, Wilms' tumor of adults, medullar carcinoma, carcinoid) are very rare. Comparatively frequent are metastases of other tumors (namely that of lung carcinoma) and renal impairment in leukemia, which are complication not often met by urologist.","['Hora, M', 'Hes, O', 'Michal, M']","['Hora M', 'Hes O', 'Michal M']","['Urologicka klinika LF UK a FN, Plzen. horam@fnplzen.cz']",['cze'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Czech Republic,Cas Lek Cesk,Casopis lekaru ceskych,0004743,IM,"['Adult', 'Humans', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*classification/diagnosis/pathology']",2001/08/16 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/16 10:00'],"['2001/08/16 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/16 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cas Lek Cesk. 2001 Jun 21;140(12):364-9.,,37,,,,Histologicke deleni nadoru ledvin dospelych pro klinickou praxi.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The primary aim of the present study was to quantify the effect of dexamethasone and prednisone treatment on energy intake in children treated for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A secondary aim was to test for differences in excess weight gain between patients treated using the 2 glucocorticoids. We measured energy intake in 26 patients (mean +/- SD age, 6.3 +/- 2.3 yr) during a 5-d period ""on"" steroids and again in the week before steroid treatment. Changes in body mass index from diagnosis to 1 and 2 yr postdiagnosis were expressed as SD scores. Steroid treatment was associated with a significant increase in energy intake of approximately 20% (mean paired difference, 1.7 MJ/d; SD, 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 0.7-2.8 MJ/d), with no significant difference between the 2 steroids. The mean change in body mass index SD score was +0.38 (SD, 1.10; P < 0.05) to 1 yr and +0.68 (SD, 1.38; P < 0.05) to 2 yr, with no significant difference between the 2 groups of patients.

To date, two serine/threonine protein phosphatases, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), have been demonstrated to function as ceramide-activated protein phosphatases. In this study, we show that treatment with either anti-FAS IgM (CH-11) (150 ng/ml) or exogenous d-(e)-C(6-)ceramide (20 microm) induces the dephosphorylation of the PP1 substrates, serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins, in Jurkat acute leukemia T-cells. The serine/threonine protein phosphatase inhibitor, calyculin A, but not the PP2A-specific inhibitor, okadaic acid, inhibited both FAS- and ceramide-induced dephosphorylation of SR proteins. Anti-FAS IgM treatment of Jurkat cells led to a significant increase in levels of endogenous ceramide beginning at 2 h with a maximal increase of 10-fold after 7 h. A 2-h pretreatment of Jurkat cells with fumonisin B(1) (100 microm), a specific inhibitor of CoA-dependent ceramide synthase, blocked 80% of the ceramide generated and completely inhibited the dephosphorylation of SR proteins in response to anti-FAS IgM. Moreover, pretreatment of Jurkat cells with myriocin, a specific inhibitor of serine-palmitoyl transferase (the first step in de novo synthesis of ceramide), also blocked FAS-induced SR protein dephosphorylation, thus demonstrating a role for de novo ceramide. These results were further supported using A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells treated with d-(e)-C(6-)ceramide. Dephosphorylation of SR proteins was inhibited by fumonisin B(1) and by overexpression of glucosylceramide synthase; again implicating endogenous ceramide generated de novo in regulating the dephosphorylation of SR proteins in response to FAS activation. These results establish a specific intracellular pathway involving both de novo ceramide generation and activation of PP1 to mediate the effects of FAS activation on SR proteins.","['Chalfant, C E', 'Ogretmen, B', 'Galadari, S', 'Kroesen, B J', 'Pettus, B J', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Chalfant CE', 'Ogretmen B', 'Galadari S', 'Kroesen BJ', 'Pettus BJ', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina 29425, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Carboxylic Acids/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Ceramides/*biosynthesis', 'Diacylglycerol Kinase/metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', '*Fumonisins', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Palmitic Acid/metabolism', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Phosphatase 1', 'Protein Phosphatase 2', 'Sarcoplasmic Reticulum/*metabolism', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Sphingolipids/metabolism', 'Threonine/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2001/08/15 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/08/15 10:00'],"['2001/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M106291200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)82687-X [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Nov 30;276(48):44848-55. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M106291200.

Our group ""Policentric Study Group on Immunological Markers"", is composed of 40 laboratories. Its aim, over recent years, has been to find a standardized way of immunophenotypic analysis applicable to various hematological diseases. The objective of this study is to contribute to the debate concerning standardization of monoclonal antibody panels and immunophenotypic analysis procedures in acute leukemia (AL) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), with the following targets: to improve interlaboratory reproducibility of the immunophenotyping data, and interpretative results; to study, with improved feasibility, correlation between immunophenotype and clinical or biological findings on a large number of AL and MDS cases; to verify the utility of the proposed monoclonal antibody panels for proper AL and MDS classification, and to detect minimal residual disease. In the field of AL and MDS our experience is based on about 1800 and 700 cases respectively analyzed over the last five years. Starting from these experiences and data of the literature we have elaborated the proposed panels of monoclonal antibodies and the methods of analysis. We have suggested a standardized immunophenotypic approach to study AL and MDS. In particular our work has focused on the gating strategy. This aims at drawing a gate of analysis having high purity and recovery, and on the choice of monoclonal antibody combinations for multiparametric analysis, particularly the normal antigen expression on each step of lineage differentiation or their clinically relevant aberrant expressions. A standardized criteria has become a necessary starting point in any kind of analytical process.

However, CRs induced by ATRA are usually brief, and resistance to the therapy rapidly develops, leading to relapses in almost every patient; thus limiting the use of ATRA as a single agent. On the basis of clinical and in vitro studies, the following mechanisms have been proposed to explain ATRA resistance: 1) induction of accelerated metabolism of ATRA, 2) increased expression of cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABPs), 3) constitutive degradation of PML-RAR alpha, 4) point mutations in the ligand-binding domain of RAR alpha of PML-RAR alpha, 5) P-glycoprotein expression, 6) transcriptional repression by histone deacetylase activity, 7) isoforms of PML-RAR alpha, 8) persistent telomerase activity, and 9) expression of type II transglutaminase.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: In order to compare the false positive rate, normal peripheral blood samples from five volunteers were analyzed by both methods. A model set of peripheral blood containing tumor cells was established by adding SNUC4 human colon cancer cells to peripheral blood collected from normal volunteers not showing any nonspecific bands upon electrophoresis of the PCR products. RT-PCR amplification of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) mRNA was done with total RNA and mRNA prepared from this model sample. In immunobead RT-PCR analysis, mRNA was prepared from the cells isolated with anti-CEA antibody-coated magnetic beads or anti-Ber-EP4 antibody-coated magnetic beads before the RT-PCR analysis. RESULT: The immunobead RT-PCR yielded no non-specific band, while the regular RT-PCR using total RNA did show non-specific band formation in all five samples. When mRNA rather than total RNA was used, nonspecific bands were formed in three of the five samples. Immunobead RT-PCR allowed the detection of 10(1) tumor cells in 1 ml of peripheral blood. The regular RT-PCR analysis had a detection limit of 10(2) tumor cells in 1 ml of peripheral blood. CONCLUSION: The immunobead RT-PCR proved to be more sensitive and specific than the regular RT-PCR at least in our model system.","['Park, S', 'Lee, B', 'Kim, I', 'Choi, I', 'Hong, K', 'Ryu, Y', 'Rhim, J', 'Shin, J', 'Park, S C', 'Chung, H', 'Chung, J']","['Park S', 'Lee B', 'Kim I', 'Choi I', 'Hong K', 'Ryu Y', 'Rhim J', 'Shin J', 'Park SC', 'Chung H', 'Chung J']","['Department of Biochemistry, Dongguk University School of Medicine, Kyung-Buk, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Carcinoembryonic Antigen/blood/*genetics', 'Humans', '*Immunomagnetic Separation/methods', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/genetics/*immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/*blood', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Stomach Neoplasms/genetics/*immunology']",2001/08/15 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/08/15 10:00'],"['2001/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s004320100239 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 2001 Aug;127(8):489-94. doi: 10.1007/s004320100239.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Carcinoembryonic Antigen)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we quantified the level of WT1 mRNA in the peripheral blood and bone marrow of patients with acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) at initial onset, remission and recurrence by the use of nucleic acid sequence based amplification (NASBA), and then ascertained the clinical usefulness of this method. At initial onset, the level of WT1 mRNA in the peripheral blood was above 10(3) copies/microgram and that in the bone marrow was above 10(4) copies/microgram. The level of WT1 mRNA was decreased in cases where therapy resulted in complete remission, but it was abnormally high in recurring cases. In AML (M3) patients, the relationship between the level of WT1 mRNA and the expression of the PML-retinoic acid alpha receptor (RAR alpha) gene, assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), was investigated. When leukemia was in remission hematologically, the PML-RAR alpha gene was negative and the level of WT1 mRNA decreased. These findings suggest that the quantification of WT1 gene expression by competitive NASBA is useful in assessing therapeutic effects and detecting MRD.","['Fukahori, S']",['Fukahori S'],"['Department of Medicine, Kurume University School of Medicine, Kurume 830-0011, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Kurume Med J,The Kurume medical journal,2985210R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', '*Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'WT1 Proteins']",2001/08/15 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/15 10:00'],"['2001/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2739/kurumemedj.48.129 [doi]'],ppublish,Kurume Med J. 2001;48(2):129-34. doi: 10.2739/kurumemedj.48.129.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (WT1 Proteins)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Apoptosis of HL-60 cells was induced by camptothecin (1 mg/L) for 2, 4, and 6 h. Apoptosis was determined by agarose electrophoresis and flow cytometry analysis. To assess telomerase activity, a PCR-based telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay (TRAP) was used. RT-PCR was performed to examine the mRNA levels of hTR (human telomerase RNA component), hEST2/hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase), TLP1/TP1 (telomerase association protein 1), and bcl-2 (B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 gene) in HL-60 cells before and after camptothecin treatment. RESULTS: Telomerase activity was decreased in a time-dependent manner during the camptothecin induced apoptosis of HL-60 cells. However, no difference in expression of each telomerase subunit was detected, while expression of bcl-2 was progressively down-regulated. CONCLUSION: These lines of evidences indicated that down-regulation of the telomerase activity in HL-60 cells was closely related to camptothecin-induced apoptosis, and the telomerase activity was not blocked at the transcriptional levels of the genes of the known ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex components. We also found that bcl-2 did not regulate the mRNA expressions of telomerase subunits directly.","['Jiang, J F', 'Liu, W J', 'Ding, J']","['Jiang JF', 'Liu WJ', 'Ding J']","['Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,IM,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Camptothecin/pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation', 'Genes, bcl-2', 'HL-60 Cells/enzymology/pathology', 'Humans', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Telomerase/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism']",2001/08/15 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/08/15 10:00'],"['2001/08/15 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/15 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2000 Aug;21(8):759-64.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)', 'XT3Z54Z28A (Camptothecin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RESULTS: Rg1 and Rh1 (at concentration of 0.1, 1, 10, 100 mg/L) had no effect on PBMC proliferation. Rh1 1 mg/L could upregulate the productions of TNF (and IL-8 induced by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) 10 mg/L plus phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) 200 nmol/L, however, Rg1 showed an inhibitory effect on TNF alpha production induced by LPS 100 mg/L. Rg1 1 mg/L and Rh1 100 mg/L enhanced the production of IL-1 alpha level in THP-1 cells in the presence of LPS 10 mg/L.

This article describes the further characterization of the interaction between human IgM and mouse Ig molecules and subunits. Mouse Ig molecules of both kappa and lambda light chain classes bound to the B-CLL cell surface. The dissociation constant for the interaction of mouse IgG1 (K121) with the B-CLL cell surface was 3.6 x 10(-7) M. To confirm the involvement of the human IgM expressed by the B-CLL cells in the interaction, the malignant cells were stimulated in vitro to induce secretion of human IgM. Enzyme immunoassay was used to show that secreted human IgM bound to intact mouse Ig, as occurred with the cell surface analysis. The mouse Ig epitope recognized by the purified secreted human IgM was shown by Western blot analysis to be located on the light chain of the mouse Ig molecule and to be conformationally dependent. K121 light chain was cloned and expressed in E. coli and the recombinant light chain bound to the surface of CLL B cells.

METHODS: Four protocols for degenerate oligonucleotide primed polymerase chain reaction (DOP-PCR) and fluorescence labeling were applied to test DNA from normal and K-562 cells. The DNA products were used for CGH analysis. RESULTS: The DOP-PCR-amplified DNA from each protocol produced hybridizations with different qualities. These could be seen primarily as differences in background staining and signal-to-noise ratios, but also as characteristic deviations of normal/normal hybridizations. One DOP-PCR-protocol was further investigated. We observed concordance between CGH results using unamplified and DOP-PCR-amplified DNA. An example of an analysis of an invasive carcinoma of the breast supports the practical value of this approach. CONCLUSIONS: DOP-PCR-amplified DNA is applicable for high- resolution CGH, the results being similar to those of CGH using unamplified DNA.","['Larsen, J', 'Ottesen, A M', 'Lundsteen, C', 'Leffers, H', 'Larsen, J K']","['Larsen J', 'Ottesen AM', 'Lundsteen C', 'Leffers H', 'Larsen JK']","['Finsen Laboratory, Finsen Center, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. jacob.larsen@finsenlab.dk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/genetics', 'DNA Primers/*genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques/methods/*standards', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization/genetics/*methods', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/*methods', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/14 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/08/14 10:00'],"['2001/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1097-0320(20010801)44:4<317::AID-CYTO1123>3.0.CO;2-5 [pii]', '10.1002/1097-0320(20010801)44:4<317::aid-cyto1123>3.0.co;2-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 2001 Aug 1;44(4):317-25. doi: 10.1002/1097-0320(20010801)44:4<317::aid-cyto1123>3.0.co;2-5.,"['0 (DNA Primers)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The cumuli oophorus were obtained from women who had taken part in an in vitro fertilization program and were suffering from blocked fallopian tubes. Both macrophages and CD4(+) T cells were detected in all cumuli. CD4(+) T cell clones, generated from T cells of these cumuli, showed higher potential to produce IL-4 and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) than CD4(+) T cell clones generated from peripheral blood or ovary specimens from the same women. More importantly, IL-4 and LIF, but not IFN-gamma mRNA was found to be constitutively expressed in vivo by cumulus oophorus cells. Progesterone is highly produced by the cumulus oophorus/oocyte complex. We recently showed that progesterone up-regulates the production of LIF by T cells and that the progesterone-induced LIF production is mediated by IL-4. Progesterone produced by cumulus granulosa cells may favor IL-4 production by T cells, which in turn can produce LIF. As the treatment with LIF enhances the in vitro growth and development of mammalian embryos, our data suggest that T cells present in the cumulus oophorus produce cytokines that may provide a microenvironment suitable for pre-implantation development of the mammalian embryo.","['Piccinni, M P', 'Scaletti, C', 'Mavilia, C', 'Lazzeri, E', 'Romagnani, P', 'Natali, I', 'Pellegrini, S', 'Livi, C', 'Romagnani, S', 'Maggi, E']","['Piccinni MP', 'Scaletti C', 'Mavilia C', 'Lazzeri E', 'Romagnani P', 'Natali I', 'Pellegrini S', 'Livi C', 'Romagnani S', 'Maggi E']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Immunoallergology and Respiratory Diseases, University of Florence, Florence, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['Adult', 'Blastocyst/cytology/immunology/*physiology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Gene Expression', 'Growth Inhibitors/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics', 'Interleukin-4/biosynthesis/genetics', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Oocytes/*cytology/*immunology', 'Ovary/cytology/immunology', 'Pregnancy', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism']",2001/08/14 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/14 10:00'],"['2001/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/1521-4141(200108)31:8<2431::AID-IMMU2431>3.0.CO;2-U [pii]', '10.1002/1521-4141(200108)31:8<2431::aid-immu2431>3.0.co;2-u [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2001 Aug;31(8):2431-7. doi: 10.1002/1521-4141(200108)31:8<2431::aid-immu2431>3.0.co;2-u.,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biochemical functions of PML bodies are unknown, despite their involvement in several human disorders. We demonstrate that eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) directly binds the PML RING, a domain required for association with bodies and for suppression of transformation. Nuclear eIF4E functions in nucleocytoplasmic transport of a subset of transcripts including Cyclin D1. Present studies indicate that some PML requires the evolutionarily older eIF4E protein for association with nuclear bodies. Further more, PML RING modulates eIF4E activity by drastically reducing its affinity for its substrate, 5' m(7)G cap of mRNA. We demonstrate that eIF4E requires cap binding for transport of Cyclin D1 mRNA and subsequent transformation activity.

The therapeutic results for patients older than 60 years accrued into clinical trials of intensive chemotherapy are largely unsatisfactory (complete remission rates rarely superior to 50-60%; median relapse-free survival usually less than 12 months). Because only 30-40% of elderly patients are actually entered into these trials, the overall failure of current treatments appear even more disappointing when considered in the context of the whole population of older individuals with AML. This appears primarily due to intrinsic differences in the biology of leukemia itself and to host-related factors (i.e. reduced tolerance to chemotherapy and comorbidity). AMLs of older subjects display several biological overlaps with secondary AMLs including multilineage involvement, phenotype, unfavorable cytogenetics and elevated activity of multidrug resistance genes. The clinical application of biologically-based prognostic factors may enable to separate patients who may actually benefit from aggressive chemotherapy from those who should be offered attenuated/palliative treatments or enrolled upfront into experimental trials of new drugs or biologic/immunologic treatments. This may hopefully result in a 'risk-adapted' strategy aimed at improving disease free survival and/or quality of life for patients with differing risk profiles.","['Pinto, A', 'Zagonel, V', 'Ferrara, F']","['Pinto A', 'Zagonel V', 'Ferrara F']","['Department of Medical Oncology, Developmental Oncology/Hematology and Leukemia Unit, Centro di Riferimento Oncologico, IRCCS, Via Pedemontana Occidentale 12, I-33081, Aviano, Italy. apinto@ets.it']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/physiopathology/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Failure']",2001/08/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/14 10:00'],"['2001/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['S1040-8428(00)00122-0 [pii]', '10.1016/s1040-8428(00)00122-0 [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 2001 Sep;39(3):275-87. doi: 10.1016/s1040-8428(00)00122-0.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],130,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TPO signalling, which is mediated by its receptor Mpl, includes Janus kinase, (JAK) signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and Shc/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The precise nature of these signalling routes has not been clarified in detail up until now. We investigated the effect of TPO on activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and its involvement in MAPK signalling in human megakaryoblastic leukaemia CMK cells. For estimation of PKA activity, phosphorylation of a PKA-specific peptide substrate was assayed in CMK cell lysates. Since activation of PKA is associated with translocation of its catalytic subunit alpha (C-PKA) into the cell nucleus, Western blot analysis of nuclear fractions with an anti-C-PKA antibody was additionally performed. The activation of TPO-induced MAPK activation and the effect of the PKA inhibitor H-89 was measured using immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-pERK antibody. TPO enhanced cAMP and induced activation of PKA in CMK cells. In addition, H-89 partly blocked TPO-induced MAPK activation in CMK cells. Our results indicate a novel TPO-triggered signalling event, activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway in human megakaryoblastic CMK cells. This signal transduction route seems to be involved in TPO-induced MAPK signaling.","['Sauer, M', 'Tausch, S', 'Zieger, M', 'Zintl, F', 'Nowak, G', 'Kaufmann, R']","['Sauer M', 'Tausch S', 'Zieger M', 'Zintl F', 'Nowak G', 'Kaufmann R']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Medical School, University of Minnesota, MN, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP/agonists/*metabolism', 'Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Transport/drug effects/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology', '*Sulfonamides', 'Thrombopoietin/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",2001/08/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/14 10:00'],"['2001/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/cyto.2001.0885 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(01)90885-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2001 Jul 21;15(2):75-9. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2001.0885.,"['0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '9014-42-0 (Thrombopoietin)', 'E0399OZS9N (Cyclic AMP)', 'EC 2.7.11.11 (Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'M876330O56 (N-(2-(4-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The level of telomerase activity in normal BM cells was used as a background level. Nine of the 12 cases of ML had higher levels of activity than that of the normal BM cells and therefore they were scored as ML with positive telomerase. The other three cases were considered as ML with negative telomerase because the levels of the enzyme were equivalent to that of normal BM cells. The data indicate that cellular differentiation may suppress telomerase activity in mouse ML cells. In summary, the results suggest that the CBA/Ca mouse model should be a useful animal system for future studies on the assessment of telomerase activity in both malignant and normal hematopoietic cells.","['Rithidech, K', 'Gordon, C R', 'Cronkite, E P']","['Rithidech K', 'Gordon CR', 'Cronkite EP']","['Pathology Department, State University of New York at Stony Brook, Stony Brook, New York 11794-8691, USA. krithidech@notes.cc.sunysb.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Telomerase/genetics/*metabolism']",2001/08/14 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/14 10:00'],"['2001/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bcmd.2001.0412 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(01)90412-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2001 Mar-Apr;27(2):496-504. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2001.0412.,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Upon inducing expression of MEnT, transfected cells enter a differentiation program and begin to produce alpha-globin mRNA, assemble hemoglobin, and stop proliferating. Differential display was used to compare mRNA expression between parental C19 MEL cells induced to differentiate with hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) and stable transfectants induced to differentiate via expression of MEnT to identify potential Myb target promoters.

Data have been reported to Eurocord by many transplant centers. Close links have been established with cord blood banks through Netcord. BMT data have been provided by transplant centers and also by the European Blood and Marrow Transplant (EBMT) and International Bone Marrow Transplant Registries (IBMTR). Eurocord has analyzed the outcome of unrelated UCBT from 121 transplant centers and 29 countries. The results have shown that survival with unrelated mismatched UCBT was comparable to that with unrelated BMT. Engraftment with cord blood was delayed, resulting in an increased incidence of early transplant complications. The incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) was reduced with cord blood grafts even in HLA mismatched transplants and in adults. In patients with leukemia, the rate of relapse was similar to that after BMT. The overall event-free survival with UCBT was not statistically different when compared to BMT.

CONCLUSION: MK antigen positive AML might derived from malignant transformation of hemotopoietic stem cell at earlier stage and the detection of MK expression was of values in predicting treatment effect and prognosis for adult AML.","['Hua, D', 'Li, J', 'Xia, X']","['Hua D', 'Li J', 'Xia X']","['First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou Medical College, Suzhou 215006.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD34/biosynthesis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex/*biosynthesis', 'Prognosis']",2001/08/14 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/14 10:00'],"['2001/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 1999 Jan;20(1):21-3.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Platelet Glycoprotein GPIb-IX Complex)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: MEL cells were induced with 1.5% DMSO.

TfR mRNA level increased with cell proliferation in non-induced MEL cells, while in the induced MEL cells, although the proliferating capacity was losing with cell maturation, TfR mRNA level increased with hemoglobin synthesis and its amplitude was higher than that in non-induced cells. 2. In both non-induced and induced MEL cells, TfR mRNA levels increased when intracellular iron level decreased; and vice versa. 3. Stimulation of erythropoiesis by Epo increased the expression of TfR mRNA, indicating that its expression in erythroid cells was regulated by the level of intracellular iron and the synthesis of heme. 4. The expression of ferrochelatase mRNA had no change in non-induced MEL cells, but increased significantly in induced MEL cells. 5. The level of intracellular iron in non-induced and induced MEL cells had less effects on the expression of ferrochelatase mRNA.","['Wang, W', 'Li, R', 'Chen, J']","['Wang W', 'Li R', 'Chen J']","['Department of Hematology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing 100730.']",['chi'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",China,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi,8212398,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Ferrochelatase/*biosynthesis/genetics', '*Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transferrin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/14 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/14 10:00'],"['2001/08/14 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/14 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Zhonghua Xue Ye Xue Za Zhi. 1999 Jan;20(1):17-20.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: The effects of novel retinoids with IFN-gamma on the differentiation and clonal proliferation of fresh leukemia cell from 6 monocytic leukemia patients were studied in vitro. Cell morphological examination, nitro tetrazolium blue reduction test and DCE, expression of CD14 and CD68 and CFU-L were used in the study. RESULTS: The primary leukemia cell, cultured with the combination of YS 904012 and IFN-gamma, became more mature in morphology. The NBT reduction rate and DCE were increased from 23.4% and 25.0% to 61.5% and 52.0%, respectively. The expression of CD14 and CD68 was increased. The growth of the leukemic colony in semi-solid culture was markedly inhibited. The activity of YS 904012 combined with IFN-gamma in inhibiting proliferation and inducing differentiation of monoblast was greater than that of R9158 or all-trans retinoic acid in combination with IFN-gamma (P < 0.01).

To establish a functional role for c-Myc in GC-mediated apoptosis, we have stably expressed MycER(TM), the human c-Myc protein fused to the modified ligand-binding domain of the murine estrogen receptor alpha, in GC-sensitive CEM-C7-14 cells. In CEM-C7-14 cells, MycER(TM) constitutively imparts c-Myc functions. Cells expressing MycER(TM) (C7-MycER(TM)) exhibited a marked reduction in cell death after 72 h in 100 nM dexamethasone (Dex), with 10-20-fold more viable cells when compared to the parental CEM-C7-14 clone. General GC responsiveness was not compromised, as evidenced by Dex-mediated suppression of endogenous c-Myc and cyclin D3, and induction of c-Jun and the glucocorticoid receptor. MycER(TM) also blunted Dex-mediated upregulation of p27(kipI) and suppression of the Myc target p53. In comparison to parental CEM-C7-14 cells, Dex-evoked DNA strand breaks were negligible and caspase activation was delayed, but the extent of G1 cell cycle arrest was similar in C7-MycER(TM) cells. Myc-ER(TM) did not result in permanent, complete resistance to GC however, and the GC-treated cells eventually died, indicative of redundant or interactive mechanisms in the GC-evoked lytic response of lymphoid cells. Our results emphasize the importance of c-Myc suppression in GC-evoked apoptosis of CEM-C7-14 cells.","['Medh, R D', 'Wang, A', 'Zhou, F', 'Thompson, E B']","['Medh RD', 'Wang A', 'Zhou F', 'Thompson EB']","['Department of Human Biological Chemistry and Genetics, The University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, TX-77555-0645, USA. rmedh@utmb.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Biopterin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Caspase 3', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Clone Cells', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Estrogen Receptor alpha', 'G1 Phase/drug effects', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Receptors, Estrogen/genetics', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Transcription Factors', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/08/11 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/08/11 10:00'],"['2001/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2001/05/23 00:00 [revised]', '2001/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204680 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Aug 2;20(34):4629-39. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204680.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Estrogen Receptor alpha)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (MAX protein, human)', '0 (Myc associated factor X)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Estrogen)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147604-94-2 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27)', '22150-76-1 (Biopterin)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EGX657432I (sapropterin)']",,"['R01 CA041407/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA041407-14/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '2RO1 CA41047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC2761604,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['NIHMS147627'],

To address this issue a cohort of individuals from 28 families with Li-Fraumeni syndrome, segregating germline TP53 mutations was established. Predicted cancers were estimated by applying age, morphology, site and sex-specific UK cancer statistics to person-years at risk. Observed and predicted cancers were compared and two-sided P-values calculated. Cancer types occurring to excess and showing P-values <0.02, were designated strongly associated with germline TP53 mutations. These were removed from the data and a second round of analyses performed. Cancer types with P-values <0.02 and 0.02-0.05 in the second round analyses were considered moderately and weakly associated respectively. Strongly associated cancers were: breast carcinoma, soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarcoma, brain tumours, adrenocortical carcinoma, Wilms' tumour and phyllodes tumour. Carcinoma of pancreas was moderately associated. Leukaemia and neuroblastoma were weakly associated. Other common carcinomas including lung, colon, bladder, prostate, cervix and ovary did not occur to excess. Although breast carcinoma and sarcomas were numerically most frequent, the greatest increases relative to general population rates were in adrenocortical carcinoma and phyllodes tumour. We conclude that germline TP53 mutations do not simply increase general cancer risk.

Furthermore, proliferative responses of PBMC in the presence of TNF alpha were observed from the BLV-positive, but not BLV-negative sheep. Membrane-bound TNF alpha (mTNF alpha) is thought to be one of the ligands, inducing B-cell activation. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the number of PBMC, that were positive for mTNF alpha expression, was increased in the BLV-positive sheep.

In this study, we demonstrate that IL-6, oncostatin M (OSM) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) upregulate membrane IL-6 receptor alpha (IL-6Ralpha) on OPM-2 myeloma cell line at transcriptional level. In OPM-2 cells, IL-6, OSM and LIF induce both signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT), mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-K) activation. We show that the cytokine-induced upregulation of IL-6Ralpha can be abolished by a janus kinase (JAK)-2 specific inhibitor, i.e. AG490, suggesting an involvement of the JAK/STAT pathway in this process. Finally, IL-6Ralpha upregulation was also inhibited by wortmannin, an inhibitor of the PI 3-kinase pathway. In conclusion, IL-6 can upregulate its own receptor on OPM-2 cells probably through the JAK/STAT and PI 3-kinase pathways.","['Thabard, W', 'Collette, M', 'Mellerin, M P', 'Puthier, D', 'Barille, S', 'Bataille, R', 'Amiot, M']","['Thabard W', 'Collette M', 'Mellerin MP', 'Puthier D', 'Barille S', 'Bataille R', 'Amiot M']","['Institut de Biologie, INSERM U463, 9 quai Moncousu, Nantes cedex 01, 44093, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cytokine,Cytokine,9005353,IM,"['Androstadienes/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Growth Inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Janus Kinase 2', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/metabolism', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism', 'Oncostatin M', 'Peptides/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Receptors, Interleukin-6/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tyrphostins/pharmacology', '*Up-Regulation', 'Wortmannin']",2001/08/11 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/11 10:00'],"['2001/08/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/cyto.2001.0911 [doi]', 'S1043-4666(01)90911-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cytokine. 2001 Jun 21;14(6):352-6. doi: 10.1006/cyto.2001.0911.,"['0 (Androstadienes)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (OSM protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tyrphostins)', '0 (alpha-cyano-(3,4-dihydroxy)-N-benzylcinnamide)', '106956-32-5 (Oncostatin M)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'SJE1IO5E3I (2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'XVA4O219QW (Wortmannin)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Introduction of additional purification steps, however, may result in modulation of the biological properties of immunoglobulins. Since cleavage of the Fab-fragment leads to a significant decrease in half-life, the latter provides information about the integrity of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) molecules. Therefore, a pharmacokinetic study of a novel preparation is required to determine safety and disposition in the target population. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and 12 with multiple myeloma received intravenous infusions of IVIG containing antibodies against hepatitis B virus (anti-HBs; n= 15; 8960 IU), cytomegalovirus (anti-CMV; n = 9; 14,250 U) or varizella-zoster-virus (anti-VZV; n = 15; 6000 IU), respectively. Serum concentrations of viral antibodies were determined for 71 days during and after infusion. RESULTS: Maximum serum concentrations of anti-HBs, anti-CMV and anti-VZV were observed at about 4 h (median) after start of the infusion. Total body clearances came to 0.14 +/- 0.08 ml/min (anti-HBs), 0.10 +/- 0.02 ml/ min (anti-CMV) and 0.14 +/- 0.07 ml/min (anti-VZV). The terminal elimination half-lives were determined to be 25.34 +/- 8.34 days (anti-HBs), 24.66 7.28 days (anti-CMV) and 31.79 +/- 12.47 days (anti-VZV). Clinical chemistry parameters including C3- and C4-complement serum concentrations revealed no pathological changes, seroconversion for hepatitis B and C and HIV did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: The pharmacokinetic parameters of the IgG antibodies calculated after administration of the novel IVIG preparations to patients with CLL and multiple myeloma are in close agreement with data obtained from healthy volunteers and with values of native IgG, suggesting that the production process did not impair clinically relevant characteristics of the viral antibodies.","['Thurmann, P A', 'Sonnenburg, C', 'Valentova, K', 'Gregora, E', 'Freischlager, F', 'Lissner, R']","['Thurmann PA', 'Sonnenburg C', 'Valentova K', 'Gregora E', 'Freischlager F', 'Lissner R']","['University Witten/Herdecke, Hospital Wuppertal GmbH, Germany. petra.thuermann@klinikum-wuppertal.de']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,European journal of clinical pharmacology,1256165,IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/blood/*metabolism', 'Area Under Curve', 'Cytomegalovirus/immunology', 'Female', 'Half-Life', 'Hepatitis B/immunology', 'Herpesvirus 3, Human/immunology', 'Humans', '*Immunoglobulins, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Metabolic Clearance Rate', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism/radiotherapy', 'Pharmacokinetics']",2001/08/11 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/11 10:00'],"['2001/08/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002280100305 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 2001 Jun;57(3):235-41. doi: 10.1007/s002280100305.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Immunoglobulins, Intravenous)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This inhibition was most effective if the polysaccharide was added 2 h before or at the time of infection. The finding that the inhibition of cell transformation by MuSV-124 was reversible after removal of the polysaccharide suggested that Porphyridium sp. polysaccharide inhibited a late step after provirus integration into the host genome. Addition of the polysaccharide post-infection significantly reduced the number of transformed cells, but its effect was less marked than that obtained when the polysaccharide was added before or at the time of infection. These findings support the possibility that the polysaccharide may affect early steps in virus replication cycle, such as virus absorption into the host cells, in addition to its effect on a late step after provirus integration.","['Huleihel, M', 'Arad, S']","['Huleihel M', 'Arad S']","['The Institute forApplied Biosciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, Israel. mahmoudh@bgumail.bgu.ac.il']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eukaryota/*chemistry', 'Fibroblasts/metabolism', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Polysaccharides/*chemistry', 'Proviruses/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",2001/08/11 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/11 10:00'],"['2001/08/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2001 May-Jun;21(3B):2073-8.,['0 (Polysaccharides)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, an appropriate method for early detection of apoptosis that can be clinically applicable to peripheral blood samples freshly obtained from leukemic patients under chemotherapy has not yet been established. We investigated the chronology of ara-C induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells by monitoring the expression of a number of apoptotic markers in a time- and concentration-dependent manner with the aim of estimating the earliest reliable marker of apoptosis to apply to clinical drug sensitivity assays. We employed the following techniques: 1) Pulsed field gel electrophoresis to detect high molecular weight DNA fragmentation; 2) FACS analysis for evaluation of APO 2.7 expression and phosphatidylserine externalization; 3) May-Grunwald-Giemsa staining for studying gross morphology; and 4) TUNEL assay to detect multitudes of terminal 3'-OH groups of oligonucleosomal DNA fragments. At 10 microM ara-C, high molecular weight DNA fragmentation was observed after 4 hours incubation being the earliest marker to manifest. APO 2.7 expression and phosphatidylserine externalization were detected almost simultaneously at 6 hours, with marked similarity in their kinetics. Emergence of apoptotic bodies then followed after 12 hours incubation and, finally, oligonucleosomal DNA fragments were demonstrated by positive TUNEL assay at 48 hours. The results suggest the time-sequential expression of each individual marker and introduce high molecular weight DNA fragmentation assay as the most suitable candidate for early detection of sensitivity of malignant cells to apoptosis-inducing anticancer agents, including ara-C.","['Badran, A', 'Iwasaki, H', 'Wano, Y', 'Kishi, S', 'Ueda, T']","['Badran A', 'Iwasaki H', 'Wano Y', 'Kishi S', 'Ueda T']","['First Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical University, Matsuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', '*Apoptosis', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Fragmentation', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'In Situ Nick-End Labeling', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/11 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/11 10:00'],"['2001/08/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2001 May-Jun;21(3B):1987-95.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The de novo purine biosynthetic pathway appeared to be the major target of the agents with the inhibition of both PRPP-amido transferase and IMP dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activities. Suppression of IMPDH activity was due to the inhibition of both the Type I and II isoforms through an uncompetitive mechanism; however, the Type II isoform was preferentially inhibited at lower concentrations of compounds tested (>50-150 microM). Therefore IMPDH Type II activity, which predominates in cancer cells, was selectively inhibited over the Type I isoform (208-312 microM). The activities of other enzymes examined were inhibited which added to the overall suppression of DNA synthesis, i.e., ribonucleotide reductase, dihydrofolate reductase and nucleoside kinases. The agents caused Tmolt4 DNA strand scission but the DNA molecule itself did not appear to be a target of the compounds since there was no induced cross-linking of the DNA, intercalation between base pairs or alkylation of the DNA bases.","['Barnes, B J', 'Izydore, R A', 'Hall, I H']","['Barnes BJ', 'Izydore RA', 'Hall IH']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-7360, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Amidophosphoribosyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Models, Chemical', 'Phenylbutazone/*pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Recombinant Proteins/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/11 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/11 10:00'],"['2001/08/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 2001 May-Jun;21(3B):1857-68.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 2.4.2.14 (Amidophosphoribosyltransferase)', 'GN5P7K3T8S (Phenylbutazone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An apoptosis-inducing protein identified to be fetal fetuin and a 60 Kd apoptosis-inducing protein have also been found in fetal serum and fresh embryo extract, respectively. Interestingly, a common characteristic of these embryonic apoptosis-inducing proteins is that they selectively induced apoptosis in cancer without affecting normal cells. For example, the 54 Kd protein selectively induced apoptosis in 10 out of 12 cancer cell lines without affecting 12 normal cell lines we tested. Fetal fetuin, on the other hand, selectively induced apoptosis in 5 cancer cell lines without affecting the 3 normal cell lines we tested. In vivo, tumor animal model study showed that fetal fetuin enhanced survival in leukemia-bearing mice and strongly inhibited the formation of prostate cancer in a PC-3 prostate cancer model in mice. A working hypothesis has been proposed to aid in the study of the mechanism by which the embryonic apoptosis-inducing proteins selectively induced apoptosis in cancer without affecting normal cells. This hypothesis states that due to the retro-differentiational characteristic of malignancy, cancer cells may re-express the signal transduction machinery for development-related apoptosis, which is otherwise to be normally expressed by embryonic, but not by adult cells. The embryonic apoptosis-inducing proteins may therefore induced apoptosis in cancer but not in normal cells and may be developed as an anticancer agent.

A comparison of the chemical structures of the derivatives with that of C.OXT-A, which is the parental molecule, suggested that the 3'-fluorine-modification might account for the higher anti-HHV-6 activity and lower cytotoxicity.",457-66,"An infection of TaY cells, which originated from an adult T-cell leukemia, with an HHV-6B OK isolate resulted in a chronically infected culture, termed TaY(OK).

Since the chronically infected culture has been maintained for over 2 years without the addition of uninfected TaY cells, we used it for an evaluation of the antiviral potency of nucleoside analogs, especially carbocyclic oxetanocins (C.OXTs).","['Wang, P', 'Abe, K', 'Ojima, T', 'Ohyashiki, J H', 'Satoh, H', 'Maruyama, T', 'Nagata, H', 'Tanaka, H', 'Yamamoto, K']","['Wang P', 'Abe K', 'Ojima T', 'Ohyashiki JH', 'Satoh H', 'Maruyama T', 'Nagata H', 'Tanaka H', 'Yamamoto K']","['Department of Virology, Medical Research Institute, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,IM,"['Adenine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Antiviral Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Herpesvirus 6, Human/*drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",2001/08/11 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/11 10:00'],"['2001/08/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.2001.tb02645.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 2001;45(6):457-66. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.2001.tb02645.x.,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '103913-16-2 (oxetanocin)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Activation of the promoter of BLV-LTR by pME-BLVtax was confirmed by luciferase assay. When the cells, such as COS-1, C8, and KU-1, were transfected with a plasmid pBLV-LUC1, which contained the luciferase gene under the control of BLV-LTR, and pME-BLVtax, luciferase was expressed in these cells, whereas no luciferase gene expression was observed when only pBLV-LUC1 was introduced into the cells. Activation of the BLV-LTR promoter was regulated by pME-BLVtax and 0.5 microg of pME-BLVtax was sufficient for the expression of the gene under the control of BLV-LTR. Furthermore, pME-BLVtax was used to direct the cell expression of the gene for diphtheria toxin A-chain under the control of BLV-LTR (pLTR-DT) to various tumor cell lines, KU-1, C8, COS-1, BL2M3, and HeLa cells. The transfection was carried out with cationic liposomes. In this experiment, co-transfection of pLTR-DT with pME-BLVtax exerted selective growth inhibitory effects on the tumor cell lines. Moreover, three co-introductions of pLTR-DT with pME-BLVtax into the cell lines resulted in significant inhibition of the cell growth. This result suggests that the delivery of the pLTR-DT and pME-BLVtax genes into tumor cells by the use of cationic liposomes may be potentially useful as a novel approach for the treatment of tumor cells.","['Tana', 'Watarai, S', 'Aida, Y', 'Tajima, S', 'Kakidani, H', 'Onuma, M', 'Kodama, H']","['Tana', 'Watarai S', 'Aida Y', 'Tajima S', 'Kakidani H', 'Onuma M', 'Kodama H']","['Division of Veterinary Science, Graduate School of Agriculture and Biological Sciences, Osaka Prefecture University, Sakai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,IM,"['Animals', 'COS Cells', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Diphtheria Toxin/*genetics', '*Genes, pX', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/*genetics', 'Luciferases/genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transfection']",2001/08/11 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/11 10:00'],"['2001/08/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1348-0421.2001.tb02644.x [doi]'],ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 2001;45(6):447-55. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.2001.tb02644.x.,"['0 (Diphtheria Toxin)', 'EC 1.13.12.- (Luciferases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: All patients studied at Laboratories Clinicos de Puebla/Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla in which the BCR-ABL hybrid gene was identified by means of polymerase chain reaction were analyzed. In 22 individuals the molecular marker of the disease was studied at diagnosis and in different instances afterwards; these patients were treated with chemotherapy, interferon, autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. RESULTS: Only the six patients that were allografted from HLA-identical siblings cleared the molecular marker of the disease; the rest of them did not achieve molecular remissions. The median survival (SV) of the whole group has not been reached, whereas the 53-month SV is 68%. One of the allografted patients died as a result of complications of graft versus-host disease. CONCLUSIONS: We have found useful the molecular monitoring of the treatment of patients with CML. Using this approach, we found that molecular remissions can be accomplished only with allografting; however, other therapeutic approaches may also result in long-lasting hematologic remissions.","['Ruiz-Arguelles, G J', 'Lopez-Martinez, B', 'Ramirez-Cabrera, J M', 'Reyes-Nunez, V', 'Rodriguez-Cedeno, H M', 'Garces-Eisele, J']","['Ruiz-Arguelles GJ', 'Lopez-Martinez B', 'Ramirez-Cabrera JM', 'Reyes-Nunez V', 'Rodriguez-Cedeno HM', 'Garces-Eisele J']","['Centro de Hematologia y Medicina Interna de Puebla, Universidad de las Americas-Puebla. gruizl@clinicaruiz.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*blood', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",2001/08/11 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/11 10:00'],"['2001/08/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 2001 May-Jun;53(3):235-9.,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective study of five patients with a morphologic diagnosis of APL by the French-American-British (FAB) classification that were treated for remission induction with ATRA and developed the ATRA syndrome. RESULTS: Three patients in newly diagnosed APL and two in leukemia relapse were analyzed. All patients received with ATRA 45 mgrs/m2/day, and three of them also received chemotherapy. Patients developed fever, respiratory distress, pulmonary infiltrates, weight gain and edemas. The onset of this symptom complex occurred from 1 to 11 days after starting treatment and was preceded by an increased in peripheral blood leukocytes. Infections or congestive heart failure were ruled out. The clinical course progressed while patients being treated with wide spectrum antibiotics. Four patients were treated with high doses corticosteroid therapy (dexametasone 10 mgrs intravenously every 12 hours), in three of them full recovery was attained and one died. One patient that did not received steroids died. CONCLUSIONS: The use of all-trans retinoic acid to induce hematologic remission in APL patients is associated in same patients with the development of ATRA syndrome, a life threatening complication. Symptoms begin in the first days of treatment. If this syndrome is suspected, early treatment with high dose steroids should be initiated.","['Martin Del Pozo, M', 'Cisneros De La Fuente, E', 'Solano, F', 'Martin, M L', 'De La Serna, J']","['Martin Del Pozo M', 'Cisneros De La Fuente E', 'Solano F', 'Martin ML', 'De La Serna J']","['Servicio Urgencias Fundacion Hospital de Alcorcon, Madrid.']",['spa'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Spain,An Med Interna,"Anales de medicina interna (Madrid, Spain : 1984)",9112183,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Lung Diseases, Interstitial/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pulmonary Edema/chemically induced', 'Respiratory Insufficiency/*chemically induced', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Syndrome', 'Tretinoin/*adverse effects']",2001/08/11 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/11 10:00'],"['2001/08/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,An Med Interna. 2001 Apr;18(4):195-200.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",,,,,El sindrome del ATRA como complicacion del tratamiento en la leucemia promielocitica aguda.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The work that does exist on parental reactions tends to conflate maternal responses with paternal responses, as fathers are usually seen as having a secondary role. Consequently, little is known about how fathers cope with treatment for childhood ALL. The present discussion seeks to make a contribution to this area by presenting findings on the paternal experience of treatment for paediatric ALL from a longitudinal study conducted at Royal Children's Hospital in Brisbane, Queensland. The findings from this research clearly indicate the emotional pain that fathers face in their struggle to accept the diagnosis of a serious, life-threatening illness such as ALL in their child. The findings challenge the notion of the make stereotype by showing that the shock of diagnosis, the emotional pain of coping with the illness, the expression of pain through tears, the desire to be with the child, the struggle to cope with the medical interventions, and concerns about other family members are not gender specific, but are rather issues common to both parents.","['McGrath, P']",['McGrath P'],"['Centre for Palliative Care Research & Education, Royal Brisbane Hospital, QLD.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Aust Health Rev,Australian health review : a publication of the Australian Hospital Association,8214381,,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chronic Disease/psychology', 'Father-Child Relations', 'Fathers/*psychology', '*Grief', 'Hospitals, Pediatric', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Life Change Events', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Mothers/psychology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', 'Queensland']",2001/08/11 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/11 10:00'],"['2001/08/11 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/11 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1071/ah010135 [doi]'],ppublish,Aust Health Rev. 2001;24(2):135-42. doi: 10.1071/ah010135.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The filamentous fungus Scedosporium consists of two species, S. prolificans and S. apiospermum, which can cause infections in immunocompromised patients that are often fatal. A significant feature of this pathogen is its broad resistance to many antifungal agents, including amphotericin B. PROCEDURE AND RESULTS: Five cases of infection with Scedosporium spp. occurred in patients with haematologic malignancies over a 10-month period. Three patients with S. prolificans were severely immunosuppressed and neutropenic; two were in relapse and another was early post-matched unrelated bone marrow transplant. All three died despite treatment with various combinations of amphotericin B and itraconazole. Two patients who were less immunosuppressed and had a normal neutrophil count developed S. apiospermum infection. Both were successfully treated with liposomal amphotericin B and itraconazole. CONCLUSIONS: Disseminated infection in immunocompromised hosts with Scedosporium spp. is often fatal. However, in patients with a lesser degree of immunocompromise and particularly in those infected with the less virulent S. apiospermum, intensive antifungal therapy with liposomal amphotericin B and itraconazole may be associated with complete eradication of infection.

Its mechanism of action is thought to be by inhibition of protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis by inhibition of chain initiation. The treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in children, has been hampered by few new effective agents developed in the past 30 years. Significant numbers of children still die of this disease. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of HHT for the therapy of refractory AML in children. PROCEDURE: Patients entered the study and were treated with HHT 7mg/m(2)/day for 10 days. The cycles could be repeated every 21 days depending on recovery from myelosuppression. RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients entered the study, with twenty-eight evaluable for response. Complete response was obtained in four and a partial response in one (response rate 5/28 = 18%). Significant toxicities included prolonged severe myelosuppression in all responsive patients and neuropathogenic pain in two patients. The median duration of response was 62 days with a range of 28-126 days. CONCLUSIONS: HHT has activity against chemotherapy resistant AML in children, with tolerable toxicity. This agent warrants further clinical evaluation in combination with other agents or perhaps biologic response modifiers which will hopefully lead to useful therapeutic options.

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), a malignant hematopoietic stem cell disorder, is characterised by an acquired genetic abnormality: the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) and its molecular counterpart, the oncogene BCR-ABL. The latter, which is translated in an active BCR-ABL protein, exhibited a deregulated tyrosine kinase activity inducing malignant transformation. Produced from the 2-phenylaminopyrimidine class, a novel synthetic inhibitor, identified as CGP57148 (STI571), inhibits tyrosine kinase activity of c-ABL, BCR-ABL, PDGF-R and c-kit at micromolar concentrations. It suppresses the proliferation of the majority of BCR-ABL positive cell lines. The phases I-II clinical trials in CML have demonstrated promising results, especially in the chronic phase of the disease.

Hence, the ability of Namalwa (Burkitt's lymphoma), U266 (multiple myeloma), and CEM (T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia) cells to interact with the extracellular matrix components vitronectin and fibronectin was determined. Fresh bone marrow plasma cells from patients with multiple myeloma also were studied. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Engagement of alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, formation and protein composition of focal adhesion contacts on the cell surface, phosphorylation of several signal transduction proteins in the contacts, cell proliferation, and enzyme secretion were studied following adhesion to vitronectin and fibronectin. RESULTS: All three lines adhered to immobilized vitronectin and fibronectin. Adhesion was fully prevented by neutralizing monoclonal anti-alpha(v)beta(3) integrin antibody. Integrin engagement caused the formation of phosphorylated pp60(src)/focal adhesion kinase complexes and the aggregation of focal adhesion plaques containing the beta(3) integrin subunit, the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin, cortactin, and paxillin, the tyrosine kinases focal adhesion kinase and pp60(src), the adapter protein Grb-2, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK-2. Free and immobilized vitronectin and fibronectin stimulated the proliferation of cells under serum-free conditions and the production and release of urokinase-type plasminogen activator, and increased the release of the activated forms of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in an alpha(v)beta(3) integrin-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained in myeloma plasma cells. CONCLUSIONS: The demonstrated ability of lymphoid tumor cells to interact with the extracellular matrix components vitronectin and fibronectin via alpha(v)beta(3) integrin can be interpreted as evidence of a novel mechanism for their invasion and spreading. This interaction allows them to adhere to the substratum and enhances their proliferation and protease secretion.","['Vacca, A', 'Ria, R', 'Presta, M', 'Ribatti, D', 'Iurlaro, M', 'Merchionne, F', 'Tanghetti, E', 'Dammacco, F']","['Vacca A', 'Ria R', 'Presta M', 'Ribatti D', 'Iurlaro M', 'Merchionne F', 'Tanghetti E', 'Dammacco F']","['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Bari Medical School, Bari, Italy. avacca@hotmail.com']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow Cells/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion/*physiology', 'Cell Division/*physiology', 'Endopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fibronectins', 'Focal Adhesion Kinase 1', 'Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphoma', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 2/metabolism', 'Matrix Metalloproteinase 9/metabolism', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1/metabolism', 'Multiple Myeloma/*pathology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasma Cells/*pathology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/metabolism', 'Receptors, Vitronectin/immunology/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/metabolism', 'Vitronectin']",2001/08/10 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/10 10:00'],"['2001/08/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0301-472X(01)00674-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00674-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 2001 Aug;29(8):993-1003. doi: 10.1016/s0301-472x(01)00674-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Receptors, Vitronectin)', '0 (Vitronectin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Kinase 1)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Focal Adhesion Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (PTK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'EC 3.4.24.24 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.35 (Matrix Metalloproteinase 9)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptors for neuropeptides such as VIP, somatostatin, and substance P have been characterised in human immuno-haematopoietic cells but little is known about the functional significance and expression of receptors for cholecystokinin (CCK) on cells of the immune system. There are only few studies that describe the expression of CCK receptors on human leukaemia-derived cell lines but the receptor structure and function in normal leukocytes have not been clearly established. We therefore sought to determine CCK receptor expression, structure, and function in nontransformed human peripheral blood mononuclear cells.Full-length cDNA clones encoding the human CCK-A and CCK-B/gastrin receptor are expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers without haematopoietic malignancy. In addition to wild-type CCK-B/gastrin receptor cDNAs, we isolated a splice variant with an in frame insertion of 69 amino acids within its putative third intracellular receptor loop. Dideoxy sequence analysis revealed that the cDNA of this splice variant comprises exons 1-4 but retains intron 4 (207 bp) in the absence of mutations within the splice donor sites. Transient expression of this splice variant in COS-7 cells reveals wild-type affinity for CCK-8, Gastrin-17, and antagonist L-365,260. Affinity for glycine-extended gastrin-17 was not increased when compared to the wild-type CCK-B/gastrin receptor. In vitro, gastrin decreased 3H-thymidine labelling in phytohaemagglutinin-pretreated mononuclear cells at a half-maximally effective concentration of 1.5 nM. We also isolated a cDNA encoding another splice variant of the CCK-B/gastrin receptor with a 158 bp deletion of the entire exon 4 sequence.

The aims of this study were to identify effects of the MHC on the molecular level and of avian leukosis virus (ALV) resistance status on MD mortality in two noninbred White Leghorn chicken lines that differ in B blood group type. Previously, within each of the chicken lines, sublines had been selected for resistance or susceptibility to ALV infection with Subgroups A and B. In this study, F2 offspring, obtained by crossing the two ALV-resistant or the two ALV-susceptible sublines, were tested for MD mortality after contact exposure at 1 d of age. Reciprocal matings were made in the grandparental generation. The MD mortality percentages, in an observation period of 17 wk, of F2 offspring from two hatches were 82.63 and 92.35%, respectively. Survival analysis (Cox model) was applied to assess the risk of dying from MD. No differences in MD mortality risk profiles were found between ALV-resistant and ALV-susceptible F2 offspring. Within ALV-susceptible F2 offspring, however, a reciprocal mating effect was observed in both hatches. The MHC Class I, II, and IV restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses were carried out on birds of the first hatch. Although two of 11 MHC class IV RFLP bands displayed a significant effect, in general, a strong association of MHC and MD mortality was not detectable.","['Weigend, S', 'Matthes, S', 'Solkner, J', 'Lamont, S J']","['Weigend S', 'Matthes S', 'Solkner J', 'Lamont SJ']","['Institute for Animal Science and Animal Behavior, Federal Agriculture Research Center, Mariensee, Neustadt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Poult Sci,Poultry science,0401150,IM,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*genetics/immunology', 'Blood Group Antigens', 'Breeding', 'Chickens/*genetics/immunology', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Herpesvirus 3, Gallid/*pathogenicity', 'Immunity, Innate/genetics', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex/*genetics', 'Marek Disease/*genetics/immunology/mortality', 'Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/08/10 10:00,2002/04/16 10:01,['2001/08/10 10:00'],"['2001/08/10 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/04/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/10 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1093/ps/80.8.1064 [doi]', 'S0032-5791(19)41800-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Poult Sci. 2001 Aug;80(8):1064-72. doi: 10.1093/ps/80.8.1064.,['0 (Blood Group Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we describe a retrovirus-based methodology to transduce foreign genes into mouse neural precursors. We used a high-titer bicistronic retroviral vector that encodes a marker gene, placental alkaline phosphatase (plap), and a selection gene, neomycin phosphotransferase II (neoR), under the translational control of two retroviral internal ribosome entry segments. Transduction efficiency even without selection was up to 95% for multipotential neurospheres derived from embryonic striata and grown with basic fibroblast growth factor 2. Expression of plap and neoR was sustained with time in culture and upon differentiation into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, as shown by double immunofluorescence labeling with cell type-specific markers, Western blotting, and neomycin resistance. However, levels of plap were decreased in differentiated oligodendrocytes. Transduction with the same vector of neonatal oligodendrocyte precursors grown in oligospheres consistently resulted in a lower proportion of plap-immunoreactive cells and enhanced cell death in the absence of neomycin. However, plap expression was maintained in some differentiated oligodendrocytes expressing galactocerebroside or myelin basic protein. In that neurospheres can be easily expanded in vitro and factors enabling their differentiation into the three main central nervous system cell types are being elucidated, this methodology could be used in the future to produce large number of transduced, differentiated neural cells.","['Franceschini, I A', 'Feigenbaum-Lacombe, V', 'Casanova, P', 'Lopez-Lastra, M', 'Darlix, J L', 'Dalcq, M D']","['Franceschini IA', 'Feigenbaum-Lacombe V', 'Casanova P', 'Lopez-Lastra M', 'Darlix JL', 'Dalcq MD']","['Unite de Neurovirologie et Regeneration du Systeme Nerveux, Pasteur Institute, 25 rue du Dr. Roux, 75724 Paris Cedex 15, France.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Neurosci Res,Journal of neuroscience research,7600111,IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase', 'Animals', 'Astrocytes/cytology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Lineage', 'Corpus Striatum/*cytology/embryology', 'Defective Viruses/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'GPI-Linked Proteins', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genetic Vectors/*genetics', 'Gentamicins/pharmacology', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Kanamycin Kinase/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Neurons/cytology/metabolism', 'Oligodendroglia/cytology/metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Reticuloendotheliosis virus/*genetics', 'Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', '*Transfection', 'Transgenes']",2001/08/09 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/09 10:00'],"['2001/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jnr.1144 [doi]'],ppublish,J Neurosci Res. 2001 Aug 1;65(3):208-19. doi: 10.1002/jnr.1144.,"['0 (GPI-Linked Proteins)', '0 (Gentamicins)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', 'A08F5XTI6G (antibiotic G 418)', 'EC 2.7.1.95 (Kanamycin Kinase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (alkaline phosphatase, placental)']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concern has spread among employees over the lack of knowledge of risk agents' symptoms, and diseases in that environment. This paper reviews the investigations of health risks in employees working in the sewage treatment plants. METHODS: A literature search was performed with the search terms; sewage, waste water, health effects, infection, and health hazards. Articles on health effects in relation to sewage were selected. RESULTS: Work in sewage water plants can involve exposure to different types of microorganisms and chemicals. The bacterial exposure is dominated by bacteria that naturally occur in nature. However, different bacteria and viruses that give rise to infections can be present in this environment and thus there exists a risk of infection, especially of hepatitis A. Investigations suggest that gastrointestinal tract symptoms are more common among employees at sewage treatment plants than among controls. Respiratory symptoms, fatigue, and headache have also been reported in several investigations. The cause of the symptoms is unknown, although certain data suggest that they are caused by inflammation. The results suggest that endotoxin in Gram-negative bacteria may be one of the causative agents. As regards cancer, some studies report an increased risk of stomach cancer and a few studies report an increased risk of cancer in the larynx, liver or, prostate or of leukemia. The spread of the cancers over a multitude of organs does not support a hypothesis of causality with agents commonly found in sewage treatment plants. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigations are needed to determine the work-related effects and ascertain the causal agents.","['Thorn, J', 'Kerekes, E']","['Thorn J', 'Kerekes E']","['Department of Environmental Medicine, Goteborg University, Sweden. jorgen.thorn@envmed.gu.se']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Ind Med,American journal of industrial medicine,8101110,IM,"['Cause of Death', 'Humans', 'Infections/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology', '*Occupational Health', '*Safety', '*Sewage', '*Waste Management']",2001/08/09 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/09 10:00'],"['2001/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/ajim.1085 [pii]', '10.1002/ajim.1085 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ind Med. 2001 Aug;40(2):170-9. doi: 10.1002/ajim.1085.,['0 (Sewage)'],50,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An epidemiologic investigation in China (NCI/CAPM study) extended quantitative evaluations of cancer risk to a broader range of benzene exposures, particularly at lower levels. METHODS: We review the evidence implicating benzene in the etiology of hematopoietic disorders, clarify methodologic aspects of the NCI/CAPM study, and examine the study in the context of the broader literature on health effects associated with occupational benzene exposure. RESULTS: Quantitative relationships for cancer risk from China and the U.S. show a relatively smooth increase in risk for acute myeloid leukemia and related conditions over a broad dose range of benzene exposure (below 200 ppm-years mostly from the China study and above 200 ppm-years mostly from the U.S. study). CONCLUSIONS: Risks of acute myeloid leukemia and other malignant and nonmalignant hematopoietic disorders associated with benzene exposure in China are consistent with other information about benzene exposure, hematotoxicity, and cancer risk, extending evidence for hematopoietic cancer risks to levels substantially lower than had previously been established.

Transfection of dominant negative STAT3, but not STAT1 inhibits mutant c-Kit mediated anchorage-independent growth in vitro and tumor formation in vivo. Expression of constitutively activated STAT3 restores the mutant c-Kit receptor's transforming ability in 293 cells.

Although SYK has not been linked to a human disease, defective expression of the closely related T-cell tyrosine kinase ZAP-70 has been associated with severe combined immunodeficiency. Childhood CD19(+)CD10(-) pro-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is thought to originate from B-cell precursors with a maturational arrest at the pro-B cell stage and it is associated with poor prognosis. Since lethally irradiated mice reconstituted with SYK-deficient fetal liver-derived lymphohematopoietic progenitor cells show a block in B-cell ontogeny at the pro-B to pre-B cell transition, we examined the SYK expression profiles of primary leukemic cells from children with pro-B cell ALL. Here we report that leukemic cells from pediatric CD19(+)CD10(-) pro-B cell ALL patients (but not leukemic cells from patients with CD19(+)CD10(+) common pre-pre-B cell ALL) have markedly reduced SYK activity. Sequencing of the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) products of the Syk mRNA in these pro-B leukemia cells revealed profoundly aberrant coding sequences with deletions or insertions. These mRNA species encode abnormal SYK proteins with a missing or truncated catalytic kinase domain. In contrast to pro-B leukemia cells, pre-pre-B leukemia cells from children with CD19(+)CD10(+) common B-lineage ALL and EBV-transformed B-cell lines from healthy volunteers expressed wild-type Syk coding sequences. Examination of the genomic structure of the Syk gene by inter-exonic PCR and genomic cloning demonstrated that the deletions and insertions in the abnormal mRNA species of pro-B leukemia cells are caused by aberrant splicing resulting in either mis-splicing, exon skipping or inclusion of alternative exons, consistent with an abnormal posttranscriptional regulation of alternative splicing of Syk pre-mRNA. Our findings link for the first time specific molecular defects involving the Syk gene to an immunophenotypically distinct category of childhood ALL. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a specific tyrosine kinase deficiency in a human hematologic malignancy.","['Goodman, P A', 'Wood, C M', 'Vassilev, A', 'Mao, C', 'Uckun, F M']","['Goodman PA', 'Wood CM', 'Vassilev A', 'Mao C', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Parker Hughes Institute & Parker Hughes Cancer Center, St Paul, Minnesota, MN 55113, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Base Sequence', 'Child', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Enzyme Precursors/chemistry/*deficiency/genetics', 'Exons/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins', 'Introns/genetics', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Neoplasm Proteins/chemistry/*deficiency/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/enzymology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology/genetics', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/analysis/chemistry/*deficiency/genetics', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Syk Kinase']",2001/08/09 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/08/09 10:00'],"['2001/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2001/04/03 00:00 [revised]', '2001/04/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.onc.1204515 [doi]'],ppublish,Oncogene. 2001 Jul 5;20(30):3969-78. doi: 10.1038/sj.onc.1204515.,"['0 (Enzyme Precursors)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (SYK protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Syk protein, mouse)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We isolated cDNA encoding the enzyme from human fibrosarcoma cells, then determined its nucleotide sequence by the 5'-RACE method followed by confirmation employing the human genome DNA library. The isolated uridine/cytidine kinase cDNA (UCK cDNA) consisted of 786 nucleotides encoding 261 amino acids and was found to have approximately 70% homology with mouse UCK cDNA. Northern blot analysis of human leukemia RNAs with labeled UCK gene showed a single band at 1.6 kb to be UCK mRNA, and southern blot analysis of the UCK cDNA after digestion with BamHI, SacI and XbaI enzymes showed four band signals, suggesting the UCK gene to have at least 4 exons. A truncated form of UCK cDNA was expressed as the His-tag conjugated protein in Escherichia coli.

The relevance of these data to confirm clinical remission or to detect minimal residual disease and/or relapse was evaluated. Fifty-four patients were monitored following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and 46 cases after chemotherapy. Various chromosome or aberration specific DNA probes were applied for follow-up in the time frame of 1 month up to 13 years. From the cytogenetic point of view, the aim was to determine the power of resolution of the I-FISH technique in the detection of clinically significant changes in the course of disease and its usefulness in daily routine cyto-genetics as compared with classical cytogenetics. In addition, reliability standards of the various DNA probes should be established. In 75 patients with remissions during the entire period of I-FISH monitoring no conspicuous signal constitution was detected. Of 25 relapses or progresses of disease, which were clinically confirmed, 22 were reliably detected by I-FISH, in only 1 case I-FISH monitoring failed to detect the aberrant clone. In 2 patients conventional karyotype analysis confirmed the relapse by detecting complex chromosomal aberrations, but specific probes for I-FISH confirmation were not available. These data suggest that I-FISH analyses in the follow-up of leukemias is a simple and in most cases sufficiently sensitive and highly reliable way of monitoring the outcome of therapy. It may well serve to close the gap between conventional karyotyping and the highly sensitive molecular techniques.","['Gebhart, E', 'Rosler, W', 'Gramatzki, M', 'Trautmann, U']","['Gebhart E', 'Rosler W', 'Gramatzki M', 'Trautmann U']","['Institute of Human Genetics, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Schwabachanlage 10, D-91054 Erlangen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Greece,Int J Oncol,International journal of oncology,9306042,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia/*genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence']",2001/08/09 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/09 10:00'],"['2001/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Int J Oncol. 2001 Sep;19(3):617-23.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The genomic breakpoint junctions were amplified by PCR. Cleavage of DNA substrates containing the normal homologues of the MLL and AF-4 translocation breakpoints was examined in vitro upon incubation with human DNA topoisomerase IIalpha and etoposide, etoposide catechol, etoposide quinone, or dactinomycin. The der(11) and der(4) genomic breakpoint junctions both involved MLL intron 6 and AF-4 intron 3. Recombination was precise at the sequence level except for the overall gain of a single templated nucleotide. The translocation breakpoints in MLL and AF-4 were DNA topoisomerase II cleavage sites. Etoposide and its metabolites, but not dactinomycin, enhanced cleavage at these sites. Assuming that DNA topoisomerase II was the mediator of the breakage, processing of the staggered nicks induced by DNA topoisomerase II, including exonucleolytic deletion and template-directed polymerization, would have been required before ligation of the ends to generate the observed genomic breakpoint junctions. These data are inconsistent with a translocation mechanism involving interchromosomal recombination by simple exchange of DNA topoisomerase II subunits and DNA-strand transfer; however, consistent with reciprocal DNA topoisomerase II cleavage events in MLL and AF-4 in which both breaks became stable, the DNA ends were processed and underwent ligation.

HSMCs were electrically silent at rest. In contrast, HMC-1 expressed a strong outwardly rectifying voltage-dependent Cl(-) conductance characteristic of ClC-4 or ClC-5 and a small inwardly rectifying K(+) current not carried by the classical Kir family of K(+) channels. Calcium ionophore induced the appearance of outwardly rectifying Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) and K(+) currents, while hypotonicity induced another outwardly rectifying conductance typical of ClC-3. Reverse transcription-PCRs confirmed that mRNAs for the voltage-dependent Cl(-) channels ClC-3 and -5 were expressed.

Their derivation and propagation are dependent upon cytokine-stimulated activation of gp130 signal transduction. Embryonic stem cells maintain a close resemblance to epiblast in developmental potency and gene expression profile. The presumption of equivalence between embryonic stem cells and epiblast is challenged, however, by the finding that early embryogenesis can proceed in the absence of gp130. To explore this issue further, we have examined the capacity of gp130 mutant embryos to accommodate perturbation of normal developmental progression. Mouse embryos arrest at the late blastocyst stage when implantation is prevented. This process of diapause occurs naturally in lactating females or can be induced experimentally by removal of the ovaries. We report that gp130(-/-) embryos survive unimplanted in the uterus after ovariectomy but, in contrast to wild-type or heterozygous embryos, are subsequently unable to resume development. Inner cell masses explanted from gp130(-/-) delayed blastocysts produce only parietal endoderm, a derivative of the hypoblast. Intact mutant embryos show an absence of epiblast cells, and Hoechst staining and TUNEL analysis reveal a preceding increased incidence of cell death. These findings establish that gp130 signalling is essential for the prolonged maintenance of epiblast in vivo, which is commonly required of mouse embryos in the wild. We propose that the responsiveness of embryonic stem cells to gp130 signalling has its origin in this adaptive physiological function.","['Nichols, J', 'Chambers, I', 'Taga, T', 'Smith, A']","['Nichols J', 'Chambers I', 'Taga T', 'Smith A']","[""Centre for Genome Research, University of Edinburgh, King's Buildings, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JQ, UK. jenny.nichols@ed.ac.uk""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Apoptosis', 'Blastocyst/cytology', 'Cytokine Receptor gp130', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development', 'Female', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit', 'Male', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics/metabolism/physiology', 'Receptors, OSM-LIF', '*Signal Transduction', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/physiology', 'Time Factors']",2001/08/09 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/09 10:00'],"['2001/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 2001 Jun;128(12):2333-9.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Il6st protein, mouse)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (Lifr protein, mouse)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Receptors, OSM-LIF)', '133483-10-0 (Cytokine Receptor gp130)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene targeting experiments in the mouse have demonstrated key roles for the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor SCL and the GATA-binding protein GATA-1 in hematopoiesis. When overexpressed in Xenopus animal cap explants, SCL and GATA-1 are each capable of specifying mesoderm to become blood. Forced expression of either factor in whole embryos, however, does not lead to ectopic blood formation. This apparent paradox between animal cap assays and whole embryo phenotype has led to the hypothesis that additional factors are involved in specifying hematopoietic mesoderm. SCL and GATA-1 interact in a transcriptional complex with the LIM domain protein LMO-2. We have cloned the Xenopus homolog of LMO-2 and show that it is expressed in a similar pattern to SCL during development. LMO-2 can specify hematopoietic mesoderm in animal cap assays. SCL and LMO-2 act synergistically to expand the blood island when overexpressed in whole embryos. Furthermore, co-expression of GATA-1 with SCL and LMO-2 leads to embryos that are ventralized and have blood throughout the dorsal-ventral axis. The synergistic effect of SCL, LMO-2 and GATA-1, taken together with the findings that these factors can form a complex in vitro, suggests that this complex specifies mesoderm to become blood during embryogenesis.","['Mead, P E', 'Deconinck, A E', 'Huber, T L', 'Orkin, S H', 'Zon, L I']","['Mead PE', 'Deconinck AE', 'Huber TL', 'Orkin SH', 'Zon LI']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Development,"Development (Cambridge, England)",8701744,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4', 'Bone Morphogenetic Proteins/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Erythropoiesis/*physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor', 'Gene Expression', 'Globins/genetics', '*Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'LIM Domain Proteins', 'Metalloproteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Smad Proteins', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1', 'Trans-Activators/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', '*Xenopus Proteins', 'Xenopus laevis/embryology']",2001/08/09 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/09 10:00'],"['2001/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Development. 2001 Jun;128(12):2301-8.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (BMP4 protein, human)', '0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (Bmp4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA1 protein, human)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (LIM Domain Proteins)', '0 (LMO2 protein, human)', '0 (Lmo2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Metalloproteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Smad Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (TAL1 protein, Xenopus)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Xenopus Proteins)', '0 (bmp4 protein, Xenopus)', '135471-20-4 (TAL1 protein, human)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depending on the bases flanking the CpG motif and on the DNA backbone, CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) can induce relatively more B-cell activation or relatively more natural killer (NK)--cell activation. To evaluate their antitumor activities, an NK-optimized ODN (1585) and 2 B-cell--optimized ODNs (1826 and 2006) were compared for their ability to protect naive mice against a lethal acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) challenge. CpG 2006, but not CpG 1585, administered 2 days before the AML challenge, allowed mice to survive more than 100 times a lethal tumor dose. Cell depletion studies showed that protection did not require T or B cells but depended on NK cells and also on an NK-independent mechanism. CpG 2006 protected against AML challenge in both syngeneic and allogeneic bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients at both early and late time points after transplantation. Although CpG 1585 had no protective effect on its own, it showed a striking synergy with CpG 2006 to induce prolonged survival to AML challenge in allogeneic recipients of T-cell-depleted marrow grafts, exceeding the survival benefit of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). When combined with DLI, a synergistic effect was observed in recipients of CpG2006 or 2006 + 1585 with 88% of mice surviving long-term. These data are the first to indicate that the systemic administration of CpG ODNs is a potent means of inducing therapeutic anti-AML innate immune responses in naive and BMT recipients.

The circulating tumor cells did not express an antigen profile typical of any subtype of leukemia commonly observed in children. Tumor cells were CD3(-)/CD56(+); had germline TCR genes; and strongly expressed CD30, epithelial membrane antigen, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) consistent with a null cell anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). The malignant cells contained a t(2;19)(p23;p13.1) that interrupted ALK and translocated it to the der(19). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and nucleotide sequence analysis revealed fusion of ALK to tropomyosin 4, an ALK fusion partner not described previously in hematologic malignancies. The clinical presentation and phenotypic features of this malignancy were not typical for ALCL because tumor cells expressed both myeloid (CD13, CD33, HLA-DR) and natural killer (NK) cell antigens. The neoplastic cells most resembled NK cells because in addition to being CD3(-)/CD56(+) with germline TCR genes, these cells were CD25(+)/CD122(+)/granzyme B(+) and possessed the functional properties of immature NK cells. The unusual clinical presentation, immunophenotype, and functional properties of these neoplastic cells suggest that this malignancy may be derived from the putative myeloid-NK precursor cell. Furthermore co-expression of NK and ALCL features supports the concept that a minority of null-ALCL may be derived from NK cells and expands the spectrum of phenotypes that can be seen in tumors produced by ALK fusion proteins.

Inhibitors of NF-kappa B activity, sodium salicylate and cyclopentenone prostaglandins (prostaglandin A(1) and 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2)), blocked spontaneous proliferation of Tax transgenic mouse spleen cells. In addition, Tax-induced tumor cells, which are resistant to irradiation-induced apoptosis, became sensitive to apoptosis in the presence of sodium salicylate and prostaglandins.

A total of 177 highly polymorphic microsatellite repeat markers were used in locus-specific polymerase chain reactions. This comprehensive allelotyping employed flow-sorted cells from diagnostic samples and whole-genome amplification of DNA from small, highly purified samples. Nineteen regions of allelic loss in 17 patients (32%) were detected on chromosome arms 1q, 3q, 5q, 7q (n = 2), 9q (n = 4), 11p (n = 2), 12p (n = 3), 13q (n = 2), 16q, 19q, and Y. The study revealed a degree of allelic loss underestimated by routine cytogenetic analysis, which failed to detect 9 of these LOH events. There was no evidence of LOH by intragenic markers for p53, Nf1, or CBFA2/AML1. Most lymphocytes lacked the deletions, which were detected only in the leukemic myeloid blast population. Analysis of patients' clinical and biologic characteristics indicated that the presence of LOH was associated with a white blood cell count of 20 x 10(9)/L or higher but was not correlated with a shorter overall survival. The relatively low rate of LOH observed in this study compared with findings in solid tumors and in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and adult AML suggests that tumor suppressor genes are either infrequently involved in the development of pediatric de novo AML or are inactivated by such means as methylation and point mutations. Additional study is needed to determine whether these regions of LOH harbor tumor suppressor genes and whether specific regions of LOH correlate with clinical characteristics.

Analysis of immunoglobulin variable region genes has revealed somatic mutation in most cases, consistent with an origin from a cell that has encountered the germinal center. One unusual feature of hairy cells (HCs) is the frequent expression of multiple immunoglobulin heavy chain isotypes, with dominance of immunoglobulin (Ig)--G3, but only a single light chain type. The origin and clonal relationship of these isotype variants have been unclear. In order to probe the isotype switching status of HCL, RNA transcripts of V(H)DJ(H)--constant region sequences from 5 cases of typical HCL, all expressing multiple surface immunoglobulin isotypes, were analyzed. Tumor V(H)DJ(H)--C(mu) sequences were identified and found to be somatically mutated (range, 1.4% to 6.5%), with a low level of intraclonal heterogeneity. Additional immunoglobulin isotypes of identical V(H)DJ(H) sequence were also identified, including IgD (5 of 5), IgG3 (5 of 5), IgG1 (3 of 5), IgG2 (2 of 5), IgA1 (4 of 5), and IgA2 (1 of 5). Derivation of multiple isotypes from individual cells was demonstrated by analyzing transcripts in single sorted cells from one patient, with evidence for coexistence of isotype variants in 10 of 10 cells. These findings indicate that clonally related multiple isotypes coexist in single HCs, with individual isotypes presumably generated via RNA splicing.

Flow cytometry and the DNA-binding dye Hoechst 33342 were previously used to identify a distinct subset of murine hematopoietic stem cells, termed the side population (SP), which rapidly expels Hoechst dye and can reconstitute the bone marrow of lethally irradiated mice. Here, the prevalence and pathogenic role of SP cells in human AML were investigated. Such cells were found in the bone marrow of more than 80% of 61 patients and had a predominant CD34(low/-) immunophenotype. Importantly, they carried cytogenetic markers of AML in all 11 cases of active disease examined and in 2 out of 5 cases in complete hematological remission. Comparison of daunorubicin and mitoxantrone fluorescence emission profiles revealed significantly higher drug efflux from leukemic SP cells than from non-SP cells. Three of 28 SP cell transplants generated overt AML-like disease in nonobese diabetic--severe combined immunodeficient mice. Low but persistent numbers of leukemic SP cells were detected by molecular and immunological assays in half of the remaining mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that SP cells are frequently involved in human AML and may be a target for leukemic transformation. They also suggest a mechanism by which SP cells could escape the effects of cytostatic drugs and might eventually contribute to leukemia relapse.

The poor outcome is thought to be caused mainly by the drug resistance of ATL cells. Lung resistance-related protein (LRP) is a novel protein associated with drug resistance. The expression of LRP messenger RNA (mRNA) was evaluated by slot blot analysis in 55 patients with ATL. Of these patients, 36 had acute, 12 chronic, and 7 lymphoma-type ATL. The expression levels of LRP mRNA were significantly higher in chronic ATL than in lymphoma-type ATL (P =.007). The expression of LRP mRNA was higher in patients with white blood cell counts above 30,000/microL (P =.038) or with abnormal lymphocyte counts above 10,000/microL (P =.007) than in the remaining patients. The enhanced efflux of [(14)C]doxorubicin from nuclei isolated from ATL cells that expressed high levels of LRP was inhibited by a polyclonal antibody against LRP, and the accumulation of doxorubicin in the isolated nuclei was increased by the anti-LRP antibody. In acute and lymphoma-type ATL patients, high expression of LRP mRNA at diagnosis correlated with shorter survival, and a Cox proportional hazards model showed that LRP expression is an independent prognostic factor. These findings suggest that functionally active LRP is expressed in some ATL cells and that it is involved in drug resistance and poor prognosis in ATL.

The viral leukemogenesis is critically dependent on its oncoprotein Tax because the protein as well as the virus can immortalize primary human lymphocytes to permanent growth. As a transcriptional transactivator, Tax can stimulate the expression of distinct cellular genes. Alterations in the expression levels of unknown growth-relevant genes may contribute to the changed growth properties of Tax-immortalized and leukemic cells. To identify genes that are linked to Tax transformation and ATL leukemogenesis, this study systematically compared the gene expression of cultured cells from patients with acute ATL with that of stimulated peripheral blood T lymphocytes. Several overexpressed RNAs that encode signal transduction functions were identified. These include a dual-specific protein phosphatase (PAC1), an interferon-inducible factor (ISG15), a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor (DEC-1), and the secreted antiapoptotic chemokine I-309. The ATL cell culture supernatants contained an antiapoptotic activity that could be specifically inhibited by antibodies directed against I-309. Inhibition of I-309 receptor (CCR8) signaling by pertussis toxin increased the apoptosis rate of ATL cell cultures in the presence and absence of external apoptotic stimuli. Both the I-309--specific antiapoptotic activity and the proapoptotic effect of inhibitors of I-309 signaling suggest the existence of an antiapoptotic autocrine loop in ATL cells. Thus, the overexpression of this chemokine may inhibit apoptosis in ATL cells and could substantially contribute to their growth.

In this study, a case of peripheral blood stem cell allograft rejection was investigated in which the patient and donor differed for a single mismatch at HLA-DP in the rejection direction.

Normal T-cell receptor gene rearrangement in T-cell progenitors results in the generation of T-cell receptor rearrangement excision circles (TRECs). In this study, a quantitative assay for TRECs was used to measure T-cell neogenesis in adult patients with leukemia who received myeloablative therapy followed by transplantation of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells. Although phenotypically mature T cells had recovered by 1 to 2 months after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), TREC levels remained low for 3 months after BMT. T-cell neogenesis became evident by 6 months, and normal levels of adult thymic function were restored at 6 to 12 months after BMT. Subsequent leukemia relapse in some patients was associated with reduced TREC levels, but infusion of mature donor CD4(+) T cells resulted in rapid restoration of thymic function.

The MDR phenotype often correlates with expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), and Pgp antagonists such as cyclosporine (CSA) have been used as chemosensitizing agents in AML. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin, an immunoconjugate of an anti-CD33 antibody linked to calicheamicin, is effective monotherapy for CD33(+) relapsed AML. However, the contribution of Pgp to gemtuzumab ozogamicin resistance is poorly defined. In this study, blast cell samples from relapsed AML patients eligible for gemtuzumab ozogamicin clinical trials were assayed for Pgp surface expression and Pgp function using a dye efflux assay. In most cases, surface expression of Pgp correlated with Pgp function, as indicated by elevated dye efflux that was inhibited by CSA. Among samples from patients who either failed to clear marrow blasts or failed to achieve remission, 72% or 52%, respectively, exhibited CSA-sensitive dye efflux compared with 29% (P =.003) or 24% (P <.001) among samples from responders. In vitro gemtuzumab ozogamicin--induced apoptosis was also evaluated using an annexin V--based assay. Low levels of drug-induced apoptosis were associated with CSA-sensitive dye efflux, whereas higher levels correlated strongly with achievement of remission and marrow blast clearance. In vitro drug-induced apoptosis could be increased by CSA in 14 (29%) of 49 samples exhibiting low apoptosis in the absence of CSA. Together, these findings indicate that Pgp plays a role in clinical resistance to gemtuzumab ozogamicin and suggest that treatment trials combining gemtuzumab ozogamicin with MDR reversal agents are warranted.

These pathways are themselves influenced by a number of lipid products (diacylglycerol, sphingosine-1 phosphate, and glucosyl ceramide), reactive oxygen species, oncogenes (such as the tumor suppressor gene p53), protein kinases (protein kinase C and phosphoinositide-3 kinase), and external stimuli (hematopoietic growth factors and the extracellular matrix).

METHODS AND RESULTS: Retrospective study of bone marrow trephine biopsy specimens from patients with LPL, compared with selected cases representing chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and multiple myeloma (MM) of known immunoglobulin light and heavy chain phenotype. Bone marrow mast cells were counted following immunohistochemical staining of sections for mast cell tryptase. We have confirmed previous observations that mast cell numbers are increased in bone marrow infiltrates of LPL. However, we found similarly high mast cell numbers in CLL. High mast cell numbers were associated with neoplastic lymphoid cells expressing an IgM kappa phenotype. Mast cell numbers were low in all cases of MM studied and in controls with no lymphoma present. We observed an apparent bias towards kappa light chain expression in our cases of LPL. CONCLUSIONS: Mast cell number should not be considered a reliable factor in the differential diagnosis of LPL and CLL when assessing bone marrow histology. Possible bias towards kappa light chain expression in LPL requires further study, as do the mechanism and functions of mast cell recruitment by neoplastic lymphoid cells.","['Wilkins, B S', 'Buchan, S L', 'Webster, J', 'Jones, D B']","['Wilkins BS', 'Buchan SL', 'Webster J', 'Jones DB']","['Division of Cancer Sciences, University of Southampton, Southampton SO16 6YD, UK. bsw2@soton.ac.uk']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/metabolism/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/enzymology/*pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/metabolism/pathology', 'Serine Endopeptidases/*analysis', 'Tryptases']",2001/08/09 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/09 10:00'],"['2001/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']","['his1173 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2559.2001.01173.x [doi]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 2001 Aug;39(2):150-5. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2559.2001.01173.x.,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.59 (Tryptases)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent advances in the biology of the malignant cell in CLL lead to a scenario comprised of two basic elements: first, CLL cells are optimally organized to survive in their niches because their ability to undergo apoptosis is severely hampered; second, they have a microenvironment-dependence that promotes their extended survival, a situation that arises most probably through direct cell-to-cell contacts. In addition, CLL cells themselves are the major accessory cells in CLL, but are inefficient antigen-presenting cells.

Toxicity, efficiency, and leukemogenic potential were studied. PATIENTS: 483 patients with a documented PV, aged more than 65 years at diagnosis, were included between 1980 and 1996 in a prospective study comparing 32P alone and 32P followed by low-dose HU maintenance therapy. Blood cell counts were performed every two months and a clinical evaluation by a specialist was obtained every four or six months. RESULTS: Treatments were well tolerated, but chronic leg ulcers were observed in the maintenance therapy arm. The risk of leukemia was about 15% at the 15th year in the group of patients treated by 32P alone, but reached 30% in the group receiving maintenance therapy. In both arms, there was no significant correlation between occurrence of leukemia and the total dose of 32P. There was a correlation between the leukemic risk and disease severity, estimated on the frequency of relapse. Cancer occurrence was slightly higher than expected in the maintenance arm. HU treatment did not protect against progression to myelofibrosis, probably due to the lack of maintenance of an efficient myeloid or megakaryocytic suppression. Median life-span was slightly shorter in the group receiving HU maintenance. In all cases, life-span was only one year lower than that observed in the reference population. CONCLUSION: For all these reasons, we suggest the us of 32P alone in elderly patients; complementary chemotherapy should only be prescribed in the cases with short-term relapse, and late resistance to 32P.","['Najean, Y', 'Rain, J D', 'Goguel, A', 'Grange, M J', 'Vigneron, N', 'Dupuy, E', 'Mougeot-Martin, M']","['Najean Y', 'Rain JD', 'Goguel A', 'Grange MJ', 'Vigneron N', 'Dupuy E', 'Mougeot-Martin M']","['Service de Medecine Nucleaire, Hopital Saint-Louis, 1 avenue Claude-Vellefaux, 75475 Paris.']",['fre'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",France,Ann Med Interne (Paris),Annales de medecine interne,0171744,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Phosphorus Radioisotopes/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Polycythemia Vera/mortality/*therapy', 'Prospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Survival Rate']",2001/08/09 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/09 10:00'],"['2001/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Med Interne (Paris). 1998 Mar;149(2):87-93.,"['0 (Phosphorus Radioisotopes)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']",,,,,Traitement des polyglobulies.

DATA SOURCES AND EXTRACTION: Most significant French and English-language papers published between 1981 and 1997 dealing with either ET, LT, clonality, cytogenetics, alkylating agents or hydroxyurea were reviewed. Patient characteristics, clinical presentation, bone marrow and cytogenetic findings, and survival data were extracted from each case report and review, and possible risk factors were analyzed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Despite the existence of clonal hematopoiesis in up to 60-80% of patients with ET, suggesting an intrinsic potential for subsequent leukemia, spontaneous LT is poorly documented and the common presumption that TL occurs in excess in treated patients with ET is still questionable. The incidence of LT, probably underestimated in the past, varies from 0.7% to 5.3% in retrospective series, and from 8% to 12% in prospective studies. Recurrent cytogenetic abnormalities are significantly more frequent and complex in marrow karyotypes performed at the time of blastic crisis, as compared with those performed at diagnosis. A review of 62 reports of LT highlights some important characteristics: a) LT can occur anytime during the chronic phase of ET, especially within the first eight years, b) all subtypes of leukemia are described, notably unclassifiable cases and megakary oblastic acute leukemias, c) bone marrow fibrosis is frequent, as is a progressive onset of a myelodysplastic syndrome preceeding the blastic crisis, d) the prognosis of LT is very poor, two-third of all patients die within 6 months. Apart from the onset of a myelodysplastic syndrome, which carries a poor outcome, there is no well-established risk factor of LT. The leukemogenic risk of myelosuppressive therapies, clearly demonstrated for years in polycythemia vera, cannot be directly ascertained in patients with ET, but is suggested by various indirect observations. This putative risk of inducing secondary leukemia affects not only alkylating agents but also hydroxyurea. CONCLUSION: LT is a highly serious and largely unpredictable complication of ET. The current debate on the specific risk of myelosuppressive treatments deserves large-scale prospective randomized studies. Until this crucial point is elucidated, any cytotoxic therapy should be reserved to elderly and/or symptomatic patients and to those having other vascular risk factors.","['Liozon, E', 'Turlure, P']","['Liozon E', 'Turlure P']","['Service de Medecine Interne A, CHRU Dupytren, 2, rue Martin-Luther-King, 87042 Limoges.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",France,Ann Med Interne (Paris),Annales de medecine interne,0171744,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/*complications/diagnosis/pathology']",2001/08/09 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/09 10:00'],"['2001/08/09 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/09 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Ann Med Interne (Paris). 1998 Mar;149(2):82-6.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],41,,,,Risque leucemique des thrombocytemies.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the physiological effects of fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-8b and the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene on G8 myogenic cells were examined. FGF-8b was found to strongly stimulate myogenic cell proliferation. Signal transduction assays using AP-1/SEAP and E-box/SEAP reporters revealed that the transcriptional factors junB/c-fos and c-myc were involved in FGF-8b-stimulated G8 cell growth. Besides examining factors that positively stimulate myogenic cell growth, we also examined genes that negatively affect cell growth. PML is a growth suppressor gene and we studied its expression in G8 cells under different growth conditions. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that in the presence of low serum, PML was expressed in approximately 23.2% of all cultured G8 cells. However, under normal culture conditions (10% serum), PML expression dropped to about 2.6%. We found that the PML gene acted antagonistically to FGF-8b, as the overexpression of PML in G8 cells significantly inhibited FGF-8b-stimulated cell proliferation. It also inhibited AP-1 and E-box transactivation. However, we believe that PML functions as a stress-response gene in G8 cells rather than as a gene normally involved in regulating muscle development.","['Kwong, W H', 'Tang, M K', 'Yew, D T', 'Chan, J Y', 'Cai, D Q', 'Tong, W M', 'Lee, K K']","['Kwong WH', 'Tang MK', 'Yew DT', 'Chan JY', 'Cai DQ', 'Tong WM', 'Lee KK']","[""Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Biol Signals Recept,Biological signals and receptors,9808792,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Physiological Phenomena', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Culture Media/pharmacology', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 8', 'Fibroblast Growth Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Genes, Reporter', 'Genes, Synthetic', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Luminescent Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Mice', 'Muscle, Skeletal/cytology/*drug effects', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*physiology', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics/physiology', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/physiology', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Signal Transduction', 'Stress, Physiological/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*physiology', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins']",2001/08/08 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['46895 [pii]', '10.1159/000046895 [doi]']",ppublish,Biol Signals Recept. 2001 Sep-Oct;10(5):285-93. doi: 10.1159/000046895.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Fgf8 protein, mouse)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Pml protein, mouse)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)', '148997-75-5 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 8)', '62031-54-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factors)']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 S.

Remarkably, the peptide presentation pattern of splenocytes and that of macrophages purified from spleens of L. monocytogenes-infected mice were different from those of in vitro infected macrophage-like cell lines. The in vivo Ag presentation pattern of splenocytes also exhibited dynamic changes during the first 48 h of infection. In vivo peptide presentation at later time points postinfection was biased toward immunodominant CD8 T cell epitopes, while at an early time point, 6 h postinfection, subdominant and dominant CD8 T cell epitopes were presented with similar strength. In summary, our studies show that Ag presentation during an infection is a highly dynamic process that only can be fully appreciated by the study of cells infected in their physiological environment.","['Skoberne, M', 'Holtappels, R', 'Hof, H', 'Geginat, G']","['Skoberne M', 'Holtappels R', 'Hof H', 'Geginat G']","['Institut fur Medizinische Mikrobiologie und Hygiene, Fakultat fur Klinische Medizin Mannheim der Universitat Heidelberg, Mannheim, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigen Presentation', 'Bacterial Proteins/immunology/isolation & purification/metabolism', '*Bacterial Toxins', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism/transplantation', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay/methods', 'Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte/administration & dosage/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/immunology/metabolism', 'Hemolysin Proteins', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388', 'Listeria monocytogenes/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Count', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Organ Specificity/immunology', 'Peptide Fragments/immunology/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Spleen/immunology/metabolism/microbiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.4049/jimmunol.167.4.2209 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunol. 2001 Aug 15;167(4):2209-18. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.167.4.2209.,"['0 (60 kDa protein, Listeria monocytogenes)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Bacterial Toxins)', '0 (Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (Hemolysin Proteins)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'R06ZRQ1YX9 (hlyA protein, Listeria monocytogenes)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We undertook an extensive analysis of normal human Ikaros expression to determine whether novel mRNAs are expressed as proteins and the extent to which these splice variants are unique to leukemia. Here we show that both mRNA and protein for DNA nonbinding Ikaros isoforms and splice variants previously linked to leukemia are expressed in normal human cells.

It is also phosphorylated upon activation of many receptors and cytoplamic tyrosine kinases. However, the biological functions of p62(dok) in normal cell signaling as well as in p210(bcr-abl) leukemogenesis are as yet not fully understood. Here we show, in hemopoietic and nonhemopoietic cells derived from p62(dok)-(/)- mice, that the loss of p62(dok) results in increased cell proliferation upon growth factor treatment. Moreover, Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation is markedly sustained in p62(dok)-(/)- cells after the removal of growth factor. However, p62(dok) inactivation does not affect DNA damage and growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, p62(dok) inactivation causes a significant shortening in the latency of the fatal myeloproliferative disease induced by retroviral-mediated transduction of p210(bcr-abl) in bone marrow cells. These data indicate that p62(dok) acts as a negative regulator of growth factor-induced cell proliferation, at least in part through downregulating Ras/MAPK signaling pathway, and that p62(dok) can oppose leukemogenesis by p210(bcr-abl).","['Di Cristofano, A', 'Niki, M', 'Zhao, M', 'Karnell, F G', 'Clarkson, B', 'Pear, W S', 'Van Aelst, L', 'Pandolfi, P P']","['Di Cristofano A', 'Niki M', 'Zhao M', 'Karnell FG', 'Clarkson B', 'Pear WS', 'Van Aelst L', 'Pandolfi PP']","['Department of Human Genetics, Molecular Biology Program, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, 1275 York Avenue, New York, NY 10021, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cells, Cultured', '*DNA-Binding Proteins', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*etiology/metabolism/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoproteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Signal Transduction', 'ras Proteins/*metabolism']",2001/08/08 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.194.3.275 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 2001 Aug 6;194(3):275-84. doi: 10.1084/jem.194.3.275.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (DOK1 protein, human)', '0 (Dok1 protein, mouse)', '0 (GAP-associated protein p62)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (ras Proteins)']",,"['CA08748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA64593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC2193466,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous immunogold labeling of membrane sheets showed that resting Fc(epsilon)RI colocalize loosely with Lyn, whereas cross-linked Fc(epsilon)RI redistribute into specialized domains (osmiophilic patches) that exclude Lyn, accumulate Syk, and are often bordered by coated pits. Here, the distribution of Fc(epsilon)RI beta is mapped relative to linker for activation of T cells (LAT), Grb2-binding protein 2 (Gab2), two PLCgamma isoforms, and the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), all implicated in the remodeling of membrane inositol phospholipids. Before activation, PLCgamma1 and Gab2 are not strongly membrane associated, LAT occurs in small membrane clusters separate from receptor, and PLCgamma2, that coprecipitates with LAT, occurs in clusters and along cytoskeletal cables. After activation, PLCgamma2, Gab2, and a portion of p85 colocalize with Fc(epsilon)RI beta in osmiophilic patches. LAT clusters enlarge within 30 s of receptor activation, forming elongated complexes that can intersect osmiophilic patches without mixing. PLCgamma1 and another portion of p85 associate preferentially with activated LAT. Supporting multiple distributions of PI3-kinase, Fc(epsilon)RI cross-linking increases PI3-kinase activity in anti-LAT, anti-Fc(epsilon)RIbeta, and anti-Gab2 immune complexes. We propose that activated mast cells propagate signals from primary domains organized around Fc(epsilon)RIbeta and from secondary domains, including one organized around LAT.","['Wilson, B S', 'Pfeiffer, J R', 'Surviladze, Z', 'Gaudet, E A', 'Oliver, J M']","['Wilson BS', 'Pfeiffer JR', 'Surviladze Z', 'Gaudet EA', 'Oliver JM']","['Department of Pathology and Cancer Research and Treatment Center, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, NM 87131, USA. bwilson@salud.unm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,IM,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing', 'Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Membrane/*chemistry/enzymology/ultrastructure', 'Cross-Linking Reagents/chemistry', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Isoenzymes/analysis/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mast Cells/*chemistry/cytology/enzymology', 'Membrane Microdomains/chemistry/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/analysis/metabolism', 'Phospholipase C gamma', 'Phosphoproteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*analysis/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/analysis/metabolism']",2001/08/08 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1083/jcb.200104049 [doi]', '154/3/645 [pii]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 2001 Aug 6;154(3):645-58. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200104049.,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Cross-Linking Reagents)', '0 (Gab2 protein, rat)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.4.3 (Phospholipase C gamma)']",,"['R01 GM049814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM49814/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC2196429,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we provide evidence for metabolic phenotypic changes in cultured K562 human myeloid blast cells after treatment with increasing doses of STI571 using [1,2-13C2]glucose as the single tracer and biological mass spectrometry. In response to 0.68 and 6.8 microm STI571, proliferation of Bcr-Abl-positive K562 cells showed a 57% and 74% decrease, respectively, whereas glucose label incorporation into RNA decreased by 13.4% and 30.1%, respectively, through direct glucose oxidation, as indicated by the decrease in the m1/Sigma(m)n ratio in RNA. Based on the in vitro proliferation data, the IC50 of STI571 in K562 cultures is 0.56 microm. The decrease in 13C label incorporation into RNA ribose was accompanied by a significant fall in hexokinase and glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase activities. The activity of transketolase, the enzyme responsible for nonoxidative ribose synthesis in the pentose cycle, was less affected, and there was a relative increase in glucose carbon incorporation into RNA through nonoxidative synthesis as indicated by the increase in the m2/Sigma(m)n ratio in RNA. The restricted use of glucose carbons for de novo nucleic acid and fatty acid synthesis by altering metabolic enzyme activities and pathway carbon flux of the pentose cycle constitutes the underlying mechanism by which STI571 inhibits leukemia cell glucose substrate utilization and growth. The administration of specific hexokinase/glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase inhibitor anti-metabolite substrates or competitive enzyme inhibitor compounds, alone or in combination, should be explored for the treatment of STI571-resistant advanced leukemias as well as that of Bcr-Abl-negative human malignancies.","['Boren, J', 'Cascante, M', 'Marin, S', 'Comin-Anduix, B', 'Centelles, J J', 'Lim, S', 'Bassilian, S', 'Ahmed, S', 'Lee, W N', 'Boros, L G']","['Boren J', 'Cascante M', 'Marin S', 'Comin-Anduix B', 'Centelles JJ', 'Lim S', 'Bassilian S', 'Ahmed S', 'Lee WN', 'Boros LG']","[""Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Institut d'Investigacions Biomediques August Pi i Sunyer, University of Barcelona, Marti i Franques 1, Barcelona 08028, Spain.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Benzamides', 'Carbon/metabolism', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids/*biosynthesis', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Hexokinase/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Nucleic Acids/*biosynthesis', 'Piperazines/*pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Transketolase/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M105796200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)64938-0 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Oct 12;276(41):37747-53. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M105796200.

We investigated the antitumor activity of S 23906-1 against several murine transplantable tumors (C38 colon carcinoma, P388 leukemia, B16 melanoma, and Lewis lung carcinoma) and in orthotopic models of human lung (NCI-H460 and A549), ovarian (IGROV1 and NIH:OVCAR-3), and colorectal cancers (HCT116 and HT-29). Against established C38 colon carcinoma, S 23906-1 administered twice i.v. from 1.56-6.25 mg/kg markedly inhibited tumor growth. Treatment at the optimal dose (6.25 mg/kg) induced tumor regression in all of the mice. Acronycine was 16-fold less potent and only moderately active at the maximum tolerated dose, 100 mg/kg. Against other murine tumors of the former National Cancer Institute panel, S 23906-1 was either only moderately active or totally inactive. When evaluated in human orthotopic models, S 23906-1 given p.o. or i.v. demonstrated a marked antitumor activity against human carcinomas. In the two human lung cancer models, S 23906-1 increased the survival of the animals in a dose-dependent manner and induced treated versus control values of 162% (NCI-H460) and 193% (A549). Vinorelbine was less active, with treated versus control values of 119% and 174%, respectively. A significant survival benefit was also observed against the two i.p. ovarian tumors in which S 23906-1 was as active as paclitaxel, inducing 80% long-term survivors in the NIH:OVCAR-3 model. Lastly, S 23906-1 inhibited the growth of primary HT-29 and HCT116 colon tumors grafted onto the cecum as efficiently as irinotecan and eradicated the formation of lymph node, hepatic, and pulmonary metastases in the aggressive HCT116 model.

We previously reported that GLO1 was a resistant factor to antitumor agent-induced apoptosis, and that S-p-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester (BBGC), an effective inhibitor of GLO1, selectively sensitized to etoposide the drug-resistant human leukemia cells that overexpressed GLO1. In this study, we quantitatively measured GLO1 enzyme activity in various human solid tumor cells, and the antiproliferative effect of the GLO1 inhibitor was examined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: BBGC-induced apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. To evaluate antitumor activity of BBGC in vivo, we developed human cancer xenografts in nude mice. RESULTS: We found that GLO1 enzyme activity was higher in all of the 38 human cancer cell lines that we examined than in the normal tissue samples. Moreover, GLO1 activity was frequently elevated in human lung carcinoma cells. Positive correlation between cellular GLO1 activity and BBGC sensitivity was observed in the lung cancer cell lines. Human lung cancer NCI-H522 and DMS114 cells, expressing higher GLO1 activity, underwent apoptosis when treated with BBGC, whereas A549 cells, expressing lower activity, did not. BBGC induced the activation of the stress-activated protein kinases c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which led to caspase activation in GLO1-overexpressing tumor cells. BBGC significantly inhibited the growth of xenografted DMS114 and human prostate cancer DU-145. CONCLUSIONS: Our present results indicate that GLO1 is a tumor-specific target enzyme especially in human lung carcinoma cells and that the GLO1 inhibitor is a potent chemotherapeutic agent to repress GLO1-overexpressing human tumors.","['Sakamoto, H', 'Mashima, T', 'Sato, S', 'Hashimoto, Y', 'Yamori, T', 'Tsuruo, T']","['Sakamoto H', 'Mashima T', 'Sato S', 'Hashimoto Y', 'Yamori T', 'Tsuruo T']","['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, Tokyo 170-8455, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,IM,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Lactoylglutathione Lyase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Lung Neoplasms/enzymology/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/drug effects/metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2001/08/08 10:00,2001/10/19 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/19 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Aug;7(8):2513-8.,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '166038-00-2 (S-4-bromobenzylglutathione cyclopentyl diester)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)', 'EC 4.4.1.5 (Lactoylglutathione Lyase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The maximum tolerated dose was 375 mg/kg/day; higher doses led to dose-limiting reversible neurocortical toxicity. At the maximum tolerated dose, PB was extremely well tolerated, with no significant toxicities; median steady-state plasma concentration at this dose was 0.29 +/- 0.16 mM. Although no patients achieved complete or partial remission, four patients achieved hematological improvement (neutrophils in three, platelet transfusion-independence in one). Other patients developed transient increases in neutrophils or platelets and decrements in circulating blasts. Monitoring of the percentage of clonal cells using centromere fluorescence in situ hybridization over the course of PB administration showed that hematopoiesis remained clonal. Hematological response was often associated with increases in both colony-forming units-granulocyte-macrophage and leukemic colony-forming units.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Recipient conditioning consisted of fludarabine 30 mg/m(2) on days -6 to -2 and i.v. busulfan 3.3 mg/kg on days -6 to -5. Antithymocyte globuline was added at 2.5 mg/kg i.v. on days -5 to -2. The patients were grafted with bone marrow (n = 13) or peripheral blood stem cells either unmanipulated (n = 20) or CD34+ selected (n = 9). Graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis was performed with cyclosporine A (CsA, n = 12), CsA/methotrexate (n = 12), or CsA/mycophenolate mofetil (n = 18). RESULTS: With a median follow-up of 13 months (range, 5-26 months), the actuarial disease-free survival is 64% and 38% for patients with lymphoid malignancies and standard-risk leukemia compared with only 14% for patients with high-risk disease. The main cause of treatment failure was relapse of disease in high-risk patients (n = 14). An increased incidence of primary (n = 1) or secondary graft-failure (n = 8) was observed (21%). Chimerism analysis of CD56+/CD3--sorted natural killer (NK) cells, available in 10 patients, showed an impaired increase of donor NK cell chimerism between day 10 and 30 after transplantation in three of four patients with graft failure, whereas the percentage of donor NK cells surpassed 75% in all of the six patients with stable engraftment.

We investigated the effect of IL-6 on the survival of rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells and analyzed the signaling pathways of the cytokine by means of some kinase inhibitors. IL-6 protects PC12 cells from the death induced by serum deprivation or anticancer agents, such as cisplatin, paclitaxel and 5-fluorouracil. Phosphatidylinositol (PI)3-kinase inhibitors (LY294002 and wortmannin) but not a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor (PD98059) completely suppressed the IL-6-promoted survival of the cells. A Janus tyrosine kinase 2 inhibitor (tyrphostin AG490) suppressed the phosphorylation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3 and only partially inhibited the anti-apoptotic activity of IL-6. IL-6 stimulated phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream effector of PI3 kinase, and in the presence of LY294002, the phosphorylation of Akt was reduced to basal level. These results suggest that the signaling pathway for the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 in PC12 cells is mediated in major part by activation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway and thus is different from that in hematopoietic cells.","['Kunioku, H', 'Inoue, K', 'Tomida, M']","['Kunioku H', 'Inoue K', 'Tomida M']","['Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, 818 Komuro, Ina, 362-0806, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Ireland,Neurosci Lett,Neuroscience letters,7600130,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects/physiology', 'Central Nervous System/drug effects/metabolism', 'Culture Media, Serum-Free/pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Drug Interactions/physiology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Neurons/drug effects/metabolism', 'Neuroprotective Agents/*pharmacology', 'PC12 Cells/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt', 'Rats', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology', 'Trans-Activators/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects/physiology']",2001/08/08 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0304-3940(01)02012-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3940(01)02012-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Neurosci Lett. 2001 Aug 17;309(1):13-6. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3940(01)02012-2.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Culture Media, Serum-Free)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Neuroprotective Agents)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Stat3 protein, rat)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Akt1 protein, rat)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a consequence, virus pseudotyping has been developed to endow transfection competent viruses with improved cell binding specificities and affinities. We have hypothesized that chemical conjugation of a virus to a cell specific ligand might also alter its target cell specificity and produce a virus that would transfect only the desired cell type. To test this concept, an ecotropic replication-defective myeloproliferative sarcoma retrovirus and an amphotropic murine adenovirus containing the gene for beta-galactosidase were chemically derivatized with folic acid. As expected from its strong ecotropism, the unmodified retrovirus did not induce beta-galactosidase expression in nonhost KB cells, while the amphotropic adenovirus yielded high levels of gene expression in the same cell line. Surprisingly, although folate derivatization enabled avid binding of both viruses to folate receptor expressing KB cells, the folate conjugation did not promote retroviral gene expression and actually prevented the normal beta-galactosidase expression seen with the adenoviral vector. The fact that co-administration of excess free folic acid to block uptake by folate receptor-mediated endocytosis restored adenoviral gene expression to the level obtained with unmodified virus suggests that folate derivatization per se does not hamper viral activity. We, therefore, conclude that neither retroviral nor adenoviral delivery via the folate endocytosis pathway is compatible with viral gene expression in KB cells.","['Reddy, J A', 'Clapp, D W', 'Low, P S']","['Reddy JA', 'Clapp DW', 'Low PS']","['Department of Chemistry, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN 47907-1393, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Control Release,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,8607908,IM,"['Adenoviridae/*genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/*drug effects', 'Conjugation, Genetic', 'Endocytosis/*drug effects', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Lac Operon/genetics', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'beta-Galactosidase/metabolism']",2001/08/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0168365901003169 [pii]', '10.1016/s0168-3659(01)00316-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Control Release. 2001 Jul 6;74(1-3):77-82. doi: 10.1016/s0168-3659(01)00316-9.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', 'EC 3.2.1.23 (beta-Galactosidase)']",,['HL63219/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But the clinical significance of AC133 expression on leukemic blasts is not yet known. We investigated the expression of AC133 antigen on blast cells of acute leukemia. Forty-one cases of acute leukemia were examined for expression of AC133, CD34, and other antigens using multicolor flow-cytometry. Samples were considered positive if at least 20% of the cells specifically stained with monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) revealed a higher fluorescence intensity compared to cells of corresponding negative control samples (=20% cut-off level). 14/36 (38.9%) acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) samples and 6/20 (30%) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) samples were positive for AC133, the difference was not significant. All AC133 positive (AC133(+)) leukemias expressed CD34, whereas 13 of 33 CD34(+) leukemias were negative for AC133, and AC133(+)/CD34(-) leukemia was not found. Expression rates of CD31, CD62L, CD62E, CD105 and CD144 were significantly higher in AC133(+) leukemia compared to those of AC133(-) leukemia (P=0.045, P<0.001, P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.003, respectively), but bcl-2, CXCR-1, CXCR4, VLA-4, CD106 expression rates were not significantly different between AC133(+) and AC133(-) leukemias. None of the clinical prognostic markers such as age, hemogram, lactate dehydrogenase, and chromosomal aberration were significantly different between AC133(+) and AC133(-) leukemias. CR rates of AC133(+) AML and AC133(-) AML were not significantly different, although there was a trend toward higher CR rates in AC133(-) AML (18/22[81.8%] AC133(-) AML versus 9/14[64.3%] AC133(+) AML), but the 1-year relapse rate of AC133(+) AML was significantly higher than that of AC133(-) AML (8/9 (88.9%) versus 7/19 (36.8%), P=0.016). Median disease-free survival (DFS) times of AC133(+) and AC133(-) AML were significantly different (11 and 18 months, respectively, P=0.006), although overall survival (OS) times were not significantly different (AC133(+) 15 months versus AC133(-) 20 months, respectively, P=0.06). Similar results regarding clinical outcomes were found when AC133(+)/CD34(+) and AC133(-)/CD34(+) were analyzed separately, but the difference did not attain statistical significance. In ALL, 9/11 (81.8%) AC133(-) and 2/4 (50%) AC133(+) cases achieved CR, but the difference was not significant. Four of 11 AC133(-) ALL (36.4%) and 2 of 3 AC133(+) ALL (66.7%) relapsed within 1 year. In survival analysis, median DFS time and OS time of the AC133(+) group were 7 and 18 months, respectively, and these were not significantly different from those of the AC133(-) group (median DFS 15, OS 22 months, respectively). Our results demonstrate that AC133 expression in AML blasts is associated with poor clinical outcomes in terms of higher early relapse and shorter disease-free survival, suggesting that the AC133 antigen might provide the prognostic stratification of acute leukemia. However, to verify the effect of AC133 expression on the therapeutic outcomes of adult acute leukemia, further study including more cases is needed.","['Lee, S T', 'Jang, J H', 'Min, Y H', 'Hahn, J S', 'Ko, Y W']","['Lee ST', 'Jang JH', 'Min YH', 'Hahn JS', 'Ko YW']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seodaemun-ku Shinchon-dong 134, PO Box 8044, 120-752, Seoul, South Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['AC133 Antigen', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD', 'Antigens, CD34/analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Glycoproteins/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/metabolism/mortality/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Peptides/*analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/08/08 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0145212601000169 [pii]', '10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00016-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 2001 Sep;25(9):757-67. doi: 10.1016/s0145-2126(01)00016-9.,"['0 (AC133 Antigen)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (PROM1 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The goals of this work were to further differentiate the normal and leukemia specific antigens relative to protein structure, determine if other protein distinctions exist, and examine p53 gene family expression in both cell types. Recognized by the monoclonal antibody 2A4, normal cells express a 185-kDa glycoprotein that may have multiple forms. Detected by the monoclonal antibody 1E10, leukemic cells express a very hydrophobic 252-kDa glycoprotein that is likely to be a transmembrane protein with spectrin/dystrophin-like characteristics. After normalization to the major cytoskeletal protein actin, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals major distinguishing protein and glycoprotein differences between the two cell types. Most obvious is the near-absence of tubulin in the non-mitotic normal hemocytes.

METHODS: Genomic DNA from 49 MDS, 38 AML and 37 AA patients and 276 controls was analysed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The frequencies of GSTM1 (73.6%) and GSTT1 (34.2%) null genotypes were significantly higher in AML patients than in the controls (36.9 and 18.1%, respectively). A higher frequency of the combined null genotype for both genes was also observed in patients with AML (26.3% compared with 5.0% in the controls).

According to the expression of CD10 and CD44, we established the following five stages of BCP-ALL phenotypes that may represent different forms of interaction between BCP-ALL and bone marrow-adherent cells: stage 1, CD19+, CD44bright, CD10-; stage 2, CD19+, CD44bright, CD10dim/bright; stage 3, CD19+, CD44dim, CD10bright, CD20-/+; stage 4, CD19+, CD44dim, CD10dim, CD20+; and stage 5, CD19+, CD44bright, CD10-, CD20+. Next, we analyzed the modulation of CD44 according to the expression of the different BCP-ALL phenotypes by incubating the samples under different culture conditions, including addition of stromal cells and interleukin (IL)-7. In culture, the samples in stages 1 and 2 maintained high expression of CD44 and re-expressed this molecule when cultured after trypsin treatment, indicating ongoing synthesis of CD44. Similarly, the stage 3 samples cultured in the presence of stromal cells, IL-7, or both also upregulated CD44 expression in culture. In contrast, the low expression of CD44 on the presumably more mature stage 4 samples was not modified by the addition of stromal cells or IL-7 or when cultured after trypsin treatment, suggesting that those cells had arrested CD44 synthesis. We concluded that down-modulation of CD44 occurred in association with differentiation to phenotype stages 3 and 4 and we hypothesized that this down-modulation might be associated with the exit of BCP-ALL from the bone marrow.","['Zittermann, S I', 'Achino, B I', 'Agriello, E E', 'Halperin, N', 'Ramhorst, R E', 'Fainboim, L']","['Zittermann SI', 'Achino BI', 'Agriello EE', 'Halperin N', 'Ramhorst RE', 'Fainboim L']","['Laboratory of Immunogenetics, Hospital de Clinicas, School of Medicine, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*pathology', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronan Receptors/*metabolism', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-7/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Stromal Cells']",2001/08/08 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['ejh325 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.066006377.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Jun;66(6):377-82. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.066006377.x.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Hyaluronan Receptors)', '0 (Interleukin-7)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AML blast expression of the PDGF-receptor alpha-chain was detected for a subset of patients (45%), whereas PDGF-receptor beta-chain expression was detected for most patients (90%). Constitutive AML blast release of the PDGF-AB isoform (the major form also derived from normal platelets) was detected for 43% of patients, whereas PDGF-BB release was not detected for any patient. The PDGF isoforms AA, AB and BB had dose-dependent and divergent effects on spontaneous and cytokine-dependent AML blast proliferation, whereas for constitutive cytokine secretion (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha) inhibitory effects were rare and all three isoforms usually had no effect or enhanced the constitutive secretion. The PDGF effects were caused by a direct effect on the AML blasts and were not dependent on the presence of serum. The PDGF effects could also be detected after in vitro culture of AML cells in the presence of IL-4+granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor. PF-4 had divergent effects on proliferation and cytokine secretion by native AML blasts. Our results suggest that exogenous (e.g. platelet-secreted) PDGF and PF-4 can function as regulators of leukemic hematopoiesis and possibly also modulate the function of residual AML cells in peripheral blood stem cell grafts. On the other hand, endogenous release of PDGF-AB by native blasts may modulate the function of normal cells in the bone marrow microenvironment (e.g. bone marrow stromal cells).","['Foss, B', 'Ulvestad, E', 'Bruserud , O']","['Foss B', 'Ulvestad E', 'Bruserud O']","['Institute of Medicine, University of Bergen, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytokines/drug effects/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Platelet Factor 4/pharmacology', 'Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Protein Isoforms/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",2001/08/08 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['ejh430 [pii]', '10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.066006365.x [doi]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2001 Jun;66(6):365-76. doi: 10.1034/j.1600-0609.2001.066006365.x.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', '37270-94-3 (Platelet Factor 4)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptors, Platelet-Derived Growth Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,['Eur J Haematol. 2001 Oct;67(4):267-78.

The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of As2O3 at therapeutic concentrations on cell viability and apoptosis on leukemic cells from patients with non-M3 acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and to study the resistance profile compared to conventional AML drugs. Cells from 20 patients were exposed to therapeutic concentrations of As2O3 continuously for 96 h. As2O3 reduced the viability in blast cells from all the 20 tested patients compared to unexposed controls (p-value: 0.02 at 0.05 microM; <0.005 at 1.0 microM and higher concentrations). An increase in the apoptotic rate was also seen after incubation with As2O3. Parallel to the incubation with arsenic the in vitro sensitivity to a number of chemotherapeutic agents commonly used in AML was studied. Correlation coefficients for the in vitro sensitivity were highly significant between the conventional AML drugs except for Ara-C. For As2O3, all the correlation coefficients were negative and ranged between -0.05 and -0.51. Furthermore, increased P-gp expression in a multidrug resistant HL-60 cell line did not decrease the sensitivity to As2O3 as compared to the parental cell line. Neither did a P-gp-transfected variant of the K562 cell line show decreased sensitivity to As2O3. We conclude that As2O3 at therapeutic concentrations induces apoptosis and cytotoxic effects in blast cells from patients with non-M3 AML, and that As2O3 differs from conventional AML drugs with respect to the mechanisms that confer resistance to the drugs.","['Lehmann, S', 'Bengtzen, S', 'Paul, A', 'Christensson, B', 'Paul, C']","['Lehmann S', 'Bengtzen S', 'Paul A', 'Christensson B', 'Paul C']","['Department of Hematology, Huddinge University Hospital, Karolinska Institute, Huddinge, Sweden.

Several flow cytometric approaches are designed to detect this antigen deficiency. But they all require drawing and testing of normal samples as control. Therefore, in the present study two flow cytometric assays for the detection of CD55 and CD59 deficiency in erythrocytes (REDQUANT CD55/CD59) and granulocytes (CELLQUANT CD55/CD59) are proposed. Precalibrated beads are used to define the cut off between normal and deficient cell populations. The specificity of the tests has been evaluated in healthy blood donors (n=52) resulting in a clear and reproducible cut off (3%) for the normal percentage of GPI-deficient cells. This cut off has been confirmed in leukaemia and lymphoma patients not suspected for developing PNH. The sensitivity has been tested in patients suffering from known PNH (n=23). Both tests performed in combination allowed a reliable detection of PNH in all patients showing antigen deficiencies in both cell types in most patients (20/23). In contrast, the PNH clones in the investigated patients with MDS (4/19) or AA (4/22) were present in granulocytes or erythrocytes, only. This underlines the necessity of analysing erythrocytes as well as granulocytes. Preliminary data regarding a possible correlation between disease activity and percentage of antigen-deficient cells lead to the assumption that haemolytic crises can only be determined on granulocytes whereas deficient erythrocytes disappeared due to complement-mediated lysis of the PNH clone. In conclusion, the combination of the test kits enables the differential diagnosis of PNH clones in a standardized, simple and rapid approach which may have therapeutic consequences.","['Oelschlaegel, U', 'Besson, I', 'Arnoulet, C', 'Sainty, D', 'Nowak, R', 'Naumann, R', 'Bux, Y', 'Ehninger, G']","['Oelschlaegel U', 'Besson I', 'Arnoulet C', 'Sainty D', 'Nowak R', 'Naumann R', 'Bux Y', 'Ehninger G']","['Medical Clinic and Policlinic I, University Hospital Dresden, Haus 66a, Fetscherstrasse 74, 01307 Dresden, Germany. oelschlaegel@oncocentre.de']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,IM,"['CD55 Antigens/*immunology', 'CD59 Antigens/*immunology', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry/methods/standards', 'Granulocytes/immunology', 'Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/blood/*immunology', 'Humans']",2001/08/08 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']","['clh357 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1365-2257.2001.00357.x [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 2001 Apr;23(2):81-90. doi: 10.1046/j.1365-2257.2001.00357.x.,"['0 (CD55 Antigens)', '0 (CD59 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: A group of 29 children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) received Erwinia ASNase 30,000 IU/m2 every day for 10 days during multiagent induction therapy. Of these patients. 13 received i.v. therapy and 16 received i.m. therapy. During the reinduction phase the patients received Erwinia ASNase 30,000 IU/m2 twice a week for 2 weeks (Mondays and Thursdays) (8 patients in the i.v.-treated group and 11 patients in the i.m.-treated group). ASNase activity (spectrophotometric assay) was measured in plasma samples obtained from the patients at various times during therapy. RESULTS: The estimated half-life was 6.4 +/- 0.5 h (n = 13), the absorption rate after i.m. administration was found to limit elimination. The apparent volume of distribution corresponded well with the volume of plasma. The estimated clearance suggested that Erwinia ASNase is a low-clearance drug. Bioavailability after i.m. administration was (mean +/- SEM) 27.0 +/- 4.5% (range 11-61%; n = 12). CONCLUSIONS: In this study the pharmacokinetic parameters after i.v. and i.m. administration of Erwinia ASNase were determined based on a substantial number of patients.

The aim of this study was to establish whether there are differences in the rate and extent of development of resistance, both in vivo and in vitro, to these two newer Vinca alkaloids under identical selection conditions. METHODS: Using P388 leukaemia cells in vivo, it was evident that VFL induced drug resistance far less readily than NVB, as shown by the number of passages required to select for total resistance. Under in vitro conditions, using A549 human lung carcinoma cells, it was also clearly shown by drug sensitivity determinations that VFL was a less-potent inducer of drug resistance than NVB. Resistance resulting from either in vivo or in vitro selection was associated with a classic multidrug resistance profile. Further characterization of the drug-resistance phenotype of the most highly resistant A549 sublines showed that the level of total beta-tubulin expression appeared to be modified exclusively in the NVB-resistant cells. CONCLUSION: The clear demonstration that resistance to VFL developed far less readily than resistance to NVB both in vivo and in vitro may have potential clinical implications.","['Etievant, C', 'Kruczynski, A', 'Barret, J M', 'Tait, A S', 'Kavallaris, M', 'Hill, B T']","['Etievant C', 'Kruczynski A', 'Barret JM', 'Tait AS', 'Kavallaris M', 'Hill BT']","['Division de Cancerologie Experimentale I, Centre de Recherche Pierre Fabre, Castres, France. chantal.etievant@pierre-fabre.com']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Tubulin/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Vinorelbine']",2001/08/08 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800100275 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Jul;48(1):62-70. doi: 10.1007/s002800100275.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Tubulin)', '5BF646324K (vinflunine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', 'Q6C979R91Y (Vinorelbine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Acyl derivatives were prepared from DM-PEN and evaluated in vivo against human MX-1 breast tumor xenografts implanted subcutaneously (s.c.) or intracerebrally (i.c.). Several derivatives were also evaluated against other human tumor xenografts and murine P388 leukemia cell lines. RESULTS: Several of the acyl derivatives were found to be superior to DM-PEN against MX-1, human ZR-75-1 breast tumor, human U251 CNS tumor and the P388 leukemia parent cell line and lines resistant to cyclophosphamide and carmustine. 4-Demethyl-4-methoxyacetylpenclomedine showed inferior activity to current clinical brain tumor drugs against a glioma cell line, superior activity to temozolomide and procarbazine against the derived mismatch repair-deficient cell line, and superior activity to cyclophosphamide and carmustine but inferior activity to temozolomide against two ependymoma cell lines, all of which were implanted s.c. CONCLUSION: Proposed mechanisms of activation and action of DM-PEN and the acyl derivatives support the potential clinical superiority of the acyl derivatives.","['Struck, R F', 'Tiwari, A', 'Friedman, H S', 'Keir, S', 'Morgan, L R', 'Waud, W R']","['Struck RF', 'Tiwari A', 'Friedman HS', 'Keir S', 'Morgan LR', 'Waud WR']","['Southern Research Institute, Birmingham, AL 35255-5305, USA. struck@sri.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Brain Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Picolines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",2001/08/08 10:00,2001/08/31 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/31 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/s002800000255 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2001 Jul;48(1):47-52. doi: 10.1007/s002800000255.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Picolines)', '66Q80IL7CW (penclomedine)']",,"['P01 CA34200/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R44 CA85021/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We retrospectively analyzed the expression of multiple lymphoid, myelomonocytic, and megakaryocytic antigens on blast proliferations in 18 patients with Down syndrome (DS; AML, 9; TMD, 9). The AMLs and TMDs shared several immunophenotypic characteristics. Blasts in all expressed CD45, CD38, and CD33; most AMLs and all TMDs were CD36+; and the majority expressed CD41 and CD61, suggesting megakaryocytic differentiation. The majority of cases were CD34+, CD14-, and CD64-. There was aberrant expression of the T-cell-associated antigen CD7 in most AMLs and TMDs. CD56 was expressed aberrantly in 5 AMLs and 7 TMDs. The major difference between the disorders was the pattern of expression of myeloid markers CD11b and CD13; each was expressed in 8 AMLs but only 2 TMDs. Blasts were HLA-DR-positive in 3 AMLs vs 7 TMDs. Blasts in TMD and AML in DS have a characteristic immunophenotype distinct from AML in other settings. The immunophenotypic similarities suggest a biologic relationship between the disorders; however, distinct immunophenotypic differences also were observed.","['Karandikar, N J', 'Aquino, D B', 'McKenna, R W', 'Kroft, S H']","['Karandikar NJ', 'Aquino DB', 'McKenna RW', 'Kroft SH']","['Division of Hematopathology and Immunology, Department of Pathology, University of Texas-Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'CD11 Antigens/analysis', 'CD13 Antigens/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*immunology', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/*immunology']",2001/08/08 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/08/08 10:00'],"['2001/08/08 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/08 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1309/XREF-C9T2-6U0A-4EDT [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2001 Aug;116(2):204-10. doi: 10.1309/XREF-C9T2-6U0A-4EDT.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (CD11 Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', 'EC 3.4.11.2 (CD13 Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preclinical canine studies demonstrated that the use of potent pre- and postgrafting immunosuppression allows for reduction in conditioning regimens while facilitating development of stable mixed chimerism. If attenuated conditioning regimens can be successfully translated to human stem cell transplantation, an improved safety profile will allow potentially curative treatment to a more representative patient profile not currently offered such therapy.

Certain guidelines may facilitate this effort. Recruitment of endothelial cells by a tumor is an early event in angiogenesis, a process regulated at genetic and epigenetic levels. The microvascular endothelial cell has become an important second target in cancer therapy. Angiogenesis inhibitors are either ""direct"" or ""indirect"" and their optimal dosing depends on a different logic than conventional chemotherapy. Conversely, antiangiogenic scheduling of chemotherapy can by-pass drug resistance. Like all solid tumors, hematologic malignancies are angiogenesis-dependent. Further, angiogenesis is modulated by proteins and cells from the hematopoietic and hemostatic systems. Clinical testing of angiogenesis inhibitors has accentuated the need for surrogate markers of tumor angiogenesis activity. Microvessel density, so valuable as a prognostic indicator of metastatic risk, cannot determine efficacy of an angiogenesis inhibitor. In the future, angiogenesis inhibitors may be added to chemotherapy or to radiotherapy, or to other modalities. Also, combinations of angiogenesis inhibitors may be administered together.","['Folkman, J', 'Browder, T', 'Palmblad, J']","['Folkman J', 'Browder T', 'Palmblad J']","[""Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA. judah.folkman@tch.Harvard.edu""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,IM,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hemostatics/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Neoplasms/*blood supply/drug therapy', 'Neovascularization, Pathologic/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Practice Guidelines as Topic']",2001/08/07 10:00,2002/01/23 10:01,['2001/08/07 10:00'],"['2001/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/23 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['01070023 [pii]'],ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2001 Jul;86(1):23-33.,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hemostatics)']",102,['2 R01 CA64481-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clinical data were based on Phase III trial information from 207 AML patients who were randomized to receive either placebo or G-CSF post-induction therapy. Analyses were conducted using a decision analytic model with the primary source of clinical event probabilities based on in-hospital care with or without an active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics. Estimates of average daily costs of care with and without an infection were imputed from a previously reported economic model of a similar population. When compared to AML patients who received placebo, patients who received G-CSF had significantly fewer days on intravenous antibiotics (median 22 vs. 26, p = 0.05), whereas overall duration of hospitalization did not differ (median 29 days). The median cost per day with an active infection that required intravenous antibiotics was estimated to be $1742, whereas the median cost per day without an active infection was estimated to be $1467. Overall, costs were $49,693 for the placebo group and $50,593 for the G-CSF patients. G-CSF during induction chemotherapy for elderly patients with AML had some clinical benefits, but it did not reduce the duration of hospitalization, prolong survival, or reduce the overall cost of supportive care.

In some trials, an increase of 10-15% in grade II-IV GVHD has been noted with PBSC. All studies showed a trend towards more chronic GVHD with PBSC. Some randomized studies have shown improved survival and disease-free survival with the use of PBSC due to lowered transplant-related mortality and fewer relapses in recipients of PBSC as a result of improved immune reconstitution and a graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effect. This survival benefit is most apparent in patients with more advanced hematologic malignancies, but further studies are needed to define the relative benefits of PBSC for patients with less advanced disease.

Until recently, autologous and allogeneic bone marrow and mobilized blood stem cell transplantations were used primarily to replace malignant, genetically abnormal or deficient immunohematopoietic compartments, and therefore highly toxic myeloablative regimens were considered to be mandatory for the effective eradication of all undesirable host-derived hematopoietic elements. Our preclinical and ongoing clinical studies have indicated that much more effective eradication of the host immunohematopoietic system cells can be achieved by adoptive allogeneic cell therapy with donor lymphocyte infusion following BMT. Thus, eradication of blood cancer cells, especially in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia and, less frequently, in patients with other hematologic malignancies, can frequently be accomplished despite the complete resistance of such tumor cells to maximally tolerated doses of chemoradiotherapy. Our cumulative experience has suggested that graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effects might be a useful tool for the eradication of otherwise resistant tumor cells of host origin. Based on the cumulative clinical experience and experimental data in animal models of human diseases, it appears that the induction of host-vs.-graft tolerance as an initial step may allow the durable engraftment of donor immunocompetent lymphocytes, which may be used for the induction of effective biologic warfare against host-type immunohematopoietic cells that need to be replaced, including malignant, genetically abnormal or self-reactive cells. Based on the aforementioned rationale, we speculated that the therapeutic benefit of BMT may be improved by using safer conditioning as part of the transplant procedure, with the goal being to induce host-vs.-graft tolerance to enable subsequent induction of GVL, possibly graft-vs.-tumor or even graft-vs.-autoimmunity effects, rather than attempting to eliminate host cells with hazardous myeloablative chemoradiotherapy. This hypothesis suggested that effective BMT procedures could be accomplished without lethal conditioning of the host, using new well-tolerated non-myeloablative regimens, thus possibly minimizing immediate and late side-effects related to the myeloablative procedures until recently considered to be mandatory for the conditioning of BMT recipients. Recent clinical data presented in this review suggest that effective BMT procedures may be accomplished with well-tolerated non-myeloablative stem cell transplantation (NST) regimens, with no major toxicity. Thus, new NST approaches may offer the feasibility of safer BMT procedures for a large spectrum of clinical indications in children and elderly individuals, without lower or upper age limits, while minimizing procedure-related toxicity and mortality. Taken together, our data suggest that high-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be successfully replaced by a more effective biologic tool, alloreactive donor lymphocytes, thus setting the stage for innovative therapeutic procedures for safer and more effective treatment of patients in need of BMT.","['Slavin, S', 'Nagler, A', 'Aker, M', 'Shapira, M Y', 'Cividalli, G', 'Or, R']","['Slavin S', 'Nagler A', 'Aker M', 'Shapira MY', 'Cividalli G', 'Or R']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cancer Immunotherapy, Danny Cunniff Leukemia Research Laboratory, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem 91120, Israel. slavin@cc.huji.ac.il']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Rev Clin Exp Hematol,Reviews in clinical and experimental hematology,9815344,IM,"['Critical Illness/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/*methods', 'Myeloablative Agonists/therapeutic use', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Transplantation Conditioning/methods', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",2001/08/07 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/07 10:00'],"['2001/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1468-0734.2001.00036.x [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Clin Exp Hematol. 2001 Jun;5(2):135-46. doi: 10.1046/j.1468-0734.2001.00036.x.,['0 (Myeloablative Agonists)'],35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the patterns of HTLV-I intrafamilial transmission in HTLV-I seropositive blood donors and assessed the risk factors of HTLV-I transmission in relatives of HTLV-I carriers in Taiwan. A total of twenty HTLV-I seropositive donors and their 103 relatives were enrolled. Among those 103 relatives, 40 (38.8%) were seropositive for HTLV-I. Their ages ranged from one to 70 years old with a mean age of 31.0 +/- 1.65 year-old. Three of the ten wives of male carriers were HTLV-I seropositive. However, none of the six husbands of female carriers were HTLV-I seropositive. Mother-to-child vertical transmission was found in nine of 48 (18.8%) tested. Significant risk factors of HTLV-I transmission among relatives of HTLV-I carriers were hospital admission, previous transfusion, breast feeding, anti-HCV seropositivity and female relatives of age >/= 30 with odds ratio (OR) of 9.73, 8.64, 4.36, 8.86 and 4.91, respectively (all p < 0.05). Nonsignificant risk factors of HTLV-I transmission were sharing needles, operation history, HBsAg seropositivity and male relatives of age >/= 30.

Conventional cytogenetic studies by chromosome banding are difficult in CLL mainly because of the low in vitro mitotic activity of the tumor cells, which leads to poor quantity and quality of metaphase spreads. Molecular genetic analyses are limited because candidate genes are known for only a few chromosomal aberrations that are observed in CLL. FISH was found to be a powerful tool for the genetic analysis of CLL as it overcomes both the low mitotic activity of the CLL cells and the lack of suitable candidate genes for analysis. Using FISH, the detection of chromosomal aberrations can be performed at the single cell level in both dividing and non-dividing cells, thus circumventing the need of metaphase preparations from tumor cells. Probes for the detection of trisomies, deletions and translocation breakpoints can be applied to the regions of interest with the growing number of clones available from genome-wide libraries. Using the interphase cytogenetic FISH approach with a disease specific set of probes, chromosome aberrations can be found in more than 80% of CLL cases. The most frequently observed abnormalities are losses of chromosomal material, with deletions in band 13q14 being the most common, followed by deletions in 11q22-q23, deletions in 17p13 and deletions in 6q21. The most common gains of chromosomal material are trisomies 12q, 8q and 3q. Translocation breakpoints, in particular involving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus at 14q32, which are frequently observed in other types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, are rare events in CLL. Genes affected by common chromosome aberrations in CLL appear to be p53 in cases with 17p deletion and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which is mutated in a subset of cases with 11q22-q23 aberrations. However, for the other frequently affected genomic regions, the search for candidate genes is ongoing. In parallel, the accurate evaluation of the incidence of chromosome aberrations in CLL by FISH allows the correlation of genetic abnormalities with clinical disease manifestations and outcome. In particular, 17p abnormalities and deletions in 11q22-q23 have already been shown to be among the most important independent prognostic factors identifying subgroups of patients with rapid disease progression and short survival. In addition, deletion 17p has been associated with resistance to treatment with purine analogs. Therefore, genetic abnormalities may allow a risk assessment for individual patients at the time of diagnosis, thus giving the opportunity for a risk-adapted management.","['Stilgenbauer, S', 'Lichter, P', 'Dohner, H']","['Stilgenbauer S', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, University of Ulm, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Italy,Rev Clin Exp Hematol,Reviews in clinical and experimental hematology,9815344,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations/genetics', '*Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics']",2001/08/07 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/07 10:00'],"['2001/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1468-0734.2000.00003.x [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Clin Exp Hematol. 2000 Mar;4(1):48-72. doi: 10.1046/j.1468-0734.2000.00003.x.,,138,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In CLL, the morphology of the circulating cells is characteristic and typical in the majority of cases. However, 15% of patients, either at diagnosis or during the course of the disease, show atypical morphology reflected by either (1) an increased (> 10%) number of circulating prolymphocytes, designated CLL/PL, or (2) an increased (> 15%) number of circulating lymphoplasmacytic and cleaved cells, designated 'atypical' CLL. There is strong evidence of a close association between atypical morphology (CLL/PL) and atypical (CLL) and clinical features, e.g. disease progression, advanced stage and survival, molecular genetics, particularly trisomy 12, but also the rare cases with t(11;14) or t(14;19), p53 abnormalities, unmutated immunoglobulin (Ig) VH genes and origin of the cell (naive, pregerminal center cell). CLL cells have a distinct immunological repertoire different from that of other lymphoproliferative disorders. The typical CLL phenotype is CD5+, CD23+, FMC7-, weak expression of surface Ig (sIg) and weak or absent expression of membrane CD22 and CD79b. The latter marker identifies an extracellular epitope of the B-cell receptor (BCR) beta chain and its weak or absent expression in CLL may derive from the expression of a truncated form. This, together with the low expression of CD22, might explain the abnormal signal transduction of CLL cells similar to that of anergic B lymphocytes. Because no single marker is specific for CLL, a composite phenotype considering this set of 5 or 6 markers compounded into a scoring system helps to distinguish CLL from the other B-cell malignancies. Immunophenotypic analysis has also been shown to be useful for minimal residual disease detection and adds valuable prognostic information because the expression of certain markers, such as FMC7 or CD38, seems to be associated with a poor outcome. In addition, CLL cells express a variety of Bcl-2 family proteins with a profile that favors inhibition of apoptosis which, together with the interaction with microenvironmental (e.g. stromal) cells and the release of cytokines, explains the long life span and subsequent accumulation of CLL cells in various organs. Despite controversies relating to the expression of adhesion molecules (selectins and integrins) in CLL cells, it appears that some of these molecules do play a role in the pathogenesis, biology and clinical patterns of the disease. In conclusion, morphology and immunophenotype are the two essential investigations, which must be carried out in all cases of CLL. Both provide relevant information in terms of diagnosis, course of the disease, prognosis and pathogenesis.","['Matutes, E', 'Polliack, A']","['Matutes E', 'Polliack A']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, Fulham Road, London, SW3 6JJ, UK. estella@icr.ac.uk']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Italy,Rev Clin Exp Hematol,Reviews in clinical and experimental hematology,9815344,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', '*Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/immunology/*pathology']",2001/08/07 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/07 10:00'],"['2001/08/07 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/07 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1468-0734.2000.00002.x [doi]'],ppublish,Rev Clin Exp Hematol. 2000 Mar;4(1):22-47. doi: 10.1046/j.1468-0734.2000.00002.x.,,87,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This oncoprotein blocks apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation or irradiation, but the mechanism for this effect remains unclear. We therefore performed representational difference analysis (RDA) to identify downstream genetic targets of E2A-HLF, using a murine FL5.12 pro-B cell line that had been stably transfected with E2A-HLF cDNA under the control of a zinc-regulated metallothionein promoter. Two RDA clones, designated RDA1 and RDA3, were differentially upregulated in E2A-HLF-positive cells after zinc induction. The corresponding cDNAs encoded two WD40 repeat-containing proteins, Grg2 and Grg6. Both are related to the Drosophila protein Groucho, a transcriptional corepressor that lacks DNA-binding activity on its own but can act in concert with other proteins to regulate embryologic development of the fly. Expression of both Grg2 and Grg6 was upregulated 10- to 50-fold by E2A-HLF. Immunoblot analysis detected increased amounts of two additional Groucho-related proteins, Grg1 and Grg4, in cells expressing E2A-HLF. A mutant E2A-HLF protein with a disabled DNA-binding region also mediated pro-B cell survival and activated Groucho-related genes. Among the transcription factors known to interact with Groucho-related protein, only RUNX1 was appreciably downregulated by E2A-HLF. Our results identify a highly conserved family of transcriptional corepressors that are activated by E2A-HLF, and they suggest that downregulation of RUNX1 may contribute to E2A-HLF-mediated leukemogenesis.","['Dang, J', 'Inukai, T', 'Kurosawa, H', 'Goi, K', 'Inaba, T', 'Lenny, N T', 'Downing, J R', 'Stifani, S', 'Look, A T']","['Dang J', 'Inukai T', 'Kurosawa H', 'Goi K', 'Inaba T', 'Lenny NT', 'Downing JR', 'Stifani S', 'Look AT']","[""Department of Experimental Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis', 'Base Sequence', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Lineage', 'Co-Repressor Proteins', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit', 'DNA, Complementary', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Drosophila melanogaster', 'Humans', '*Leucine Zippers', 'Leukemia, B-Cell', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/*metabolism', 'Proteins/genetics', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Trans-Activators/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Up-Regulation']",2001/08/04 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/04 10:00'],"['2001/08/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/MCB.21.17.5935-5945.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 2001 Sep;21(17):5935-45. doi: 10.1128/MCB.21.17.5935-5945.2001.,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Co-Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (DNA, Complementary)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, human)', '0 (E2a-Hlf fusion protein, mouse)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Runx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (TLE1 protein, human)', '0 (TLE2 protein, human)', '0 (TLE3 protein, rat)', '0 (Tle1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tle2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tle4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tle5 protein, mouse)', '0 (Tle6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,"['P30 CA021765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA059571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA59571/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['GENBANK/AF145957', 'GENBANK/AF145958']",,PMC87312,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to immunohistochemical analysis, we have established a 5' exonuclease-based real-time reverse transcriptase-mediated quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) method to detect cyclin D1 overexpression for the diagnosis of MCL. The RQ-PCR could detect cyclin D1 overexpression in all nine examined MCL cases, in contrast genomic PCR detected t(11;14) in only two of nine cases. By RQ-PCR the expression of G6PDH was significantly higher in myeloid leukemias than those in B-cell lymphomas (P = 0.018). As a result, cyclin D1/G6PDH ratio ranged from 0.78 to 12.4 (mean, 1.83) in MCL, exclusively higher than those in other B-cell lymphoma (0.00009 approximately 0.16) and myeloid leukemia (0.00011 approximately 0.085). The high expression of cyclin D1 in certain myeloid leukemias was identified to reflect their proliferative activity and not to represent the oncogenic overexpression. The 95% confidence interval of the cyclin D1/G6PDH ratio was 0.29 approximately 11.1 for MCL, 0.014 approximately 0.25 for other B-cell lymphomas and 0.000014 approximately 0.083 for myeloid leukemia, suggesting that a cutoff value can be set at 0.25.

Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces the monocyte/macrophage-like differentiation of HL-60 cells and results in growth arrest, increasing adherence. In PMA-induced differentiation of HL-60 cells, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-K) activity was measured as phosphatidylinositol3P recovery from phosphatidylinositol by in vitro kinase assay. PI 3-K activity was increased in HL-60 cells that were stimulated by 20 nM PMA and the activity was inhibited by pretreatment with 20 microM LY294002, a specific inhibitor of PI 3-K. Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family have been suggested to be one of the downstream targets of PI 3-K. PKC zeta is one of the atypical PKCs, non-diacylglycerol-responsive PKCs, and the activity was measured by the ability of phosphorylation onto myelin basic protein. PMA also induced the activation of PKC zeta during monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells, and LY294002-pretreated cells failed to induce PKC zeta activation. The activity of PI 3-K is essential for PKC zeta activation, and LY294002 blocks both monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells and activation of PKC zeta during PMA-induced cell differentiation. This implies that activated PI 3-K subsequently stimulates the PKC zeta in the process of PMA-induced monocytic differentiation.","['Kim, M S', 'Lim, W K', 'Cha, J G', 'An, N H', 'Yoo, S J', 'Park, J H', 'Kim, H M', 'Lee, Y M']","['Kim MS', 'Lim WK', 'Cha JG', 'An NH', 'Yoo SJ', 'Park JH', 'Kim HM', 'Lee YM']","['College of Pharmacy and Center of Oriental Medicinal Science, Wonkwang University, Iksan, 570-749, Chonbuk, South Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Chromones/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells/cytology/drug effects/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Morpholines/pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",2001/08/04 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/04 10:00'],"['2001/08/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0304383501005055 [pii]', '10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00505-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 2001 Sep 28;171(1):79-85. doi: 10.1016/s0304-3835(01)00505-5.,"['0 (Chromones)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '31M2U1DVID (2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (protein kinase C zeta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To clarify the genetic risk for ATL, we characterized HLA class I alleles of ATL patients and analyzed the anchor motifs of HTLV-1 peptides binding to HLA class I molecules, using 291 lines of anti-HTLV-1 CD8(+) cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) generated in vitro with a total of 165 synthetic peptides for HTLV-1 Tax and Env proteins. Allele frequencies of HLA-A*26, B*4002, B*4006, and B*4801 were significantly higher in ATL patients than in HAM/TSP patients and asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers in southern Japan. CD8(+) CTL analysis revealed the HTLV-1 Tax peptide sequence to completely lack anchor motifs of peptides binding to HLA-A*26,B*4002, and B*4006 molecules but to possess one anchor for HLA-B*4801, while the HTLV-1 Env peptide sequence had many anchor motifs for HLA-A*26, B*4002, B*4006, and B*4801 molecules.

Although the initial remission rate is quite high, relapse and associated drug resistance remain a problem. In vitro studies have demonstrated an adaptive increase in asparagine synthetase (AS) expression in ASNase-resistant cells, which is believed to permit ASNase-resistant human leukaemia cells to survive in vivo. The present results, obtained with ASNase-sensitive and -resistant human MOLT-4 leukaemia cell lines, illustrate that several other adaptive processes occur to provide sufficient amounts of the AS substrates, aspartate and glutamine, required to support this increased enzymic activity. In both cell populations, aspartate is derived almost exclusively from intracellular sources, whereas the necessary glutamine arises from both intracellular and extracellular sources. Transport of glutamine into ASNase-resistant cells is significantly enhanced compared with the parental cells, whereas amino acid efflux (e.g. asparagine) is reduced. Most of the adaptive change for the amino acid transporters, Systems A, ASC and L, is rapidly (12 h) reversed following ASNase removal. The enzymic activity of glutamine synthetase is also enhanced in ASNase-resistant cells by a post-transcriptional mechanism. The results demonstrate that there are several sites of metabolic adaptation in ASNase-treated leukaemia cells that serve to promote the replenishment of both glutamine and asparagine.","['Aslanian, A M', 'Kilberg, M S']","['Aslanian AM', 'Kilberg MS']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, FL 32610-0245, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Amino Acids/chemistry/metabolism', 'Asparaginase/*pharmacology', 'Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase/*metabolism', 'Aspartic Acid/chemistry', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cell Survival', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase/metabolism', 'Glutamine/chemistry', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'RNA/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/04 10:00,2001/09/21 10:01,['2001/08/04 10:00'],"['2001/08/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/21 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/04 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/0264-6021:3580059 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 2001 Aug 15;358(Pt 1):59-67. doi: 10.1042/0264-6021:3580059.,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '30KYC7MIAI (Aspartic Acid)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EC 6.3.1.1 (Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase)', 'EC 6.3.1.2 (Glutamate-Ammonia Ligase)']",,['DK-52064/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,PMC1222032,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 5a'-homo-vinblastine congeners 3a, 62a, and 65a showed vinblastine-like inhibition of tubulin polymerization and cytotoxicity to L1210 leukemia cells, albeit at lower potency for the latter activity, than that found with the corresponding compounds in the vinblastine series.","['Kuehne, M E', 'Cowen, S D', 'Xu, F', 'Borman, L S']","['Kuehne ME', 'Cowen SD', 'Xu F', 'Borman LS']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Vermont, Burlington, 05405, USA. mkuehne@zoo.uvm.edu']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Org Chem,The Journal of organic chemistry,2985193R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Epoxy Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Vinblastine/*analogs & derivatives/*chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology']",2001/08/04 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/04 10:00'],"['2001/08/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['jo000249z [pii]', '10.1021/jo000249z [doi]']",ppublish,J Org Chem. 2001 Aug 10;66(16):5303-16. doi: 10.1021/jo000249z.,"[""0 (5a'-homo-vinblastine)"", '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Epoxy Compounds)', '571PJ1LW03 (vindoline)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",,['CA RO1 12010/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most published data suggest that errors such as base misincorporation occur at similar frequencies for HIV-1 and for simple retroviruses such as spleen necrosis virus (SNV) and murine leukemia virus (MuLV). However, previous reports have suggested that template switch-mediated recombination is much more frequent for HIV-1 than for simple retroviruses. In this report, direct repeat deletion vectors similar to those previously used for measuring template switching events for SNV and MuLV were developed for HIV-1. Forward mutation rates and the frequency of template switching during a single cycle of HIV-1 replication were determined. The frequency of HIV-1-mediated repeat deletion was measured for three separate internal repeats in lacZ and was compared to rates observed with identical repeats for MuLV. The results indicated that the error rate and the frequency of repeat deletion of HIV-1 were similar to those of MuLV.","['An, W', 'Telesnitsky, A']","['An W', 'Telesnitsky A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109-0620, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Cell Line', 'DNA, Viral/metabolism', '*Gene Deletion', '*Genetic Vectors', 'HIV-1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/metabolism', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid/*genetics', 'Templates, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Virus Replication']",2001/08/04 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/04 10:00'],"['2001/08/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.2001.1025 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(01)91025-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2001 Aug 1;286(2):475-82. doi: 10.1006/viro.2001.1025.,"['0 (DNA, Viral)']",,['P30 CA79458/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we showed that the K8 (K-bZIP) protein, an early protein encoded by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), colocalized with the PML bodies in HHV-8-infected primary effusion lymphoma cells. Cotransfection of two plasmids expressing the K8 protein and green-fluorescence protein (GFP)-PML fusion protein into 293T cells revealed that the K8 protein colocalized with PML in cells with high PML expression. Overexpression of the K8 protein in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with stable GFP-PML expression did not induce the dispersion of the PML bodies, unlike the IE1 protein of HCMV. Transfection of a truncated K8 gene revealed that the leucine zipper domain of the K8 protein was required for the colocalization with PML. We also demonstrated that the K8 protein bound to p53 in vivo and in vitro, and that high expression of the K8 protein caused the accumulation of p53 to the PML bodies in CHO cells, suggesting that the K8 protein functions in the recruitment of p53 to the PML bodies. These data suggest that the K8 protein may be associated with the functional modulation of p53 in the nucleus during the lytic phase of HHV-8.","['Katano, H', 'Ogawa-Goto, K', 'Hasegawa, H', 'Kurata, T', 'Sata, T']","['Katano H', 'Ogawa-Goto K', 'Hasegawa H', 'Kurata T', 'Sata T']","['Department of Pathology, National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 162-8640, Japan. katano@nih.go.jp']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Animals', 'Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors', 'CHO Cells', 'Carrier Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cricetinae', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Herpesviridae Infections/virology', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/genetics/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leucine Zippers', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Lymphoma', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', '*Nuclear Proteins', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins', 'Transcription Factors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins', 'Viral Proteins/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism']",2001/08/04 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/04 10:00'],"['2001/08/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/viro.2001.1005 [doi]', 'S0042-6822(01)91005-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Virology. 2001 Aug 1;286(2):446-55. doi: 10.1006/viro.2001.1005.,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (K8 protein, Human herpesvirus 8)', '0 (Luminescent Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '147336-22-9 (Green Fluorescent Proteins)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first one is part of the widely employed EORTC-GIMEMA AML-10 and consists often days of therapy. The second (FLANG) is a short (three day), Fludarabine, Ara-C, mitoxantrone and G-CSF containing regimen. We first retrospectively analyzed the outcome of 77 consecutive AML patients with comparable clinical and haematological features receiving FLANG (25) or AML-10 (52), between June 1993 and October 1999, and observed equivalent CR rate, as well as DFS and overall survival duration. We then selected 9 non pretreated patients per group who reached CR after one course of therapy. Patients treated with FLANG had a statistically significant earlier platelet recovery compared to those treated with AML-10, fewer days of intravenous antibiotic therapy (14/22, respectively, p < 0.05), and a shorter hospitalization period (22/33 days, p < 0.01). FLANG was significantly more expensive than AML 10 as far as the cost of antiblastic drugs (p < 0.01) and G-CSF support (p < 0.05) are concerned. On the contrary, the expense for antiemetic drugs (p < 0.01) and the cost of personnel and other services ($5,906/$3,970, p < 0.05) were higher for AML-10 than for FLANG. Overall, the average costs of FLANG and AML10 were $9,269 and $12,424 respectively (p < 0.05; difference = -25%). Our study seems to indicate that, compared to AML-10, FLANG induction is as effective, less expensive and it allows for a decrease in the length of hospitalization and thus for better exploitation of the financial resources of Hematology-Oncology departments.","['Clavio, M', 'Quintino, S', 'Masoudi, B', 'Carrara, S', 'Cerri, R', 'Pierri, I', 'Canepa, L', 'Miglino, M', 'Muner, P', 'Damasio, E', 'Gobbi, M']","['Clavio M', 'Quintino S', 'Masoudi B', 'Carrara S', 'Cerri R', 'Pierri I', 'Canepa L', 'Miglino M', 'Muner P', 'Damasio E', 'Gobbi M']","['Dept. of Haematology, Azienda Ospedale S Martino e Cliniche Universitarie Convenzionate, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*economics', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*economics', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Cytarabine/*economics', '*Drug Costs', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*economics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*economics', 'Male', 'Maximum Tolerated Dose', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*economics', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vidarabine/analogs & derivatives/*economics']",2001/08/04 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/04 10:00'],"['2001/08/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/04 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2001 Jun;20(2):165-73.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'FA2DM6879K (Vidarabine)', 'FLANG protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many patients with low TS expression still fail to respond to treatment. Therefore, we studied the cell cycle proteins, Rb, E2F2, Ki67, p21 and p53 and the apoptotic proteins, mcl-1, hax, bcl-xl, bcl-2, Fas receptor, Fas ligand, caspase-3, M30 and PARP as potential predictive factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In biopsy specimens of liver metastases from 31 colorectal cancer patients, protein expression was retrospectively determined by immunohistochemistry and related to response to hepatic arterial or intravenous (i.v.) 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment, time to tumour progression (TTP) and overall survival. RESULTS: Expression of both p53 and Rb correlated with survival benefit after 5-FU treatment. A median survival time of 79 weeks was found in patients with high levels of p53 or Rb compared to 36 and 44 weeks for patients expressing low levels of p53 (P = 0.027) or Rb (P = 0.030), respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that p53 was the best predictor of survival independent of sex, age or prior treatment. Following 5-FU hepatic arterial infusion, patients with a high TS expression had a shorter survival time than those with a low expression (P = 0.025). The anti-apoptotic protein mcl-1 was the only factor, which correlated with response to 5-FU treatment. Thirty-five percent of patients with a diffuse mcl-1 expression responded whereas ninety percent of patients with a peri-nuclear expression responded (P = 0.041). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that besides TS, also Rb, p53 and mcl-1 are correlated with clinical outcome in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.","['Backus, H H', 'van Riel, J M', 'van Groeningen, C J', 'Vos, W', 'Dukers, D F', 'Bloemena, E', 'Wouters, D', 'Pinedo, H M', 'Peters, G J']","['Backus HH', 'van Riel JM', 'van Groeningen CJ', 'Vos W', 'Dukers DF', 'Bloemena E', 'Wouters D', 'Pinedo HM', 'Peters GJ']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University Hospital Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Oncol,Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology,9007735,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*metabolism', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/*pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism/*secondary', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*metabolism', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thymidylate Synthase/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*metabolism']",2001/08/04 10:00,2002/01/30 10:01,['2001/08/04 10:00'],"['2001/08/04 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/30 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/04 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1023/a:1011112227044 [doi]', 'S0923-7534(19)47975-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Oncol. 2001 Jun;12(6):779-85. doi: 10.1023/a:1011112227044.,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently some studies have indicated clustering not only at diagnosis, but also around time and place of birth. Space-time clustering at time of birth could be of special interest if the aetiological agent is of infectious origin and the induction of leukaemia either occurs pre- or perinatally or an infection at that time favours a poor subsequent immune response to the agent. METHODS: To identify possible space-time clustering we have used the close-pair method of Knox. One-thousand-twenty recorded cases (0-14 years) of childhood acute lymphatic leukaemia and 293 cases (0-14 years) of malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from Sweden between 1973-1996 were analysed. The records include date of birth and of diagnosis as well as addresses at birth and at diagnosis. RESULTS: A significant excess of case-pairs (25 observed, 14.9 expected, p = 0.01) was observed close in date and place of birth in the 4-14 year age group with acute lymphatic leukaemia (ALL). However there was no statistically significant clustering found around time of diagnosis.

InsP3 is generated from the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Recently, roles for other phosphoinositides (PIs) in store-operated Ca2+ influx have been suggested because inhibitors of PI kinases reduce Ca2+ influx when the latter is triggered independent of PIP2 hydrolysis. Using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to record the store-operated Ca2+ current ICRAC in RBL-1 cells, we examined whether PIs are involved in linking store depletion to activation of CRAC channels. Of several structurally distinct PI kinase inhibitors, only one (LY294002) was able to reduce partially the extent of activation of ICRAC although this could not be reversed by exogenous phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Our findings suggest that, if a PI kinase is involved in activation of ICRAC in RBL-1 cells, it has a unique pharmacological profile.

METHODS: A total of 1058 cases of de novo ANLL were studied. Chromosome preparations were made on bone marrow cells using direct method and short-term culture. Karyotypes were analyzed by R-banding in all cases and G-banding in some cases in addition. RESULTS: Six hundred and thirty cases (60%) had clonal chromosomal abnormalities. 25 categories of major karyotypic abnormalities were found. Among them, 11 were the specific chromosomal rearrangements seen in 481 cases, accounting for 76% of the total number of patients with karyotypic abnormalities. Isolate trisomy 8 (21 cases) was the most common numerical abnormality. t(15;17)(211 cases) and t(8;21)(200 cases) were the most frequent structural abnormalities. The 1.1% of M(2), 72% of M(3), 71% of M(4E0), 50% of M(2), 6 % of M(5) and 1.4% of M(2) had t(7;11), t(15;17), inv(16), t(8;21), t/del(11q 23) and t/del(12p) abnormalities, however, the 100% of t(7;11), 100% of t(15;17 ), 100% of inv(16), 88.5% of t(8;21), 83% of t/del(11q23) and 62% of t/del(12p) were detected in patients with M(2), M(3), M(4E0), M(2), M(5) and M(2) subtypes, respectively. CONCLUSION: By conventional banding technique, including R- and G-bandings, 60% of patients with ANLL may be found to have clonal chromosomal abnormalities which are predominantly specific chromosomal rearrangements correlated with specific FAB subtypes. Thus, karyotype is an important indicator for diagnosis and classification of ANLL.","['Xue, Y', 'Guo, Y', 'Wu, Y', 'Pan, J', 'Li, J', 'Lu, D']","['Xue Y', 'Guo Y', 'Wu Y', 'Pan J', 'Li J', 'Lu D']","['The First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Jiangsu Institute of Hematology, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006 P.R.

The surface glycoprotein (SU) is responsible for viral recognition of, and binding to, target cells through its interaction with an unknown cell surface receptor. To facilitate molecular analysis of the receptor-binding properties of SU and to characterize the cellular receptor employed by HTLV-1, we have expressed a recombinant SU fused to the Fc domain of human immunoglobulin G. Here, we demonstrate that this novel SU-immunoadhesin retains both the biochemical properties of Fc and the receptor-binding specificity of the HTLV-1 SU. We use this SU-immunoadhesin to demonstrate, by direct cell surface binding assays, that the receptor used by HTLV-1 has been conserved through vertebrate evolution. Moreover, using murine-human somatic cell hybrids we provide data that do not support the previously assigned location for the HTLV-1 receptor on human chromosome 17. Most importantly, we show that many cell lines that are resistant to HTLV-1 envelope-mediated infection and syncytium formation express functional receptors that are recognized by the HTLV-1 SU. Based on our results, we suggest that for some HTLV-1-resistant cell lines the block to viral entry occurs at a late post-receptor-binding step of the entry process. Our findings will be of value in developing new strategies to identify the cellular receptor used by HTLV-1.","['Jassal, S R', 'Pohler, R G', 'Brighty, D W']","['Jassal SR', 'Pohler RG', 'Brighty DW']","['Biomedical Research Centre, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, The University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Dogs', 'Drosophila melanogaster/cytology', 'Gene Products, env/metabolism', 'Giant Cells/*physiology', 'Glycoproteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*pathogenicity/physiology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/metabolism']",2001/08/03 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/03 10:00'],"['2001/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.75.17.8317-8328.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Sep;75(17):8317-28. doi: 10.1128/jvi.75.17.8317-8328.2001.,"['0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (HTLV-I receptor)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (gp46 protein, Human T-cell leukemia virus type I)']",,,,,,,,PMC115076,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proline-rich motif of gp30, PX(2)PX(4-5)P, is analogous to the recognition site of Src homology 3 (SH3) domains of signaling molecules. Using site-directed mutagenesis of an infectious molecular clone of BLV, point mutations were introduced which changed three of the prolines of the motif to alanines. The influence of these mutations on the pathogenicity of BLV was studied in sheep which received either (i) plasmid DNA with provirus containing proline-to-alanine mutations (pppBLV), (ii) plasmid DNA with wild-type provirus (wtBLV), or (iii) transfection reagent alone. Although all of the BLV-injected animals seroconverted at approximately the same time, viral loads at later time points were high in five of five of the wtBLV group and two of five of the pppBLV group but low in three of five of the pppBLV group, as determined by semiquantitative PCR. Viral expression was lower in the pppBLV-transfected sheep, as measured by p24 antigen enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in cultured cells, and serologic titers were lower. Thirty-one months after transfection, four of four wtBLV-transfected sheep had died of leukemia and lymphoma, and all five of the pppBLV-transfected sheep were clinically healthy and had normal peripheral blood lymphocyte counts. These data indicate that the proline-rich motif of gp30 is not required for viral infectivity but is important for high viral load in vivo, suggesting that SH3-mediated gp30 interactions are critical for viral pathogenesis following infection. Absence of interactions with the proline-rich motif may prevent or delay tumorigenesis in sheep.","['Reichert, M', 'Winnicka, A', 'Willems, L', 'Kettmann, R', 'Cantor, G H']","['Reichert M', 'Winnicka A', 'Willems L', 'Kettmann R', 'Cantor GH']","['National Veterinary Research Institute, Pulawy, Warsaw, Poland. reichert@piwet.pulawy.pl']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Amino Acid Motifs', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Viral/blood', 'Base Sequence', 'Cattle', 'DNA, Viral/blood', 'Deltaretrovirus Infections/*veterinary/virology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/metabolism/*pathogenicity', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/virology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Proline', 'Proviruses/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Sheep', 'Sheep Diseases/*virology', 'Transfection', 'Viral Core Proteins/metabolism', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Viral Load']",2001/08/03 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/03 10:00'],"['2001/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/jvi.75.17.8082-8089.2001 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 2001 Sep;75(17):8082-9. doi: 10.1128/jvi.75.17.8082-8089.2001.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '0 (core protein p24, bovine leukemia virus)', '0 (gp30 envelope transmembrane protein, Bovine leukemia virus)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",,,,,,,,PMC115052,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When modified to contain the Fc-binding domain of protein A, this envelope gives a significant enhancement in specificity in combination with antibodies specific for HLA and CD4 relative to that without antibody.

SFFV gp55 has been shown to interact with the Epo receptor complex, causing constitutive activation of various signal-transducing molecules. When injected into adult mice, SFFV induces a rapid erythroleukemia, with susceptibility being determined by the host gene Fv-2, which was recently shown to be identical to the gene encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase Stk/Ron. Susceptible, but not resistant, mice encode not only full-length Stk but also a truncated form of the kinase, sf-Stk, which may mediate the biological effects of SFFV infection. To determine whether expression of SFFV gp55 leads to the activation of sf-Stk, we expressed sf-Stk, with or without SFFV gp55, in hematopoietic cells expressing the Epo receptor. Our data indicate that sf-Stk interacts with SFFV gp55 as well as gp55(P), the biologically active form of the viral glycoprotein, forming disulfide-linked complexes. This covalent interaction, as well as noncovalent interactions with SFFV gp55, results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of sf-Stk and its association with multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated signal-transducing molecules. In contrast, neither Epo stimulation in the absence of SFFV gp55 expression nor expression of a mutant of SFFV that cannot interact with sf-Stk was able to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of sf-Stk or its association with any signal-transducing molecules. Covalent interaction of sf-Stk with SFFV gp55 and constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of sf-Stk can also be detected in an erythroleukemia cell line derived from an SFFV-infected mouse.

Our results also suggest a mechanism by which SAM domains could mediate the spreading of transcriptional repression complexes along the chromosome.","['Kim, C A', 'Phillips, M L', 'Kim, W', 'Gingery, M', 'Tran, H H', 'Robinson, M A', 'Faham, S', 'Bowie, J U']","['Kim CA', 'Phillips ML', 'Kim W', 'Gingery M', 'Tran HH', 'Robinson MA', 'Faham S', 'Bowie JU']","['Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, DOE Laboratory of Structural Biology and Molecular Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Crystallography, X-Ray', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/biosynthesis/*chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymers/*chemistry', 'Protein Structure, Secondary', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/biosynthesis/chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Repressor Proteins/biosynthesis/*chemistry/genetics/physiology', 'Solubility', 'Transcription, Genetic']",2001/08/03 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/08/03 10:00'],"['2001/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/emboj/20.15.4173 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2001 Aug 1;20(15):4173-82. doi: 10.1093/emboj/20.15.4173.,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",,"['R01 CA081000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA81000/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,PMC149168,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used parental K562/WT chronic myelogenous leukemia cells and a multidrug-resistant subline thereof, K562/ADM. Multidrug-resistant cells were more resistant to daunorubicin, but more sensitive to cisplatin than parental K562 cells as measured by growth inhibition and apoptosis assays. Resistance to daunorubicin can be explained by amplification of the MDR1 drug transporter gene. Cisplatin induced more DNA damage in specific genes and in the entire genome of K562/ADM cells compared to K562/WT cells using PCR stop assays and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Pretreatment with 5AC modulated the response of K562/ADM cells toward MDR-type drugs (daunorubicin, vincristine, etoposide) and reduced function and expression of MDR1 as analyzed by flow cytometry and RT-PCR. Analysis of CpG island methylation in the promotor region of the MDR1 gene by bisulfite sequencing and a methylation-sensitive HpaII-digestion/PCR approach revealed that methylation of the MDR1 promotor of K562/ADM cells was greater than in K562/WT cells. 5AC treatment completely abolished MDR1 promotor methylation. The unexpected observation that DNA demethylation by 5AC rather decreases than increases MDR1 expression in K5612/ADM cells points to still unexplored sequences in the MDR1 promotor whose transcriptional activity may be affected by the methylation status. 5AC pretreatment also modulated K562/WT and K562/ADM cells to non-MDR-type drugs such as cisplatin and increased cisplatin-induced DNA damage.","['Efferth, T', 'Futscher, B W', 'Osieka, R']","['Efferth T', 'Futscher BW', 'Osieka R']","['Medizinische Klinik IV, Aachen Technical University (RWTH Aachen), Aachen, Germany. efferth@vcrp.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Cells Mol Dis,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",9509932,IM,"['ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Azacitidine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance, Multiple', 'Gene Amplification/drug effects', 'Genes, MDR/drug effects/genetics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells/*drug effects']",2001/08/03 10:00,2002/02/01 10:01,['2001/08/03 10:00'],"['2001/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/01 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bcmd.2001.0427 [doi]', 'S1079-9796(01)90427-9 [pii]']",ppublish,Blood Cells Mol Dis. 2001 May-Jun;27(3):637-48. doi: 10.1006/bcmd.2001.0427.,"['0 (ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B, Member 1)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', 'M801H13NRU (Azacitidine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Coptisine was cytotoxic on LoVo and HT 29 and less potent on L-1210, and it was partially crossresistant on the human tumour colon cell line resistant to Dx, LoVo/Dx, whereas it was not significantly crossresistant on the murine leukaemia cell line resistant to CDDP, L-1210/CDDP.

A nursing perspective.,25-9,"Who knows best: the patient or the provider? My opinion, based on a review of the literature and practical experience, is that the patient, the provider and the system each offer a unique perspective that we can draw upon in ensuring quality care across the continuum. Nurses have a unique body of knowledge and skill that they bring to each interaction with the patient. They must have an awareness of the patient's and the system's expectations and interact and negotiate realistic expectations for each. The maintenance of balanced expectations and the measurement of effectiveness will continue to be a challenge. However, patients should be involved in and direct aspects of their care and feel satisfied with the process. Ultimately, nurses and the hospitals in which they work are responsible for providing effective and satisfying care. I would like to end by reinforcing the importance of the patient's voice in the provision of compassionate care. It is disheartening to read about patients' experiences of ""discompassionate healthcare"" (Holloway 1999). Yet I am reassured when I read or experience examples of compassionate and effective care such as that outlined by Valerie McDonald. (Hospital Quarterly Winter 1999/2000) Ms. McDonald, a former social worker and adult educator, is the mother of three daughters, one who had Burkitt's lymphoma diagnosed in 1994 and a second who had acute lymphostatic leukemia diagnosed in 1997 and who died recently in 1999. McDonald provided a wonderful perspective about her hospital experiences--the good and the bad. There would be no denying from this report that patients know the key qualities necessary for effective and compassionate care and that this mother recognized the energy and time it took to provide this care. ""I hope,"" she states, ""as the dust settles from restructuring and cutbacks that hospital staff will still have the time, energy and flexibility to practice the art of healing as they did with my children"" (p. 24).

Telomerase activity is closely linked to attainment of cellular immortality, a step in carcinogenesis, while lack of such activity contributes to cellular senescence. Telomerase is activated in more than 85% of malignant tumors. However, with the exception of some self-renewing tissues with high regenerative potential, telomerase activity is usually repressed in normal somatic tissues. Based on these reports, we investigated telomerase activity in gastric mucosal tissues. Telomerase activity is highest in cancer, followed by intestinal metaplasia, chronic gastritis, and normal mucosa. In patients with intestinal-type gastric cancer, telomerase activity was higher in those with intestinal metaplasia and H. pylori infection than in patients without infection. Our results suggest that H. pylori infection may influence telomerase activity in cancer and noncancerous tissue. Genes encoding three major components of human telomerase have been recently cloned. They included those for human telomerase RNA component (hTR), human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), and telomerase-associated protein 1 (TEP1). More recently, two human telomeric repeat binding factors (TRFs) have also been cloned: TRF1, considered to inhibit the action of telomerase at the telomeric region, and TRF2, believed to prevent fusion of chromosome ends and, in vitro, to remodel linear telomeric DNA into large duplex loops. However, the details of mechanisms regulating telomerase activity are still poorly understood, and specific components or binding proteins that might represent suitable targets for cancer gene therapy have not yet been identified. Therefore, we established quantitative assays using a TaqMan RT-PCR for mRNAs encoding the telomerase components hTR, hTERT, and TEP1, as well as for those encoding TRF1 and TRF2. By using our quantitative assays, we found the following results: 1) Expression of TRF1 and TRF2 mRNA was greater in the normal cells than in human malignant hematopoietic cell lines or in patients with acute leukemia, 2) hTERT mRNA expression showed changes paralleling telomerase activity and became undetectable with HL60 cell differentiation, 3) initially low expression of TRF1 and TRF2 mRNA increased during differentiation. Our results suggest that not only hTERT but also TRF1 and 2 are important regulators of telomerase activity.","['Watanabe, N']",['Watanabe N'],"['Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, Sapporo 060-0061, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi,[Hokkaido igaku zasshi] The Hokkaido journal of medical science,17410290R,IM,"['Cell Movement/*physiology', '*Cellular Senescence', 'Helicobacter Infections/enzymology', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/enzymology/genetics/*pathology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/enzymology', 'Telomerase/chemistry/genetics/*metabolism', 'Telomere/*genetics']",2001/08/03 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/03 10:00'],"['2001/08/03 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/03 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hokkaido Igaku Zasshi. 2001 May;76(3):127-32.,['EC 2.7.7.49 (Telomerase)'],25,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of children with malignant and ARDS who needed mechanical ventilation and were admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit from January 1987 to January 1997. RESULTS: Seventeen children with ARDS and malignancy aged 10.5 +/- 5.1 years were identified. Six of the 17 children (35.3%) survived. Sepsis syndrome was present in 70.6% of all the children. Peak inspiratory pressure, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), and ventilation index values could distinguish outcome by day 3. A significant relationship between respiratory data and outcome related to efficiency of oxygenation, as determined by PaO(2)/FIO(2) and P(A-a)O(2), was present from day 8 after onset of mechanical ventilation. CONCLUSIONS: Peak inspiratory pressure, PEEP, and ventilation index values could distinguish survivors from nonsurvivors by day 3. This may assist in early application of supportive nonconventional therapies in children with malignancy and ARDS.","['Ben-Abraham, R', 'Weinbroum, A A', 'Augerten, A', 'Toren, A', 'Harel, R', 'Vardi, A', 'Barzilay, Z', 'Paret, G']","['Ben-Abraham R', 'Weinbroum AA', 'Augerten A', 'Toren A', 'Harel R', 'Vardi A', 'Barzilay Z', 'Paret G']","['Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care Medicine, Tel-Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel-Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Crit Care,Journal of critical care,8610642,IM,"['Adult', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*complications', 'Male', 'Positive-Pressure Respiration', 'Prognosis', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/etiology/*mortality/physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0883-9441(01)70022-6 [pii]', '10.1053/jcrc.2001.25232 [doi]']",ppublish,J Crit Care. 2001 Jun;16(2):54-8. doi: 10.1053/jcrc.2001.25232.,,,,,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

The patient presented with a two-week history of fever, weakness, anasarca, and a skin rash. Physical examination revealed pink to skin-colored firm papules, which coalesced into indurated plaques on his trunk, upper extremities, and face. The lesions, in combination with generalized edema, produced a leonine facies. Touch prep of the biopsy showed medium to large blasts, large monocytoid cells, and numerous small mature lymphocytes, providing the preliminary diagnosis of a second, previously undiagnosed myelomonocytic malignancy in this patient. The initial diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by histologic, cytochemical, immunohistochemical and flow cytometry studies. This is the first reported case of CLL with concurrent AML in which rapid touch prep of a skin punch biopsy facilitated diagnosis.","['Miller, M K', 'Strauchen, J A', 'Nichols, K T', 'Phelps, R G']","['Miller MK', 'Strauchen JA', 'Nichols KT', 'Phelps RG']","['Departments of Dermatopathology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, New York 10029, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Dermatopathol,The American Journal of dermatopathology,7911005,IM,"['Humans', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary', '*Skin Neoplasms']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000372-200108000-00011 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Dermatopathol. 2001 Aug;23(4):334-40. doi: 10.1097/00000372-200108000-00011.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, transient myeloproliferative disorders (TMD), which may mimic acute leukemia, also occur in neonates with Down syndrome. TMD is recognized shortly after birth or in the neonatal period and is characterized by leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, which resolve spontaneously in four to six weeks. CASE: A 1.5-month-old, male infant born with Down syndrome and patent ductus arteriosus presented with abdominal distention due to ascites. Cytology of the fluid revealed immature myeloid cells and megakaryocytes. Flow cytometry of the ascitic fluid confirmed the presence of immature myelomonocytic cells. A complete hematologic evaluation along with the clinical findings supported the diagnosis of TMD in Down syndrome. CONCLUSION: TMD is an uncommon syndrome strongly associated with Down syndrome. Since the abnormal laboratory findings are seen primarily in the peripheral blood, it is usually diagnosed by a hematopathologist without much difficulty. Our case demonstrates the importance of cytopathologist familiarity with this entity so as not to erroneously diagnose a leukemic process. This is extremely important since most cases of TMD spontaneously resolve within a few weeks to months and do not require treatment other than supportive measures.","['Shiffer, J', 'Natarajan, S']","['Shiffer J', 'Natarajan S']","['Kaiser Permanente, Woodland Hills, California, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Acta Cytol,Acta cytologica,0370307,IM,"['Ascites/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Down Syndrome/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications/*pathology']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1159/000327873 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Cytol. 2001 Jul-Aug;45(4):610-2. doi: 10.1159/000327873.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, more than 50 different chromosomal regions are known to participate in translocations involving 11q23, many of which affect MLL. The pathogenetically important outcome of these rearrangements is most likely the creation of a fusion gene consisting of the 5' part of the MLL gene and the 3' end of the partner gene. Although abnormalities of the MLL gene as such are generally associated with poor survival, recent data suggest that the prognostic impact varies among the different fusion genes generated. Hence, detection of the specific chimeric gene produced is important for proper prognostication and clinical decision making. We have developed a paired multiplex reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis to facilitate a rapid and accurate detection of the most frequent MLL fusion genes in adult and childhood acute leukemias. To increase the specificity, two sets of primers were designed for each fusion gene, and these paired primer sets were run in parallel in two separate multiplex one-step PCR reactions. Using the described protocol, we were able to amplify successfully, in one single assay, the six clinically relevant fusion genes generated by the t(4;11)(q21;q23) [MLL/AF4], t(6;11)(q27;q23) [MLL/AF6], t(9;11)(p21-22;q23) [MLL/AF9], t(10;11)(p11-13;q23) [MLL/AF10], t(11;19)(q23;p13.1) [MLL/ELL], and t(11;19)(q23; p13.3) [MLL/ENL] in cell lines, as well as in patient material.","['Andersson, A', 'Hoglund, M', 'Johansson, B', 'Lassen, C', 'Billstrom, R', 'Garwicz, S', 'Nilsson, P G', 'Mitelman, F', 'Fioretos, T']","['Andersson A', 'Hoglund M', 'Johansson B', 'Lassen C', 'Billstrom R', 'Garwicz S', 'Nilsson PG', 'Mitelman F', 'Fioretos T']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, Lund University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/analysis/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', '*Transcription Factors']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402189 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1293-300. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402189.,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2002 Aug;16(8):1574; author reply 1575-6.

Here we describe the cloning and characterization of the human homologue of murine TSLP. This protein, which is expressed in a number of tissues including heart, liver and prostate, prevented apoptosis and stimulated growth of the human acute myeloid leukemia (AML)-derived cell line MUTZ-3. Anti-interleukin (IL)-7 receptor antibodies (Abs) neutralized this effect indicating that TSLP binds to at least part of the IL-7 receptor complex. TSLP induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-5. In contrast to IL-7, TSLP-triggered STAT-5 phosphorylation was not preceded by activation of janus kinase (JAK) 3. These findings would be in accordance with the notion, raised previously for the mouse system, that TSLP leads to STAT-5 phosphorylation by activating other kinases than the JAKs. Some other signaling pathways stimulated by many cytokines are not involved in TSLP activity; thus, TSLP did not stimulate activation of ERK1,2 and p70S6K. Furthermore, neutralizing Abs raised against cytokines known to stimulate the growth of MUTZ-3 cells did not inhibit the proliferative effects of TSLP, suggesting that TSLP-induced growth was a direct effect. In summary, we describe the cloning of human TSLP and its proliferative effects on a myeloid cell line.

The combination of an early acting cytokine (hIL-3) with a late acting one (hG-CSF) allows efficient hematopoeitic reconstruction following myeloablative insult, and drives differentiation of non-myelocytic lineages (ie thrombocytic lineages) that are inaccessible using hG-CSF alone, in both preclinical models and clinical settings. A myelopoietin species was displayed and mutagenized on filamentous bacteriophage: both component agonists of myelopoietin were presented in biologically functional conformations as each recognized its corresponding receptor. Five amino acid positions in a short region of the hG-CSF receptor agonist module of myelopoietin that had been identified as important for proliferative activity were mutagenized. Display was used because it allows very 'deep' mutagenesis at selected residues: >10(5) substitution variants were affinity-screened using the hG-CSF receptor and 130 new, active variants of myelopoietin were identified and characterized. None of the selected variants were significantly more active than the parental myelopoietin species in a hG-CSF-dependent cell proliferation assay, though many were as active. Many of these relatively high-activity variants contained parental amino acids at several positions, suggesting the parental sequence may already be optimal at these positions for the assays used, and potentially accounting for the failure to identify enhanced bioactivity variants. Analysis of substitutions of high-activity variants complements and extends previous alanine scanning, and other genetic and biochemical data for hG-CSF variants.","['Lee, S C', 'Ibdah, R', 'Van Valkenburgh, C', 'Rowold, E', 'Abegg, A', 'Donnelly, A', 'Klover, J', 'Merlin, S', 'McKearn, J P']","['Lee SC', 'Ibdah R', 'Van Valkenburgh C', 'Rowold E', 'Abegg A', 'Donnelly A', 'Klover J', 'Merlin S', 'McKearn JP']","['GD Searle Pharmacia Company, St Louis, MO 63196, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Cytokines/genetics', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/analysis/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Interleukin-3', 'Peptide Library', 'Receptors, Cytokine/genetics', '*Recombinant Fusion Proteins', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Sequence Analysis']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402163 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1277-85. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402163.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Peptide Library)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (myelopoietin)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,['Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1147.

Bone marrow microvessel density (MVD) and angiogenesis grading were estimated using CD34 immunostaining. Six patients had a confirmed response to therapy with at least 50% or greater reduction in serum and urine monoclonal (M) protein.

Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), consecutively diagnosed from 1986 to 1999, were enrolled. A total of 3,856 patients from 1 to 15 years of age and 1,803 patients from 15 to 29 years of age were eligible for this study. Demographically, the frequency of AML found was almost constant during the teenage years, whereas the frequency of ALL gradually decreased. The relative frequency of CML and MDS apparently started to increase in patients in their late teens. The relative frequency of M3 and t(15;17) gradually increased during adolescence. Among patients aged 1 to 4 years, M7 was the most frequent FAB subtype. Among patients aged 5 to 9 years, M2 and t(8;21) was the most frequent subtype. The percentage of T cell ALL increased in patients 5 to 9 years old, reaching 31.2% in the 20- to 24-year-old age group. The percentage of patients with hyperdiploidy over 50 chromosomes was highest (17.0%) in patients aged 1 to 4 and decreased to 3.9% in the older teens. The percentage of patients with the Ph1 chromosome increased from 9.9% in teens to 30.0% in patients in their late twenties. When comparing event-free survival (EFS) rates for ALL according to age, the estimated 7-year EFS rate was highest for patients aged 1 to 9 years (65.9%) and intermediate for patients aged 10 to 15 years (48.4%). However, the EFS rate was significantly worse for patients aged 15 to 19 years (19.4%) and 20 to 29 years (17.0%) (P = 0.024). On the other hand, the EFS rate for AML decreased with increasing age, although without statistical significance. The overall survival rates are approximate among all age groups. The results of the study indicate that there are considerable variations in biologic features of leukemia between children and young adults. The prognosis for adolescent leukemia may be improved by introducing pediatric trials, which take into account the prognostic biological features.","['Horibe, K', 'Tsukimoto, I', 'Ohno, R']","['Horibe K', 'Tsukimoto I', 'Ohno R']","['Department of Pediatrics, Nagoya University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/genetics/*physiopathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Analysis']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402194 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1256-61. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402194.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its mechanism of action is not fully understood, nor the reason for its narrow therapeutic window. We studied the pharmacodynamics of busulfan in an in vitro cell line model, allowing us to evaluate the effects of various doses and exposure times on clonogeneic capacity, proliferation and apoptosis. Cells were incubated with busulfan in concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 microg/ml for 2, 4 or 8 h, then washed and cultured in busulfan-free medium for 72 h. Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was estimated by using the trapezoidal rule from different concentrations and times of incubation. In all assays busulfan affected the cells in an AUC-dependent manner. Induced changes in the biological parameters studied appeared at different time points after exposure to busulfan stopped. Thus, the decrease in proliferation and clonogenic capacity preceded cell cycle arrest in G2 phase and development of apoptosis, implying that apoptosis is a secondary event to interruption of vital metabolic processes. Biochemically, apoptotic changes were typical for chemotherapy-induced apoptosis with caspase activation, cleavage of Bcl-2 and PARP proteins, while cleavage of actin was not observed. Cells were rescued from apoptosis with a general caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk, but not with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF).

This phenomenon, termed cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR), was induced by adhesion through the alpha5beta1 (VLA-5) integrin. Phosphotyrosine analysis demonstrates that anti-apoptotic signaling through integrins in K562 cells is independent of the tyrosine kinases activated by BCR/ABL, with the possible exception of an unknown 80 kDa protein. Cytoprotection of FN-adhered CML cells indicates that tumor-ECM interactions may be critical for the emergence of drug-resistant tumor populations and treatment failure in this disease.

Cells infected with AdWTp53 and Adp27 showed high level of wild-type p53 and p27KiP1 expression, respectively. The expression of these proteins resulted in G1 arrest after 24 h of infection. Although the cells persisted in G1 arrest in both cell populations after 48 and 72 h of infection, the level of apoptosis assessed by TUNEL analysis was higher in cells infected with AdWTp53. Interestingly, apoptosis was more pronounced in cells infected with Adp27 after the initial 24 h and reached a steady state at 48 and 72 h. A lower MOI of Adp27 resulted in G1 arrest associated with a low level of apoptosis in SUDHL-1 cells after 48 h of infection. This was correlated with lower expression of p27KiP1. We postulate that the time-lag and the different level of apoptosis occurring in SUDHL-1 cells infected with AdWTp53 and Adp27 are clearly related to the intrinsic biochemical pathways solicited.

However, their role in the treatment of hematopoietic malignancies remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a new MMP inhibitor, SI-27, in hematopoietic malignancies. SI-27 alone induces apoptosis in several human myeloid leukemia cell lines such as U937, NB4, and HL60 cells by activating caspase 8, 9, and 3. Apoptosis was measured with annexin V positive staining, a drop in mitochondrial transmembrane potential (deltapsim), presence of hypodiploid DNA, and cleavage of PARP and IkappaBalpha. Furthermore, at lowered concentrations, which did not directly induce apoptosis, SI-27 acted to sensitize U937 cells and other cells to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-mediated apoptosis. The accumulation of membrane Fas, the Fas ligand, and TNFR1 were not apparent due to exposure to SI-27, and antagonistic anti-Fas or anti-Fas ligand antibodies did not block SI-27-induced apoptosis. Thus, SI-27-induced apoptosis is not mediated by the Fas pathway.

While the in vivo effects of daniplestim and myelopoietin-1 are well described, the mechanisms by which they stimulate growth are not well understood. We have investigated the effects of daniplestim and myelopoietin-1 on the prevention of apoptosis in two human hematopoietic cell lines, OCI-AML.5 and AML 193. Daniplestim and myelopoietin-1 prevented apoptosis to a greater degree than native recombinant IL-3 or G-CSF as determined by annexin V/propidium iodide binding and TUNEL assays. Daniplestim and myelopoietin-1 promoted the maintenance of the mitochondrial membrane potential better than native IL-3 or G-CSF. These cytokines promoted a lower redox potential as higher levels of free radicals were detected after cytokine treatment than in cytokine-deprived cells implying increased respiration. These results indicate that daniplestim and myelopoietin-1 are able to prevent apoptosis in hematopoietic cells more effectively than native IL-3 and G-CSF.

In six patients, multiple breaks occurred in small segments of 12p with subsequent translocations and insertions of these segments into other chromosomes, sometimes to unexpected regions. In three patients additional chromosome breaks resulted in a sub-clone which was cytogenetically indistinguishable from the main clone in each patient based on the cytogenetic analysis. These subtle molecular events were detected exclusively in a region covering TEL/ETV6 and KIP1/CDKN1B. Seven of nine had a previous history of chemo/radiotherapy; all the patients showed complex karyotypes, even though they were newly diagnosed with leukemia. Survival data were available in five patients, and all survived less than 6 months. These findings suggest that the 12p13 region, especially the above-mentioned region, is genetically unstable and fragile. It is likely that multiple chromosome breaks were induced through mutagens used in chemo/ radiotherapy, and are associated with a sub-group of patients with an extremely bad prognosis.","['Sato, Y', 'Kobayashi, H', 'Suto, Y', 'Olney, H J', 'Davis, E M', 'Super, H G', 'Espinosa, R 3rd', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Rowley, J D']","['Sato Y', 'Kobayashi H', 'Suto Y', 'Olney HJ', 'Davis EM', 'Super HG', 'Espinosa R 3rd', 'Le Beau MM', 'Rowley JD']","['Department of Clinical Pathology, Research Institute of International Medical Center of Japan, Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Chromosome Fragility', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Humans']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402188 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1193-202. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402188.,,,"['CA40046/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42557/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BIOMED-1 Concerted Action Investigation of Minimal Residual Disease in Acute Leukemia: International Standardization and Clinical Evaluation.,1185-92,"The flow cytometric detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) in precursor-B-acute lymphoblastic leukemias (precursor-B-ALL) mainly relies on the identification of minor leukemic cell populations that can be discriminated from their normal counterparts on the basis of phenotypic aberrancies observed at diagnosis. This technique is not very complex, but discordancies are frequently observed between laboratories, due to the lack of standardized methodological procedures and technical conditions. To develop standardized flow cytometric techniques for MRD detection, a European BIOMED-1 Concerted Action was initiated with the participation of laboratories from six different countries. The goal of this concerted action was to define aberrant phenotypic profiles in a series of 264 consecutive de novo precursor-B-ALL cases, systematically studied with one to five triple-labelings (TdT/CD10/CD19, CD10/CD20/CD19, CD34/CD38/CD19, CD34/CD22/CD19 and CD19/CD34/CD45) using common flow cytometric protocols in all participating laboratories. The use of four or five triple-stainings allowed the identification of aberrant phenotypes in virtually all cases tested (127 out of 130, 98%). These phenotypic aberrancies could be identified in at least two and often three triple-labelings per case. When the analysis was based on two or three triple-stainings, lower incidences of aberrancies were identified (75% and 81% of cases, respectively) that could be detected in one and sometimes two triple-stainings per case. The most informative triple staining was the TdT/CD10/CD19 combination, which enabled the identification of aberrancies in 78% of cases. The frequencies of phenotypic aberrations detected with the other four triple-stainings were 64% for CD10/CD20/CD19, 56% for CD34/CD38/CD19, 46% for CD34/CD22/CD19, and 22% for CD19/CD34/CD45. In addition, cross-lineage antigen expression was detected in 45% of cases, mainly coexpression of the myeloid antigens CD13 and/or CD33 (40%). Parallel flow cytometric studies in different laboratories finally resulted in highly concordant results (>90%) for all five antibody combinations, indicating the high reproducibility of our approach. In conclusion, the technique presented here with triple-labelings forms an excellent basis for standardized flow cytometric MRD studies in multicenter international treatment protocols for precursor-B-ALL patients.","['Lucio, P', 'Gaipa, G', 'van Lochem, E G', 'van Wering, E R', 'Porwit-MacDonald, A', 'Faria, T', 'Bjorklund, E', 'Biondi, A', 'van den Beemd, M W', 'Baars, E', 'Vidriales, B', 'Parreira, A', 'van Dongen, J J', 'San Miguel, J F', 'Orfao, A']","['Lucio P', 'Gaipa G', 'van Lochem EG', 'van Wering ER', 'Porwit-MacDonald A', 'Faria T', 'Bjorklund E', 'Biondi A', 'van den Beemd MW', 'Baars E', 'Vidriales B', 'Parreira A', 'van Dongen JJ', 'San Miguel JF', 'Orfao A']","['Department of Hematology, Portuguese Institute of Oncology, Lisbon.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry/standards', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Reference Standards', 'Reference Values']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402150 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1185-92. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402150.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,['BIOMED-I'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, because this new anti-leukemic drug is also considered to be a poison, its possible adverse effects are a highly important issue related to its clinical use. We here investigated, both in vitro and in vivo, the effects of a combination of As2O3 and GM-CSF as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of APL. Treatment of both retinoic acid (RA)-sensitive and -resistant APL cell lines (NB4 and UF-1 cells, respectively), as well as primary APL cells with a combination of As2O3 and GM-CSF for 4 days resulted in inducing differentiation, but not apoptosis, to mature granulocytes. In addition, a combination of both agents induced degradation of the PML/RARalpha protein. GM-CSF was found to be associated with increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 kinase in both NB4 and UF-1 cells, and a specific inhibitor of Jak2, AG490, completely blocked the ability of GM-CSF to prevent apoptosis and induce differentiation of As2O3-treated UF-1 cells. In in vivo analysis, As2O3 induced differentiation of APL cells in a RA-resistant APL model of human GM-CSF-producing transgenic SCID mice that had a high level of human GM-CSF in their sera. In contrast, As2O3 alone diminished tumors in UF-1 cells transplanted into NOD/SCID mice via induction of apoptosis. In conclusion, a combination of As2O3 and GM-CSF appears to be a novel differentiation-inducing therapy in patients with APL, including relapsed or RA-resistant cases.","['Muto, A', 'Kizaki, M', 'Kawamura, C', 'Matsushita, H', 'Fukuchi, Y', 'Umezawa, A', 'Yamada, T', 'Hata, J', 'Hozumi, N', 'Yamato, K', 'Ito, M', 'Ueyama, Y', 'Ikeda, Y']","['Muto A', 'Kizaki M', 'Kawamura C', 'Matsushita H', 'Fukuchi Y', 'Umezawa A', 'Yamada T', 'Hata J', 'Hozumi N', 'Yamato K', 'Ito M', 'Ueyama Y', 'Ikeda Y']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Keio University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide', 'Arsenicals/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Proteins/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/metabolism', 'Oxides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402162 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1176-84. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402162.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Arsenicals)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Oxides)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the current phase II study of 27 previously untreated patients with CLL, we used a sequential combination of six cycles of intravenous cyclophosphamide (1 g/m2) plus oral prednisone (100 mg/m2 per day for 5 days) followed by two to six cycles of 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (5 mg/m2 per day for 5 days).

For the most part, ceramide's effects are antagonistic to growth and survival. Interestingly, ceramide and the pro-growth agonist, diacylglycerol (DAG) appear to be regulated simultaneously but in opposite directions in the sphingomyelin cycle. While ceramide stimulates signal transduction pathways that are associated with cell death or at least are inhibitory to cell growth (eg stress-activated protein kinase, SAPK, pathways), DAG activates the classical and novel isoforms of the protein kinase C (PKC) family. These PKC isoforms are associated with cell growth and cell survival. Furthermore, DAG activation of PKC stimulates other signal transduction pathways that support cell proliferation (eg mitogen-activated protein kinase, MAPK, pathways). Thus, ceramide and DAG generation may serve to monitor cellular homeostasis by inducing pro-death or pro-growth pathways, respectively. The production of ceramide is emerging as a fixture of programmed cell death. Ceramide levels are elevated in response to diverse stress challenges including chemotherapeutic drug treatment, irradiation, or treatment with pro-death ligands such as tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF alpha. Consistent with this notion, ceramide itself is a potent apoptogenic agent. Ceramide activates stress-activated protein kinases like c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and thus affects transcription pathways involving c-jun. Ceramide activates protein phosphatases such as protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A). Ceramide activation of protein phosphatases has been shown to promote inactivation of a number of pro-growth cellular regulators including the kinases PKC alpha and Akt, Bcl2 and the retinoblastoma protein. A new role has recently emerged for ceramide in the regulation of protein synthesis. Ceramide-induced activation of double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), a protein kinase important in anti-viral host defense mechanisms and recently implicated in cellular stress pathways, results in the inhibition of protein synthesis as a prelude to cell death. Taken together, these properties of ceramide suggest that this important second-signal molecule may have useful properties as an anti-neoplastic agent. Thus, strategies to promote ceramide metabolism or use of ceramide analogs directly may one day become useful in the treatment of diseases like leukemia.","['Ruvolo, P P']",['Ruvolo PP'],"['University of Florida Shands Cancer Center and The Department of Medicine, Gainesville 32610-0232, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Animals', 'Ceramides/*physiology', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System', 'Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/physiology', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402197 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1153-60. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402197.,"['0 (Ceramides)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)']",121,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PNH cells would escape damage precisely because they have lost most or all of their ability to produce GPI.","['Karadimitris, A', 'Luzzatto, L']","['Karadimitris A', 'Luzzatto L']",,['eng'],"['Editorial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Hemoglobinuria, Paroxysmal/etiology/genetics/immunology/pathology', 'Humans']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.leu.2402180 [doi]'],ppublish,Leukemia. 2001 Aug;15(8):1148-52. doi: 10.1038/sj.leu.2402180.,,36,['R01 HL56778/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We determined the ability of cinchonine to reverse doxorubicin drug resistance in a doxorubicin-resistant leukaemia cell line (mouse P388/DOX). A non-cytotoxic concentration of cinchonine (10 microM) increased the sensitivity to doxorubicin of multidrug-resistant P388/DOX cells and significantly enhanced the doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and DNA fragmentation in resistant cells, but had no effect in parent cells. Time-course studies demonstrated that DNA fragmentation was present 24 h after incubation with doxorubicin and cinchonine, indicating that DNA degradation was a preceding event. In cultured cells, cinchonine increased the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in the resistant cells in a dose-dependent manner. Using flow cytometry to measure the inhibition of the P-glycoprotein (P-gp) dependent efflux of rhodamine 123, cinchonine was found to be considerably more effective than quinine. The results with cinchonine suggest that there may be quinine derivatives with a similar capacity to inhibit drug transport by P-gp. Additionally, the G2/M phase cell population in resistant cells is increased by doxorubicin/cinchonine treatment. Exposure of resistant cells to 1 microM doxorubicin and 10 microM cinchonine resulted in the expression of Fas (APO-1/CD95) in cells after 6 h.

Although lung biopsy may establish the diagnosis of parenchymal disease, it remains unclear whether such a procedure results in a significant change in the patient's treatment and outcome. This study evaluates the efficacy of lung biopsy in recipients of stem cell transplantation. METHODS: The medical records of 15 stem cell transplant recipients who underwent 18 lung biopsies were reviewed. The indications for stem cell transplantation were leukemia in 10 patients, lymphoma in 2, histiocytosis in 1, neuroblastoma in 1, and Ewing's sarcoma in 1. The results of the lung biopsies were correlated to the clinical management and outcomes. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 67% (10 patients). Eight of the 9 patients who required mechanical ventilatory support at the time of lung biopsy died. The pathologic diagnoses were pneumonitis in 6 biopsies, fibrosis in 6, brochiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia in 3, hemorrhage in 2, and infarction in 1. Therapy was changed in 1 patient who improved after a course of steroids for bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. Lung biopsy cultures were positive in 6 patients but rarely resulted in changes in antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Results of very few lung biopsies performed in stem cell transplant recipients redirected therapy. Furthermore, the ultimate outcome of these patients were not improved by the results of lung biopsies.","['Dunn, J C', 'West, K W', 'Rescorla, F J', 'Tres Scherer, L R', 'Engum, S A', 'Rouse, T M', 'Smith, J W', 'Grosfeld, J L']","['Dunn JC', 'West KW', 'Rescorla FJ', 'Tres Scherer LR', 'Engum SA', 'Rouse TM', 'Smith JW', 'Grosfeld JL']","['Section of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Surgery, Indiana University School of Medicine and the James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Biopsy, Needle/methods/statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Lung/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Pulmonary Edema/*etiology/*pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Survival Rate']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0022346801119378 [pii]', '10.1053/jpsu.2001.25799 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 2001 Aug;36(8):1302-3. doi: 10.1053/jpsu.2001.25799.,,,,,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

Ultrastructural morphology revealed blasts from AML-M0 as very immature myeloid cells, blasts from mixed-lineage leukemia as having partially lymphoid cell features, and blasts from AUL as undifferentiated blasts with myeloid nature to some extent. Ultrastructurally, myeloperoxidase activity was positive in 81% of AML-M0 patients and less positive in the mixed-lineage leukemia and AUL patients. The DNA in the nuclei of the AML-M0 blasts was dispersed, as was observed in the immature myeloid cells. Some of the blasts from the mixed-lineage leukemia patients showed condensation of DNA, resembling blasts from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The distribution of periodate-reactive glycoconjugates revealed that glycogen particles were absent or, if present, very scanty in AML-M0. Most of the blasts from the AUL patients lacked glycogen particles, and the blasts from those with mixed-lineage leukemia contained clustered glycogen particles, as was observed in the blasts from all patients.

However, antigens may be weak, and immune capacity can be compromised. Fusion of genes encoding activating sequences to the tumor antigen sequence facilitates promotion and manipulation of effector pathways. Idiotypic determinants of B-cell tumors, encoded by the variable region genes, are clone-specific tumor antigens. When assembled as single-chain Fv (scFv) alone in a DNA vaccine, immunogenicity is low. Previously, we found that fusion of a sequence from tetanus toxin (fragment C; FrC) promoted anti-idiotypic protection against lymphoma and myeloma. We have now investigated an alternative fusion gene derived from a plant virus, potato virus X coat protein, a primary antigen in humans. When fused to scFv, the self-aggregating protein generates protection against lymphoma and myeloma. In contrast to scFv-FrC, protection against lymphoma is mediated by CD4+ T cells, as is protection against myeloma. Plant viral proteins offer new opportunities to activate immunity against linked T-cell epitopes to attack cancer.","['Savelyeva, N', 'Munday, R', 'Spellerberg, M B', 'Lomonossoff, G P', 'Stevenson, F K']","['Savelyeva N', 'Munday R', 'Spellerberg MB', 'Lomonossoff GP', 'Stevenson FK']","['Molecular Immunology Group, Tenovus Laboratory, Southampton University Hospitals Trust, Southampton SO16 6YD, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Nat Biotechnol,Nature biotechnology,9604648,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fragments/chemistry', 'Immunoglobulin G/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*prevention & control', 'Lymphoma/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Multiple Myeloma/prevention & control', 'Plants/*genetics/*virology', 'Plasmids/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/chemistry/metabolism', 'Tetanus Toxin/chemistry', 'Time Factors', 'Vaccines, DNA/*pharmacology']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/90816 [doi]', '90816 [pii]']",ppublish,Nat Biotechnol. 2001 Aug;19(8):760-4. doi: 10.1038/90816.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Tetanus Toxin)', '0 (Vaccines, DNA)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, CD34(-) cell lines (HL-60, U937, JOK-1, Raji, Molt-3, Jurkat, and CEM-C7) and mature lymphocytes from peripheral blood and tonsils lacked CD173 and CD174. All cell lines and native lymphocytes as well as CD34+ precursor cells were negative for H3 and H4. Immunoprecipitation and consecutive Western blotting revealed a 170-kDa glycoprotein as the carrier molecule for the CD173 and CD174 oligosaccharide sequences on CD34+ hematopoietic precursors. The key enzyme for generating CD173 is the beta-D-galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase (FUT1). As shown by RT-PCR, FUT1 was expressed in immature hematopoietic cells but absent in mature lymphocytes, which indicates that expression of CD173 within the hematopoietic system is regulated at the transcriptional level by FUT1. Due to their exclusive presence on CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, CD173 and CD174 represent novel markers of early hematopoiesis. The expression of the fucosylated histo-blood group antigens CD173 and CD174 in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells and down-regulation of FUT1 in mature lymphocytes may be important factors influencing the homing process of hematopoietic stem cells to the bone marrow.","['Cao, Y', 'Merling, A', 'Karsten, U', 'Schwartz-Albiez, R']","['Cao Y', 'Merling A', 'Karsten U', 'Schwartz-Albiez R']","['Division of Cellular Immunology, German Cancer Research Centre, Im Neuenheimer Feld 280, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Glycobiology,Glycobiology,9104124,IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System/*metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/biosynthesis', 'Carbohydrate Sequence', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fucosyltransferases/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukosialin', 'Lewis Blood Group Antigens/*biosynthesis', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Sialoglycoproteins/*biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/glycob/11.8.677 [doi]'],ppublish,Glycobiology. 2001 Aug;11(8):677-83. doi: 10.1093/glycob/11.8.677.,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Leukosialin)', '0 (Lewis Blood Group Antigens)', '0 (Lewis Y antigen)', '0 (SPN protein, human)', '0 (Sialoglycoproteins)', 'EC 2.4.1.- (Fucosyltransferases)', 'EC 2.4.1.69 (galactoside 2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. By combining analyses from nuclear run-on, reporter gene transient transfection, genomic footprinting, site-directed mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, and Western blotting experiments, we found that constitutively elevated catalase expression is strongly regulated at the transcriptional level by both Sp1 and CCAAT-recognizing factors and that much higher levels of nuclear Sp1 and NF-Y are present in HP100 nuclei as compared with HL60 nuclei. In addition, we demonstrated an X-ray-inducible association of a WT1/Egr-related factor with an overlapping Sp1/Egr-1 recognition sequence located within the core promoter of the catalase gene.

Defects in apoptosis signaling pathways, thus, contribute to carcinogenesis and chemoresistance. A major goal in chemotherapy is, therefore, to find cytotoxic agents that restore the ability of tumor cells to undergo apoptosis. We show here that the sesquiterpene lactone helenalin (10-50 microM) induces apoptosis in leukemia Jurkat T cells even if they lack the CD95 death receptor or overexpress the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-x(L) or Bcl-2. Activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells, however, are not affected (10-50 microM helenalin). Helenalin led to a time-dependent (0-24 h) cleavage of the specific caspase-3-like substrate Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin as well as to the proteolytic processing of procaspase-3 and -8. Caspase activation was a necessary requirement for apoptosis because the broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk, 50 microM) completely abrogated helenalin-induced DNA fragmentation as well as phosphatidylserin translocation. Although the initiator caspase-8 was activated, the helenalin-induced signaling pathway did not require the CD95 death receptor as shown using cells without or with an antibody (ZB4)-blocked CD95 receptor. Helenalin also did not induce CD95 or CD95-ligand expression. On the other hand, helenalin was found to induce the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria that was not inhibited by the caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk, which indicated that cytochrome c release precedes caspase activation. Cytochrome c release was accompanied by dissipation of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), which was partly inhibited by zVAD-fmk, which suggests that caspases are involved in loss of DeltaPsi(m). Most importantly, overexpression of the mitochondria protecting proteins Bcl-x(L) or Bcl-2 failed to confer resistance to helenalin-induced apoptosis, although the data presented here suggest that helenalin induces a mitochondria-dependent pathway. Thus, helenalin is a promising experimental cytotoxic agent that possibly points to new strategies to overcome apoptosis resistance attributable to overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins.","['Dirsch, V M', 'Stuppner, H', 'Vollmar, A M']","['Dirsch VM', 'Stuppner H', 'Vollmar AM']","['Department of Pharmacy, Center of Drug Research, University of Munich, Butenandtstrasse 5-13, D-81377 Munich, Germany.

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT), an enzyme subject to genetic polymorphism, catabolizes thiopurines into inactive methylated bases, but also produces methylthioguanine nucleotides and methylmercaptopurine nucleotides from thioguanine and mercaptopurine nucleotides, respectively. To study the effect of TPMT on activation versus inactivation of mercaptopurine and thioguanine, we used a retroviral gene transfer technique to develop human CCRF-CEM cell lines that did (TPMT+) and did not (MOCK) overexpress TPMT. After transduction, TPMT activities were 14-fold higher in the TPMT+ versus the MOCK cell lines (P < 0.001). TPMT+ cells were less sensitive to thioguanine than MOCK cells (IC(50) = 1.10+/- 0.12 microM versus 0.55 +/- 0.19 microM; P = 0.02); in contrast, TPMT+ cells were more sensitive to mercaptopurine than MOCK cells (IC(50) = 0.52 +/- 0.20 microM versus 1.50 +/- 0.23 microM; P < 0.01). The lower sensitivity of TPMT+ versus MOCK cells to thioguanine was associated with lower thioguanine nucleotide concentrations (917 +/- 282 versus 1515 +/- 183 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells; P = 0.01), higher methylthioguanine nucleotide concentrations (252 +/- 34 versus 27 +/- 10 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells; P = 0.01), less inhibition of de novo purine synthesis (13 versus 95%; P < 0.01), and lower deoxythioguanosine incorporation into DNA (2.0 +/- 0.6% versus 7.2 +/- 2.0%; P < 0.001). The higher sensitivity of TPMT+ cells to mercaptopurine was associated with higher concentrations of methylmercaptopurine nucleotide (2601 +/- 1055 versus 174 +/- 77 pmol/5 x 10(6) cells; P = 0.01) and greater inhibition of de novo purine synthesis (>99% versus 74%; P < 0.01) compared with MOCK cells. We conclude that methylation of mercaptopurine contributes to the antiproliferative properties of the drug, probably through inhibition of de novo purine synthesis by methylmercaptopurine nucleotides, whereas thioguanine is inactivated primarily by TPMT.","['Dervieux, T', 'Blanco, J G', 'Krynetski, E Y', 'Vanin, E F', 'Roussel, M F', 'Relling, M V']","['Dervieux T', 'Blanco JG', 'Krynetski EY', 'Vanin EF', 'Roussel MF', 'Relling MV']","[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105, USA.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['3T3 Cells', 'Animals', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Biotransformation', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Deoxyguanosine/metabolism', 'Gene Transfer Techniques', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/*enzymology/genetics', 'Mercaptopurine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Methyltransferases/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Purine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Purines/biosynthesis', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Thioguanine/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Thionucleosides/metabolism', 'Thionucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Aug 1;61(15):5810-6.,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Purine Nucleotides)', '0 (Purines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '6V404DV25O (6-methylthiopurine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'EC 2.1.1.67 (thiopurine methyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",,"['CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36401/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA51001/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA56819/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vinca alkaloids bind to the beta-tubulin subunit of the alpha/beta-tubulin heterodimer and inhibit polymerization of microtubules. Recent studies have implicated altered beta-tubulin isotype expression and mutations in resistance to microtubule-stabilizing agents. Microtubule-associated protein (MAP) MAP4 binds to and stabilizes microtubules, and increased expression is associated with decreased sensitivity to microtubule-depolymerizing agents. To address the significance of beta-tubulin and MAP4 alterations in childhood ALL, two CCRF-CEM-derived Vinca alkaloid resistant cell lines, VCR R (vincristine) and VLB100 (vinblastine), were examined. Decreased expression of class III beta-tubulin was detected in both VCR R and VLB100 cells. VCR R cells and to a lesser extent VLB100 cells expressed increased levels of MAP4 protein. Increased microtubule stability was observed in these VCR R cells as identified by the high levels of polymerized tubulin (45.6 +/- 2.6%; P < 0.005) compared with CEM and VLB100 cells (24.7 +/- 3.3% and 24.7 +/- 2.5%, respectively). Expression was associated with a single MAP4 isoform in the polymerized microtubule fraction in CEM and VCR cells. In contrast, VLB100 cells expressed a lower molecular weight isoform in the polymerized fraction. Two-dimensional-PAGE and immunoblotting revealed marked posttranslational changes in class I beta-tubulin in VCR R cells not evident in CEM cells. Sequencing of the beta-tubulin (HM40) gene identified a point mutation in VCR R cells in nucleotide 843 (CTC-->ATC; Leu(240)-->Ile) that was not present in CEM or VLB100 cells. This mutation resides in a region of beta-tubulin that lies in close proximity to the alpha/beta tubulin interface. Multiple alterations related to normal microtubule function were identified in ALL cells selected for resistance to Vinca alkaloids, and these alterations may provide important insight into mechanisms mediating resistance to Vinca alkaloids.","['Kavallaris, M', 'Tait, A S', 'Walsh, B J', 'He, L', 'Horwitz, S B', 'Norris, M D', 'Haber, M']","['Kavallaris M', 'Tait AS', 'Walsh BJ', 'He L', 'Horwitz SB', 'Norris MD', 'Haber M']","[""Children's Cancer Institute Australia for Medical Research, High Street, Randwick, NSW, Australia 2031. m.kavallaris@unsw.edu.au""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Microtubule-Associated Proteins/biosynthesis/metabolism', 'Microtubules/*metabolism', 'Models, Molecular', 'Mutation', 'Protein Conformation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Tubulin/biosynthesis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vinblastine/*pharmacology', 'Vincristine/*pharmacology']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 2001 Aug 1;61(15):5803-9.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (MAP4)', '0 (Microtubule-Associated Proteins)', '0 (Tubulin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, we have isolated and characterized a lectin from the venom of the snake Bothrops jararacussu.

In the present work, we observed that cells from human metastatic breast cancer (MDA-MB-435) and human ovarian carcinoma (OVCAR-5) cell lines adhere, although weakly, to BJcuL. However, BJcuL did not inhibit adhesion of these cells to the extracellular matrix proteins fibronectin, laminin and type I collagen. Importantly, viability of these tumor cells and cells from other human tumor cell lines and a bovine brain endothelial cell line was suppressed by BJcuL. These findings suggest that the lectin BJcuL may serve as an interesting tool for combating tumor progression by inhibiting tumor cell and endothelial cell growth.","['de Carvalho, D D', 'Schmitmeier, S', 'Novello, J C', 'Markland, F S']","['de Carvalho DD', 'Schmitmeier S', 'Novello JC', 'Markland FS']","['Departamento de Bioquimica, Instituto de Biologia, UNICAMP, Campinas-SP, 13083-970, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Toxicon,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,1307333,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Vessels/cytology', 'Bothrops', 'Brain/cytology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Carcinoma/pathology', 'Cattle', '*Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Collagen/metabolism', 'Crotalid Venoms/analysis/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Endothelium, Vascular/cytology', 'Extracellular Matrix Proteins/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Fibronectins/metabolism', 'Glioblastoma/pathology', 'Humans', 'Laminin/metabolism', 'Lectins/analysis/*chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/pathology', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urinary Bladder Neoplasms/pathology']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0041-0101(01)00106-4 [pii]', '10.1016/s0041-0101(01)00106-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicon. 2001 Oct;39(10):1471-6. doi: 10.1016/s0041-0101(01)00106-4.,"['0 (Crotalid Venoms)', '0 (Extracellular Matrix Proteins)', '0 (Fibronectins)', '0 (Laminin)', '0 (Lectins)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to examine the possibility that EGCG-binding to Fas triggers the Fas-mediated apoptosis. The EGCG treatment of human monocytic leukemia U937 cells resulted in elevation of caspase 8 activity and fragmentation of caspase 8. The DNA ladder formation caused by the EGCG treatment was inhibited by the caspase 8 inhibitor. These findings suggested the involvement of the Fas-mediated cascade in the EGCG-induced apoptosis in U937 cells. Affinity chromatography revealed the binding between EGCG and Fas. Thus, the results suggest that EGCG-binding to Fas, presumably on the cell surface, triggers the Fas-mediated apoptosis in U937 cells.","['Hayakawa, S', 'Saeki, K', 'Sazuka, M', 'Suzuki, Y', 'Shoji, Y', 'Ohta, T', 'Kaji, K', 'Yuo, A', 'Isemura, M']","['Hayakawa S', 'Saeki K', 'Sazuka M', 'Suzuki Y', 'Shoji Y', 'Ohta T', 'Kaji K', 'Yuo A', 'Isemura M']","['School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, University of Shizuoka, Yada, Shizuoka, 422-8526, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['*Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Blotting, Western', 'Caspase 8', 'Caspase 9', 'Caspase Inhibitors', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Catechin/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Protein Binding/drug effects/physiology', 'U937 Cells', 'fas Receptor/*metabolism']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/bbrc.2001.5293 [doi]', 'S0006-291X(01)95293-3 [pii]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2001 Aug 3;285(5):1102-6. doi: 10.1006/bbrc.2001.5293.,"['0 (Caspase Inhibitors)', '0 (Cysteine Proteinase Inhibitors)', '0 (fas Receptor)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'BQM438CTEL (epigallocatechin gallate)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP8 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP9 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surprisingly, we found that histamine synthesis did effectively occur in response to the growth factor. This activity was not associated with megakaryopoiesis since it was not detected in megakaryocytes generated from CD34(+) cells cultured in the presence of TPO. Comparing different c-mpl-transfected cell lines, we found that the amount of histamine generated in response to TPO correlated with their responsiveness to PMA, but not with their level of c-mpl expression, thus revealing an intrinsic basophil differentiation potential.

Cholesterol and its derivatives are required in high concentrations by neoplastic proliferating cells for both DNA synthesis and cell growth. Thus, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase could effect cell cycle progression and proliferation. Therefore, we examined the effect of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (simvastatin) alone and in combination with cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C) on the proliferation of two AML cell lines. METHODS: AML blasts derived from two cell lines (HL-60 and AML-2) were incubated with increasing concentrations of either simvastatin alone or simvastatin alone for 24 hours with ARA-C added thereafter. The effect of the drugs on cell proliferation in liquid culture (3H thymidine uptake) and on clonogenic assay was analyzed. RESULTS: We found that the number of proliferating AML blasts (suspension cultures) and colony formations (agar cultures) of both cell lines declined significantly after incubation with simvastatin. Preincubation of both cell lines with simvastatin by the addition of increasing concentrations of ARA-C produced a degree of growth inhibition that was significantly greater than that of the individual compounds. This antigrowth interaction was additive rather than synergistic. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that simvastatin has a major antiproliferative effect on AML blasts in vitro. Also, the combination of simvastatin and ARA-C significantly enhanced the antiproliferative effect of each drug. These findings may open new avenues in both the laboratory and clinical research of the treatment of leukemia.","['Lishner, M', 'Bar-Sef, A', 'Elis, A', 'Fabian, I']","['Lishner M', 'Bar-Sef A', 'Elis A', 'Fabian I']","['Department of Medicine, Meir Hospital, Kfar-Saba, Israel. lishnm@internet-zahav.net']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Investig Med,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,9501229,IM,"['Anticholesteremic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Simvastatin/*administration & dosage', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",2001/08/02 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.2310/6650.2001.33896 [doi]'],ppublish,J Investig Med. 2001 Jul;49(4):319-24. doi: 10.2310/6650.2001.33896.,"['0 (Anticholesteremic Agents)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'AGG2FN16EV (Simvastatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,10.2310/6650.2001.33896 [doi],,,,,,,,,,,,

This property may also be used to enhance a graft-versus-leukaemia effect (GVL) after donor leucocyte infusion (DLI), a mode of therapy increasingly offered to patients relapsing after allo BMT. AIM: The aims of the present study were to examine the efficacy and toxicity of IFN therapy administered after granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)-stimulated blood cells given as DLI in patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute undifferentiated leukaemia (AUL) and multiple myeloma relapsing after allo BMT. METHODS: Between October 1996 and September 1999, 27 patients (16 AML, four ALL, three CML, three multiple myeloma, one AUL) who relapsed after allo BMT were treated with chemotherapy followed by DLI, collected after G-CSF stimulation in all but two cases. Subsequently, IFN was given to patients without significant GVHD or rapidly progressive disease. The outcome after DLI with regard to remission rate, disease-free survival and GVHD was analysed. RESULTS: Eighteen patients received IFN following DLI, 14 of whom developed significant GVHD (grade II-IV acute or extensive chronic); thereafter, GVHD resolved with cessation of IFN alone in four patients, but 10 required systemic immunosuppression. Twenty-three patients were given chemotherapy and DLI as initial treatment of relapse; 10 achieved complete remission (CR), in four patients this was only after the onset of GVHD. The other four patients received chemotherapy and DLI as a consolidation of a chemotherapy-induced remission. The CR was durable only in patients with CML (3 of 3) and AML (4 of 8). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with IFN induced GVHD in the majority of patients receiving DLI. The induction of GVHD and GVL by this approach produced excellent results in patients with CML and modest results in AML, but appeared to be less effective in myeloma and ALL.","['Grigg, A', 'Kannan, K', 'Schwarer, A P', 'Spencer, A', 'Szer, J']","['Grigg A', 'Kannan K', 'Schwarer AP', 'Spencer A', 'Szer J']","['Department of Clinical Haernatology and Medical Oncology, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia. andrew.grigg@mh.org.au']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/drug effects', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/therapy', '*Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/etiology', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis', 'Treatment Outcome']",2001/08/02 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/08/02 10:00'],"['2001/08/02 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/08/02 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1046/j.1445-5994.2001.00013.x [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2001 Jan-Feb;31(1):15-22. doi: 10.1046/j.1445-5994.2001.00013.x.,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the concentration of CSMI and the time of mixed culture with CSMI before irradiation had positive relation to the effects mentioned above. Compared with control group, CSMI could increase the radiation-induced apoptosis of fresh leukemia cells (5.89 +/- 2.91% vs 12.05 +/- 3.06%).

To date, more than 40 different 11q23 abnormalities have been described on the cytogenetic level, and at least 25 of the respective fusion partner genes are cloned. The vast majority of the respective reciprocal translocations generate a chimeric 5'-MLL/partner-3' gene on the derivative 11q23. In this work, we report a unique ins(X;11)(q24;q23) in an infant with acute myeloid leukemia (AML-M2) that fuses the human KIAA0128 gene at Xq24 with MLL. In contrast to the typical reciprocal MLL translocations, however, we provide evidence that the 5'-MLL/KIAA0128-3' fusion resides on Xq24 rather than on 11q23. The KIAA0128 gene encodes the human Septin 6 protein, which contains an ATP-GTP binding motif and three nuclear targeting sequences in its carboxy terminus. The maintenance of the reading frame of the 5'-MLL/KIAA0128-3' mRNA fusion allows for the formation of a novel chimeric protein. Septin 6 is the third member of the Septins that is fused to the MLL protein; the other two are hCDCrel at 22q11 and MSF at 17q25.","['Borkhardt, A', 'Teigler-Schlegel, A', 'Fuchs, U', 'Keller, C', 'Konig, M', 'Harbott, J', 'Haas, O A']","['Borkhardt A', 'Teigler-Schlegel A', 'Fuchs U', 'Keller C', 'Konig M', 'Harbott J', 'Haas OA']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, University of Giessen, Giessen, Germany. arndt.borkhardt@paediat.med.uni-giessen.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'Cytoskeletal Proteins', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Remission Induction', 'Septins', '*Transcription Factors', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'X Chromosome/*genetics']",2001/07/31 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/07/31 10:00'],"['2001/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.1169 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Sep;32(1):82-8. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1169.,"['0 (Cytoskeletal Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (SEPTIN6 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Septins)']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Double minutes (dmin) and homogeneously staining regions are well established phenomena as cytogenetic correlates of gene amplification. Recently, however, two additional mechanisms leading to gene amplification, i.e., segmental jumping translocations and formation of ring chromosomes, have been described. We report four patients with AML, in whom bone marrow cells exhibited amplifications of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in the form of ring chromosomes or a hsr. In two patients, the MLL gene, and in one patient the CBFA2 gene were shown to be co-amplified with rRNA genes. In two of the four patients, multiple copies of alpha-satellite sequences of the centromeres 13 and 21, respectively, were also demonstrated. In three of the four patients, the clinical course was very aggressive, leading to death within 2-8 months. In these three patients, complex karyotype abnormalities were found, whereas the karyotype of Patient 4 was characterized only by supernumerary ring 21 chromosomes of different sizes and a trisomy 8 in half of the metaphases. Modes of origin and clinical significance of the amplification of rRNA genes are discussed.","['Fonatsch, C', 'Nowotny, H', 'Pittermann-Hocker, E', 'Streubel, B', 'Jager, U', 'Valent, P', 'Buchner, T', 'Lechner, K']","['Fonatsch C', 'Nowotny H', 'Pittermann-Hocker E', 'Streubel B', 'Jager U', 'Valent P', 'Buchner T', 'Lechner K']","['Institut fur Medizinische Biologie der Universitat Wien, Vienna, Austria. christa.fonatsch@uniivie.ac.at']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow Cells/pathology', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification/*genetics', 'Genes, rRNA/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/31 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/07/31 10:00'],"['2001/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.1161 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Sep;32(1):11-7. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1161.,,,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The AF10 gene on chromosome 10 at band p12 and MLL at 11q23 fuse in the t(10;11)(p12;q23). Recently, we have identified ABI1 as a new partner gene for MLL in an AML patient with a t(10;11)(p11.2;q23). The ABI1 is a human homologue of the mouse Abl-interactor 1 (Abi1), encoding an Abl-binding protein. The ABI1 protein exhibits sequence similarity to homeotic genes, and contains several polyproline stretches and a src homology 3 (SH3) domain. To clarify the clinical features of t(10;11)-leukemias, we investigated 6 samples from acute leukemia patients with t(10;11) and MLL rearrangement and detected MLL-AF10 chimeric transcripts in 5 samples and MLL-ABI1 in one. The patient with MLL-ABI1 chimeric transcript is the second case described, thus confirming that the fusion of the MLL and ABI1 genes is a recurring abnormality. Both of the patients with MLL-ABI1 chimeric transcript are surviving, suggesting that these patients have a better prognosis than the patients with MLL-AF10. To investigate the roles of AF10 and ABI1 further, we examined the expression of these genes in various cell lines and fresh tumor samples using the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction method. Although AF10 was expressed in almost all cell lines similarly, the expression patterns of ABI1 were different between leukemia and solid tumor cell lines, suggesting the distinctive role of each isoform of ABI1 in these cell lines. We also determined the complete mouse Abi1 sequence and found that the sequence matched with human ABI1 better than the originally reported Abi1 sequence. Further functional analysis of the MLL-AF10 and MLL-ABI1 fusion proteins will provide new insights into the leukemogenesis of t(10;11)-AML.","['Shibuya, N', 'Taki, T', 'Mugishima, H', 'Chin, M', 'Tsuchida, M', 'Sako, M', 'Kawa, K', 'Ishii, E', 'Miura, I', 'Yanagisawa, M', 'Hayashi, Y']","['Shibuya N', 'Taki T', 'Mugishima H', 'Chin M', 'Tsuchida M', 'Sako M', 'Kawa K', 'Ishii E', 'Miura I', 'Yanagisawa M', 'Hayashi Y']","['Department of Pediatrics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Amino Acid Sequence/genetics', 'Animals', '*Arabidopsis Proteins', 'Base Sequence/genetics', 'Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 10/*genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11/*genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein', '*Neoplasm Proteins', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Phosphoprotein Phosphatases/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/*genetics', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'U937 Cells']",2001/07/31 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/07/31 10:00'],"['2001/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.1160 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2001 Sep;32(1):1-10. doi: 10.1002/gcc.1160.,"['0 (Arabidopsis Proteins)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (MLL-ABI1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (MLLT10 protein, human)', '0 (Mllt10 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Kmt2a protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.- (ABI1 protein, Arabidopsis)', 'EC 3.1.3.16 (Phosphoprotein Phosphatases)']",,,,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,['GENBANK/AY033645'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The question of proneness to other kinds of cancer is still open. In this study we reassessed the incidence rates of leukemia and other malignancies in Israeli DS subjects, based on the total population. The target population consisted of all DS subjects in Israel in the period of 1948--1995. Due to incompleteness of data, the target population was not fully achieved, thus the study population was divided into 2 subgroups: subjects born in Israel between 1979 and 1995 (registry group) and currently or past-institutionalized subjects born before 1979 (institution group). The cohort was linked with the Cancer Registry, and cancer cases that had been diagnosed through December 1995 were subsequently identified. Observed incidence rates were compared with expected rates in the general population. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were computed for each disease category. Analyses were performed separately for each subgroup of the study population. In the registry group, 7 cancer cases were observed, compared with 1.5 expected (SIR = 4.67, 95% CI 1.9--9.6), all leukemia cases. For the institution group a total of 17 cancer cases were observed, compared with 12.8 expected. These included 4 cases of leukemia (SIR = 6.90, 95% CI 1.90--17.70). An excess of gastric cancer in male subjects (SIR = 11.9, 95% CI 1.3--42.9) was also observed. Significant excess of leukemia in DS population in Israel is in accordance with previously published data. An excess of gastric cancer in DS male subjects born before 1979, which has not been reported before, should be further explored.","['Boker, L K', 'Blumstein, T', 'Sadetzki, S', 'Luxenburg, O', 'Litvak, I', 'Akstein, E', 'Modan, B']","['Boker LK', 'Blumstein T', 'Sadetzki S', 'Luxenburg O', 'Litvak I', 'Akstein E', 'Modan B']","['Department of Clinical Epidemiology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Ramat Gan, Israel.

Both normal and malignant B cells can express the 1D10 antigen. A humanized version of 1D10 was produced using CDR grafting. The resulting antibody has an affinity that is similar to that of the parental murine antibody. In addition, the humanized antibody is capable of inducing complement-mediated cytotoxicity, antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity, and direct apoptosis of 1D10-expressing B cells. Based on these in vitro anti-tumor activities, we conclude humanized 1D10 deserves further evaluation as an immunotherapeutic agent.","['Kostelny, S A', 'Link, B K', 'Tso, J Y', 'Vasquez, M', 'Jorgensen, B H', 'Wang, H', 'Hall, W C', 'Weiner, G J']","['Kostelny SA', 'Link BK', 'Tso JY', 'Vasquez M', 'Jorgensen BH', 'Wang H', 'Hall WC', 'Weiner GJ']","['Protein Design Labs, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Antibody Affinity', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Apoptosis/immunology', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Epitopes/immunology', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/biosynthesis/genetics/*immunology', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",2001/07/31 10:00,2001/08/10 10:01,['2001/07/31 10:00'],"['2001/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/10 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1002/ijc.1366 [pii]', '10.1002/ijc.1366 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2001 Aug 15;93(4):556-65. doi: 10.1002/ijc.1366.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",,['M01 RR00059/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,"['Copyright 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.']",,"['GENBANK/AF281860', 'GENBANK/AF281861']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the impact on outcome of auto-SCT after two different strategies of early intensification performed after an identical induction regimen in adult patients with AML. Between January 1993 and December 1998, 140 consecutive AML patients were enrolled in a program consisting of an identical anthracycline-based induction (ICE) and two different consolidation regimens: one cycle, cytarabine-based (single-NOVIA: 91 patients); two cycles, fludarabine-based (double-FLAN: 49 patients). Seventy out of 91 patients received single-NOVIA consolidation: 60 underwent a transplantation procedure (allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo-BMT):16 patients; auto-SCT: 44). Thirty-five out of 49 patients received double-FLAN consolidation: 31 underwent a transplantation procedure (allo-BMT: 10; auto-SCT: 21). The double consolidation regimen was well-tolerated with only minor side-effects. Median follow-up observation time for surviving patients was 38 months (range, 17-71) for the double-FLAN consolidation group and 70 months (range: 48-93) for the single-NOVIA consolidation group. Among the patients who received auto-SCT, the double consolidation strategy produced a superior disease-free survival curve at 36 months (78.6% (95%CI: 59.4-97.8) vs 47.7% (95%CI: 33-62.4)) compared with the single-NOVIA group. This difference was confirmed when the patients were analyzed for intention to treat (P = 0.04). In addition, the double-FLAN consolidation group showed a superior overall survival and lower relapse rate (P = 0.02). We conclude that the double-FLAN reinforcement strategy is safe and enhances the clinical impact of auto-SCT for AML patients in first complete remission.

All patients received marrow depleted of mature CD3(+) T cells by complement-mediated lysis using T(10)B(9)-1A3 (n = 489) or Muromonab-Orthoclone OKT3 (n = 57) monoclonal antibodies. Neutrophil engraftment to 0.5 x 10(9)/1 and platelet engraftment to 20 x 10(9)/l were assessed as endpoints. Factors significantly affecting neutrophil or platelet engraftment in the univariate analysis included patient age, T cell dose, anti-thymocyte globulin use, gender, diagnosis at transplant, CMV serostatus, HLA mismatch, CD34 cell dose (n = 249), and growth factor use and type. These variables were included in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model. The results showed that a faster rate of neutrophil engraftment was independently associated with CD34(+) cell dose > or = 5 x 10(6)/kg and most strongly with growth factor administration. Faster platelet engraftment was associated with transplantation for chronic leukemia, CD34(+) cell dose > or = 2 x 10(6)/kg, an HLA matched related donor, and the absence of growth factor use. G-CSF had a higher relative risk (RR) of enhancing neutrophil engraftment than GM-CSF and significantly delayed platelet engraftment. The combined use of G-CSF + GM-CSF was similar to G-CSF alone. The enhancing effect of G-CSF for neutrophil recovery was most striking for patients who engrafted to 0.5 x 10(9)/1 at or before day 12 (RR = 9.5, P < 0.0001) compared to patients who received no growth factor. Conversely, the delaying effect of G-CSF on platelet engraftment was strongest for patients engrafting on or before day 25 (RR = 0.4, P = 0.0004). Of the independent variables affecting engraftment kinetics in recipients of TCD marrow allografts only growth factor, and to a limited extent, CD34(+) cell dose can be controlled by the clinician. A higher CD34(+) cell dose enhances the rate of both neutrophil and platelet engraftment whereas for G-CSF the benefits of myeloid growth factor use in enhancing neutrophil recovery may be partly offset by a delay in platelet engraftment.","['Keever-Taylor, C A', 'Klein, J P', 'Eastwood, D', 'Bredeson, C', 'Margolis, D A', 'Burns, W H', 'Vesole, D H']","['Keever-Taylor CA', 'Klein JP', 'Eastwood D', 'Bredeson C', 'Margolis DA', 'Burns WH', 'Vesole DH']","['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, WI, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Analysis of Variance', 'Antigens, CD34/physiology', 'Blood Donors', 'Blood Platelets/cytology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', '*Graft Survival/drug effects/immunology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematologic Diseases/mortality/therapy', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutrophils/cytology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Time Factors']",2001/07/31 10:00,2002/01/11 10:01,['2001/07/31 10:00'],"['2000/10/23 00:00 [received]', '2001/01/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/11 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/sj.bmt.1702872 [doi]'],ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 2001 Apr;27(8):791-800. doi: 10.1038/sj.bmt.1702872.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During this process, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-inducible expression of human leukocyte antigen-DR alpha is markedly enhanced. The enhancement of human leukocyte antigen-DR alpha expression is at least due to the TPA-dependent induction of the IFN-gamma receptor 1 chain and IFN-gamma receptor 2 chain genes. Here we have studied the mechanism of TPA-induced up-regulation of the IFN-gamma receptor 1 chain gene. Reporter gene analyses of 5'-deletion constructs of the IFN-gamma receptor 1 gene (IFNGR1) promoter indicated that the critical region for control of transcription and the TPA-responsive element (TRE) were present in the -128 to -109 base pair (bp) region. We confirmed that this region of the IFNGR1 promoter was responsive to TPA-induced signals by using a reporter construct whose promoter consisted of the -128 to -109 bp fragment and the minimal herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter. Moreover, a supershift assay indicated that Sp1 bound to this TRE in TPA-treated THP-1 cells. These results suggest that in TPA-treated cells the binding of Sp1 to the TRE of the IFNGR1 promoter causes the up-regulation of this gene.","['Sakamoto, S', 'Taniguchi, T']","['Sakamoto S', 'Taniguchi T']","['Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Medical Research Center, Kochi Medical School, Okoh, Nankoku, Kochi 783-8505, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Carcinogens/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/analysis', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/drug effects', 'Receptors, Interferon/drug effects/*genetics', 'STAT1 Transcription Factor', 'Serine/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/metabolism']",2001/07/31 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/31 10:00'],"['2001/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1074/jbc.M105543200 [doi]', 'S0021-9258(19)56663-7 [pii]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2001 Oct 5;276(40):37237-41. doi: 10.1074/jbc.M105543200.

RESULTS: Four patients had a complete remission of chronic GvHD on thalidomide; five patients showed a partial response. Of these five patients, three died eventually of respectively ongoing GvHD, pneumonia and recurrent leukemia. There were no serious side effects, except for one patient who had to stop thalidomide because of polyneuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: It is worthwhile to give thalidomide in prednison/ciclosporin A refractory chronic GvHD.

To delineate the basis for these differences we studied the transcriptional regulation of human methionine adenosyltransferase II (MAT II), which catalyzes AdoMet synthesis in these cells. Recently, we identified an Sp1 site in the proximal promoter of the MAT2A gene, which encodes the alpha2 catalytic subunit of MAT II, that is essential for the in vitro and in vivo promoter activity in Jurkat leukemic T cells, and that involves binding of the nuclear factors Sp2 and Sp3, but not Sp1. Here, the in vitro and in vivo activity of the proximal MAT2A promoter in normal resting, PHA-stimulated, and leukemic human T cells was compared. Significantly different patterns of protein factor interaction in the proximal region of the MAT2A promoter were found. Normal resting and activated T cells produced complexes of significantly lower molecular weight than those formed in leukemic T cells. Supershift studies coupled with analysis of proteins bound to the proximal promoter suggest that low levels of expression of Sp2 and Sp3 in normal T cells may be responsible for the difference in the in vitro promoter activity between normal and leukemic cells. Mutation of the key Sp1 site equally reduced the in vivo promoter activity in normal and malignant T cells; by contrast, it had significantly different effects on protein-DNA interactions in normal and leukemic T cells. Together, the data support the idea that differences in protein-DNA interactions may contribute to significant differences in MAT2A regulation in normal and malignant cells.","['Halim, A B', 'LeGros, H L Jr', 'Chamberlin, M E', 'Geller, A', 'Kotb, M']","['Halim AB', 'LeGros HL Jr', 'Chamberlin ME', 'Geller A', 'Kotb M']","['Department of Surgery, University of Tennessee, Memphis 38104, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Binding Sites', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Child', 'DNA Probes', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Glycoproteins', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Lipoproteins/biosynthesis', 'Methionine Adenosyltransferase/chemistry/*genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes']",2001/07/31 10:00,2001/10/26 10:01,['2001/07/31 10:00'],"['2001/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/26 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0167-4889(01)00115-X [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-4889(01)00115-x [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 2001 Jul 25;1540(1):32-42. doi: 10.1016/s0167-4889(01)00115-x.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (LGALS3BP protein, human)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', 'EC 2.5.1.6 (Methionine Adenosyltransferase)']",,['GM-54892-09/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CONCLUSION: This case reveals the occurrence of simultaneous bilateral central retinal vein occlusion associated with anticardiolipin antibodies in leukemia and suggests an additional mechanism other than hyperviscosity for bilateral central retinal vein occlusions in leukemic patients.","['Al-Abdulla, N A', 'Thompson, J T', 'LaBorwit, S E']","['Al-Abdulla NA', 'Thompson JT', 'LaBorwit SE']","['Krieger Eye Institute, Sinai Hospital, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Ophthalmol,American journal of ophthalmology,0370500,IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Anticardiolipin/*analysis', 'Antiphospholipid Syndrome/*complications/diagnosis/immunology', 'Blood Viscosity', 'Fluorescein Angiography', 'Glaucoma, Neovascular/complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*complications/diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Retinal Vein Occlusion/*complications/diagnosis/immunology', 'Visual Acuity']",2001/07/31 10:00,2001/08/17 10:01,['2001/07/31 10:00'],"['2001/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/17 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0002939401009114 [pii]', '10.1016/s0002-9394(01)00911-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Ophthalmol. 2001 Aug;132(2):266-8. doi: 10.1016/s0002-9394(01)00911-4.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anticardiolipin)']",,['P30-EY01765/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Following incubation in differentiation media containing interleukin (IL)-1b (IL-1b), IL-11, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), up to 1% of the precursor cells converted into cells immunoreactive for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a marker for dopamine neurons. The TH immunoreactive cells exhibited morphological and functional properties characteristic of dopamine neurons in culture. These precursor cells might serve as a useful source of human dopamine neurons for studying the development and degeneration of human dopamine neurons and may further serve as a continuous, on-demand source of cells for therapeutic transplantation in patients with Parkinson's disease.","['Storch, A', 'Paul, G', 'Csete, M', 'Boehm, B O', 'Carvey, P M', 'Kupsch, A', 'Schwarz, J']","['Storch A', 'Paul G', 'Csete M', 'Boehm BO', 'Carvey PM', 'Kupsch A', 'Schwarz J']","['Department of Neurology, University of Ulm Medical School, Ulm, Germany. alexander.storch@medizin.uni-ulm.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Exp Neurol,Experimental neurology,0370712,IM,"['Biomarkers/analysis', 'Cell Culture Techniques/methods', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dopamine/analysis', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Epidermal Growth Factor/pharmacology', 'Fetus', 'Fibroblast Growth Factor 2/pharmacology', 'Gestational Age', 'Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor', 'Growth Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-11/pharmacology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Mesencephalon/cytology/*embryology', '*Nerve Growth Factors', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/pharmacology', 'Neurons/*cytology', 'Oxygen/pharmacology', 'Prosencephalon/cytology/*embryology', 'Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Time Factors', 'Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase/analysis']",2001/07/31 10:00,2001/09/14 10:01,['2001/07/31 10:00'],"['2001/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/14 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']","['10.1006/exnr.2001.7706 [doi]', 'S0014-4886(01)97706-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Exp Neurol. 2001 Aug;170(2):317-25. doi: 10.1006/exnr.2001.7706.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (GDNF protein, human)', '0 (Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-11)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Nerve Growth Factors)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '103107-01-3 (Fibroblast Growth Factor 2)', '62229-50-9 (Epidermal Growth Factor)', 'EC 1.14.16.2 (Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)']",,,,['Copyright 2001 Academic Press.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although sperm DNA damage exists following treatment, no increase in genetic defects or congenital malformations was detected among children conceived to parents who have previously undergone chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The use of assisted reproductive technologies and micromanipulation techniques might increase this risk; hence caution should be exercised. In female cancer patients, miscarriage and congenital malformations are not increased following chemotherapy. However, when IVF and embryo cryopreservation is practised between or shortly after treatment, possible genetic risks to the growing oocytes exist, and hence the babies should be screened. During pregnancy, the potential teratogenic effects of chemotherapy influence the choice and timing of therapy. Termination is usually recommended in the first trimester. Second- and third-trimester exposure does not usually increase the teratogenic risk and cognitive development, but it may increase the risk of poor obstetric outcome and fetal myelosuppression. During the first two weeks after fertilization of the embryo, radiation is lethal but not teratogenic. High doses of radiation during pregnancy induce anomalies, impaired growth and mental retardation, and there may be an increased risk of childhood leukaemia and other tumours in the offspring.","['Arnon, J', 'Meirow, D', 'Lewis-Roness, H', 'Ornoy, A']","['Arnon J', 'Meirow D', 'Lewis-Roness H', 'Ornoy A']","['Israel Ministry of Health and Laboratory of Teratology, Hebrew University Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hum Reprod Update,Human reproduction update,9507614,IM,"['Abnormalities, Drug-Induced/etiology/genetics', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Embryonic and Fetal Development/*drug effects/genetics/*radiation effects', 'Female', 'Fetus/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Germ Cells/*drug effects/physiology/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology/genetics', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Rats']",2001/07/31 10:00,2002/01/16 10:01,['2001/07/31 10:00'],"['2001/07/31 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/16 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/31 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/humupd/7.4.394 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Reprod Update. 2001 Jul-Aug;7(4):394-403. doi: 10.1093/humupd/7.4.394.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],110,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Preliminary clinical results of radioimmunotherapy of medullary thyroid carcinomas and lung cancers look promising. Very encouraging results in biodistribution and radioimmunotherapy experiments in animals have been obtained with new haptens bearing two histamine-hemisuccinate suitable for 131I, 99mTc and 188Re labeling. Targeting isotopes to double antigen positive tumor cells provides a binding enhancement that increases specificity for tumor cells as compared to single antigen targeting on normal cells.

Thiol-dependent proteases (Calpaine), kinases (e.g. c-JUN NH2-terminal kinase), caspases and nucleases are involved in beta-lap cytotoxicity. These enzymes activity, as well as ROS production by beta-lap redox-cycling, would be essential for beta-lap cytotoxicity.

We tested the safety and efficacy of an immunotoxin directed against a surface antigen that is strongly expressed by leukemic hairy cells. METHODS: RFB4(dsFv)-PE38 (BL22), a recombinant immunotoxin containing an anti-CD22 variable domain (Fv) fused to truncated pseudomonas exotoxin, was administered in a dose-escalation trial by intravenous infusion every other day for a total of three doses. RESULTS: Of 16 patients who were resistant to cladribine, 11 had a complete remission and 2 had a partial remission with BL22. The three patients who did not have a response received low doses of BL22 or had preexisting toxin-neutralizing antibodies. Of the 11 patients in complete remission, 2 had minimal residual disease in the bone marrow or blood. During a median follow-up of 16 months (range, 10 to 23), 3 of the 11 patients who had a complete response relapsed and were retreated; all of these patients had a second complete remission. In 2 of the 16 patients, a serious but completely reversible hemolytic-uremic syndrome developed during the second cycle of treatment with BL22.

Such composite lymphomas represent interesting models to study the pathogenesis of B-cell lymphomas and the relationship between HD and B-cell NHL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed two composite lymphomas (a combination of classical HD with follicular lymphoma [FL] and a combination of classical HD with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia [B-CLL]) by micromanipulation of single cells from tissue sections and amplification of immunoglobulin V region genes for the clonal relationship of the tumor cells. RESULTS: In both cases, clonally related variable (V) genes with both shared as well as distinct somatic mutations were obtained from the two lymphomas, showing that in each of the cases the distinct tumor cells were members of a common germinal center (GC) B-cell clone. FL cells from two different lymph nodes of patient 1 showed a similar mutation pattern, suggesting that infiltration of these lymph nodes by tumor cells was not restricted to a particular FL cell or subclone. In the FL, a single cell was identified with a mutation signature indicating that premalignant cells can persist in the tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The cases presented here further underline the close relationship between HD and B-cell NHL and the role of the GC in lymphomagenesis. Whereas the latter was already suggested for FL and HD, the present study indicates that also in the B-CLL subset characterized by mutated Ig genes, important steps in malignant transformation happen in the GC, and that HRS cells can derive from CD5-positive B cells.","['Kuppers, R', 'Sousa, A B', 'Baur, A S', 'Strickler, J G', 'Rajewsky, K', 'Hansmann, M L']","['Kuppers R', 'Sousa AB', 'Baur AS', 'Strickler JG', 'Rajewsky K', 'Hansmann ML']","['Institute for Genetics, University of Cologne, Germany. rkuppers@mac.genetik.uni-koeln.de']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Cell Lineage', 'Clone Cells', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/genetics', 'Germinal Center/immunology/*pathology', 'Hodgkin Disease/genetics/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Follicular/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reed-Sternberg Cells/immunology/pathology']",2001/07/28 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/28 10:00'],"['2001/07/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Med. 2001 May;7(5):285-92.,['0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)'],,,,,,,,PMC1950043,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Disease Free Survival for the all protocol is 78% +/- 3 and overall survival 83% +/- 3. Various clinical and laboratory features at the time of diagnosis have been correlated with prognosis. They provide a potential mean to stratify patients into treatment subgroups according their relative risk of treatment failure. The identification of these prognostic factors has been an essential element in the design of current therapeutic trials. Prognostic characteristics of childhood ALL include: age, white blood cell count, tumor burden, cytogenetics (chromosome count and chromosomal translocation), immunophenotype and early response to treatment. Molecular biology has been the revolution of the last two decades permitting the cloning of the genes involved in the leukemic process. Finally the new molecular techniques allow a sensitive diagnostic approach to minimal residual disease (MRD). The better detection of MRD must allow a more rational basis for therapeutic intensification for a subset of poor responder patients. A decrease in therapy of very good responders can also be envisaged.","['Schaison, G', 'Auclerc, M F', 'Baruchel, A', 'Leblanc, T', 'Leverger, G']","['Schaison G', 'Auclerc MF', 'Baruchel A', 'Leblanc T', 'Leverger G']","['Service de Pediatrie a Orientation Hematologique-Hopital Saint-Louis, 1 avenue Claude Vellefaux-75475 Paris.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Bull Acad Natl Med,Bulletin de l'Academie nationale de medecine,7503383,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Protocols', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'France', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/genetics/*mortality', 'Prognosis']",2001/07/28 10:00,2002/01/05 10:01,['2001/07/28 10:00'],"['2001/07/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/01/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/28 10:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bull Acad Natl Med. 2001;185(1):149-60; discussion 160-2.,,33,,,,Le pronostic des leucemies aigues lymphoblastiques (LAL) de l'enfant.

The problems encountered and the strategies that have been used to improve the outlook in older adults with AML are presented. The two main strategies for improving outcomes in older adults with AML are to develop effective chemotherapeutic regimens with improved tolerability, and to reduce drug resistance. In studies to identify optimal chemotherapeutic regimens in older adults, a satisfactory balance between efficacy and toxicity has not yet been achieved. Also, the use of growth factors to promote hematopoietic recovery has yet to yield consistent reductions in treatment-related morbidity or mortality. Drug resistance can be modified by inhibiting drug efflux mechanisms or by increasing sensitivity to cytotoxic agents, but these strategies have not yet been shown to significantly affect outcomes. Novel approaches including antibody-targeted and molecular-targeted chemotherapy may have the potential to improve the prognosis for older adults with AML.","['Lowenberg, B']",['Lowenberg B'],"['Department of Hematology, Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Hematol,Seminars in hematology,0404514,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Aging', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",2001/07/28 10:00,2001/09/28 10:01,['2001/07/28 10:00'],"['2001/07/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['ashem0380010s6 [pii]', '10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90151-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Semin Hematol. 2001 Jul;38(3 Suppl 6):10-6. doi: 10.1016/s0037-1963(01)90151-9.,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],30,,,['Copyright 2001 by W.B.

These 1-phenylpropenone derivatives induce cell cycle arrest at the G2 / M phase of the cell cycle. TK5048 inhibited tubulin polymerization in human lung cancer PC-14 cells in a concentration-dependent manner. In a polymerization assay using bovine brain tubulin, AM-132 and AM-138 were quite strong, AM-97 was moderately strong, and TK5048 was a relatively weak inhibitor of tubulin polymerization. A murine leukemia cell line resistant to a sulfonamide antimitotic agent, E7010, which binds to colchicine-binding sites on tubulin, was cross-resistant to the in vitro growth-inhibitory effect of AM compounds. Inhibition of tubulin polymerization is therefore one of the mechanisms of action of these AM compounds against tumor cells. To profile the antitumor effect of AM compounds, the in vivo antitumor effect of AM-132 was evaluated against cytokine-secreting Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). Tumor-bearing mice were treated with intravenous AM-132 using three different treatment schedules. LLC tumors expressing tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or interleukin (IL)-6 were very sensitive to AM-132. In particular, LLC tumors expressing IL-6 were markedly reduced by AM-132 treatment, and showed coloring of the tumor surface and unusual hemorrhagic necrosis. These results suggest a combined effect of AM-132 and cytokines on the blood supply to tumors.","['Tatsumi, Y', 'Arioka, H', 'Ikeda, S', 'Fukumoto, H', 'Miyamoto, K', 'Fukuoka, K', 'Ohe, Y', 'Saijo, N', 'Nishio, K']","['Tatsumi Y', 'Arioka H', 'Ikeda S', 'Fukumoto H', 'Miyamoto K', 'Fukuoka K', 'Ohe Y', 'Saijo N', 'Nishio K']","['Pharmacology Division, National Cancer Center Research Institute, National Cancer Center Hospital, Chuo-ku, Tokyo 104-0045, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Small Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Indoles/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Propiophenones/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tubulin/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",2001/07/28 10:00,2001/10/05 10:01,['2001/07/28 10:00'],"['2001/07/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/05 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01160.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 2001 Jul;92(7):768-77. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb01160.x.,"['0 (AM132)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Propiophenones)', '0 (TK5048)', '0 (Tubulin)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",,,['Jpn J Cancer Res 2001 Dec;92(12):1355'],,,,,PMC5926787,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of the present study was to determine the cellular mechanisms that mediate the impairment of renal proximal tubular Na/Pi cotransport in a model of K deficiency in the rat. METHODS: K deficiency in the rat was achieved by feeding rats a K-deficient diet for seven days, which resulted in a marked decrease in serum and tissue K content. RESULTS: K deficiency resulted in a marked increase in urinary Pi excretion and a decrease in the V(max) of brush-border membrane (BBM) Na/Pi cotransport activity (1943 +/- 95 in control vs. 1184 +/- 99 pmol/5 sec/mg BBM protein in K deficiency, P < 0.02). Surprisingly, the decrease in Na/Pi cotransport activity was associated with increases in the abundance of type I (NaPi-1), and type II (NaPi-2) and type III (Glvr-1) Na/Pi protein. The decrease in Na/Pi transport was associated with significant alterations in BBM lipid composition, including increases in sphingomyelin, glucosylceramide, and ganglioside GM3 content and a decrease in BBM lipid fluidity. Inhibition of glucosylceramide synthesis resulted in increases in BBM Na/Pi cotransport activity in control and K-deficient rats. The resultant Na/Pi cotransport activity in K-deficient rats was the same as in control rats (1148 +/- 52 in control + PDMP vs. 1152 +/- 61 pmol/5 sec/mg BBM protein in K deficiency + PDMP). These changes in transport activity occurred independent of further changes in BBM NaPi-2 protein or renal cortical NaPi-2 mRNA abundance. CONCLUSION: K deficiency in the rat causes inhibition of renal Na/Pi cotransport activity by post-translational mechanisms that are mediated in part through alterations in glucosylceramide content and membrane lipid dynamics.","['Zajicek, H K', 'Wang, H', 'Puttaparthi, K', 'Halaihel, N', 'Markovich, D', 'Shayman, J', 'Beliveau, R', 'Wilson, P', 'Rogers, T', 'Levi, M']","['Zajicek HK', 'Wang H', 'Puttaparthi K', 'Halaihel N', 'Markovich D', 'Shayman J', 'Beliveau R', 'Wilson P', 'Rogers T', 'Levi M']","['Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and VA Medical Center, Dallas, Texas 75216, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/physiology', 'Glucosylceramides/*metabolism', 'Hypokalemia/metabolism', 'Kidney Tubules, Proximal/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Membrane Fluidity/*physiology', 'Microvilli/metabolism', 'Oocytes/metabolism', 'Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Phosphorus/urine', 'Potassium Deficiency/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, Virus/genetics/metabolism', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type I', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type II', 'Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III', '*Symporters', 'Xenopus laevis']",2001/07/28 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/07/28 10:00'],"['2001/07/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0085-2538(15)47914-1 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-1755.2001.060002694.x [doi]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 2001 Aug;60(2):694-704. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1755.2001.060002694.x.,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', '0 (Glucosylceramides)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '0 (Slc20a1 protein, rat)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type I)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type II)', '0 (Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type III)', '0 (Symporters)', '0 (leukemia virus receptor, gibbon ape)', '27YLU75U4W (Phosphorus)']",,['1 F32 DK09689-01/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The majority of patients with this disorder develop progressive glomerulosclerosis. One key event in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis is the infiltration of monocytes into affected glomeruli. Mesangial cells can synthesize and secrete monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), an important chemoattractant for monocytes. The objective of the present study was to examine the effect of Lp-X on MCP-1 expression in mesangial cells leading to an enhanced monocyte chemotaxis and to elucidate the mechanisms involved in this process. METHODS: Lp-X was isolated from the plasma of a patient with familial LCAT deficiency. After rat mesangial cells were incubated with Lp-X for four or six hours, the expression of MCP-1 mRNA was determined by nuclease protection assay, and MCP-1 protein was measured by Western immunoblotting analysis. Monocyte chemotaxis was determined by using a Micro Chemotaxis Chamber. RESULTS: Lp-X (50 to 100 nmol/mL) stimulated mesangial cell MCP-1 mRNA expression (137 to 220%) and MCP-1 protein levels (233 to 375%). Conditioned media collected from Lp-X-treated mesangial cells stimulated human acute monocytic leukemia (THP-1) monocyte chemotaxis (165 to 200%). The increase in MCP-1 expression in mesangial cells was associated with an elevation of intracellular diacylglycerol levels, and activation of protein kinase C (PKC) as well as nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Lp-X participates in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis and subsequent renal failure in familial LCAT deficient patients by stimulating monocyte infiltration via a mechanism involving mesangial MCP-1 expression.","['Lynn, E G', 'Siow, Y L', 'Frohlich, J', 'Cheung, G T', 'O, K']","['Lynn EG', 'Siow YL', 'Frohlich J', 'Cheung GT', 'O K']","['Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong SAR, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chemokine CCL2/*genetics/metabolism', 'Chemotaxis, Leukocyte/drug effects/immunology', 'Cholesterol/metabolism', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'Diltiazem/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Foam Cells/metabolism', 'Gene Expression/drug effects/immunology', 'Genes, Recessive', 'Glomerular Mesangium/cytology/*metabolism', 'Glomerulosclerosis, Focal Segmental/immunology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Indoles/pharmacology', 'Lecithin Cholesterol Acyltransferase Deficiency/genetics/immunology/*metabolism', 'Lipoprotein-X/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Monocytes/cytology', 'NF-kappa B/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Staurosporine/pharmacology', 'Type C Phospholipases/metabolism']",2001/07/28 10:00,2001/10/12 10:01,['2001/07/28 10:00'],"['2001/07/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/10/12 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/28 10:00 [entrez]']","['S0085-2538(15)47897-4 [pii]', '10.1046/j.1523-1755.2001.060002520.x [doi]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 2001 Aug;60(2):520-32. doi: 10.1046/j.1523-1755.2001.060002520.x.,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Chemokine CCL2)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Lipoprotein-X)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '151342-35-7 (Ro 32-0432)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EE92BBP03H (Diltiazem)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some markers (CD34, CD15, and CD117) are available for both techniques. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) analysis may be performed by enzyme cytochemical (EC) or IH techniques. OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability of these markers and MPO by these techniques, we designed a study to compare the results of analyses of these markers and MPO by FC (CD34, CD15, and CD117), EC (MPO), and IH (CD34, CD15, CD117, and MPO) techniques. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-nine AMLs formed the basis of the study. These AMLs all had been immunophenotyped previously by FC analysis; 27 also had had EC analysis performed. Of the AMLs, 29 had BM core biopsies and 26 had BM clots that could be evaluated. The paraffin blocks of the 29 BM core biopsies and 26 BM clots were stained for CD34, CD117, MPO, and CD15. These results were compared with results by FC analysis (CD34, CD15, and CD117) and EC analysis (MPO). RESULTS: Immunodetection of CD34 expression in AML had a similar sensitivity by FC and IH techniques. Immunodetection of CD15 and CD117 had a higher sensitivity by FC analysis than by IH analysis. Detection of MPO by IH analysis was more sensitive than by EC analysis. There was no correlation of French-American-British (FAB) subtype of AML with CD34 or CD117 expression. Expression of CD15 was associated with AMLs with a monocytic component. Myeloperoxidase reactivity by IH analysis was observed in AMLs originally FAB subtyped as M0. CONCLUSIONS: CD34 can be equally detected by FC and IH techniques. CD15 and CD117 are better detected by FC analysis and MPO is better detected by IH analysis.","['Dunphy, C H', 'Polski, J M', 'Evans, H L', 'Gardner, L J']","['Dunphy CH', 'Polski JM', 'Evans HL', 'Gardner LJ']","['Division of Hematopathology, Department of Pathology, St Louis University Health Sciences Center, St Louis, MO, USA. cdunphy@unch.unc.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Arch Pathol Lab Med,Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine,7607091,IM,"['Antigens, CD34/*analysis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/analysis', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology/*immunology/pathology', 'Lewis X Antigen/*analysis', 'Paraffin', 'Peroxidase/*analysis', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/*analysis', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Tissue Embedding']",2001/07/28 10:00,2001/08/24 10:01,['2001/07/28 10:00'],"['2001/07/28 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/08/24 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/28 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.5858/2001-125-1063-EOBMSW [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2001 Aug;125(8):1063-9. doi: 10.5858/2001-125-1063-EOBMSW.,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '8002-74-2 (Paraffin)', 'EC 1.11.1.7 (Peroxidase)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This clustering problem is difficult for several reasons, in particular the sparsity of the data, the high dimensionality of the feature (gene) space, and the fact that many features are irrelevant or redundant. Our algorithm iterates between two computational processes, feature filtering and clustering. Given a reference partition that approximates the correct clustering of the samples, our feature filtering procedure ranks the features according to their intrinsic discriminability, relevance to the reference partition, and irredundancy to other relevant features, and uses this ranking to select the features to be used in the following round of clustering. Our clustering algorithm, which is based on the concept of a normalized cut, clusters the samples into a new reference partition on the basis of the selected features. On a well-studied problem involving 72 leukemia samples and 7130 genes, we demonstrate that CLIFF outperforms standard clustering approaches that do not consider the feature selection issue, and produces a result that is very close to the original expert labeling of the sample set.","['Xing, E P', 'Karp, R M']","['Xing EP', 'Karp RM']","['Division of Computer Science, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA. epxing@cs.berkeley.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Markov Chains', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/*statistics & numerical data']",2001/07/27 10:00,2002/02/28 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.s306 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2001;17 Suppl 1:S306-15. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.s306.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These molecular patterns can be revealed routinely on a genomic scale. However, class prediction based on these patterns is an under-determined problem, due to the extreme high dimensionality of the data compared to the usually small number of available samples. This makes a reduction of the data dimensionality necessary. Here we demonstrate how phenotypic classes can be predicted by combining feature selection and discriminant analysis. By comparing several feature selection methods we show that the right dimension reduction strategy is of crucial importance for the classification performance. The techniques are demonstrated by methylation pattern based discrimination between acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia.","['Model, F', 'Adorjan, P', 'Olek, A', 'Piepenbrock, C']","['Model F', 'Adorjan P', 'Olek A', 'Piepenbrock C']","['Epigenomics AG, Kastanienallee 24, D-10435 Berlin, Germany.

Based on a collection of gene expression profiles from different tissue samples, the method searches for binary class distinctions in the set of samples that show clear separation in the expression levels of specific subsets of genes. Several mutually independent class distinctions may be found, which is difficult to obtain from most commonly used clustering algorithms. Each class distinction can be biologically interpreted in terms of its supporting genes. The mathematical characterization of the favored class distinctions is based on statistical concepts. By analyzing three data sets from cancer gene expression studies, we demonstrate that our method is able to detect biologically relevant structures, for example cancer subtypes, in an unsupervised fashion.","['von Heydebreck, A', 'Huber, W', 'Poustka, A', 'Vingron, M']","['von Heydebreck A', 'Huber W', 'Poustka A', 'Vingron M']","['Division of Computational Molecular Biology, Max-Planck-Institute for Molecular Genetics, Ihnestr. 73, D-14195 Berlin, Germany. heydebre@molgen.mpg.de']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bioinformatics,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",9808944,IM,"['*Algorithms', 'Computational Biology', 'Databases, Factual', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Melanoma/genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis/statistics & numerical data', 'Oncogenes']",2001/07/27 10:00,2002/02/28 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.s107 [doi]'],ppublish,Bioinformatics. 2001;17 Suppl 1:S107-14. doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/17.suppl_1.s107.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model predictions suggest that the strategy of normal cell stimulation, possibly with growth factors, and possibly carried out within an intensive treatment framework may be a worthwhile chemotherapeutic option. Under this protocol, the model also predicts a minimum time interval for active treatment, a time to discontinue treatment, and a rest period during treatment in order to guarantee patient safety and recovery. Consequently, by relating and comparing model predictions to patient data, model simulations forecast that treatment could be shortened by 1-2 weeks if organized over or in the neighborhood of a predicted optimal time interval. Following this, it is conjectured that such an approach engendered by the model could produce outcomes that may have an edge over outcomes arising from therapeutic strategies that are executed over time frames that are relatively longer or significantly shorter than the predicted optimal time.","['Afenya, E K']",['Afenya EK'],"['Department of Mathematics, Elmhurst College, 190 Prospect Avenue, 60126-3296, Elmhurst, IL, USA. evansa@elmhurst.edu']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Math Biosci,Mathematical biosciences,0103146,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Computer Simulation', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Recombinant Proteins/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",2001/07/27 10:00,2001/09/08 10:01,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2001/09/08 10:01 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']","['S002555640100061X [pii]', '10.1016/s0025-5564(01)00061-x [doi]']",ppublish,Math Biosci. 2001 Jul;172(1):15-32. doi: 10.1016/s0025-5564(01)00061-x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bloom syndrome cells have a distinctive high frequency of sister chromatid exchange and quadriradial formation. BLM, the protein altered in BS, is a member of the RecQ DNA helicase family, whose members share an average of 40% identity in the helicase domain and have divergent N-terminal and C-terminal flanking regions of variable lengths. The BLM DNA helicase has been shown to localize to the ND10 (nuclear domain 10) or PML (promyelocytic leukemia) nuclear bodies, where it associates with TOPIIIalpha, and to the nucleolus. RESULTS: This report demonstrates that the N-terminal domain of BLM is responsible for localization of the protein to the nuclear bodies, while the C-terminal domain directs the protein to the nucleolus. Deletions of the N-terminal domain of BLM have little effect on sister chromatid exchange frequency and chromosome stability as compared to helicase and C-terminal mutations which can increase SCE frequency and chromosome abnormalities. CONCLUSION: The helicase activity and the C-terminal domain of BLM are critical for maintaining genomic stability as measured by the sister chromatid exchange assay. The localization of BLM into the nucleolus by the C-terminal domain appears to be more important to genomic stability than localization in the nuclear bodies.","['Yankiwski, V', 'Noonan, J P', 'Neff, N F']","['Yankiwski V', 'Noonan JP', 'Neff NF']","['Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, New York Blood Center, 310 East 67th Street, New York, NY 10021, USA. nneff@nybc.org']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMC Cell Biol,BMC cell biology,100966972,IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphatases/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'Alleles', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Cell Nucleolus/enzymology', 'Cell Nucleus/enzymology', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'DNA Helicases/*chemistry/genetics/*physiology', 'DNA Repair', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Doxycycline/pharmacology', 'Genome', 'Green Fluorescent Proteins', 'Humans', 'Luminescent Proteins/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'RecQ Helicases', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Sister Chromatid Exchange', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection']",2001/07/27 10:00,2002/11/26 04:00,['2001/07/27 10:00'],"['2001/05/15 00:00 [received]', '2001/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [pubmed]', '2002/11/26 04:00 [medline]', '2001/07/27 10:00 [entrez]']",['10.1186/1471-2121-2-11 [doi]'],ppublish,BMC Cell Biol. 2001;2:11. doi: 10.1186/1471-2121-2-11.
