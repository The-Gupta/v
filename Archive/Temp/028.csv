Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to measure the serum miR-203 levels in 134 patients with AML and 70 healthy controls. The results demonstrated that serum miR-203 expression was significantly reduced in AML patients compared with healthy controls. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis revealed miR-203 could distinguish AML cases from normal controls. Low serum miR-203 levels were associated with worse clinical features, as well as poorer overall survival and relapse free survival of AML patients. Moreover, multivariate analysis confirmed low serum miR-203 expression to be an independent unfavorable prognostic predictor for AML. The bioinformatics analysis showed that the downstream genes and pathways of miR-203 was closely associated with tumorigenesis. Downregulation of miR-203 in AML cell lines upregulated the expression levels of oncogenic promoters such as CREB1, SRC and HDAC1. Thus, these findings demonstrated that serum miR-203 might be a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of AML.","['Guo, Yingmeng']",['Guo Y'],['ORCID: 0000-0002-7312-3664'],"['a Department of Pediatric medicine, Linyi Central Hospital , Yishui , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",United States,Bioengineered,Bioengineered,101581063,"['0 (Antagomirs)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CREB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein)', '0 (MIRN203 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (src-Family Kinases)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",IM,['Bioengineered. 2020 Dec;11(1):1.

BACKGROUND: Leukemia is the most common hematological malignancy and is associated with an increased risk of thrombotic and bleeding complications in patients undergoing PCI. There are limited data around clinical outcomes of leukemia patients undergoing PCI. METHODS: We used the National Inpatient Sample to investigate the outcomes of leukemia patients undergoing PCI between 2004 and 2014. Patients were then subdivided into diagnoses of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or chronic myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoid leukemia or chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL). Multiple logistic regressions were used to study the association of a leukemia diagnosis with in-hospital outcomes: mortality, bleeding, vascular and cardiac complications, and stroke. RESULTS: There were 6,561,445 records of patients who underwent PCI during the study time, of which 15,789 patients had a diagnosis of leukemia. The most common leukemia subtype was CLL accounting for 75% of the cohort (n = 10,800). After multivariable adjustment, a leukemia diagnosis was associated with significantly increased odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.11-1.79]) and bleeding (OR: 1.87; 95% CI: [1.56-2.09]), whereas patients with AML had a fivefold increase of in-hospital mortality (OR: 5.38; 95% CI: [2.94-9.76]). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with current diagnosis of leukemia are at increased risk of procedure-related complications following PCI. A multidisciplinary approach is needed among interventional cardiologists, oncologists, and hematologists to minimize procedural complications and improve outcomes in this high-risk cohort.","['Potts, Jessica', 'Mohamed, Mohamed O', 'Lopez Mattei, Juan C', 'Iliescu, Cezar A', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Rashid, Muhammad', 'Bagur, Rodrigo', 'Mamas, Mamas A']","['Potts J', 'Mohamed MO', 'Lopez Mattei JC', 'Iliescu CA', 'Konopleva M', 'Rashid M', 'Bagur R', 'Mamas MA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9678-5222', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8817-4579', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9725-1583', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1888-9429']","['Keele Cardiovascular Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Keele Cardiovascular Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Department of Cardiology, Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent, UK.', 'Department of Cardiology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Cardiology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Leukemia, MD Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, Houston, Texas.', 'Keele Cardiovascular Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Keele Cardiovascular Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Cardiology, London Health Sciences Centre, London, Ontario, Canada.', 'Keele Cardiovascular Group, Centre for Prognosis Research, Institute for Primary Care and Health Sciences, Keele University, Keele, UK.', 'Department of Cardiology, Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent, UK.', 'Institute of Population Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Catheter Cardiovasc Interv,Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,100884139,,IM,,"['Acute Coronary Syndrome/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*therapy', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary/adverse effects/instrumentation/mortality', 'Coronary Artery Disease/diagnostic imaging/mortality/*therapy', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Hemorrhage/mortality', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Inpatients', '*Leukemia/diagnosis/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Stents', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*clinical outcomes', '*leukemia', '*mortality', '*percutaneous coronary intervention']",2019/08/15 06:00,2021/02/09 06:00,['2019/08/15 06:00'],"['2019/01/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/02/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ccd.28432 [doi]'],ppublish,Catheter Cardiovasc Interv. 2020 Jul;96(1):53-63. doi: 10.1002/ccd.28432.

Defect in an intrinsic pathway of apoptosis via overexpression of Mcl-1 is responsible for malignant melanoma development and progression, and also for resistance to chemotherapeutic agents. MIM1 is a specific low molecular Mcl-1 protein inhibitor that is able to induce Mcl-1-dependent cancer cells death. Here, we examined the effect of MIM1 as well as MIM1 and dacarbazine (DTIC) mixture on cell viability, apoptosis, and cell cycle progression in COLO829 melanoma cells. Cell viability was performed by the WST-1 assay. Analysis of apoptosis as well as cell cycle progression was determined by fluorescence image cytometer NucleoCounter NC-3000. The obtained results demonstrated that the MIM1 exhibited high cytotoxicity against melanotic melanoma cells and induced mitochondrial membrane breakdown, GSH depletion, and DNA fragmentation. Additionally, MIM1 enhanced the proapoptotic effect of DTIC toward melanoma cells; furthermore, a mixture of these drugs caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase in COLO829 cells. Taken together, these data provide, for the first time, evidence that a low molecular weight Mcl-1 inhibitor-MIM1 may be a promising agent with antitumor and proapoptotic properties toward melanoma cells.","['Respondek, Michalina', 'Beberok, Artur', 'Rzepka, Zuzanna', 'Rok, Jakub', 'Wrzesniok, Dorota']","['Respondek M', 'Beberok A', 'Rzepka Z', 'Rok J', 'Wrzesniok D']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0844-9155'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Silesia, Jagiellonska, 441-200, Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Silesia, Jagiellonska, 441-200, Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Silesia, Jagiellonska, 441-200, Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Silesia, Jagiellonska, 441-200, Sosnowiec, Poland.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, School of Pharmacy with the Division of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Silesia, Jagiellonska, 441-200, Sosnowiec, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Fundam Clin Pharmacol,Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,8710411,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Death/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage/drug effects', 'DNA Fragmentation/drug effects', 'Dacarbazine/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Glutathione/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Melanoma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mitochondrial Membranes/drug effects/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Skin Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['BH3 mimetic', 'MIM1', 'Mcl-1 protein', 'apoptosis', 'dacarbazine', 'malignant melanoma']",2019/08/15 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2019/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/11/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/fcp.12503 [doi]'],ppublish,Fundam Clin Pharmacol. 2020 Feb;34(1):20-31. doi: 10.1111/fcp.12503.

Many first generations of TRAIL agonists including recombinant preparations of TRAIL, agonistic antibodies against DR4/DR5 have been developed in phase I/II clinical trials for cancer therapy. However, the outcomes of clinical trials by using DR4/DR5 agonist mono-therapy were disappointed even though the safety profile was well tolerance. In the present study, we report an anti-DR5 antibody-drug conjugate (ADC, named as Zapadcine-1) possesses a higher potential for the therapy of lymphocyte leukemia and solid cancers. Methods: Zapadcine-1 was made by a fully humanized DR5-specific monoclonal antibody (Zaptuzumab) coupled via a cleavable linker to a highly toxic inhibitor of tubulin, monomethyl auristatin D (MMAD), by using ThioBridge technology. Cytotoxicity of the ADC in various tumor cells was identified by luminescent cell viability assay and the efficacy in vivo was determined in cells derived xenografts (CDX) of Jurkat E6-1, BALL-1, Reh, and patient derived xenografts (PDX) of human acute leukemia. Preliminary safety evaluation was carried out in rat and monkey. Results: Zapadcine-1 possesses a similar binding ability to the death receptor DR5 as the naked monoclonal antibody Zaptuzumab, and can be rapidly endocytosed into the lysosome of cancer cells. Zapadcine-1 specifically kills human lymphocyte leukemia cells and solid tumor cells, but not normal cells tested. More importantly, Zapadcine-1 drastically eliminates the xenografts in both CDX and PDX models of human acute leukemia.

The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of single injected Zapadcine-1 in rat and cynomolgus monkey shows an acceptable safety profile.

Thus, we performed a collaborative study between Eurocord/ALWP-EBMT and JSHCT/JDCHCT. Adults with acute leukaemia who underwent a single UCBT were eligible. In total, 3764 and 1027 patients of the JSHCT/JDCHCT and Eurocord/ALWP-EBMT registries, respectively, were included. The median ages of the Japanese and European cohorts were 51 and 38 years, respectively. Three or more HLA mismatches were more frequently observed in the Japanese cohort. The median total nucleated cell (TNC) counts were 2.58 and 3.51 x 10(7)/kg in the Japanese and European cohorts, respectively. Anti-thymocyte globulin was used in only 2% of the Japanese cohort compared with 65% of the European cohort. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 41% in JSHCT/JDCHCT and 33% in Eurocord/ALWP-EBMT. In the multivariate analysis, TNC dose and HLA matching had no significant effect on OS in either cohort, whereas year of transplantation, age, and refined disease risk index affected OS in both cohorts. Despite considerable differences in characteristics between the Japanese and European cohorts, we observed similar prognostic factors affecting UCBT outcomes in adult patients with acute leukaemia in both registries.","['Kanda, Junya', 'Hayashi, Hiromi', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Kimura, Fumihiko', 'Volt, Fernanda', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Kako, Shinichi', 'Tozatto-Maio, Karina',

Although somatic mutations in core spliceosome components and their associated factors have been described in some cases, almost nothing is known about the contribution of distorted epigenetic patterns to aberrant splicing. Herein, we show that the splicing RNA-binding protein CELF2 is targeted by promoter hypermethylation-associated transcriptional silencing in human cancer. Focusing on the context of breast cancer, we also demonstrate that CELF2 restoration has growth-inhibitory effects and that its epigenetic loss induces an aberrant downstream pattern of alternative splicing, affecting key genes in breast cancer biology such as the autophagy factor ULK1 and the apoptotic protein CARD10. Furthermore, the presence of CELF2 hypermethylation in the clinical setting is associated with shorter overall survival of the breast cancer patients carrying this epigenetic lesion.","['Pique, Laia', 'Martinez de Paz, Alexia', 'Pineyro, David', 'Martinez-Cardus, Anna', 'Castro de Moura, Manuel', 'Llinas-Arias, Pere', 'Setien, Fernando', 'Gomez-Miragaya, Jorge', 'Gonzalez-Suarez, Eva', 'Sigurdsson, Stefan', 'Jonasson, Jon G', 'Villanueva, Alberto', 'Vidal, August', 'Davalos, Veronica', 'Esteller, Manel']","['Pique L', 'Martinez de Paz A', 'Pineyro D', 'Martinez-Cardus A', 'Castro de Moura M', 'Llinas-Arias P', 'Setien F', 'Gomez-Miragaya J', 'Gonzalez-Suarez E', 'Sigurdsson S', 'Jonasson JG', 'Villanueva A', 'Vidal A', 'Davalos V', 'Esteller M']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3937-8794', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1801-4681', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5284-0058', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5164-0006']","[""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Biomedical Center, Vatnsmyrarvegur 16, 101, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Iceland, Sturlugata 8, 101, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Department of Pathology, Landspitali University Hospital, Reykjavik, Iceland.', ""Translational Research Laboratory, IDIBELL-Institut Catala d'Oncologia, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", 'Department of Pathology, Bellvitge University Hospital, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.', ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."", ""Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), L'Hospitalet, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@carrerasresearch.org."", 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red Cancer (CIBERONC), 28029, Madrid, Spain. mesteller@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Physiological Sciences Department, School of Medicine and Health Sciences, University of Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@carrerasresearch.org.', 'Josep Carreras Leukaemia Research Institute (IJC), Badalona, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. mesteller@carrerasresearch.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (CELF Proteins)', '0 (CELF2 protein, human)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)']",IM,,"['Breast Neoplasms/*genetics/*pathology', 'CELF Proteins/*genetics', '*DNA Methylation', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/*genetics', '*RNA Splicing', 'Spliceosomes/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,2019/08/15 06:00,2020/03/03 06:00,['2019/08/15 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41388-019-0936-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41388-019-0936-x [pii]']",ppublish,Oncogene. 2019 Nov;38(45):7106-7112. doi: 10.1038/s41388-019-0936-x.

We systematically compared the variant allele frequencies of recurrently mutated genes in DNA and RNA sequencing data of 246 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. We observed that 95% of all detected variants were transcribed while the rest were not detectable in RNA sequencing with a minimum read-depth cut-off (10x). Our analysis focusing on 11 genes harbouring recurring mutations demonstrated allelic imbalance (AI) in most patients. GATA2, RUNX1, TET2, SRSF2, IDH2, PTPN11, WT1, NPM1 and CEBPA showed significant AIs. While the effect size was small in general, GATA2 exhibited the largest allelic imbalance. By pooling heterogeneous data from three independent AML cohorts with paired DNA and RNA sequencing (N = 253), we could validate the preferential transcription of GATA2-mutated alleles. Differential expression analysis of the genes with significant AI showed no significant differential gene and isoform expression for the mutated genes, between mutated and wild-type patients. In conclusion, our analyses identified AI in nine out of eleven recurrently mutated genes. AI might be a common phenomenon in AML which potentially contributes to leukaemogenesis.","['Batcha, Aarif M N', 'Bamopoulos, Stefanos A', 'Kerbs, Paul', 'Kumar, Ashwini', 'Jurinovic, Vindi',

Although many recent studies have demonstrated correlations between mitochondrial function and genetic makeup or originating tissue, it remains unclear why some cancers are more susceptible to mitocans (anticancer drugs that target mitochondrial function to mediate part or all of their effect). Moreover, fundamental questions of efficacy and mechanism of action in various tumor types stubbornly remain. Here we demonstrate that cancer type is a significant predictor of tumor response to mitocan treatment, and that acute myeloid leukemias (AML) show an increased sensitivity to these drugs. We determined that AML cells display particular defects in mitochondrial metabolism that underlie their sensitivity to mitocan treatment. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combinatorial treatment with a mitocan (CCCP) and a glycolytic inhibitor (2-deoxyglucose) has substantial synergy in AML cells, including primary cells from patients with AML. Our results show that mitocans, either alone or in combination with a glycolytic inhibitor, display anti-leukemia effects in doses much lower than needed to induce toxicity against normal blood cells, indicating that mitochondria may be an effective and selective therapeutic target.","['Panina, Svetlana B', 'Baran, Natalia', 'Brasil da Costa, Fabio H', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Kirienko, Natalia V']","['Panina SB', 'Baran N', 'Brasil da Costa FH', 'Konopleva M', 'Kirienko NV']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0618-4798', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1537-4967']","['Department of BioSciences, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of BioSciences, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Diagnostics and Biomedical Sciences, The University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of BioSciences, Rice University, Houston, TX, USA. kirienko@rice.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Mitochondrial)', '0 (Protons)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA, Mitochondrial/genetics', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Oxygen Consumption/drug effects', 'Protons']",PMC6692368,,,2019/08/15 06:00,2020/07/31 06:00,['2019/08/15 06:00'],"['2019/04/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-1851-3 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-1851-3 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Aug 13;10(8):617. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1851-3.,,20190813,,['R35 GM129294/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Time-course studies revealed Wnt5a could induce activation of NF-kappaB within 30 minutes, but required more than 3 hours to induce pSTAT3. Culture of isolated CLL cells for 24 hours revealed Wnt5a-induced expression of interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL1, which in turn could induce pSTAT3 in unstimulated CLL cells within 30 minutes. We found that Wnt5a could induce CLL cell expression of NF-kappaB target genes, including IL-6, and that this effect could be blocked by cirmtuzumab or drugs that inhibit NF-kappaB. Examination of CLL cells and plasma collected from patients treated with cirmtuzumab revealed reduced levels of phosphorylated p65 and diminished expression of NF-kappaB and STAT3 target genes in CLL cells, as well as lower plasma levels of IL-6, in the samples after therapy. Collectively, these studies indicate that Wnt5a/ROR1-dependent signaling contributes to CLL cell activation of NF-kappaB, which in turn causes autocrine IL-6-induced activation of pSTAT3. As such, this study demonstrates that cirmtuzumab can inhibit leukemia cell activation of both NF-kappaB and STAT3 in patients with CLL.","['Chen, Yun', 'Chen, Liguang', 'Yu, Jian', 'Ghia, Emanuela M', 'Choi, Michael Y', 'Zhang, Ling', 'Zhang, Suping', 'Sanchez-Lopez, Elsa', 'Widhopf, George F 2nd', 'Messer, Karen', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Jamieson, Catriona', 'Kipps, Thomas J']","['Chen Y', 'Chen L', 'Yu J', 'Ghia EM', 'Choi MY', 'Zhang L', 'Zhang S', 'Sanchez-Lopez E', 'Widhopf GF 2nd', 'Messer K', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Jamieson C', 'Kipps TJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0564-895X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4236-1985', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0064-4549']","['Moores Cancer Center, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Edmond H.

We aimed to characterise oesophageal cancer-specific and subtypes-specific gene regulation patterns and their upstream transcription factors (TFs). DESIGN: To identify regulatory elements, we profiled fresh-frozen oesophageal normal samples, tumours and cell lines with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Mathematical modelling was performed to establish (super)-enhancers landscapes and interconnected transcriptional circuitry formed by master TFs. Coregulation and cooperation between master TFs were investigated by ChIP-Seq, circularised chromosome conformation capture sequencing and luciferase assay. Biological functions of candidate factors were evaluated both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: We found widespread and pervasive alterations of the (super)-enhancer reservoir in both subtypes of oesophageal cancer, leading to transcriptional activation of a myriad of novel oncogenes and signalling pathways, some of which may be exploited pharmacologically (eg, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) pathway). Focusing on EAC, we bioinformatically reconstructed and functionally validated an interconnected circuitry formed by four master TFs-ELF3, KLF5, GATA6 and EHF-which promoted each other's expression by interacting with each super-enhancer. Downstream, these master TFs occupied almost all EAC super-enhancers and cooperatively orchestrated EAC transcriptome. Each TF within the transcriptional circuitry was highly and specifically expressed in EAC and functionally promoted EAC cell proliferation and survival. CONCLUSIONS: By establishing cancer-specific and subtype-specific features of the EAC epigenome, our findings promise to transform understanding of the transcriptional dysregulation and addiction of EAC, while providing molecular clues to develop novel therapeutic modalities against this malignancy.","['Chen, Li', 'Huang, Moli', 'Plummer, Jasmine', 'Pan, Jian', 'Jiang, Yan Yi', 'Yang, Qian',

RESULTS: In Guangdong Province, an indigenous chicken flock was infected with neoplastic disease. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the tissues showed the typical characteristics of MDV and classical ALV infection. The PCR and sequencing data demonstrated that the identified MDV was clustered into a very virulent MDV strain endemic in domestic chickens in China. Moreover, subgroups ALV-A and ALV-K were efficiently recovered from two samples. The full genome sequence revealed that the ALV-K isolate was phylogenetically close to the ALV TW3593 isolate from Taiwan Province. CONCLUSIONS: A co-infection of vvMDV with multiple ALV subgroups emerged in a chicken flock with neoplastic disease in Guangdong Province. The co-infection with different subgroups of ALV with vvMDV in one chicken flock poses the risk for the emergence of novel ALVs and heavily burdens the control strategy for MDV.","['Li, Tuofan', 'Xie,

This study describes treatment patterns by region and assesses time to achieve MR4.5 in patients with CML - chronic phase (CP) treated with second-line nilotinib or dasatinib in 10 countries. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was used to assess time to MR4.5 for nilotinib versus dasatinib. The model accounted for the competing-risk event of TKI resistance, included random effects for country clustering, and was adjusted for baseline covariates. The study included 280 patients treated with either nilotinib (N = 135 [48%]) or dasatinib (N = 145 [52%]) as second-line TKI with median treatment durations of 19.1 and 18.7 months, respectively. Nilotinib was observed to be better in achieving MR4.5 than dasatinib (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.37, 95% CI [1.11, 1.69]) suggesting second-line nilotinib may perform better in achieving MR4.5 than dasatinib.","['Cortes, Jorge', 'Huynh, Lynn', 'Mendelson, Estella', 'Brandt, Patricia', 'Dalal, Darshan', 'DerSarkissian, Maral', 'Cortina, Diego', 'Narkhede, Sahil', 'Sheng Duh, Mei']","['Cortes J', 'Huynh L', 'Mendelson E', 'Brandt P', 'Dalal D', 'DerSarkissian M', 'Cortina D', 'Narkhede S', 'Sheng Duh M']",,"['The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA.', 'Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, MA, USA.', 'Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, East Hanover, NJ, USA.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Analysis Group, Inc., Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,,"['*Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Dasatinib/therapeutic use', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/therapeutic use', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*deep molecular response', '*nilotinib', '*targeted therapies', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2019/08/15 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/15 06:00'],"['2019/08/15 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1644332 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2020 Jan;61(1):98-107. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1644332.

Here, we described the synthesis of several novel 3-substituted and 3,6-disubstituted-2-carboalkoxy indoles followed by the elucidation of their mechanism of action and in vivo anti-leukemia efficacy. The synthesis of 3-substituted-2-carboalkoxy indoles relied on two Heck arylations of methyl acrylate and methyl cinnamates respectively, to generate beta,beta-disubstituted acrylates followed by an efficient Cadogan-Sundberg reaction of these latter intermediates. The method developed led to the synthesis of twenty-one novel functionalized indoles. Of these, indole 20 showed selective cytotoxicity against leukemia cells at the nanomolar scale, and, therefore, it was selected for the investigation of its mechanism of action. Indole 20 was found to target tubulin leading to G2/M cell cycle arrest, DNA damage and apoptosis. Indole 20 decreased beta-tubulin protein in leukemia cells in a time-dependent manner and induced depolymerization of the microtubule network in Hela cells, thus fully characterizing its microtubule destabilizer activity. The connectivity map analysis of HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells treated with indole 20 revealed a transcriptional profile similar to that of cells treated with prostaglandins, apparently due to the induction of cellular differentiation as addressed by the expression of CD11 and CD14 markers. Finally, indole 20 given intraperitoneally, at 10mg/kg, 5x/week significantly prolonged the overall survival of NOD/SCID mice transplanted with RS4; 11B-ALL cells.","['Cury, Nathalia Moreno', 'Capitao, Rebeca Monique', 'Almeida, Renan do Canto Borges de', 'Artico, Leonardo Luis', 'Correa, Juliana Ronchi', 'Simao Dos Santos, Eric Francisco', 'Yunes, Jose Andres', 'Correia, Carlos Roque Duarte']","['Cury NM', 'Capitao RM', 'Almeida RDCB', 'Artico LL', 'Correa JR', 'Simao Dos Santos EF', 'Yunes JA', 'Correia CRD']",,"['Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, SP, 13083-210, Brazil; Graduate Program in Genetics and Molecular Biology, State University of Campinas, Campinas, SP, 13083-210, Brazil.', 'Institute of Chemistry, State University of Campinas, Campinas, SP, 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Institute of Chemistry, State University of Campinas, Campinas, SP, 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, SP, 13083-210, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, SP, 13083-210, Brazil.', 'Institute of Chemistry, State University of Campinas, Campinas, SP, 13083-970, Brazil.', 'Laboratorio de Biologia Molecular, Centro Infantil Boldrini, Campinas, SP, 13083-210, Brazil; Genetics Department, Faculty of Medical Sciences, State University of Campinas, Campinas, SP, 13083-887, Brazil.

Organ-invasion may occur in any stage, but is usually associated with advanced disease and a poor prognosis. Sometimes, extra-medullary organ invasion shows a metastasis-like or even sarcoma-like destructive growth of neoplastic cells in local tissue sites. Examples are myeloid sarcoma, mast cell sarcoma and localized blast phase of chronic myeloid leukemia. So far, little is known about mechanisms underlying re-distribution and extramedullary dissemination of LSC in myeloid neoplasms. In this article, we discuss mechanisms through which LSC can mobilize out of the bone marrow niche, can transmigrate from the blood stream into extramedullary organs, can invade local tissue sites and can potentially create or support the formation of local stem cell niches. In addition, we discuss strategies to interfere with LSC expansion and organ invasion by targeted drug therapies.","['Valent, Peter', 'Sadovnik, Irina', 'Eisenwort, Gregor', 'Herrmann, Harald', 'Bauer, Karin', 'Mueller, Niklas', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Wicklein, Daniel', 'Schumacher, Udo']","['Valent P', 'Sadovnik I', 'Eisenwort G', 'Herrmann H', 'Bauer K', 'Mueller N', 'Sperr WR', 'Wicklein D', 'Schumacher U']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria; Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology & Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Austria.

These observations have led to clinical efforts to directly inhibit the spliceosome in patients with refractory leukemias. Here, we identify that inhibiting symmetric or asymmetric dimethylation of arginine, mediated by PRMT5 and type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), respectively, reduces splicing fidelity and results in preferential killing of SF-mutant leukemias over wild-type counterparts. These data identify genetic subsets of cancer most likely to respond to PRMT inhibition, synergistic effects of combined PRMT5 and type I PRMT inhibition, and a mechanistic basis for the therapeutic efficacy of PRMT inhibition in cancer.","['Fong, Jia Yi', 'Pignata, Luca', 'Goy, Pierre-Alexis', 'Kawabata, Kimihito Cojin', 'Lee, Stanley Chun-Wei', 'Koh, Cheryl M', 'Musiani, Daniele', 'Massignani, Enrico', 'Kotini, Andriana G', 'Penson, Alex', 'Wun, Cheng Mun', 'Shen, Yudao', 'Schwarz, Megan', 'Low, Diana Hp', 'Rialdi, Alexander', 'Ki, Michelle', 'Wollmann, Heike', 'Mzoughi, Slim', 'Gay, Florence', 'Thompson, Christine', 'Hart, Timothy', 'Barbash, Olena', 'Luciani, Genna M', 'Szewczyk, Magdalena M', 'Wouters, Bas J', 'Delwel, Ruud', 'Papapetrou, Eirini P', 'Barsyte-Lovejoy, Dalia', 'Arrowsmith, Cheryl H', 'Minden, Mark D', 'Jin, Jian', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Bonaldi, Tiziana', 'Abdel-Wahab, Omar', 'Guccione, Ernesto']","['Fong JY', 'Pignata L', 'Goy PA', 'Kawabata KC', 'Lee SC', 'Koh CM', 'Musiani D', 'Massignani E', 'Kotini AG', 'Penson A', 'Wun CM', 'Shen Y', 'Schwarz M', 'Low DH', 'Rialdi A', 'Ki M', 'Wollmann H', 'Mzoughi S', 'Gay F', 'Thompson C', 'Hart T', 'Barbash O', 'Luciani GM', 'Szewczyk MM', 'Wouters BJ', 'Delwel R', 'Papapetrou EP', 'Barsyte-Lovejoy D', 'Arrowsmith CH', 'Minden MD', 'Jin J', 'Melnick A', 'Bonaldi T', 'Abdel-Wahab O', 'Guccione E']",,"['Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A( *)STAR), Singapore 138673, Singapore;

Its influence on patients with advanced/metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has been largely unexplored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study nested in Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance)/SWOG 80405 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00265850), a National Cancer Institute-sponsored phase III trial of systemic therapy for mCRC. Within 1 month after therapy initiation, patients were invited to complete a validated questionnaire that reported average physical activity over the previous 2 months. On the basis of responses, we calculated metabolic equivalent task (MET) hours per week to quantify physical activity. The primary end point of the clinical trial and this companion study was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and first grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events. To minimize confounding by poor and declining health, we excluded patients who experienced progression or died within 60 days of activity assessment and used Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to adjust for known prognostic factors, comorbidities, and weight loss. RESULTS: The final cohort included 1,218 patients. Compared with patients engaged in less than 3 MET hours per week of physical activity, patients engaged in 18 or more MET hours per week experienced an adjusted hazard ratio for OS of 0.85 (95% CI, 0.71 to 1.02; PTrend = .06) and for PFS of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99; PTrend = .01). Compared with patients engaging in less than 9 MET hours per week, patients engaging in 9 or more MET hours per week experienced an adjusted hazard ratio for grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events of 0.73 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.86; PTrend < .001). CONCLUSION: Among patients with mCRC in Cancer and Leukemia Group B (Alliance)/SWOG 80405, association of physical activity with OS was not statistically significant. Greater physical activity was associated with longer PFS and lower adjusted risk for first grade 3 or greater treatment-related adverse events.","['Guercio, Brendan J', 'Zhang, Sui', 'Ou, Fang-Shu', 'Venook, Alan P', 'Niedzwiecki, Donna', 'Lenz, Heinz-Josef', 'Innocenti, Federico', ""O'Neil, Bert H"", 'Shaw, James E', 'Polite, Blase N', 'Hochster, Howard S', 'Atkins, James N', 'Goldberg, Richard M', 'Sato, Kaori', 'Ng, Kimmie', 'Van Blarigan, Erin', 'Mayer, Robert J', 'Blanke, Charles D', ""O'Reilly, Eileen M"", 'Fuchs, Charles S', 'Meyerhardt, Jeffrey A']","['Guercio BJ', 'Zhang S', 'Ou FS', 'Venook AP', 'Niedzwiecki D', 'Lenz HJ', 'Innocenti F', ""O'Neil BH"", 'Shaw JE', 'Polite BN', 'Hochster HS', 'Atkins JN', 'Goldberg RM', 'Sato K', 'Ng K', 'Van Blarigan E', 'Mayer RJ', 'Blanke CD', ""O'Reilly EM"", 'Fuchs CS', 'Meyerhardt JA']",,"[""Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare, Boston, MA.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Duke University, Durham, NC.', 'University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles, CA.', 'University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN.', 'Medstar Washington Hospital Center, Washington, DC.', 'University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ.', 'Southeast Clinical Oncology Research Consortium, National Cancer Institute Community Oncology Research Program, Winston-Salem, NC.', 'West Virginia University Cancer Institute, Morgantown, WV.', 'Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare, Boston, MA.', 'Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare, Boston, MA.', 'University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare, Boston, MA.', 'SWOG, Portland, OR.', 'Oregon Health & Science University, Portland, OR.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT.', 'Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*mortality/pathology', 'Disease Progression', '*Exercise', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC6900834,,,2019/08/14 06:00,2020/06/18 06:00,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.01019 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Oct 10;37(29):2620-2631. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.01019.

One challenge in identifying biomarkers of early disease is the collection of samples from patients prior to symptomatic presentation. We used blood collected during surgical resection of lung tumors in an iTRAQ isobaric tagging experiment to identify proteins effluxing from tumors into pulmonary veins. Forty proteins were identified as having an increased abundance in the vein draining from the tumor compared to ""healthy"" pulmonary veins. These protein markers were then assessed in a second cohort that utilized the mass spectrometry (MS) technique: Sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra (SWATH) MS. SWATH-MS was used to measure proteins in serum samples taken from 25 patients <50 months prior to and at lung cancer diagnosis and 25 matched controls. The SWATH-MS analysis alone produced an 11 protein marker panel. A machine learning classification model was generated that could discriminate patient samples from patients within 12 months of lung cancer diagnosis and control samples.

We previously identified heme metabolism as a novel pathway contributing to sensory neurons maintenance and nociception. Indeed, we reported mutations in the feline leukemia virus subgroup C receptor 1 (FLVCR1) gene in individuals affected by HSAN. FLVCR1 gene encodes for 2 heme export proteins, FLVCR1a (plasma membrane) and FLVCR1b (mitochondria), crucially involved in the regulation of cellular heme homeostasis. Here, we report on 2 additional patients carrying novel biallelic mutations in FLVCR1 translation initiation codon (c.2T>C; p.(Met1Thr) and c.3G>T; p.(Met1Ile)). We overexpressed the c.2T>C; p.(Met1Thr) mutant in human cell lines and we describe its impact on protein structure and function in comparison with other HSAN-related mutations. We found that the mutation interferes with translation in 2 different ways: by lowering levels of translation of wild-type protein and by inducing translation initiation from a downstream in-frame ATG, leading to the production of an N-terminal truncated protein that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. The impact of different kinds of mutations on FLVCR1a localization and structure was also described. The identification of novel FLVCR1 mutations in HSAN reinforces the crucial role of heme in sensory neuron maintenance and pain perception. Moreover, our in vitro findings demonstrate that heme export is not completely lost in HSAN patients, thus suggesting the possibility to improve FLVCR1 expression/activity for therapeutic purposes.","['Bertino, Francesca', 'Firestone, Kyra', 'Bellacchio, Emanuele', 'Jackson, Kelly E', 'Asamoah, Alexander', 'Hersh, Joseph', 'Fiorito, Veronica', 'Destefanis, Francesca', 'Gonser, Rusty', 'Tucker, Megan E', 'Altruda, Fiorella', 'Tolosano, Emanuela', 'Chiabrando, Deborah']","['Bertino F', 'Firestone K', 'Bellacchio E', 'Jackson KE', 'Asamoah A', 'Hersh J', 'Fiorito V', 'Destefanis F', 'Gonser R', 'Tucker ME', 'Altruda F', 'Tolosano E', 'Chiabrando D']",,"['Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'College of Arts and Sciences, Indiana State University, IN, United States.', ""Genetics and Rare Diseases Research Division, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, IRCCS, Rome, Italy."", 'Weisskopf Child Evaluation Center, University of Louisville, Kentucky, United States.', 'Weisskopf Child Evaluation Center, University of Louisville, Kentucky, United States.', 'Weisskopf Child Evaluation Center, University of Louisville, Kentucky, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Biology, College of Arts and Sciences, Indiana State University, IN, United States.', 'The Center for Genomic Advocacy, Indiana State University, IN, United States.', 'College of Arts and Sciences, Indiana State University, IN, United States.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Biotechnology and Health Sciences, Molecular Biotechnology Center, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pain,Pain,7508686,"['0 (FLVCR1 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Transport Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Virus)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)']",IM,,"['DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Female', 'HeLa Cells', 'Heme/*metabolism', 'Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathies/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Membrane Transport Proteins/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Virus/*genetics']",,,,2019/08/14 06:00,2020/08/29 06:00,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001675 [doi]', '00006396-201912000-00010 [pii]']",ppublish,Pain. 2019 Dec;160(12):2766-2775. doi: 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001675.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, few reports describe long-term outcomes of pediatric KT recipients with a pretransplant malignancy. Between 1963 and 2015, 884 pediatric (age: 0-17 years old) recipients received 1055 KTs at our institution. KT outcomes were analyzed in children with a pretransplant malignancy. We identified 14 patients who had a pretransplant malignancy prior to KT; the majority were <10 years old at the time of KT. Ten (71%) patients received their grafts from living donors, the majority of which were related to the recipient. Wilms' tumor was the dominant type of pretransplant malignancy, seen in 50% of patients. The other pretransplant malignancy types were EBV-positive lymphoproliferative disorders, non-EBV-positive lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, soft-tissue sarcoma, and ovarian cancer. Ten of the 14 patients received chemotherapy as part of their pretransplant malignancy treatment. Graft survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 93%, 83%, and 72%, respectively. Patient survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 100%, 91%, and 83%, respectively. Six (40%) patients suffered AR following KT; half of them had their first episode of AR within 1 month of KT. Our single-center experience demonstrates that pediatric KT recipients with a previously treated pretransplant malignancy did not exhibit worse outcomes than other pediatric KT patients.","['Serrano, Oscar K', 'Gannon, Alexis', 'Olowofela, Ayokunle S', 'Reddy, Apoorva', 'Berglund, Danielle', 'Matas, Arthur J']","['Serrano OK', 'Gannon A', 'Olowofela AS', 'Reddy A', 'Berglund D', 'Matas AJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5076-0938'],"['Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.', 'Department of Surgery, Division of Transplantation, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*surgery', 'Kidney Neoplasms/*surgery', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Living Donors', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/surgery', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/surgery', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Wilms Tumor/surgery', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*immunosuppression', '*nephrotoxicity', '*pediatric kidney transplantation', '*pretransplant malignancy']",2019/08/14 06:00,2020/09/20 06:00,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2018/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13557 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2019 Nov;23(7):e13557. doi: 10.1111/petr.13557.

Here we assess shared genetic risk in genome-wide-association-studies (GWAS). Secondary analysis of GWAS of NHL subtypes (chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma) and ADs (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis). Shared genetic risk was assessed by (a) description of regional genetic of overlap, (b) polygenic risk score (PRS), (c)""diseasome"", (d)meta-analysis. Descriptive analysis revealed few shared genetic factors between each AD and each NHL subtype. The PRS of ADs were not increased in NHL patients (nor vice versa). In the diseasome, NHLs shared more genetic etiology with ADs than solid cancers (p = .0041). A meta-analysis (combing AD with NHL) implicated genes of apoptosis and telomere length. This GWAS-based analysis four NHL subtypes and three ADs revealed few weakly-associated shared loci, explaining little total risk. This suggests common genetic variation, as assessed by GWAS in these sample sizes, may not be the primary explanation for the link between these ADs and NHLs.","['Din, Lennox', 'Sheikh, Mohammad',

The lack of clinical data harmonization impedes cross-institutional electronic data exchange and future meta-analyses. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify and harmonize a semantic core of common data elements (CDEs) in clinical routine and research documentation, based on a systematic metadata analysis of existing documentation models. METHODS: Lists of relevant data items were collected and reviewed by hematologists from two university hospitals regarding routine documentation and several case report forms of clinical trials for AML. In addition, existing registries and international recommendations were included. Data items were coded to medical concepts via the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) by a physician and reviewed by another physician. On the basis of the coded concepts, the data sources were analyzed for concept overlaps and identification of most frequent concepts. The most frequent concepts were then implemented as data elements in the standardized format of the Operational Data Model by the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium. RESULTS: A total of 3265 medical concepts were identified, of which 1414 were unique. Among the 1414 unique medical concepts, the 50 most frequent ones cover 26.98% of all concept occurrences within the collected AML documentation. The top 100 concepts represent 39.48% of all concepts' occurrences. Implementation of CDEs is available on a European research infrastructure and can be downloaded in different formats for reuse in different electronic data capture systems. CONCLUSIONS: Information management is a complex process for research-intense disease entities as AML that is associated with a large set of lab-based diagnostics and different treatment options. Our systematic UMLS-based analysis revealed the existence of a core data set and an exemplary reusable implementation for harmonized data capture is available on an established metadata repository.","['Holz, Christian', 'Kessler, Torsten', 'Dugas, Martin', 'Varghese, Julian']","['Holz C', 'Kessler T', 'Dugas M', 'Varghese J']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3752-5436', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7679-5362', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9740-0788', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7206-3719']","['Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Informatics, University of Munster, Munster, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Canada,JMIR Med Inform,JMIR medical informatics,101645109,,,,,PMC6709897,['NOTNLM'],"['UMLS', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'common data elements', 'medical informatics']",2019/08/14 06:00,2019/08/14 06:01,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2019/01/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:01 [medline]']","['v7i3e13554 [pii]', '10.2196/13554 [doi]']",epublish,JMIR Med Inform. 2019 Aug 12;7(3):e13554. doi: 10.2196/13554.,"['(c)Christian Holz, Torsten Kessler, Martin Dugas, Julian Varghese.

Nicotinamide (NAM) is the principal NAD(+) precursor and a noncompetitive inhibitor of SIRT1. In our study, we showed that NAM enhanced the sensitivity of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) to doxorubicin (DOX) via SIRT1. We found that SIRT1 high expression in CML patients was associated with disease progression and drug resistance. Exogenous NAM efficiently repressed the deacetylation activity of SIRT1 and induced the apoptosis of DOX-resistant K562 cells (K562R) in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, the combination of NAM and DOX significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. The knockdown of SIRT1 in K562R cells enhanced NAM+DOX-induced apoptosis. SIRT1 rescue in K562R reduced the NAM+DOX-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, the combinatory treatment significantly increased the cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP in K562R in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest the potential role of NAM in increasing the sensitivity of CML to DOX via the inhibition of SIRT1.","['Pan, Shan', 'Leng, Jun', 'Deng, Xinzhou', 'Ruan, Honggang', 'Zhou, Lu', 'Jamal, Muhammad', 'Xiao, Ruijing', 'Xiong, Jie', 'Yin, Qian', 'Wu, Yingjie', 'Wang, Meng', 'Yuan, Wen', 'Shao, Liang', 'Zhang, Qiuping']","['Pan S', 'Leng J', 'Deng X', 'Ruan H', 'Zhou L', 'Jamal M', 'Xiao R', 'Xiong J', 'Yin Q', 'Wu Y', 'Wang M', 'Yuan W', 'Shao L', 'Zhang Q']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2633-5824'],"['Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei, China.', 'Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory of Developmentally Originated Disease, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '12001-76-2 (Vitamin B Complex)', '25X51I8RD4 (Niacinamide)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Combinations', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, SCID', 'Niacinamide/*pharmacology', 'Sirtuin 1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vitamin B Complex/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CML', '*DOX', '*NAM', '*SIRT1']",2019/08/14 06:00,2021/03/19 06:00,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2018/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29303 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2020 Jan;121(1):574-586. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29303.

To investigate a possible role for HPV in a cervical carcinoma that was HPV-negative by PCR testing, we performed HPV DNA hybridization capture plus massively parallel sequencing. This detected a subgenomic, URR-E6-E7-E1 segment of HPV70 DNA, a type not generally associated with cervical cancer, inserted in an intron of the B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11B (BCL11B) gene in the human genome. Long range DNA sequencing confirmed the virus and flanking BCL11B DNA structures including both insertion junctions. Global transcriptomic analysis detected multiple, alternatively spliced, HPV70-BCL11B, fusion transcripts with fused open reading frames. The insertion and fusion transcripts were present in an intraepithelial precursor phase of tumorigenesis. These results suggest oncogenicity of HPV70, identify novel BCL11B variants with potential oncogenic implications, and underscore the advantages of thorough genomic analyses to elucidate insights into HPV-associated tumorigenesis.","['Van Arsdale, Anne', 'Patterson, Nicole E', 'Maggi, Elaine C', 'Agoni, Lorenzo', 'Van Doorslaer, Koenraad', 'Harmon, Bryan', 'Nevadunsky, Nicole', 'Kuo, Dennis Y S', 'Einstein, Mark H', 'Lenz, Jack', 'Montagna, Cristina']","['Van Arsdale A', 'Patterson NE', 'Maggi EC', 'Agoni L', 'Van Doorslaer K', 'Harmon B', 'Nevadunsky N', 'Kuo DYS', 'Einstein MH', 'Lenz J', 'Montagna C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5788-7410'],"[""Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Women's Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York."", 'Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York.', ""Department of Women's and Children's Health, Obstetrics & Gynecology Unit, Fondazione Poliambulanza Istituto Ospedaliero, Brescia, Italy."", 'School of Animal and Comparative Biomedical Sciences, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences BIO5 Institute University of Arizona, Tuscon, Arizona, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York.', ""Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Women's Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York."", ""Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology and Women's Health, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York."", ""Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Women's Health, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, New Jersey."", 'Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Yeshiva University, Bronx, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (BCL11B protein, human)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)']",IM,,"['Base Sequence', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics/metabolism', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Female', 'Genomics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing/methods', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Papillomaviridae/*genetics/pathogenicity', 'Papillomavirus Infections/*diagnosis/genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/genetics', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC6916423,['NOTNLM'],"['* BCL11B', '*HPV DNA', '*HPV70', '*cancer', '*cervical carcinoma', '*fluorescent in situ hybridization', '*hybridization capture', '*insertional oncogenesis', '*long range sequencing', '*oncogene']",2019/08/14 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22799 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2020 Feb;59(2):84-95. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22799.

Herein, we evaluated the predictive value of controlling nutritional status (CONUT) in patients undergoing allo-HCT for myeloid malignancies. We retrospectively analyzed 200 patients with myeloid malignancies who underwent allo-HCT for the first time. We evaluated CONUT before the initiation of conditioning and compared malnourished patients (poor CONUT, n = 56) with non-malnourished patients (normal CONUT, n = 144). The cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality within 100 days (early NRM) was significantly higher in the poor CONUT group than in the normal CONUT group [21.4% (95% CI: 11.8-33.0%) vs. 9.7% (95% CI: 5.6-15.2%); P = 0.025]. In multivariate analysis, poor CONUT was an independent and significant risk factor for early NRM [HR: 2.2 (95% CI: 1.0-4.7); P = 0.048]. The overall 1-year survival rate was significantly lower in the poor CONUT group than in the normal CONUT group [53.3% (95% CI: 39.4-65.4%) vs. 71.0% (95% CI: 62.7-77.7%); P = 0.005]. These findings suggest that CONUT before allo-HCT is a useful predictor of poor outcomes in patients with myeloid malignancies.","['Araie, Hiroaki', 'Kawaguchi, Yuka', 'Okabe, Motohito', 'Lee, Yoonha', 'Ohbiki, Marie', 'Osaki, Masahide', 'Goto, Miyo', 'Goto, Tatsunori', 'Morishita, Takanobu', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Miyamura, Koichi']","['Araie H', 'Kawaguchi Y', 'Okabe M', 'Lee Y', 'Ohbiki M', 'Osaki M', 'Goto M', 'Goto T', 'Morishita T', 'Ozawa Y', 'Miyamura K']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1162-9010'],"['Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, 3-35 Michishita-cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan. nietzsche286@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, 3-35 Michishita-cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, 3-35 Michishita-cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, 3-35 Michishita-cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, 3-35 Michishita-cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, 3-35 Michishita-cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, 3-35 Michishita-cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, 3-35 Michishita-cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, 3-35 Michishita-cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, 3-35 Michishita-cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, 3-35 Michishita-cho, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis', 'Neoplasms', '*Nutritional Status', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'Controlling nutritional status (CONUT)', 'Malnutrition', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome']",2019/08/14 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02723-w [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02723-w [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Nov;110(5):599-605. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02723-w.

Clinical trials of FF-10501 for myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are currently being conducted in the United States. Although it has been shown that FF-10501 induces apoptosis in hematological malignant cells, the intracellular mechanisms of this effect have not been characterized. We conducted an in vitro study to elucidate the mechanisms of FF-10501-induced cell death using 12 hematological malignant cell lines derived from myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. FF-10501 suppressed the growth of each cell line in a dose-dependent manner. However, the clinically relevant dose (40 muM) of FF-10501 induced cell death in three cell lines (MOLM-13, OCI-AML3, and MOLT-3). Investigation of the cell death mechanism suggested that FF-10501 induces both apoptotic and necrotic cell death. FF-10501-induced apoptosis was mediated by caspase-8 activation followed by activation of the mitochondrial pathway in MOLM-13 and MOLT-3 cells. FF-10501 induced necrotic cell death via endoplasmic reticulum stress in OCI-AML3 cells. The present study is the first to identify intracellular pathways involved in FF-10501-induced cell death.","['Matsumoto, Taichi', 'Jimi, Shiro', 'Migita, Keisuke', 'Terada, Kazuki', 'Mori, Masayoshi', 'Takamatsu, Yasushi', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Hara, Shuuji']","['Matsumoto T', 'Jimi S', 'Migita K', 'Terada K', 'Mori M', 'Takamatsu Y', 'Suzumiya J', 'Hara S']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5301-1481'],"['Department of Drug Informatics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, 8-19-1, Nanakuma, Jounan, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan. tmatsumoto@fukuoka-u.ac.jp.', 'Central Laboratory of Pathology and Morphology, Department of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Informatics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, 8-19-1, Nanakuma, Jounan, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Drug Design and Drug Delivery, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pharmacotherapeutics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology, and Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology/Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Shimane, Japan.', 'Department of Drug Informatics, Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Fukuoka University, 8-19-1, Nanakuma, Jounan, Fukuoka, 814-0180, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.1.1.205 (IMP Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Caspase 8/metabolism', 'Cell Death/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Humans', 'IMP Dehydrogenase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mitochondria/metabolism', 'Necrosis/chemically induced']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Caspase-8', 'Endoplasmic reticulum stress', 'FF-10501', 'Necrosis']",2019/08/14 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2019/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02722-x [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02722-x [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Nov;110(5):606-617. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02722-x.

Methods: A randomized control design study was applied in two hematology departments in a hospital in Zhengzhou. Patients in the experimental group received mindfulness-based psychological care(MBPC), and those in the control group received conventional care. Anxiety, depression, and sleeping problems were measured using the Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Self-Rating Depression Scale, and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Results: Statistically significant differences were observed among anxiety, depression, and sleeping problems between the two groups in the post-test (P < 0.05). A significant decrease in anxiety and depression and an improvement in sleep were observed between pre- and post-interventions (P < 0.05) in the experimental group. Conclusions: MBPC significantly improved sleep quality and mood of the experimental group.

AIM: The goal wa`s to study the direct cytotoxic effect of the phytocomplex and its modulating effect on the cytotoxic activity of the donor's mononuclear blood cells in in vitro experiments. METHODS: The phytocomplex was a dry extract from marsh cinquefoil, creeping alfalfa and common hop; its main active ingredients were flavonoids. Transplantable monolayer cultures of lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal cancer, erythroblastic leukaemia, and fibroblasts were used as target cells. The cytotoxic activity was assessed using a cytotoxic test based on the selective ability to live cells to reduce MTT (3-[4, 5-dimethyltriazol-2-yl]-2, 5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide) to formazan in mitochondria. Quantitative determination of formazan was performed using spectrophotometry. RESULTS: A direct cytotoxic effect of the phytocomplex in concentrations of at least 2.5 mg/ml on tumour cells has been established. Its modulating effect on the cytotoxic activity of mononuclear blood cells at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml was shown. The phytocomplex in doses of 0.25 and 0.5 mg/ml increased the killer activity of the mononuclear cells in a diseased person's blood, but did not affect these blood cells in a healthy donor. Incubation of lymphocytes with a phytocomplex for 24 hours increased the cytotoxic activity of mononuclear cells by 20-25%. CONCLUSION: The direct cytotoxic effect of the phytocomplex and its modulating effect on the cytotoxic activity of mononuclear blood cells in model experiments in vitro have been established.","['Babaskina, Liudmila Ivanovna', 'Litvinova, Tatiana Mikhailovna', 'Babaskin, Dmitrii Vladimirovich', 'Kiselevsky, Mikhail Valentinovich', 'Savinova, Olga Vladimirovna', 'Winter, Elizaveta Aleksandrovna']","['Babaskina LI', 'Litvinova TM', 'Babaskin DV', 'Kiselevsky MV', 'Savinova OV', 'Winter EA']",,"['Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, 8-2 Trubetskaya Street, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, 8-2 Trubetskaya Street, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, 8-2 Trubetskaya Street, Moscow, Russian Federation.', 'N.

Tumor-associated antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (TAA-CTLs)-based therapy was introduced and increasingly used clinically to kill tumor cells via tumor antigen activation. Method: In this study, we expanded autologous lymphocytes reactive to five TAA (NY-ESO-1, MAGE-A3, WT1, Survivin, and PRAME) and evaluated its safety and efficacy in 9 patients with AML at high risk of relapse. Results: Before first TAA-CTL infusion, 5 patients were minimal residual disease (MRD) positive, whereas 4 were MRD negative. Patients received TAA-CTL infusion for 1-3 times. None of them had obvious adverse reactions during or post the infusion. Of the 4 MRD-negative patients who were infused with TAA-CTLs, one developed relapsed disease. Among 5 MRD+ patients, there was a demonstrable antileukemic effect of the TAA-CTLs alone without any concomitant chemotherapy in 2 patients, as demonstrated by the negative of MRD in bone marrow after TAA-CTL infusion. Conclusions: In summary, we have observed preliminary indications of activity and safety after administration of autologous TAA-CTLs in patients with AML. The ultimate question of clinical efficacy, however, will need to be addressed in a larger trial with larger homogeneous patient population.","['Xue, Lei', 'Hu, Yan', 'Wang, Jian', 'Liu, Xin', 'Wang, Xingbing']","['Xue L', 'Hu Y', 'Wang J', 'Liu X', 'Wang X']",,"[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Science and Medicine, University of Sciences and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Science and Medicine, University of Sciences and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Science and Medicine, University of Sciences and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Science and Medicine, University of Sciences and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of USTC, Division of Life Science and Medicine, University of Sciences and Technology of China, Hefei, Anhui 230001, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Anhui Provincial Hospital, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,,PMC6642655,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'immunotherapy', 'tumor-associated antigen-specific T cells']",2019/08/14 06:00,2019/08/14 06:01,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2019/02/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S205296 [doi]', '205296 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Jul 16;11:6467-6476. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S205296. eCollection 2019.,,20190716,,,['The authors declare that they have no competing interests in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the immune regulatory mechanisms employed by acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cells upon exposure to IFN-gamma is critical for development of immunotherapy and checkpoint blockade therapy approaches. This study aims to explore the influence of myeloid maturation on IFN-gamma-induced PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression and on pro-leukemogenic transcription factor STAT3 signaling in AML and MDS. Stimulation of myeloid blasts' maturation by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (vitamin D) increased the CD11b(+) fraction that expressed PD-1 ligands in response to IFN-gamma. Intriguingly, STAT3 pathway was potently induced by IFN-gamma and strengthened upon prolonged exposure. Nonetheless, STAT3-mediated atypical IFN-gamma signaling appeared as a negligible factor for PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression. These negative influences of IFN-gamma could be alleviated by a small-molecule inhibitor of STAT3, stattic, which also inhibited the upregulation of PD-L1. In conclusion, induction of myeloid maturation enhances the responsiveness of AML and MDS cells to IFN-gamma. However, these malignant myeloid cells can exploit both STAT3 pathway and PD-1 ligands to survive IFN-gamma-mediated immunity and maintain secondary immune resistance.","['Yoyen-Ermis, Digdem', 'Tunali, Gurcan', 'Tavukcuoglu, Ece', 'Horzum, Utku', 'Ozkazanc, Didem', 'Sutlu, Tolga', 'Buyukasik, Yahya', 'Esendagli, Gunes']","['Yoyen-Ermis D', 'Tunali G', 'Tavukcuoglu E', 'Horzum U', 'Ozkazanc D', 'Sutlu T', 'Buyukasik Y', 'Esendagli G']",,"['Department of Basic Oncology, Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Lokman Hekim University, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical Biology, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Basic Oncology, Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Basic Oncology, Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Basic Oncology, Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Nanotechnology Research and Application Center, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Nanotechnology Research and Application Center, Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Basic Oncology, Hacettepe University Cancer Institute, Ankara, Turkey. gunes.esendagli@lycos.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (ARHGEF3 protein, human)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (CD11b Antigen)', '0 (CD274 protein, human)', '0 (ITGAM protein, human)', '0 (PDCD1LG2 protein, human)', '0 (Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein)', '0 (Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'B7-H1 Antigen/genetics/*immunology', 'CD11b Antigen/genetics/immunology', 'Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*immunology/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 Protein/genetics/immunology', 'Rho Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors/genetics/*immunology', 'Signal Transduction', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology']",PMC6691003,,,2019/08/14 06:00,2020/10/27 06:00,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-48256-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-48256-4 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Aug 12;9(1):11697. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-48256-4.,,20190812,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BLV-positive cows were further divided into cows with High BLV proviral load (H-PVL) (n=23) and Low BLV proviral load (L-PVL) (n=53). Severity of clinical mastitis was classified as MILD, MODERATE, or SEVERE. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed on the host factors and environmental factors with severity of clinical mastitis as the objective variable. BLV proviral load (PVL) and season at onset of mastitis showed significant correlation with the severity of clinical mastitis. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed on natural immunity factors lactoferrin and lingual antimicrobial peptide (LAP) concentration in milk, with PVL as the objective variable.

These translocations can occur as sole clonal driver mutations in infant leukemias, suggesting that fetal or neonatal hematopoietic progenitors may be exquisitely sensitive to transformation by MLL fusion proteins. To test this possibility, we used transgenic mice to induce one translocation product, MLL-ENL, during fetal, neonatal, juvenile and adult stages of life. When MLL-ENL was induced in fetal or neonatal mice, almost all died of AML. In contrast, when MLL-ENL was induced in adult mice, most survived for >1 year despite sustained transgene expression. AML initiation was most efficient when MLL-ENL was induced in neonates, and even transient suppression of MLL-ENL in neonates could prevent AML in most mice. MLL-ENL target genes were induced more efficiently in neonatal progenitors than in adult progenitors, consistent with the distinct AML initiation efficiencies. Interestingly, transplantation stress mitigated the developmental barrier to leukemogenesis. Since fetal/neonatal progenitors were highly competent to initiate MLL-ENL-driven AML, we tested whether Lin28b, a fetal master regulator, could accelerate leukemogenesis. Surprisingly, Lin28b suppressed AML initiation rather than accelerating it. This may explain why MLL rearrangements often occur before birth in human infant leukemia patients, but transformation usually does not occur until after birth, when Lin28b levels decline. Our findings show that the efficiency of MLL-ENL-driven AML initiation changes through the course of pre- and postnatal development, and developmental programs can be manipulated to impede transformation.","['Okeyo-Owuor, Theresa', 'Li, Yanan', 'Patel, Riddhi M', 'Yang, Wei', 'Casey, Emily B', 'Cluster, Andrew S', 'Porter, Shaina N', 'Bryder, David', 'Magee, Jeffrey A']","['Okeyo-Owuor T', 'Li Y', 'Patel RM', 'Yang W', 'Casey EB', 'Cluster AS', 'Porter SN', 'Bryder D', 'Magee JA']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-4396-0557', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0169-1224', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0766-4200']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund Stem Cell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden; and.', 'Sahlgrenska Cancer Center, Gothenburg University, Gothenburg, Sweden.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, and.', 'Department of Genetics, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (MLL-ENL oncoprotein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Comorbidity', 'Female', 'Genetic Association Studies', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Hemorrhage/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Odds Ratio', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics']",PMC6693010,,,2019/08/14 06:00,2020/08/01 06:00,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2019/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019000554 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000554 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Aug 13;3(15):2388-2399. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000554.,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,['R01 HL136504/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMOylation is deregulated in various hematological malignancies, where it participates in both tumorigenesis and cancer cell response to therapies. This is the case for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemias (APL) where SUMOylation, and subsequent destruction, of the PML-RARalpha fusion oncoprotein are triggered by arsenic trioxide, which is used as front-line therapy in combination with retinoic acid to cure APL patients. A similar arsenic-induced SUMO-dependent degradation was also documented for Tax, a human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV1) viral protein implicated in Adult T-cell Leukemogenesis. SUMOylation also participates in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) response to both chemo- and differentiation therapies, in particular through its ability to regulate gene expression. In Multiple Myeloma, many enzymes of the SUMO pathway are overexpressed and their high expression correlates with lower response to melphalan-based chemotherapies. B-cell lymphomas overexpressing the c-Myc oncogene also overexpress most components of the SUMO pathway and are highly sensitive to SUMOylation inhibition. Targeting the SUMO pathway with recently discovered pharmacological inhibitors, alone or in combination with current therapies, might therefore constitute a powerful strategy to improve the treatment of these cancers.","['Boulanger, Mathias', 'Paolillo, Rosa', 'Piechaczyk, Marc', 'Bossis, Guillaume']","['Boulanger M', 'Paolillo R', 'Piechaczyk M', 'Bossis G']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2799-4047', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3349-8250']","['Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, University of Montpellier, CNRS, 34000 Montpellier, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, University of Montpellier, CNRS, 34000 Montpellier, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, University of Montpellier, CNRS, 34000 Montpellier, France.', 'Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, University of Montpellier, CNRS, 34000 Montpellier, France. guillaume.bossis@igmm.cnrs.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (SUMO-1 Protein)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'SUMO-1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sumoylation/drug effects']",PMC6721055,['NOTNLM'],"['SUMOylation', 'hematomalignancies', 'leukemia', 'resistance']",2019/08/14 06:00,2020/01/15 06:00,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2019/07/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/15 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20163895 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20163895 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Aug 9;20(16). pii: ijms20163895. doi: 10.3390/ijms20163895.,,20190809,,"['ALF-2017/02/Association Laurette Fugain', '2018/Fondation Leucemie Espoir', 'PLBIO15-170/Institut National Du Cancer', 'equipe labellisee/Ligue Contre le Cancer', '4eme annee de these/Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These metabolites fuel the bioenergy, biosynthesis, and redox potential required for duplication of cellular biomass. Multicellular organisms maintain tissue homeostasis by balancing signals promoting proliferation and removal of cells via apoptosis. While apoptosis is in itself an energy dependent process activated by intrinsic and extrinsic signals, whether specific nutrient acquisition (elevated or suppressed) and their metabolism regulates apoptosis is less well investigated. Normal cellular metabolism is regulated by lineage specific intrinsic features and microenvironment driven extrinsic features. In the context of cancer, genetic abnormalities, unconventional microenvironments and/or therapy engage constitutive pro-survival signaling to re-program and rewire metabolism to maintain survival, growth, and proliferation. It thus becomes particularly relevant to understand whether altered nutrient acquisition and metabolism in cancer can also contribute to the evasion of apoptosis and consequently therapy resistance. Our review attempts to dissect a causal relationship between two cancer hallmarks, i.e., deregulated cellular energetics and the evasion of programmed cell death with primary focus on the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis.","['Sharma, Aditi', 'Boise, Lawrence H', 'Shanmugam, Mala']","['Sharma A', 'Boise LH', 'Shanmugam M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4415-8083'],"['Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Winship Cancer Institute, School of Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA. mala.shan@emory.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,,PMC6721599,['NOTNLM'],"['BCL-2', 'apoptosis', 'metabolism']",2019/08/14 06:00,2019/08/14 06:01,['2019/08/14 06:00'],"['2019/07/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11081144 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11081144 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Aug 9;11(8). pii: cancers11081144. doi: 10.3390/cancers11081144.,,20190809,,"['R01 CA208328/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA192844/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '6573-19/Leukemia and Lymphoma Society']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

RNA profiles were downloaded from the Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatment (TARGET) database and identified specific lncRNAs, miRNAs, and mRNAs in high-risk group of childhood AML. A lncRNA-mRNA-miRNA ceRNA network in childhood AML was constructed. A total of 2064 mRNAs, 615 lncRNAs, and 60 miRNAs were identified as significantly differentially expressed, and 13 lncRNAs, 7 miRNAs, and 67 mRNAs were incorporated in the ceRNA network. Functional analysis showed that these DEmRNAs were significantly enriched in Ras signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and other tumor-related pathways.

The compounds were applied during the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition and to differentiated myeloid progenitors growing in suspension. The system was capable of identifying compounds with both inhibitory and favorable effects on hematopoietic network, changes in expression of hematopoietic markers, and mitochondrial and cytotoxicity. The findings were confirmed and further investigated by secondary screens, colony forming cell assay, and gene expression profiling. The hematoendothelial toxicity of 5-fluorouracil, berberine chloride, and benzo(a)pyrene is characterized by the inhibition of cell division and a shift of hematopoietic programming to non-hemogenic endothelial and mesenchymal fates. This study demonstrates the feasibility of transcription factor (TF)-based differentiation systems to monitor endothelial and hematotoxicity and serves as an informative platform for screening myelosuppressive or stimulatory drugs and mechanistic studies of their action.","['Elcheva, Irina', 'Sneed, Mechelle', 'Frazee, Scott', 'Liu, Zhenqiu', 'Zhu, Junjia', 'Wood, Tyler', 'Hendrickson, Sara', 'Oehler, Chuck', 'Garcia, Brad', 'Spiegelman, Vladimir S']","['Elcheva I', 'Sneed M', 'Frazee S', 'Liu Z', 'Zhu J', 'Wood T', 'Hendrickson S', 'Oehler C', 'Garcia B', 'Spiegelman VS']",,"['Primorigen Biosciences Inc., Madison, WI 53719, USA; Division of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, Hershey, PA 17033, USA.

Some patients progressing to the blast phase develop chemotherapeutic drug resistance. In the authors' previous study, it was found that the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway was activated in CML and that rapamycin inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells. Targeting the mTOR pathway may be used in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs to enhance their efficacy and overcome multidrug resistance. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of rapamycin and doxorubicin on K562 cell proliferation following the combination treatment, and further focus on confirming whether rapamycin enhanced the antitumor effects of doxorubicin by downregulating the mTOR/ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) pathway. It was found that rapamycin and doxorubicin significantly decreased the viability of K562 cells. The apoptotic cells were more frequently detected in rapamycin and doxorubicin treatment groups (25.50+/-1.25%). Both drugs decreased Bcl-2 and increased Bax expression in K562 cells. Rapamycin and doxorubicin also reduced the phosphorylation levels of mTOR and p70S6K. Meanwhile, p70S6K-targeting small interfering (si)RNA and doxorubicin inhibited cell proliferation and regulated key factors of the cell cycle. In addition, the exposure of cells to p70S6K siRNA and doxorubicin significantly increased cell apoptosis, as compared with single treatment. These results suggested that rapamycin could enhance the antitumor effects of doxorubicin on K562 cells by downregulating mTOR/p70S6K signaling. Targeting the mTOR/p70S6K pathway may be a new therapeutic approach for leukemia.","['Li, Jie', 'Liu, Wenjing', 'Hao, Hongling', 'Wang, Qiuyi', 'Xue, Liying']","['Li J', 'Liu W', 'Hao H', 'Wang Q', 'Xue L']",,"['Department of Hematology, Hebei General Hospital, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050000, P.R.

Despite its efficacy, nephrotoxicity is a potentially serious toxicity that could also exacerbate other methotrexate-related toxicities and compromise dose intensity. Acetazolamide (AZL) is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that causes an increase in bicarbonate excretion and consequently urine alkalinisation. Following occurrences of HDMTx-induced acute kidney injury (AKI) due to inadequate urine alkalinisation at our institution, routine AZL was administered to appropriate patients from 2010 onwards. AIMS: To analyse the addition of AZL to routine renoprotective measures, given that inadequate urinary alkalinisation is the major risk factor for methotrexate crystal precipitation and prolonged excretion. In addition, since fluid overload is a common consequence of HDMTx treatment, the effect of AZL on fluid balance was also examined. METHODS: This is a retrospective, single-centred cohort study examining the mitigation of HDMTx-induced toxicities by AZL in 92 patients over a 6-year period. RESULTS: AZL showed a strong trend of preventing either AKI (as per CTCAE version 4.03) or delayed methotrexate elimination (>5 days), especially in males. Furthermore, AZL also resulted in reduced weight gain and fewer episodes of urinary pH <7.0. CONCLUSION: AZL appeared to diminish the incidence of HDMTx-induced toxicities, including reducing oedema-related weight gain. With mild, preventable hypokalaemia as the only noteworthy toxicity, AZL could be considered as an adjunct to HDMTx patient care.","['Ku, Matthew', 'Bazargan, Ali', 'Tam, Constantine']","['Ku M', 'Bazargan A', 'Tam C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9289-1335'],"[""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", ""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", ""Department of Haematology, St Vincent's Hospital, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."", 'Department of Haematology, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', 'O3FX965V0I (Acetazolamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['*Acetazolamide', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic', 'Cohort Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Methotrexate', 'Retrospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acetazolamide', '*methotrexate', '*renal insufficiency']",2019/08/14 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/13 06:00'],"['2018/11/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/imj.14468 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2020 Mar;50(3):357-362. doi: 10.1111/imj.14468.,['(c) 2019 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similar treatments for T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) have been less successful, which is due to the higher resistance of T-ALL blasts to the cytotoxic function of NK cells. Herein, microRNA-29b (miR-29b) upregulation was identified in NK cells in both neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 (Notch1)-T-ALL mice and patients with T-ALL. Furthermore, miR-29b expression levels were downregulated in T-ALL blast cells. In addition, there was a selective downregulation of an immature subset of NK cells, as well as a reduction in interferon gamma (IFNgamma) production and natural killer receptor group 2, member D (NKG2D) expression level by NK cells in Notch1-T-ALL mice and patients with T-ALL. Furthermore, when miR-29b knock-out NK cells were adoptively transfused into Notch1-T-ALL mice, partial restoration of IFNgamma production and NKG2D expression was observed in NK cells, accompanied by retarded ALL progression and improved survival time. These results implied that T-ALL blast immune evasion occurred via miR-29b-mediated dysregulation in NK cells in the T-ALL microenvironment.","['Jin, Fengyan', 'Du, Zhonghua', 'Tang, Yang', 'Wang, Lixia', 'Yang, Yanping']","['Jin F', 'Du Z', 'Tang Y', 'Wang L', 'Yang Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, First Bethune Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130021, P.R.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common type of malignancy in humans. In the present study, Oncomine database was used to compare the expression pattern of SEPT2 mRNA between CRC and normal tissues. Additionally, protein expression in 90 pairs of CRC and paracancerous tissues was analyzed by western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results showed that SEPT2 was highly expressed in CRC tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. SEPT2 expression quantified by IHC was associated with lymph node metastasis, the degree of differentiation and TNM staging. Increased SEPT2 wass associated with reduced overall survival (OS) according to Kaplan-Meier analysis. COX proportional hazard analysis indicated that SEPT2 was an independent factor that influenced the OS of patients with CRC. Therefore, SEPT2 was associated with the occurrence, progression and prognosis of CRC and thus, may be a marker and prognostic indicator of CRC.","['He, Haoyu', 'Li, Junjun', 'Xu, Meng', 'Kan, Ziliang', 'Gao, Yang', 'Yuan, Caijun']","['He H', 'Li J', 'Xu M', 'Kan Z', 'Gao Y', 'Yuan C']",,"['Department of Oncology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical University, Jinzhou, Liaoning 121000, P.R.

Therefore, we investigated whether TKI prophylaxis for negative-minimal residual disease (MRD) after HSCT would improve patient outcomes in this nationwide retrospective cohort study. We included patients with Ph+ ALL who underwent their first allogeneic HSCT between 2001 and 2016, received TKI before HSCT, and achieved negative-MRD status within 180 days after HSCT. Of 850 patients for inclusion, 50 patients received TKI prophylaxis, mostly imatinib or dasatinib (median dose: 400 mg with imatinib and 40 mg with dasatinib). In a multivariate analysis, disease status at HSCT was the sole risk factor for relapse (hazard ratio, 3.58; P < .001 for positive-MRD with complete remission [CR] and hazard ratio, 6.13; P < .001 for active disease). TKI prophylaxis was not associated with a decreased risk of relapse or superior overall survival in either the whole cohort or in the analysis limited to negative-MRD or positive-MRD with CR1 at HSCT. Meanwhile, TKI prophylaxis limited to dasatinib might be associated with a decreased risk of relapse (hazard ratio, 0.34; P = .140), unlike imatinib. Alternative strategies using new-generation TKI for high-risk patients are warranted to improve the outcomes after allogeneic HSCT.","['Akahoshi, Yu', 'Nishiwaki, Satoshi', 'Mizuta, Shuichi', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Tanaka, Masatsugu', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Ozawa, Yukiyasu', 'Takahashi, Satoshi', 'Onizuka, Makoto', 'Shiratori, Souichi', 'Nakamae, Hirohisa', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Kako, Shinichi']","['Akahoshi Y', 'Nishiwaki S', 'Mizuta S', 'Ohashi K', 'Uchida N', 'Tanaka M', 'Fukuda T', 'Ozawa Y', 'Takahashi S', 'Onizuka M', 'Shiratori S', 'Nakamae H', 'Kanda Y', 'Ichinohe T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Kako S']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6825-9340'],"['Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Advanced Medicine, Nagoya University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology & Immunology, Kanazawa Medical University, Ishikawa, Japan.', 'Hematology Division, Tokyo Metropolitan Cancer and Infectious Diseases Center, Komagome Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanagawa Cancer Center, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Nagoya First Hospital, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Molecular Therapy, The Advanced Clinical Research Centre, The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Tokai University School of Medicine, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Hokkaido University Faculty of Medicine, Sapporo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Osaka City University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Dasatinib/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/drug effects/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/*therapy', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6778639,['NOTNLM'],"['Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'dasatinib', 'imatinib', 'minimal residual disease', 'post-transplant tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2019/08/14 06:00,2019/10/12 06:00,['2019/08/13 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14167 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Oct;110(10):3255-3266. doi: 10.1111/cas.14167.

Precision medicine strategies targeting the BCR pathway have been generally effective in treating lymphoma, but often fail to produce durable responses in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a common and aggressive cancer. New insights into DLBCL biology garnered from genomic analyses and functional proteogenomic studies have identified novel modes of BCR signaling in this disease. Herein, we describe the distinct roles of antigen-dependent and antigen-independent BCR signaling in different subtypes of DLBCL. We highlight mechanisms by which the BCR cooperates with TLR9 and mutant isoforms of MYD88 to drive sustained NF-kappaB activity in the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of DLBCL. Finally, we discuss progress in detecting and targeting oncogenic BCR signaling to improve the survival of patients with lymphoma.","['Young, Ryan M', 'Phelan, James D', 'Wilson, Wyndham H', 'Staudt, Louis M']","['Young RM', 'Phelan JD', 'Wilson WH', 'Staudt LM']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1735-2892'],"['Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Lymphoid Malignancies Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Autoantigens/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/genetics/metabolism', 'Germinal Center/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/*etiology/*metabolism/therapy', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/*etiology/*metabolism/therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction']",PMC6693651,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell receptor', '*cancer', '*lymphoma', '*signal transduction']",2019/08/14 06:00,2020/02/25 06:00,['2019/08/13 06:00'],"['2019/05/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12792 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2019 Sep;291(1):190-213. doi: 10.1111/imr.12792.,['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Investigation of the related regulators benefits the understanding of male reproduction. The proteasome system has been reported to regulate spermatogenesis, but the mechanisms and key contributing factors in vivo are poorly explored. Here we found that ablation of REGgamma, a proteasome activator, resulted in male subfertility. Analysis of the mouse testes after birth showed there was a decreased number of PLZF(+) spermatogonia and spermatocytes. Molecular analysis found that REGgamma loss significantly increased the abundance of p53 protein in the testis, and directly repressed PLZF transcription in cell lines. Of note, allelic p53 haplodeficiency partially rescued the defects in spermatogenesis observed in REGgamma-deficient mice. In summary, our results identify REGgamma-p53-PLZF to be a critical pathway that regulates spermatogenesis and establishes a new molecular link between the proteasome system and male reproduction.","['Gao, Xiao', 'Chen, Hui', 'Liu, Jian', 'Shen, Shihui', 'Wang, Qingwei', 'Clement, Tracy M', 'Deskin, Brian J', 'Chen, Caiyu', 'Zhao, Dengpan', 'Wang, Lu', 'Guo, Linjie', 'Ma, Xueqing', 'Zhang, Bianhong', 'Xu, Yunfei', 'Li, Xiaotao', 'Li, Lei']","['Gao X', 'Chen H', 'Liu J', 'Shen S', 'Wang Q', 'Clement TM', 'Deskin BJ', 'Chen C', 'Zhao D', 'Wang L', 'Guo L', 'Ma X', 'Zhang B', 'Xu Y', 'Li X', 'Li L']",,"['Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Department of Veterinary Physiology and Pharmacology, Texas A&M University, College Station, TX, USA.', 'Epigenetic & Stem Cell Biology Laboratory, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709, USA.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.', ""Department of Urology, Shanghai Tenth People's Hospital, Tongji University, Shanghai 200072, China."", 'Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030, USA.', 'Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, 500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai 200241, China.

Although the essential role of GATA2 in mouse hematopoiesis is well established, its involvement during early human hematopoietic development is not clear. By combining time-controlled overexpression of GATA2 with genetic knockout experiments, we found that GATA2, at the mesoderm specification stage, promotes the generation of hemogenic endothelial progenitors and their further differentiation to hematopoietic progenitor cells, and negatively regulates cardiac differentiation. Surprisingly, genome-wide transcriptional and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that GATA2 bound to regulatory regions, and repressed the expression of cardiac development-related genes. Moreover, genes important for hematopoietic differentiation were upregulated by GATA2 in a mostly indirect manner. Collectively, our data reveal a hitherto unrecognized role of GATA2 as a repressor of cardiac fates, and highlight the importance of coordinating the specification and repression of alternative cell fates.","['Castano, Julio', 'Aranda, Sergi', 'Bueno, Clara', 'Calero-Nieto, Fernando J', 'Mejia-Ramirez, Eva', 'Mosquera, Jose Luis', 'Blanco, Enrique', 'Wang, Xiaonan', 'Prieto, Cristina', 'Zabaleta, Lorea', 'Mereu, Elisabetta', 'Rovira, Meritxell', 'Jimenez-Delgado, Senda', 'Matson, Daniel R', 'Heyn, Holger', 'Bresnick, Emery H', 'Gottgens, Berthold', 'Di Croce, Luciano', 'Menendez, Pablo', 'Raya, Angel', 'Giorgetti, Alessandra']","['Castano J', 'Aranda S', 'Bueno C', 'Calero-Nieto FJ', 'Mejia-Ramirez E', 'Mosquera JL', 'Blanco E', 'Wang X', 'Prieto C', 'Zabaleta L', 'Mereu E', 'Rovira M', 'Jimenez-Delgado S', 'Matson DR', 'Heyn H', 'Bresnick EH', 'Gottgens B', 'Di Croce L', 'Menendez P', 'Raya A', 'Giorgetti A']",,"[""Center of Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona (CMRB), Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via de L'Hospitalet, 199-203, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona 08908, Spain; Center for Networked Biomedical Research on Bioengineering, Biomaterials, and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN), Madrid 28029, Spain."", 'Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona 08003, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Wellcome and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute and Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', ""Center of Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona (CMRB), Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via de L'Hospitalet, 199-203, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona 08908, Spain."", 'Bioinformatics Unit, Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, 08908 Spain.', 'Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona 08003, Spain.', 'Department of Hematology, Wellcome and MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute and Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain.', 'Laboratory of Hematological Diseases, Fundacion Inbiomed, San Sebastian, 20009, Spain.', 'CNAG-CRG, Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Center of Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona (CMRB), Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via de L'Hospitalet, 199-203, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona 08908, Spain."", ""Center of Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona (CMRB), Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via de L'Hospitalet, 199-203, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona 08908, Spain."", 'Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'CNAG-CRG, Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology (BIST), Barcelona, Spain; Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Cell and Regenerative Biology, UW-Madison Blood Research Program, Carbone Cancer Center, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, Madison, WI 53705, USA.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain.', 'Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG), The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona 08003, Spain; Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona 08010, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona 08036, Spain; Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona 08010, Spain; Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red en Cancer (CIBERONIC) ISCIII, Barcelona, Spain.', ""Center of Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona (CMRB), Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via de L'Hospitalet, 199-203, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona 08908, Spain; Center for Networked Biomedical Research on Bioengineering, Biomaterials, and Nanomedicine (CIBER-BBN), Madrid 28029, Spain; Institucio Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avancats (ICREA), Barcelona 08010, Spain."", ""Center of Regenerative Medicine in Barcelona (CMRB), Hospital Duran i Reynals, Gran Via de L'Hospitalet, 199-203, Hospitalet de Llobregat, Barcelona 08908, Spain.

We conducted a phase I study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multidrug chemotherapy including BZM in Japanese children with relapsed ALL. Three of five children with relapsed ALL enrolled in the study between November 2014 and April 2016 were evaluated. BZM (1.3 mg/m(2)) was administered on days 8, 11, 15, and 18 of multidrug induction chemotherapy. Pharmacokinetic studies were performed. Age at study entry was 5, 7, and 7 years old, respectively. Two patients had hyperdiploid B-precursor ALL, and one had T cell ALL. Although all patients experienced grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity and grade 3 elevation of aminotransferases, no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. The maximum tolerated dose was defined as 1.3 mg/m(2). Peripheral neuropathy and respiratory complications were not observed. Complete remission was achieved in all three patients. The mean maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration-time curve was 74.0 ng/mL and 73.9 ng h/mL, respectively.

We first established two doxorubicin (ADM)-resistant AML cell lines and then utilized high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to compare their circRNA expression profiles with those of the parental cell lines. With bioinformatic analysis, we identified key circRNA molecules involved in drug resistance and validated our findings in clinical specimens. The target microRNAs (miRNAs) and downstream mRNAs were also explored bioinformatically. Using RNA interference technique, the potential mechanism was further investigated. Twenty-nine circRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed between ADM-resistant and sensitive cells. We found that circPAN3 is most likely a key mediator in the development of AML drug resistance, evidenced by the increased expression in ADM-resistant cell lines and BM samples from relapsed patients. Additionally, downregulation of circPAN3 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly restored drug sensitivity to ADM in the two ADM-resistant cell lines, but lentivirus-mediated circPAN3 overexpression had the opposite effect. Subsequent bioinformatic analysis and mechanistic experiments revealed that circPAN3 may facilitate AML drug resistance through regulating autophagy and influencing expression of apoptosis-related proteins, while AMPK/mTOR signaling plays a key role in the regulation of circPAN3 on autophagy. These findings may provide new important insights into the role of circRNAs in mediating AML drug resistance, and suggest that circPAN3 might be a potential target for treatment of drug-resistance AML, which merits further investigation and validation.","['Shang, Jin', 'Chen, Wei-Min', 'Liu, Shan', 'Wang, Zhi-Hong', 'Wei, Tian-Nan', 'Chen, Zhi-Zhong', 'Wu, Wen-Bing']","['Shang J', 'Chen WM', 'Liu S', 'Wang ZH', 'Wei TN', 'Chen ZZ', 'Wu WB']",,"['Provincial Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Department of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, China.', 'Provincial Clinical Medical College of Fujian Medical University, Department of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Hospital, Fuzhou, Fujian 350001, China.

Blocking PD-1 and its ligand's pathways enhances antileukaemia responses by enabling T cells in murine models. We aimed to assess the addition of nivolumab to frontline therapy with idarubicin and cytarabine in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. METHODS: This single-arm, phase 2 part of the phase 1-2 study of nivolumab in combination with idarubicin and cytarabine was done at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA). Eligible patients were aged 18-60 years (or >60 years if suitable for intensive chemotherapy), and had newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Induction included cytarabine 1.5 g/m(2) by 24-h continuous infusion daily on days 1-4 (3 days in patients >60 years) and idarubicin 12 mg/m(2) daily on days 1-3. Nivolumab 3 mg/kg was started on day 24 (range 22-26) and continued every 2 weeks for up to a year in responders. Responders received either up to five consolidation cycles of attenuated doses of idarubicin and cytarabine, or allogeneic stem cell transplantation if eligible. The primary endpoint was event-free survival. Efficacy and safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment. Secondary endpoints were relapse-free survival and overall survival. This ongoing trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02464657. FINDINGS: Between Aug 7, 2015, and June 2, 2018, 44 patients were enrolled of whom 22 (50%) had adverse genetic risk by European Leukaemia Network classification. All patients were evaluable for safety and efficacy. At a median follow-up of 17.25 months (IQR 0.50-30.40), median event-free survival was not reached (95% CI 7.93-NR). Median relapse-free survival of responders was 18.54 months (95% CI 8.20-23.22). The median overall survival was 18.54 months (95% CI 10.81-28.81). Six patients had seven grade 3-4 immune-related adverse events with two cases of rash, two of colitis, and one each of transaminitis, pancreatitis, and cholecystitis. 19 (43%) of 44 patients achieved a response and proceeded to allogeneic stem cell transplantation, with grade 3-4 graft-versus-host disease observed in five (26%). No treatment related deaths were attributed to nivolumab. INTERPRETATION: Addition of nivolumab to induction chemotherapy with idarubicin and cytarabine is feasible in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome. Post-transplant severe graft-versus-host disease could be improved, and earlier initiation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy is warranted in future studies.

Predictors of thrombohemorrhagic early death (TH-ED)/early bleeding death are not well characterized. In this retrospective study, eleven baseline clinical variables that can be assessed easily and promptly were chosen for evaluation in a cohort of 364 patients with APL who were administered arsenic trioxide (ATO) alone as remission induction therapy. TH-ED was defined as death from bleeding or thrombosis within 30days after hospital admission. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for both the univariate and multivariate analyses. Totally, 53 patients died from severe bleeding (51 cases) or thrombosis (2 cases), and at 30days the cumulative incidences of TH-ED were 14.6%. Six independent risk factors for TH-ED were identified, including relapse, male, white blood cell (WBC) count above 10x10(9)/L, fibrinogen level below 1g/L, D-dimer level above 4mg/L and increased creatinine level. Increased creatinine level was the most powerful risk factor, followed by WBC count>10x10(9)/L.

The median age at HSCT was 44 years (range, 18 to 70 years). All 441 patients (100%) received TKI before HSCT (performed between 2005 and 2016). Of these 441 patients, 404 (92%) were in cytologic complete remission (CR), whereas the remaining 37 (8%) had active disease at the time of HSCT. Molecular minimal residual disease (MRD) was negative in 147 patients (36%) at the time of HSCT. The donor was unrelated in 46% of patients. The most prevalent source of stem cells was peripheral blood (70%). The conditioning regimen was myeloablative in 82% of cases (total body irradiation-based in 50%) and included antithymocyte globulin in 51% of patients. With a median follow-up after HSCT of 39.4 months (range, 1 to 145 months), the probability of overall survival (OS) at 1, 2, and 5 years was 69.6%, 61.1% and 50.3%, respectively, with a median OS of 62 months. Progression-free survival (PFS) at 1, 2, and 5 years was 60.2%, 52.1% and 43.7%, respectively. OS and PFS were significantly better in patients who were in CR and MRD-negative at the time of HSCT compared with patients who were in CR but MRD-positive (50% OS not reached versus 36 months; P=.015; 50% PFS not reached versus 26 months, P=.003). The subgroup of MRD-negative patients both at HSCT and at 3 months after HSCT had a better outcome (5-year OS, 70%). Conversely, the 37 patients who underwent a HSCT with active Ph(+) ALL had a median OS of 7 months and a median PFS of 5 months. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was significantly lower in MRD-negative patients (19.5% versus 35.4%; P=.001). Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) after 1, 2, and 5 years was 19.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 15.5% to 22.9%), 20.7% (95% CI, 17% to 24.7%), and 24.1% (95% CI, 20% to 28.5%), respectively. NRM was significantly lower with a modified European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (mEBMT) risk score of 0 to 2 compared with >/=3 (15% versus 25%; P = .016). The median OS for Ph(+) ALL patients who underwent a TKI-based treatment followed by an allogeneic HSCT, in recent years at the GITMO centers, was 62 months. Evaluation of the mEBMT risk score can be useful to predict NRM. Our data confirm that HSCT is a potentially curative treatment for Ph(+) ALL with an excellent outcome for the subgroup of MRD-negative patients both at HSCT and at 3 months after HSCT (5-year OS, 70%).","['Candoni, Anna', 'Rambaldi, Alessandro', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Velardi, Andrea', 'Arcese, William', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Lazzarotto, Davide', 'Lussana, Federico', 'Olivieri, Jacopo', 'Grillo, Giovanni', 'Parma, Matteo', 'Bruno, Benedetto', 'Sora, Federica', 'Bernasconi, Paolo', 'Saccardi, Riccardo', 'Foa, Robin', 'Sessa, Mariarosa', 'Bresciani, Paola', 'Giglio, Fabio', 'Picardi, Alessandra', 'Busca, Alessandro', 'Sica, Simona', 'Perruccio, Katia', 'Zucchetti, Elisa', 'Diral, Elisa', 'Iori, Anna Paola', 'Colombo, Anna Amelia', 'Tringali, Stefano', 'Santarone, Stella', 'Irrera, Giuseppe', 'Mancini, Stefano', 'Zallio, Francesco', 'Malagola, Michele', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Carella, Angelo Michele', 'Olivieri, Attilio', 'Tecchio, Cristina', 'Dominietto, Alida', 'Vacca, Adriana', 'Sorasio, Roberto', 'Orciuolo, Enrico', 'Risitano, Antonio Maria', 'Leotta, Salvatore', 'Cortelezzi, Agostino', 'Mammoliti, Sonia', 'Oldani, Elena', 'Bonifazi, Francesca']","['Candoni A', 'Rambaldi A', 'Fanin R', 'Velardi A', 'Arcese W', 'Ciceri F', 'Lazzarotto D', 'Lussana F', 'Olivieri J', 'Grillo G', 'Parma M', 'Bruno B', 'Sora F', 'Bernasconi P', 'Saccardi R', 'Foa R', 'Sessa M', 'Bresciani P', 'Giglio F', 'Picardi A', 'Busca A', 'Sica S', 'Perruccio K', 'Zucchetti E', 'Diral E', 'Iori AP', 'Colombo AA', 'Tringali S', 'Santarone S', 'Irrera G', 'Mancini S', 'Zallio F', 'Malagola M', 'Albano F', 'Carella AM', 'Olivieri A', 'Tecchio C', 'Dominietto A', 'Vacca A', 'Sorasio R', 'Orciuolo E', 'Risitano AM', 'Leotta S', 'Cortelezzi A', 'Mammoliti S', 'Oldani E', 'Bonifazi F']",,"['Hematology and SCT Unit, Universita di Udine, Azienda Sanitaria-Universitaria Integrata Santa Maria Misericordia, Udine, Italy.

METHODS: Dual-color fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe was used to detect MLL gene rearrangement in 68 children with AML by interphase FISH. The results were compared with that of conventional G banding chromosomal analysis. RESULTS: Among the 68 children, 28 were detected by FISH with positive hybridization signals, with a detection rate for MLL gene rearrangement being 41.2%. Twelve (17.6%) reciprocal translocations and interruption of 11q23 were detected by G banding analysis. The difference in the detection rates between the two methods was statistically significant (P< 0.05). CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of FISH assay for MLL gene rearrangement was significantly higher than that of G banding chromosomal karyotyping. Combined use of both methods for children with AML can improve the detection rate of MLL gene rearrangements and provide crucial clues for clinical diagnosis, treatment and prognosis.","['Li, Rui', 'Zhao, Ding', 'Wang, Meiye', 'Zhang, Zhenhua', 'Li, Linfei', 'Wang, Chaojie']","['Li R', 'Zhao D', 'Wang M', 'Zhang Z', 'Li L', 'Wang C']",,"[""Genetics Laboratory, Children' s Hospital Affiliated to Zhengzhou University, Henan Children' s Hospital, Zhengzhou Children' s Hospital, Zhengzhou, Henan 450018, China. zhaoding2004@163.com.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Child', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/*genetics', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic']",,,,2019/08/11 06:00,2019/09/26 06:00,['2019/08/11 06:00'],"['2019/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/26 06:00 [medline]']","['940636162 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2019.08.006 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Aug 10;36(8):777-780. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2019.08.006.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This modification is catalyzed by the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) family of histone methyltransferases including MLL1, MLL2, MLL3, MLL4, SET1A and SET1B. The catalytic activity of this family is dependent on interactions with additional conserved proteins, but the structural basis for subunit assembly and the mechanism of regulation is not well understood. We used a hybrid methods approach to study the assembly and biochemical function of the minimally active MLL1 complex (MLL1, WDR5 and RbBP5). A combination of small angle X-ray scattering, cross-linking mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and computational modeling were used to generate a dynamic ensemble model in which subunits are assembled via multiple weak interaction sites. We identified a new interaction site between the MLL1 SET domain and the WD40 beta-propeller domain of RbBP5, and demonstrate the susceptibility of the catalytic function of the complex to disruption of individual interaction sites.","['Kaustov, Lilia', 'Lemak, Alexander', 'Wu, Hong', 'Faini, Marco', 'Fan, Lixin', 'Fang, Xianyang', 'Zeng, Hong', 'Duan, Shili', 'Allali-Hassani, Abdellah', 'Li, Fengling', 'Wei, Yong', 'Vedadi, Masoud', 'Aebersold, Ruedi', 'Wang, Yunxing', 'Houliston, Scott', 'Arrowsmith, Cheryl H']","['Kaustov L', 'Lemak A', 'Wu H', 'Faini M', 'Fan L', 'Fang X', 'Zeng H', 'Duan S', 'Allali-Hassani A', 'Li F', 'Wei Y', 'Vedadi M', 'Aebersold R', 'Wang Y', 'Houliston S', 'Arrowsmith CH']",,"['Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Department of Anesthesia, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON M4N 3M5, Canada.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, ON M5G 2M9, Canada.', 'Structural Genomics Consortium, University of Toronto, 101 College Street, MaRS Centre, South Tower, Toronto, ON M5G 1L7, Canada.', 'Department of Biology, Institute of Molecular Systems Biology, ETH Zurich, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'The Small-Angel X-ray Scattering Core Facility, Center for Cancer Research of National Cancer Institute, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc.

To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying CLL risk we analyze chromatin accessibility, active regulatory elements marked by H3K27ac, and DNA methylation at 42 risk loci in up to 486 primary CLLs. We identify that risk loci are significantly enriched for active chromatin in CLL with evidence of being CLL-specific or differentially regulated in normal B-cell development. We then use in situ promoter capture Hi-C, in conjunction with gene expression data to reveal likely target genes of the risk loci. Candidate target genes are enriched for pathways related to B-cell development such as MYC and BCL2 signalling. At 14 loci the analysis highlights 63 variants as the probable functional basis of CLL risk. By integrating genetic and epigenetic information our analysis reveals novel insights into the relationship between inherited predisposition and the regulatory chromatin landscape of CLL.","['Speedy,

We screened a small-molecule library of 116 inhibitors targeting different targets of the cell cycle and discovered several kinases, including Cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) as vulnerabilities in CCA. Analysis of multiple CCA data sets demonstrated that CDK7 was overexpressed in CCA tissues. Further studies demonstrated that CDK7 inhibitor THZ1 inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis in CCA cells. We also showed that THZ1 inhibited CCA cell growth in a xenograft model. RNA-sequencing followed by Gene ontology analysis showed a striking impact of THZ1 on DNA-templated transcriptional programs. THZ1 downregulated CDK7-mediated phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II, indicative of transcriptional inhibition. A number of oncogenic transcription factors and survival proteins, like MCL1, FOSL1, and RUNX1, were repressed by THZ1. MCL1, one of the antiapoptotic BCL2 family members, was significantly inhibited upon THZ1 treatment. Accordingly, combining THZ1 with a BCL2/BCL-XL inhibitor ABT-263 synergized in impairing cell growth and driving apoptosis. Our results demonstrate CDK7 as a potential target in treating CCA. Combinations of CDK7 inhibition and BCL2/BCL-XL inhibition may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for CCA.","['Huang, Tianlu', 'Ding, Xiwei', 'Xu, Guifang', 'Chen, Gang', 'Cao, Yu', 'Peng, Chunyan', 'Shen, Shanshan', 'Lv, Ying', 'Wang, Lei', 'Zou, Xiaoping']","['Huang T', 'Ding X', 'Xu G', 'Chen G', 'Cao Y', 'Peng C', 'Shen S', 'Lv Y', 'Wang L', 'Zou X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8280-2538'],"['Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, Jiangsu, China.', 'Division of Hepatobiliary Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, 325000, Zhejiang, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, Jiangsu, China.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, Jiangsu, China. 867152094@qq.com.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital, The Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, Nanjing, 210008, Jiangsu, China. zouxp@nju.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (THZ1 compound)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)', 'XKJ5VVK2WD (navitoclax)']",IM,,"['Aniline Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Phenylenediamines/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-X Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics']",PMC6688996,,,2019/08/11 06:00,2020/07/31 06:00,['2019/08/11 06:00'],"['2019/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-1831-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-1831-7 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Aug 9;10(8):602. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1831-7.,,20190809,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, in vivo data are limited and the molecular mechanism of autophagy regulators in the process of leukemogenesis is not completely understood. Here we show that Beclin-1 knockdown, but not Atg5 deletion in a murine CML model leads to a reduced leukemic burden and results in a significantly prolonged median survival of targeted mice. Further analyses of murine cell lines and primary patient material indicate that active BCR-ABL directly interacts with BECLIN-1 and phosphorylates its tyrosine residues 233 and 352, resulting in autophagy suppression. By using phosphorylation-deficient and phosphorylation-mimic mutants, we identify BCR-ABL induced BECLIN-1 phosphorylation as a crucial mechanism for BECLIN-1 complex formation: interaction analyses exhibit diminished binding of the positive autophagy regulators UVRAG, VPS15, ATG14 and VPS34 and enhanced binding of the negative regulator Rubicon to BCR-ABL-phosphorylated BECLIN-1.

Outcomes remain poor for T-ALL patients who have either primary resistance to standard-of-care chemotherapy or disease relapse. Notably, there are currently no targeted therapies available in T-ALL. This lack of next-generation therapies highlights the need for relevant preclinical disease modeling to identify and validate new targets and treatment approaches. Here, we adapted a spontaneously arising, genetically heterogeneous, thymic transplantation-based murine model of T-ALL, recapitulating key histopathological and genetic features of the human disease, to the preclinical testing of targeted and immune-directed therapies. Genetic engineering of the murine Notch1 locus aligned the spectrum of Notch1 mutations in the mouse model to that of human T-ALL and confirmed aberrant, recombination-activating gene (RAG)-mediated 5' Notch1 recombination events as the preferred pathway in murine T-ALL development. Testing of Notch1-targeting therapeutic antibodies demonstrated T-ALL sensitivity to different classes of Notch1 blockers based on Notch1 mutational status. In contrast, genetic ablation of Notch3 did not impact T-ALL development. The T-ALL model was further applied to the testing of immunotherapeutic agents in fully immunocompetent, syngeneic mice. In line with recent clinical experience in T-cell malignancies, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) blockade alone lacked anti-tumor activity against murine T-ALL tumors. Overall, the unique features of the spontaneous T-ALL model coupled with genetic manipulations and the application to therapeutic testing in immunocompetent backgrounds will be of great utility for the preclinical evaluation of novel therapies against T-ALL.","['Gao, Jie', 'Van Meter, Michael', 'Hernandez Lopez, Susana', 'Chen, Guoying', 'Huang, Ying', 'Ren, Shumei', 'Zhao, Qi', 'Rojas, Jose', 'Gurer, Cagan', 'Thurston, Gavin', 'Kuhnert, Frank']","['Gao J', 'Van Meter M', 'Hernandez Lopez S', 'Chen G', 'Huang Y', 'Ren S', 'Zhao Q', 'Rojas J', 'Gurer C', 'Thurston G', 'Kuhnert F']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4603-4225'],"['Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591, USA.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591, USA.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591, USA.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591, USA.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591, USA.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591, USA.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591, USA.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591, USA.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591, USA.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591, USA.', 'Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Tarrytown, New York, NY 10591, USA frank.kuhnert@regeneron.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Dis Model Mech,Disease models & mechanisms,101483332,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (B7-H1 Antigen)', '0 (Receptors, Notch)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/metabolism', 'B7-H1 Antigen/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Oncogenes', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Notch/*metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'Thymus Gland/transplantation']",PMC6765191,['NOTNLM'],"['*Immunotherapy', '*Notch1', '*PD-1 blockade', '*T-ALL', '*Targeted therapy']",2019/08/11 06:00,2020/05/23 06:00,['2019/08/11 06:00'],"['2019/06/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['dmm.040931 [pii]', '10.1242/dmm.040931 [doi]']",epublish,Dis Model Mech. 2019 Sep 16;12(9). pii: dmm.040931. doi: 10.1242/dmm.040931.,['(c) 2019.

We evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in adults with haematological malignancies receiving immunosuppressive cancer treatments. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled study, done at 77 centres worldwide, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients with haematological malignancies aged 18 years and older to receive two doses of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine or placebo 1-2 months apart during or after immunosuppressive cancer treatments, and stratified participants according to their underlying diseases. The co-primary objectives of the study were the evaluation of safety and reactogenicity of the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine compared with placebo from the first vaccination up to 30 days after last vaccination in all participants; evaluation of the proportion of participants with a vaccine response in terms of anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune response to the adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine at month 2 in all participants, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; and evaluation of the anti-glycoprotein E humoral immune responses to the vaccine compared with placebo at month 2 in all participants, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We assessed immunogenicity in the per-protocol cohort for immunogenicity and safety in the total vaccinated cohort. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01767467, and with the EU Clinical Trials Register, number 2012-003438-18. FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2013, and Sept 10, 2015, we randomly assigned 286 participants to adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine and 283 to placebo. 283 in the vaccine group and 279 in the placebo group were vaccinated. At month 2, 119 (80.4%, 95% CI 73.1-86.5) of 148 participants had a humoral vaccine response to adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine, compared with one (0.8%, 0.0-4.2) of 130 participants in the placebo group, and the adjusted geometric mean anti-glycoprotein E antibody concentration was 23 132.9 mIU/mL (95% CI 16 642.8-32 153.9) in the vaccine group and 777.6 mIU/mL (702.8-860.3) in the placebo group (adjusted geometric mean ratio 29.75, 21.09-41.96; p<0.0001) in all patients, excluding those with non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Humoral and cell-mediated immune responses persisted above baseline until month 13 in all strata and, as expected, vaccine was more reactogenic than placebo (within 7 days after vaccination pain was reported by 221 [79.5%] of 278 vaccine group participants and 45 [16.4%] of 274 placebo group participants; fatigue was reported by 162 [58.3%] of 278 vaccine group participants and 102 [37.2%] of 274 placebo group participants). Incidences of unsolicited or serious adverse events, potential immune-mediated diseases, disease-related events, and fatal serious adverse events were similar between the groups. INTERPRETATION: The immunocompromised adult population with haematological malignancies is at high risk for herpes zoster. The adjuvanted recombinant zoster vaccine, which is currently licensed in certain countries for adults aged 50 years and older, is likely to benefit this population.

However, the mode of action of JTE-607 remains unknown. In this study, we identified JTE-607 to be a prodrug compound that is converted to an active form by ester hydrolysis. Furthermore, we determined that the active form of JTE-607 bound cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor subunit 3 (CPSF3), using compound-immobilized affinity chromatography. CPSF3 is a 73-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor complex, which functions as an RNA endonuclease. The protein is involved in the 3'-end processing of messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) at the cleavage site located downstream of the poly(A) addition signal. We found that treatment with JTE-607 caused accumulation of pre-mRNAs. Furthermore, knockdown experiments showed that CPSF3 deficiency also caused accumulation of pre-mRNAs and suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines, like JTE-607. These findings indicated that CPSF3 is a direct target of JTE-607 and a new potential target for the treatment of disease-related abnormal cytokine production.","['Kakegawa, Junya', 'Sakane, Naoki', 'Suzuki, Kensuke', 'Yoshida, Takayuki']","['Kakegawa J', 'Sakane N', 'Suzuki K', 'Yoshida T']",,"['Pharmaceutical Frontier Research Laboratories, Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Japan Tobacco Inc., 1-13-2, Fukuura, Kanazawa-Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 236-0004, Japan.', 'Pharmaceutical Frontier Research Laboratories, Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Japan Tobacco Inc., 1-13-2, Fukuura, Kanazawa-Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 236-0004, Japan.', 'Pharmaceutical Frontier Research Laboratories, Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Japan Tobacco Inc., 1-13-2, Fukuura, Kanazawa-Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 236-0004, Japan.', 'Pharmaceutical Frontier Research Laboratories, Central Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Japan Tobacco Inc., 1-13-2, Fukuura, Kanazawa-Ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 236-0004, Japan.

Acknowledging a greater risk for developing HTLV-1 associated illnesses due to immunosuppression, screening is being widely considered in the transplantation setting. Herein, we report the experience with universal HTLV testing of donors and recipients of solid organ transplants in a survey conducted in Spain. METHODS: All hospitals belonging to the Spanish HTLV network were invited to participate in the study. Briefly, HTLV antibody screening was performed retrospectively in all specimens collected from solid organ donors and recipients attended since the year 2008. RESULTS: A total of 5751 individuals were tested for HTLV antibodies at 8 sites. Donors represented 2312 (42.2%), of whom 17 (0.3%) were living kidney donors. The remaining 3439 (59.8%) were recipients. Spaniards represented nearly 80%. Overall, 9 individuals (0.16%) were initially reactive for HTLV antibodies. Six were donors and 3 were recipients. Using confirmatory tests, HTLV-1 could be confirmed in only two donors, one Spaniard and another from Colombia. Both kidneys of the Spaniard were inadvertently transplanted. Subacute myelopathy developed within 1 year in one recipient. The second recipient seroconverted for HTLV-1 but the kidney had to be removed soon due to rejection. Immunosuppression was stopped and 3 years later the patient remains in dialysis but otherwise asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: The rate of HTLV-1 is low but not negligible in donors/recipients of solid organ transplants in Spain. Universal HTLV screening should be recommended in all donor and recipients of solid organ transplantation in Spain. Evidence is overwhelming for very high virus transmission and increased risk along with the rapid development of subacute myelopathy.","['de Mendoza, Carmen', 'Roc, Lourdes', 'Benito, Rafael', 'Reina,

31399043,NLM,MEDLINE,20200828,20200828,2051-1426 (Electronic) 2051-1426 (Linking),7,1,2019 Aug 10,Development of a new fusion-enhanced oncolytic immunotherapy platform based on herpes simplex virus type 1.,214,10.1186/s40425-019-0682-1 [doi],"BACKGROUND: Oncolytic viruses preferentially replicate in tumors as compared to normal tissue and promote immunogenic cell death and induction of host systemic anti-tumor immunity. HSV-1 was chosen for further development as an oncolytic immunotherapy in this study as it is highly lytic, infects human tumor cells broadly, kills mainly by necrosis and is a potent activator of both innate and adaptive immunity. HSV-1 also has a large capacity for the insertion of additional, potentially therapeutic, exogenous genes. Finally, HSV-1 has a proven safety and efficacy profile in patients with cancer, talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), an oncolytic HSV-1 which expresses GM-CSF, being the only oncolytic immunotherapy approach that has received FDA approval. As the clinical efficacy of oncolytic immunotherapy has been shown to be further enhanced by combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, developing improved oncolytic platforms which can synergize with other existing immunotherapies is a high priority. In this study we sought to further optimize HSV-1 based oncolytic immunotherapy through multiple approaches to maximize: (i) the extent of tumor cell killing, augmenting the release of tumor antigens and danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) factors; (ii) the immunogenicity of tumor cell death; and (iii) the resulting systemic anti-tumor immune response. METHODS: To sample the wide diversity amongst clinical strains of HSV-1, twenty nine new clinical strains isolated from cold sores from otherwise healthy volunteers were screened across a panel of human tumor cell lines to identify the strain with the most potent tumor cell killing ability, which was then used for further development. Following deletion of the genes encoding ICP34.5 and ICP47 to provide tumor selectivity, the extent of cell killing and the immunogenicity of cell death was enhanced through insertion of a gene encoding a truncated, constitutively highly fusogenic form of the envelope glycoprotein of gibbon ape leukemia virus (GALV-GP-R(-)). A number of further armed derivatives of this virus were then constructed intended to further enhance the anti-tumor immune response which was generated following fusion-enhanced, oncolytic virus replication-mediated cell death. These viruses expressed GMCSF, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody-like molecule, CD40L, OX40L and/or 4-1BB, each of which is expected to act predominantly at the site and time of immune response initiation. Expression of these proteins was confirmed by ELISA and/or western blotting. Immunogenic cell death was assessed by measuring the levels of HMGB1 and ATP from cell free supernatants from treated cells, and by measuring the surface expression of calreticulin. GALV-GP-R(-) mediated cell to cell fusion and killing was tested in a range of tumor cell lines in vitro. Finally, the in vivo therapeutic potential of these viruses was tested using human A549 (lung cancer) and MDA-MB-231(breast cancer) tumor nude mouse xenograft models and systemic anti-tumor effects tested using dual flank syngeneic 4434 (melanoma), A20 (lymphoma) mouse tumor models alone and in combination with a murine anti-PD1 antibody, and 9 L (gliosarcoma) tumors in rats. RESULTS: The twenty nine clinical strains of HSV-1 isolated and tested demonstrated a broad range of tumor cell killing abilities allowing the most potent strain to be identified which was then used for further development. Oncolytic ability was demonstrated to be further augmented by the expression of GALV-GP-R(-) in a range of tumor cell lines in vitro and in mouse xenograft models in nude mice. The expression of GALV-GP-R(-) was also demonstrated to lead to enhanced immunogenic cell death in vitro as confirmed by the increased release of HMGB1 and ATP and increased levels of calreticulin on the cell surface. Experiments using the rat 9 L syngeneic tumor model demonstrated that GALV-GP-R(-) expression increased abscopal uninjected (anenestic) tumor responses and data using mouse 4434 tumors demonstrated that virus treatment increased CD8+ T cell levels both in the injected and uninjected tumor, and also led to increased expression of PD-L1. A combination study using varying doses of a virus expressing GALV-GP-R(-) and mGM-CSF and an anti-murine PD1 antibody showed enhanced anti-tumor effects with the combination which was most evident at low virus doses, and also lead to immunological memory. Finally, treatment of mice with derivatives of this virus which additionally expressed anti-mCTLA-4, mCD40L, m4-1BBL, or mOX40L demonstrated enhanced activity, particularly in uninjected tumors. CONCLUSION: The new HSV-1 based platform described provides a potent and versatile approach to developing new oncolytic immunotherapies for clinical use. Each of the modifications employed was demonstrated to aid in optimizing the potential of the virus to both directly kill tumors and to lead to systemic therapeutic benefit. For clinical use, these viruses are expected to be most effective in combination with other anti-cancer agents, in particular PD1/L1-targeted immune checkpoint blockade. The first virus from this program (expressing GALV-GP-R(-) and hGM-CSF) has entered clinical development alone and in combination with anti-PD1 therapy in a number of tumor types (NCT03767348).","['Thomas, Suzanne', 'Kuncheria, Linta', 'Roulstone, Victoria', 'Kyula, Joan N', 'Mansfield, David', 'Bommareddy, Praveen K', 'Smith, Henry', 'Kaufman, Howard L', 'Harrington, Kevin J', 'Coffin, Robert S']","['Thomas S', 'Kuncheria L', 'Roulstone V', 'Kyula JN', 'Mansfield D', 'Bommareddy PK', 'Smith H', 'Kaufman HL', 'Harrington KJ', 'Coffin RS']",,"['Replimune Inc, 18 Commerce Way, Woburn, MA, 01801, USA.', 'Replimune Inc, 18 Commerce Way, Woburn, MA, 01801, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Replimune Inc, 18 Commerce Way, Woburn, MA, 01801, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Replimune Inc, 18 Commerce Way, Woburn, MA, 01801, USA.', 'Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK.', 'Replimune Inc, 18 Commerce Way, Woburn, MA, 01801, USA.

YS110 has an inhibitory activity against the CD26-positive tumor growth via the immunological and direct pathway, such as intra-nuclear transportation of CD26 and YS110, and suppressed transcription of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) subunit POLR2A. The ADC conjugated with YS110 and an antitumor compound triptolide (TR-1), which is an inhibitor for TFIIH, one of the general transcription factors for Pol II was developed. YS110 and triptolide were crosslinked by the heterobifunctional linker succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) and designated Y-TR1. Antitumor efficacy of Y-TR1 against malignant mesothelioma and leukemia cell lines were assessed by the in vitro cell viability assay and in vivo assay using xenografted mouse models. Y-TR1 showed significant cytotoxicity against CD26-positive cell lines but not CD26-negative counterparts in a dose-dependent manner via suppression of mRNA synthesis by impairment of the Pol II activity. The tumors in xenografted mice administered Y-TR1 was smaller than that of the unconjugated YS110 treated mice without severe toxicity. In conclusion, the novel compound Y-TR1 showed antitumor properties against CD26-positive cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo without toxicity. The Y-TR1 is a unique antitumor ADC and functions against Pol II.","['Hayashi, Mutsumi', 'Madokoro, Hiroko', 'Yamada, Koji', 'Nishida, Hiroko', 'Morimoto, Chikao', 'Sakamoto, Michiie', 'Yanagawa, Hiroshi', 'Yamada, Taketo']","['Hayashi M', 'Madokoro H', 'Yamada K', 'Nishida H', 'Morimoto C', 'Sakamoto M', 'Yanagawa H', 'Yamada T']",,"['Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry, The Jikei University School of Medicine, 3-25-8 Nishi-Shimbashi, Minato-ku, Tokyo 105-8461, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Therapy Development and Innovation for Immune Disorders and Cancers, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-1-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan.', 'Department of Fundamental Science and Technology, Keio University School of Science and Technology, 3-14-1 Hiyoshi, Kouhoku-ku, Yokohama City 233-8522, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'IDAC Theranostics Inc., 1-1-48 Suehirocho, Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama City 230-0045, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Keio University School of Medicine, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan. taketo@saitama-med.ac.jp.', 'Department of Pathology, Saitama Medical University, 38 Morohongo, Moroyama-machi, Saitama 350-0495, Japan. taketo@saitama-med.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,,PMC6721810,['NOTNLM'],"['CD26', 'RNA polymerase II', 'antibody drug conjugate', 'malignant mesothelioma', 'targeted therapy', 'triptolide']",2019/08/11 06:00,2019/08/11 06:01,['2019/08/11 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/11 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11081138 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11081138 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Aug 8;11(8). pii: cancers11081138. doi: 10.3390/cancers11081138.,,20190808,,"['07-17/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology', '23390086/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology', '16H04714/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology', '22790355/Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology', 'H24-B10-003/Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan', 'H27-150401-01/Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare of Japan']",['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a growing body of evidence that caspase family also plays a role in cellular differentiation. Evidence suggests that caspase-9 is among the most important members with non-apoptotic roles in the execution of differentiation. Since drug-induced differentiation in some types of cancer cells is a promising treatment, we have investigated caspase-9 activity during differentiation of a cancer cell; leukemia. We demonstrate that caspase-9 has increased activity during differentiation and also the inhibition of caspase-9 will prevent the granulocytic differentiation of leukemic cells. In addition, we studied the differentiation induction mediated by caspase-9 using an inducible variant of caspase-9. Results indicate the caspase-9 mediated differentiation accompanied by a reduction in the expression of CD33 and an increase in CD15. Notably, all of the events occur when cell viability remains constant. Owing to the evidence, caspase-9 activity is considered as a central factor in the execution of differentiation in leukemic cells.","['Madadi, Zahra', 'Akbari-Birgani, Shiva', 'Monfared, Parviz Davoodi', 'Mohammadi, Saeed']","['Madadi Z', 'Akbari-Birgani S', 'Monfared PD', 'Mohammadi S']",,"['Department of Biological Sciences, Institute for Advanced Studies in Basic Sciences (IASBS), Zanjan 45137-66731, Iran.

We found higher alpha-diversity in the tumor microbiome of LTS patients and identified an intra-tumoral microbiome signature (Pseudoxanthomonas-Streptomyces-Saccharopolyspora-Bacillus clausii) highly predictive of long-term survivorship in both discovery and validation cohorts. Through human-into-mice fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments from STS, LTS, or control donors, we were able to differentially modulate the tumor microbiome and affect tumor growth as well as tumor immune infiltration.

Because the complexity of the aldosterone response is still not fully appreciated, we aimed at identifying new elements in this pathway. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of the proto-oncogene PIM3 (Proviral Integration Site of Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus 3), a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the calcium/calmodulin-regulated group of kinases, is stimulated by aldosterone in vitro (mCCDcl1 cells), ex vivo (mouse kidney slices), and in vivo in mice. Characterizing a germline Pim3(-) (/) (-) mouse model, we found that these mice have an upregulated Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS), with high circulating aldosterone and plasma renin activity levels on both standard or Na(+) -deficient diet. Surprisingly, we did not observe any obvious salt-losing phenotype in Pim3 KO mice as shown by normal blood pressure, plasma and urinary electrolytes, as well as unchanged expression levels of the major Na(+) transport proteins. These observations suggest that the potential effects of the loss of the Pim3 gene are physiologically compensated. Indeed, the 2 other family members of the PIM kinase family, PIM1 and PIM2 are upregulated in the kidney of Pim3(-) (/) (-) mice, and may therefore be involved in such compensation. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the PIM3 kinase is a novel aldosterone-induced protein, but its precise role in aldosterone-dependent renal homeostasis remains to be determined.","['Spirli, Alessia', 'Cheval, Lydie', 'Debonneville, Anne', 'Penton, David', 'Ronzaud, Caroline', 'Maillard, Marc', 'Doucet, Alain', 'Loffing, Johannes', 'Staub, Olivier']","['Spirli A', 'Cheval L', 'Debonneville A', 'Penton D', 'Ronzaud C', 'Maillard M', 'Doucet A', 'Loffing J', 'Staub O']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1799-9784'],"['Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'National Centre of Competence in Research ""Kidney.ch"", Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM, Sorbonne Universites, USPC, Universite Paris Descartes, Universite Paris Diderot, Physiologie Renale et Tubulopathies, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'National Centre of Competence in Research ""Kidney.ch"", Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'National Centre of Competence in Research ""Kidney.ch"", Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Anatomy, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'National Centre of Competence in Research ""Kidney.ch"", Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Service of Nephrology, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, INSERM, Sorbonne Universites, USPC, Universite Paris Descartes, Universite Paris Diderot, Physiologie Renale et Tubulopathies, Paris, France.', 'National Centre of Competence in Research ""Kidney.ch"", Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'Institute of Anatomy, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Pharmacology & Toxicology, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland.', 'National Centre of Competence in Research ""Kidney.ch"", Lausanne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Physiol Rep,Physiological reports,101607800,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '4964P6T9RB (Aldosterone)', '9NEZ333N27 (Sodium)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases)']",IM,,"['Aldosterone/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Kidney/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Nephrons/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Phenotype', 'Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases/*metabolism', 'Sodium/metabolism', 'Transcription Factors/genetics']",PMC6687858,['NOTNLM'],"['*Blood pressure', '*blood volume', '*kidney', '*steroid hormone']",2019/08/10 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/05/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.14814/phy2.14177 [doi]'],ppublish,Physiol Rep. 2019 Aug;7(15):e14177. doi: 10.14814/phy2.14177.,"['(c) 2019 The Authors.

One natural recombinant ALV strain, designated as HB2015032, was isolated from indigenous chickens with neoplastic diseases in Hubei, China. The complete proviral genome of HB2015032 is 7703 bp in length. Sequence analysis showed that the Env of HB2015032 exhibited 99.3% similarity with that of a ALV subgroup K (ALV-K) isolate JS11C1 at amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both gp85 and gp37 of HB2015032 were clustered in the same branch with JS11C1 and other ALV-K strains isolated from Chinese indigenous chickens in recent years. However, the pol gene, the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), and the 3' long terminal repeat (3' LTR) of HB2015032 were more closely related to ALV-J prototype HPRS-103, and clustered in the same branch with ALV-J strains. Furthermore, the pol gene of HB2015032 contained a premature stop codon that resulted in a truncated Pol protein with 22 amino acid residues missing, which was a unique feature of the pol gene of ALV-J. 3'UTR of HB2015032 containing entire DR1, E element and U3. E element of HB2015032 contained one base deletion, which resulted in a c-Ets-1 binding site. In addition, U3 region of HB2015032 contains most of the transcription regulatory elements of ALV-J, including two CAAT boxes, Y boxes, CArG boxes, PRE boxes, NFAP-1 boxes, and one TATA box. These results suggest that isolate HB2015032 was a novel recombinant ALV-K containing the ALV-K env gene and the ALV-J backbone and exhibiting high pathogenicity.","['Liang, Xiongyan', 'Gu, Yufang', 'Chen, Xueyang', 'Li, Tuofan', 'Gao, Yulong', 'Wang, Xiaomei', 'Fang, Chun', 'Fang, Shouguo', 'Yang, Yuying']","['Liang X', 'Gu Y', 'Chen X', 'Li T', 'Gao Y', 'Wang X', 'Fang C', 'Fang S', 'Yang Y']",,"['School of Animal Science, Yangtze University, No.88, Jingmi Road, Jingzhou, 434025, China.', 'School of Animal Science, Yangtze University, No.88, Jingmi Road, Jingzhou, 434025, China.', 'School of Animal Science, Yangtze University, No.88, Jingmi Road, Jingzhou, 434025, China.', 'School of Animal Science, Yangtze University, No.88, Jingmi Road, Jingzhou, 434025, China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, No. 678, Haping Road, Harbin, China.', 'Division of Avian Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, No. 678, Haping Road, Harbin, China.', 'School of Animal Science, Yangtze University, No.88, Jingmi Road, Jingzhou, 434025, China.', 'School of Animal Science, Yangtze University, No.88, Jingmi Road, Jingzhou, 434025, China.', 'School of Animal Science, Yangtze University, No.88, Jingmi Road, Jingzhou, 434025, China. yangyycn@yangtzeu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Virus Genes,Virus genes,8803967,['0 (Viral Proteins)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Avian Leukosis/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/*classification/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Chickens', 'China', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Phylogeny', 'Poultry Diseases/*virology', '*Recombination, Genetic', 'Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Sequence Homology, Amino Acid', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ALV-J', 'ALV-K', 'Avian leukosis virus', 'Recombinant']",2019/08/10 06:00,2020/01/11 06:00,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11262-019-01695-7 [doi]', '10.1007/s11262-019-01695-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Virus Genes. 2019 Oct;55(5):726-733. doi: 10.1007/s11262-019-01695-7.

Thirty-four patients previously diagnosed with TN-PMF (n = 14), MDS-F (n = 18), or MDS/MPN-F (n = 2) were included in the present study. After central revision of the bone marrow histology, diagnoses according to the 2016-WHO classification were TN-PMF (n = 6), MDS-F (n = 19), and MDS/MPN-F (n = 9), with TN-PMF genotype representing only 4% of a cohort of 141 molecularly annotated PMF. Genomic classification according to next-generation sequencing and cytogenetic study was performed in 28 cases. Median number of mutations was 4 (range 1-7) in cases with TP53 disruption/aneuploidy or with chromatin-spliceosome mutations versus 1 mutation (range 0-2) in other molecular subgroups (p < 0.0001). The number of mutations and the molecular classification were better than PMF and MDS conventional scoring systems to predict survival and progression to acute leukemia. In conclusion, TN-PMF is an uncommon entity when the 2016 WHO criteria are strictly applied.

One of the limits of this approach has been in the past the paucity of AML markers suitable for MRD assessment. Recently, the number of biomarkers has increased, due to the identification of highly specific leukemia-associated immunophenotypes by multicolor flow-cytometry, and of rare mutated gene sequences by digital droplet PCR, or next-generation sequencing (NGS). In addition, NGS allowed unraveling of clonal heterogeneity, present in AML at initial diagnosis or developing during treatment, which influences reliability of specific biomarkers, that may be unstable during the disease course. The technological advances have increased the application of MRD-based strategies to a significantly higher number of AML patients, and the information deriving from MRD assessment has been used to design individual post-remission protocols and pre-emptive treatments in patients with sub-clinical relapse. This led to the definition of MRD-negative complete remission as outcome definition in the recently published European Leukemianet MRD guidelines. In this review, we summarized the principles of modern technologies and their clinical applications for MRD detection in AML patients, according to the specific leukemic markers.","['Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Ottone, Tiziana', 'Lavorgna, Serena', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Buccisano, Francesco']","['Voso MT', 'Ottone T', 'Lavorgna S', 'Venditti A', 'Maurillo L', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Buccisano F']",,"['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy.', 'Santa Lucia Foundation, IRCCS, Neuro-Oncohematology, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy.', 'Santa Lucia Foundation, IRCCS, Neuro-Oncohematology, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,,PMC6664148,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'MRD', 'NGS', 'digital droplet PCR', 'multiparametric flow-cytometry']",2019/08/10 06:00,2019/08/10 06:01,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/01/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00655 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Jul 23;9:655. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00655. eCollection 2019.,,20190723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aim of the Study: We planned this case-control study based on numerous studies supporting the association of MTHFR polymorphisms (C677T and A1298C) with CML risk in different ethnic populations. Therefore, the influence of these polymorphisms on CML susceptibility was investigated among Kashmiri population (North India). Materials and Methods: Polymerase chain reaction/restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique was employed for genotyping MTHFR C677T and A1298C SNP's in 125 CML patients as against 150 age and gender matched healthy controls. Results: A significant difference was observed in frequency of 677CT genotype between cases and controls [46.4 vs. 27.3% (p = 0.0005)]. Similarly combined 677CT+TT genotype showed significant difference between cases and controls [50.4 vs. 28.6% (p = 0.0002)]. Both MTHFR 677CT and 677CT+TT genotypes imposed greater than 2-fold risk of developing CML (OR = 2.4, 95%CI: 1.46-4.05; OR = 2.5, 95%CI: 1.53-4.16). In case of A1298C SNP, the frequency of 1298AC genotype was higher in controls (64.0%) as compared to CML cases (48.8%) (p = 0.04) and imparted a significant protective role from CML predisposition. Furthermore, haplotype analysis revealed only ""677CT/1298AA"" haplotype significantly increased the risk of CML predisposition [(p = 0.008) (OR = 3.2, 95% CI: 1.3-7.4)]. Conclusion: We conclude that both MTHFR C677T and A1298C polymorphisms may be important genetic modifiers and seem to have a plausible role to confer risk of CML in Kashmiri population, where C677T SNP strongly increases the risk of CML while as A1298C SNP has a protective effect.","['Baba, Shahid M', 'Shah, Zafar A', 'Javaid, Khushboo', 'Pandith, Arshad A', 'Rasool, Javeed', 'Geelani, Sajad A', 'Baba, Rafia A', 'Amin, Shajrul', 'Mohammad, Gul']","['Baba SM', 'Shah ZA', 'Javaid K', 'Pandith AA', 'Rasool J', 'Geelani SA', 'Baba RA', 'Amin S', 'Mohammad G']",,"['Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Kashmir, Srinagar, India.', 'Advanced Centre for Human Genetics, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Immunology and Molecular Medicine, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Kashmir, Srinagar, India.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Srinagar, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,,PMC6667548,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR-ABL', 'CML', 'India', 'Kashmir', 'MTHFR', 'PCR', 'RFLP']",2019/08/10 06:00,2019/08/10 06:01,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00612 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Jul 24;9:612. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00612. eCollection 2019.,,20190724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, little is known about the association of maternal folic acid intake with the occurrence of childhood cancer. Hence, this study aimed to determine the effects of maternal folic acid consumption on the risk of childhood cancer. Methods: A total of 158 related articles were obtained from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and ProQuest using standardized keywords, of which 17 were included in the final review. Results: Eleven of the 17 articles showed a significant protective association between maternal folic acid supplementation and childhood cancer. Using a random-effects model, pooled odds ratios (ORs) showed a protective association between maternal folic acid supplementation and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (OR, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.86). However, there was no significant association between maternal folic acid supplementation and acute myeloid leukaemia (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46 to 1.06) or childhood brain tumours (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.19). Conclusions: Maternal folic acid supplementation was found to have a protective effect against childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Thus, healthcare professionals are recommended to provide regular health education and health promotion to the community on the benefits of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy.","['Wan Ismail, Wan Rosmawati', 'Abdul Rahman, Raudah', 'Rahman, Nur Ashiqin Abd', 'Atil, Azman', 'Nawi, Azmawati Mohammed']","['Wan Ismail WR', 'Abdul Rahman R', 'Rahman NAA', 'Atil A', 'Nawi AM']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0214-0272', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0857-5549', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8371-2593', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0850-7992', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0009-5244']","['Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),J Prev Med Public Health,Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,101242972,,IM,,,PMC6686110,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood cancer', 'Folate', 'Maternal', 'Vitamin supplementation']",2019/08/10 06:00,2019/08/10 06:01,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:01 [medline]']","['10.3961/jpmph.19.020 [doi]', 'jpmph-52-4-205 [pii]']",ppublish,J Prev Med Public Health. 2019 Jul;52(4):205-213. doi: 10.3961/jpmph.19.020.

The intrinsic correlation between CMML and autoimmune diseases can create significant pitfalls in differential diagnosis. CMML occasionally presents with clinical and histopathological manifestations that are similar to those of Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD), a newly recognized systemic autoimmune disorder. Both CMML and IgG4-RD can have significant overlaps due to the common nature of these systemic disorders, especially when atypical clinical phenotypes are present. It is significant for physicians to accurately distinguish CMML and IgG4-RD because the therapy modalities could differ extremely between the two entities. Here we present a unique case of a 70-year-old female who had a condition that mimicked the onset of IgG4-RD not only in terms of clinical manifestations but also in serology and histopathology analyses. Following a series of rigorous examinations, this patient was ultimately diagnosed as having CMML. Herein, we discuss the aspects of IgG4-RD's differential diagnosis and the need for careful comparison of clinical and laboratory features as well as consideration of the pathogenesis of both IgG4-RD and CMML. We also stress a concept that the presence of autoimmune conditions cannot be the sole basis to exclude diagnosis of CMML, as these disorders can appear concomitantly.","['Bai, Zhiqian', 'Chen, Yuxue', 'Chen, Xiaoqi', 'Dong, Lingli']","['Bai Z', 'Chen Y', 'Chen X', 'Dong L']",,"['Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Wuhan 430022, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Zhongnan Hospital Affiliated to Wuhan University Wuhan 430071, China.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Immunology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Wuhan 430022, China.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,,,PMC6684895,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CCML)', 'IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD)', 'autoimmune diseases (AIDs)', 'malignancy']",2019/08/10 06:00,2019/08/10 06:01,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2019 Jul 15;11(7):4561-4567. eCollection 2019.,,20190715,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional treatment with Retinoic acid and chemotherapeutics is quite satisfactory. However, there are still patients who relapse or develop resistance to conventional treatment. To propose new possibilities for acute leukemia treatment, we studied the potential of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor and histone methyl transferase (HMT) inhibitor to enhance conventional therapy in vitro and ex vivo. NB4 and HL60 cell lines were used as an in vitro model; APL patient bone marrow mononuclear cells were used as an ex vivo model. Cell samples were treated with Belinostat (HDAC inhibitor) and 3-Deazaneplanocin A (HMT inhibitor) in combination with conventional treatment (Retinoic acid and Idarubicin). We demonstrated that the combined treatment used in the study had slightly higher effect on cell proliferation inhibition than conventional treatment. Also, enhanced treatment showed stronger effect on induction of apoptosis and on suppression of metabolism. Moreover, the treatment accelerated granulocytic cell differentiation and caused chromatin remodelling (increased H3K14 and H4 acetylation levels). In vitro and ex vivo models showed similar response to the treatment with different combinations of 3-Deazaneplanocin A, Belinostat, Retinoic acid, and Idarubicin. In conclusion, we suggest that 3-Deazaneplanocin A and Belinostat enhanced conventional acute promyelocytic leukemia treatment and could be considered for further investigations for clinical use.","['Vitkeviciene, Aida', 'Skiauteryte, Giedre', 'Zucenka, Andrius', 'Stoskus, Mindaugas', 'Gineikiene, Egle', 'Borutinskaite, Veronika', 'Griskevicius, Laimonas', 'Navakauskiene, Ruta']","['Vitkeviciene A', 'Skiauteryte G', 'Zucenka A', 'Stoskus M', 'Gineikiene E', 'Borutinskaite V', 'Griskevicius L', 'Navakauskiene R']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9347-5333', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6077-0136', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1077-9439']","['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Sauletekio Av. 7, LT-01257 Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Sauletekio Av. 7, LT-01257 Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Transfusion Medicine Centre, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu Str. 2, LT-08661 Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Transfusion Medicine Centre, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu Str. 2, LT-08661 Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Transfusion Medicine Centre, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu Str. 2, LT-08661 Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Sauletekio Av. 7, LT-01257 Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Transfusion Medicine Centre, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu Str. 2, LT-08661 Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Hematology, Oncology, and Transfusion Medicine Centre, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Santariskiu Str. 2, LT-08661 Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,J Oncol,Journal of oncology,101496537,,,,,PMC6668531,,,2019/08/10 06:00,2019/08/10 06:01,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/6179573 [doi]'],epublish,J Oncol. 2019 Jul 18;2019:6179573. doi: 10.1155/2019/6179573. eCollection 2019.,,20190718,,,"['The authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest regarding the', 'publication of this article.']",,,,,,['J Oncol. 2020 Sep 4;2020:1834190.

Moreover, endogenous glucocorticoids link the endocrine and immune system and ensure the correct function of inflammatory events during tissue repair, regeneration, and pathogen elimination via genomic and rapid non-genomic pathways. Due to their strong immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory and anti-allergic effects on immune cells, tissues and organs, glucocorticoids significantly improve the quality of life of many patients suffering from diseases caused by a dysregulated immune system. Despite the multitude and seriousness of glucocorticoid-related adverse events including diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis and infections, these agents remain indispensable, representing the most powerful, and cost-effective drugs in the treatment of a wide range of rheumatic diseases. These include rheumatoid arthritis, vasculitis, and connective tissue diseases, as well as many other pathological conditions of the immune system. Depending on the therapeutically affected cell type, glucocorticoid actions strongly vary among different diseases. While immune responses always represent complex reactions involving different cells and cellular processes, specific immune cell populations with key responsibilities driving the pathological mechanisms can be identified for certain autoimmune diseases. In this review, we will focus on the mechanisms of action of glucocorticoids on various leukocyte populations, exemplarily portraying different autoimmune diseases as heterogeneous targets of glucocorticoid actions: (i) Abnormalities in the innate immune response play a crucial role in the initiation and perpetuation of giant cell arteritis (GCA). (ii) Specific types of CD4+ T helper (Th) lymphocytes, namely Th1 and Th17 cells, represent important players in the establishment and course of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), whereas (iii) B cells have emerged as central players in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). (iv) Allergic reactions are mainly triggered by several different cytokines released by activated Th2 lymphocytes. Using these examples, we aim to illustrate the versatile modulating effects of glucocorticoids on the immune system. In contrast, in the treatment of lymphoproliferative disorders the pro-apoptotic action of glucocorticoids prevails, but their mechanisms differ depending on the type of cancer. Therefore, we will also give a brief insight into the current knowledge of the mode of glucocorticoid action in oncological treatment focusing on leukemia.","['Strehl, Cindy', 'Ehlers, Lisa', 'Gaber, Timo', 'Buttgereit, Frank']","['Strehl C', 'Ehlers L', 'Gaber T', 'Buttgereit F']",,"['Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Rheumatism Research Centre (DRFZ) Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Rheumatism Research Centre (DRFZ) Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Rheumatism Research Centre (DRFZ) Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Rheumatology and Clinical Immunology, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany.', 'German Rheumatism Research Centre (DRFZ) Berlin, Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,['0 (Glucocorticoids)'],IM,,"['Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*immunology/pathology', 'Giant Cell Arteritis/*immunology/pathology', 'Glucocorticoids/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*immunology/pathology', 'Th1 Cells/*immunology/pathology', 'Th17 Cells/*immunology/pathology']",PMC6667663,['NOTNLM'],"['*allergic diseases', '*giant cell arteritis', '*glucocorticoids', '*immune system', '*inflammation', '*leukemia', '*rheumatoid arthritis', '*systemic lupus erythematosus']",2019/08/10 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01744 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jul 24;10:1744. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01744. eCollection 2019.,,20190724,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The selective pressures shaping its mutational spectrum, dominated by missense mutations, are enigmatic, and neomorphic gain-of-function (GOF) activities have been implicated. We used CRISPR-Cas9 to generate isogenic human leukemia cell lines of the most common TP53 missense mutations. Functional, DNA-binding, and transcriptional analyses revealed loss of function but no GOF effects. Comprehensive mutational scanning of p53 single-amino acid variants demonstrated that missense variants in the DNA-binding domain exert a dominant-negative effect (DNE). In mice, the DNE of p53 missense variants confers a selective advantage to hematopoietic cells on DNA damage. Analysis of clinical outcomes in patients with acute myeloid leukemia showed no evidence of GOF for TP53 missense mutations. Thus, a DNE is the primary unit of selection for TP53 missense mutations in myeloid malignancies.","['Boettcher, Steffen', 'Miller, Peter G', 'Sharma, Rohan', 'McConkey, Marie', 'Leventhal, Matthew',

Crystal structures of Src modules kinases provide valuable insights into the regulatory mechanisms that control activation and generate a framework from which drug discovery can advance. The conformational ensembles visited by these multidomain kinases in solution are also key features of the regulatory machinery controlling catalytic activity. Measurement of dynamic motions within kinases substantially augments information derived from crystal structures. In this review, we focus on a body of work that has transformed our understanding of non-receptor tyrosine kinase regulation from a static view to one that incorporates how fluctuations in conformational ensembles and dynamic motions influence activation status. Regulatory dynamic networks are often shared across and between kinase families while specific dynamic behavior distinguishes unique regulatory mechanisms for select kinases. Moreover, intrinsically dynamic regions of kinases likely play important regulatory roles that have only been partially explored. Since there is clear precedence that kinase inhibitors can exploit specific dynamic features, continued efforts to define conformational ensembles and dynamic allostery will be key to combating drug resistance and devising alternate treatments for kinase-associated diseases.","['Amatya, Neha', 'Lin, David Yin-Wei', 'Andreotti, Amy H']","['Amatya N', 'Lin DY', 'Andreotti AH']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6952-7244'],"['Roy J.

Immunohistochemical staining of bone marrow biopsies from most of these patients revealed aberrant expression of BCL6, a transcription factor that promotes oncogenic B-cell transformation and drug resistance in B-ALL. Our genetic and ChIP-seq (chromatin immunoprecipitation [ChIP] combined with high-throughput sequencing) analyses showed that MLL-AF4 and MLL-ENL fusions directly bound to the BCL6 promoter and up-regulated BCL6 expression. While oncogenic MLL fusions strongly induced aberrant BCL6 expression in B-ALL cells, germline MLL was required to up-regulate Bcl6 in response to physiological stimuli during normal B-cell development. Inducible expression of Bcl6 increased MLL mRNA levels, which was reversed by genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of Bcl6, suggesting a positive feedback loop between MLL and BCL6. Highlighting the central role of BCL6 in MLL-rearranged B-ALL, conditional deletion and pharmacological inhibition of BCL6 compromised leukemogenesis in transplant recipient mice and restored sensitivity to vincristine chemotherapy in MLL-rearranged B-ALL patient samples. Oncogenic MLL fusions strongly induced transcriptional activation of the proapoptotic BH3-only molecule BIM, while BCL6 was required to curb MLL-induced expression of BIM. Notably, peptide (RI-BPI) and small molecule (FX1) BCL6 inhibitors derepressed BIM and synergized with the BH3-mimetic ABT-199 in eradicating MLL-rearranged B-ALL cells. These findings uncover MLL-dependent transcriptional activation of BCL6 as a previously unrecognized requirement of malignant transformation by oncogenic MLL fusions and identified BCL6 as a novel target for the treatment of MLL-rearranged B-ALL.","['Hurtz, Christian', 'Chan, Lai N', 'Geng, Huimin', 'Ballabio, Erica', 'Xiao, Gang', 'Deb, Gauri', 'Khoury, Haytham', 'Chen, Chun-Wei', 'Armstrong, Scott A', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Ernst, Patricia', 'Melnick, Ari', 'Milne, Thomas', 'Muschen, Markus']","['Hurtz C', 'Chan LN', 'Geng H', 'Ballabio E', 'Xiao G', 'Deb G', 'Khoury H', 'Chen CW', 'Armstrong SA', 'Chen J', 'Ernst P', 'Melnick A', 'Milne T', 'Muschen M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0413-4271'],"['Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Monrovia, California 91016, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Monrovia, California 91016, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Monrovia, California 91016, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Medical Research Council (MRC) Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Monrovia, California 91016, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Monrovia, California 91016, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Monrovia, California 91016, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Monrovia, California 91016, USA.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Monrovia, California 91016, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado, Denver, Colorado 80045, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York 10065, USA.', 'Medical Research Council (MRC) Molecular Haematology Unit, Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford OX3 9DS, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Systems Biology, City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Monrovia, California 91016, USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, California 94143, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,"['0 (BCL6 protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Cell Survival/genetics', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Gene Deletion', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Targeting', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology', 'Prognosis', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6/*genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6719625,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cells', '*BCL6', '*BIM', '*MLL']",2019/08/10 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['gad.327593.119 [pii]', '10.1101/gad.327593.119 [doi]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 2019 Sep 1;33(17-18):1265-1279. doi: 10.1101/gad.327593.119.

To gain insight into the familial risk for the different hematological malignancies and their possible inter-relationship, we analyzed data on more than 16 million individuals from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. After identifying 153 115 patients diagnosed with a primary hematological malignancy, we quantified familial relative risks (FRRs) by calculating standardized incident ratios (SIRs) in 391 131 of their first-degree relatives. The majority of hematological malignancies showed increased FRRs for the same tumor type, with the highest FRRs being observed for mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR, 16.7), lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (SIR, 15.8), and mantle cell lymphoma (SIR, 13.3). There was evidence for pleiotropic relationships; notably, chronic lymphocytic leukemia was associated with an elevated familial risk for other B-cell tumors and myeloproliferative neoplasms. Collectively, these data provide evidence for shared etiological factors for many hematological malignancies and provide information for identifying individuals at increased risk, as well as informing future gene discovery initiatives.","['Sud, Amit', 'Chattopadhyay, Subhayan', 'Thomsen, Hauke', 'Sundquist, Kristina', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Houlston, Richard S', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Sud A', 'Chattopadhyay S', 'Thomsen H', 'Sundquist K', 'Sundquist J', 'Houlston RS', 'Hemminki K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6133-0164', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8599-2971', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5951-3116', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5268-0242']","['Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Faculty of Medicine, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Center for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education, Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan; and.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Center for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education, Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan; and.', 'Division of Genetics and Epidemiology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular Pathology, The Institute of Cancer Research, London, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Databases, Factual', '*Family', 'Female', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease/*epidemiology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'Sweden/epidemiology']",PMC6789511,,,2019/08/10 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/01/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)71415-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019001362 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Sep 19;134(12):960-969. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019001362.

Thus, defining mechanisms underlying MLL-r ALL maintenance is critical for developing effective therapy. PRMT1, which deposits an asymmetric dimethylarginine mark on histone/non-histone proteins, is reportedly overexpressed in various cancers. Here, we demonstrate elevated PRMT1 levels in MLL-r ALL cells and show that inhibition of PRMT1 significantly suppresses leukemic cell growth and survival. Mechanistically, we reveal that PRMT1 methylates Fms-like receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) at arginine (R) residues 972 and 973 (R972/973), and its oncogenic function in MLL-r ALL cells is FLT3 methylation dependent. Both biochemistry and computational analysis demonstrate that R972/973 methylation could facilitate recruitment of adaptor proteins to FLT3 in a phospho-tyrosine (Y) residue 969 (Y969) dependent or independent manner. Cells expressing R972/973 methylation-deficient FLT3 exhibited more robust apoptosis and growth inhibition than did Y969 phosphorylation-deficient FLT3-transduced cells. We also show that the capacity of the type I PRMT inhibitor MS023 to inhibit leukemia cell viability parallels baseline FLT3 R972/973 methylation levels. Finally, combining FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitor PKC412 with MS023 treatment enhanced elimination of MLL-r ALL cells relative to PKC412 treatment alone in patient-derived mouse xenografts. These results indicate that abolishing FLT3 arginine methylation through PRMT1 inhibition represents a promising strategy to target MLL-r ALL cells.","['Zhu, Yinghui', 'He, Xin', 'Lin, Yi-Chun', 'Dong, Haojie', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Chen, Xianwei', 'Wang, Zhihao', 'Shen, Yudao', 'Li, Min', 'Wang, Hanying', 'Sun, Jie', 'Nguyen, Le Xuan', 'Zhang, Han', 'Jiang, Wenjuan', 'Yang, Yanzhong', 'Chen, Jianjun', 'Muschen, Markus', 'Chen, Chun-Wei', 'Konopleva, Marina Y', 'Sun, Weili', 'Jin, Jian', 'Carlesso, Nadia', 'Marcucci, Guido', 'Luo, Yun', 'Li, Ling']","['Zhu Y', 'He X', 'Lin YC', 'Dong H', 'Zhang L', 'Chen X', 'Wang Z', 'Shen Y', 'Li M', 'Wang H', 'Sun J', 'Nguyen LX', 'Zhang H', 'Jiang W', 'Yang Y', 'Chen J', 'Muschen M', 'Chen CW', 'Konopleva MY', 'Sun W', 'Jin J', 'Carlesso N', 'Marcucci G', 'Luo Y', 'Li L']",,"['Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Translational Biomarker Discovery Core.', 'Division of Stem Cell Biology Research, Department of Developmental and Stem Cell Biology, and.', 'Department of Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Mount Sinai Center for Therapeutics Discovery, Department of Pharmacological Sciences and Department of Oncological Sciences, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Department of Information Sciences, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Hematological Malignancies Translational Science, Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Hematologic Malignancies and Stem Cell Transplantation Institute, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA.', 'College of Pharmacy, Western University of Health Sciences, Pomona, CA.', 'Department of Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Department of Systems Biology and The Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Monrovia, CA.', 'Department of Systems Biology and The Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Monrovia, CA.', 'Department of Systems Biology and The Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Center, Monrovia, CA.', 'Department of Leukemia, Division of Cancer Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX;

After induction and consolidation, favorable-risk patients (FR) were to receive autologous stem cell transplant (AuSCT) and poor-risk patients (PR) allogeneic stem cell transplant (AlloSCT). Intermediate-risk patients (IR) were to receive AuSCT or AlloSCT depending on the postconsolidation levels of MRD. Three hundred sixty-one of 500 patients (72%) achieved a complete remission, 342/361 completed the consolidation phase and were treatment allocated: 165 (48%) to AlloSCT (122 PR, 43 IR MRD-positive) plus 23 rescued after salvage therapy, for a total of 188 candidates; 150 (44%) to AuSCT (115 FR, 35 IR MRD-negative) plus 27 IR patients (8%) with no leukemia-associated phenotype, for a total of 177 candidates. Overall, 110/177 (62%) and 130/188 (71%) AuSCT or AlloSCT candidates received it, respectively. Two-year overall (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of the whole series was 56% and 54%, respectively. Two-year OS and DFS were 74% and 61% in the FR category, 42% and 45% in the PR category, 79% and 61% in the IR MRD-negative category, and 70% and 67% in the IR MRD-positive category. In conclusion, AuSCT may still have a role in FR and IR MRD-negative categories. In the IR MRD-positive category, AlloSCT prolongs OS and DFS to equal those of the FR category. Using all the available sources of stem cells, AlloSCT was delivered to 71% of the candidates.This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01452646 and EudraCT as #2010-023809-36.","['Venditti, Adriano', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Melillo, Lorella', 'Calafiore, Valeria', 'Cairoli, Roberto', 'de Fabritiis, Paolo', 'Storti, Gabriella', 'Salutari, Prassede', 'Lanza, Francesco', 'Martinelli, Giovanni', 'Luppi, Mario', 'Mazza, Patrizio', 'Martelli, Maria Paola', 'Cuneo, Antonio', 'Albano, Francesco', 'Fabbiano, Francesco', 'Tafuri, Agostino', 'Chierichini, Anna', 'Tieghi, Alessia', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola Stefano', 'Capelli, Debora', 'Foa, Robin', 'Alati, Caterina', 'La Sala, Edoardo', 'Fazi, Paola', 'Vignetti, Marco', 'Maurillo, Luca', 'Buccisano, Francesco', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Irno-Consalvo, Maria', 'Ottone, Tiziana', 'Lavorgna, Serena', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Arcese, William', 'Amadori, Sergio']","['Venditti A', 'Piciocchi A', 'Candoni A', 'Melillo L', 'Calafiore V', 'Cairoli R', 'de Fabritiis P', 'Storti G', 'Salutari P', 'Lanza F', 'Martinelli G', 'Luppi M', 'Mazza P', 'Martelli MP', 'Cuneo A', 'Albano F', 'Fabbiano F', 'Tafuri A', 'Chierichini A', 'Tieghi A', 'Fracchiolla NS', 'Capelli D', 'Foa R', 'Alati C', 'La Sala E', 'Fazi P', 'Vignetti M', 'Maurillo L', 'Buccisano F', 'Del Principe MI', 'Irno-Consalvo M', 'Ottone T', 'Lavorgna S', 'Voso MT', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Arcese W', 'Amadori S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0245-0553', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8648-885X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7926-6052', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1278-604X', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4320-9253', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1936-3592', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6164-4761']","['Hematology, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Fondazione Policlinico Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'GIMEMA Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata di Udine, Udine, Italy.', 'Fondazione IRCCS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza, UO di Ematologia, San Giovanni Rotondo (FG), Italy.', 'Ospedale Ferrarotto, Catania, Italy.', 'Ospedale Niguarda Ca Granda, Milan, Italy.', 'Ospedale S.

Germline mutations of human PHF6 cause Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, a congenital neurodevelopmental disorder. Loss-of-function mutations of PHF6 are detected in patients with acute leukemia, mainly of T-cell lineage and in a small proportion of myeloid lineage. The functions of PHF6 in physiological hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis remain incompletely defined. To address this question, we generated a conditional Phf6 knockout mouse model and investigated the impact of Phf6 loss on the hematopoietic system. We found that Phf6 knockout mice at 8 weeks of age had reduced numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells in the peripheral blood compared with the wild-type littermates. There were decreased granulocyte-monocytic progenitors but increased Lin(-)c-Kit(+)Sca-1(+) cells in the marrow of young Phf6 knockout mice. Functional studies, including competitive repopulation unit and serial transplantation assays, revealed an enhanced reconstitution and self-renewal capacity in Phf6 knockout hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Aged Phf6 knockout mice had myelodysplasia-like presentations, including decreased platelet counts, megakaryocyte dysplasia, and enlarged spleen related to extramedullary hematopoiesis. Moreover, we found that Phf6 loss lowered the threshold of NOTCH1-induced leukemic transformation at least partially through increased leukemia-initiating cells. Transcriptome analysis on the restrictive rare HSC subpopulations revealed upregulated cell cycling and oncogenic functions, with alteration of key gene expression in those pathways. In summary, our studies show the in vivo crucial roles of Phf6 in physiological and malignant hematopoiesis.","['Hsu, Yueh-Chwen', 'Chen, Tsung-Chih', 'Lin, Chien-Chin', 'Yuan, Chang-Tsu', 'Hsu, Chia-Lang', 'Hou, Hsin-An', 'Kao, Chein-Jun', 'Chuang, Po-Han', 'Chen, Yu-Ren', 'Chou, Wen-Chien', 'Tien, Hwei-Fang']","['Hsu YC', 'Chen TC', 'Lin CC', 'Yuan CT', 'Hsu CL', 'Hou HA', 'Kao CJ', 'Chuang PH', 'Chen YR', 'Chou WC', 'Tien HF']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5392-2509', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7447-8045']","['Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; and.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Medical Research, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Notch1 protein, mouse)', '0 (PHF6 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Biomarkers', 'Cell Self Renewal/*genetics', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Receptor, Notch1/genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*deficiency', 'Thymocytes/metabolism']",PMC6693005,,,2019/08/10 06:00,2020/08/01 06:00,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/05/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019000391 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000391 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Aug 13;3(15):2355-2367. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000391.,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, there are few data regarding the causes and the development of anemia after long-term treatment. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of anemia after at least two years of imatinib treatment of CML patients in the CP and to identify other contributing causes of anemia in this population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 97 CML patients in the CP treated with imatinib for at least two years. We analyzed the hemoglobin (Hb) levels of CML patients at diagnosis, upon initiation of treatment with imatinib and after two years of imatinib treatment, and investigated other causes of anemia in this population. RESULTS: Most of the patients presented Hb levels below the normal range (80.4%) after the second year of treatment, 17.9% grade 2 and 1.3% grade 3. In 13 cases (16.7%), anemia was attributed to resistance and in 13 cases (16.7%) the following causes were identified: iron deficiency (n=5), hypothyroidism (n=2), vitamin B12 deficiency (n=3), acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) (n=1), pulmonary tuberculosis (n=1) and renal toxicity (n=1). In 52 patients (66.6%), there were no other factors contributing to anemia, except imatinib treatment. CONCLUSION: Regular follow-up is required to identify the causes of anemia not related to CML or imatinib toxicity. The importance of investigating secondary causes of anemia should be emphasized, especially in patients with good adherence to treatment and satisfactory therapeutic response.","['Moura, Muriel Silva', 'Benevides, Thais Celi Lopes', 'Delamain, Marcia Torresan', 'Duarte, Gislaine Oliveira', 'Percout, Priscila Oliveira', 'Dias, Maria Almeida', 'Zulli, Roberto', 'Souza, Carmino Antonio de', 'Lorand-Metze, Irene', 'Pagnano, Katia Borgia Barbosa']","['Moura MS', 'Benevides TCL', 'Delamain MT', 'Duarte GO', 'Percout PO', 'Dias MA', 'Zulli R', 'Souza CA', 'Lorand-Metze I', 'Pagnano KBB']",,"['Universidade Estadual de Campinas, (Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil; Universidade Federal de Alagoas (UFAL), Maceio, AL, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, (Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil; Universidade Federal de Campina Grande (UFCG), Campina Grande, PB, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, (Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, (Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, (Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil; Universidade Federal de Sergipe (UFS), Aracaju, SE, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, (Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil; Universidade Federal da Bahia, Salvador, BA, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, (Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, (Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, (Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil.', 'Universidade Estadual de Campinas, (Unicamp), Campinas, SP, Brazil.

In response to the necessity to find new therapeutic strategies, plant secondary metabolites including essential oils (EOs) may represent one of the best sources. EOs in plants act as constitutive defenses against biotic and abiotic stress, and they play an important role in the pharmacology for their low toxicity, good pharmacokinetic and multitarget activity. In this context, natural products such as EOs are one of the most important sources of drugs used in pharmaceutical therapeutics. The aim of this paper was to identify the chemical composition of the essential oil of Alluaudia procera leaves, obtained by hydrodistillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and to verify its biological activities on acute myeloid leukemia cancer cell HL60 and its multidrugresistant variant HL60R and the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus exhibiting multi-antibiotic resistance. We speculate that cytotoxic and antibiotic effects observed in the tested resistant models may be due to the coordinate activities of forty compounds detected or to the C16 macrocyclic lactones which are the major ones (30%). Our data confirm the possibility of using EOs as therapeutic strategies in resistant models is due to the heterogeneous composition of the oils themselves.","['Poma, Paola', 'Labbozzetta, Manuela', 'Zito, Pietro', 'Alduina, Rosa', 'Ramarosandratana, Aro Vonjy', 'Bruno, Maurizio', 'Rosselli, Sergio', 'Sajeva, Maurizio', 'Notarbartolo, Monica']","['Poma P', 'Labbozzetta M', 'Zito P', 'Alduina R', 'Ramarosandratana AV', 'Bruno M', 'Rosselli S', 'Sajeva M', 'Notarbartolo M']",,"['Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (STEBICEF), University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (STEBICEF), University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (STEBICEF), University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (STEBICEF), University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Plant Biology and Ecology, University of Antananarivo, PO Box 906, Antananarivo 101, Madagascar.', 'Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (STEBICEF), University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy.', 'Department of Agricultural, Food and Forest Sciences, University of Palermo Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy. maurizio.sajeva@unipa.it.', 'Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (STEBICEF), University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy. monica.notarbartolo@unipa.it.', 'Department of Biological, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Science and Technology (STEBICEF), University of Palermo, Viale delle Scienze, 90128 Palermo, Italy. sergio.rosselli@unipa.it.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Molecules,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",100964009,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oils, Volatile)', '0 (Phytochemicals)']",IM,,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance', 'Magnoliopsida/*chemistry', 'Molecular Structure', 'Oils, Volatile/*chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Phytochemicals/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Spectrum Analysis']",PMC6720003,['NOTNLM'],"['Didiereaceae', 'acute myeloid leukemia cell', 'essential oil', 'succulent plants']",2019/08/10 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2019/06/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['molecules24162871 [pii]', '10.3390/molecules24162871 [doi]']",epublish,Molecules. 2019 Aug 7;24(16). pii: molecules24162871. doi: 10.3390/molecules24162871.,,20190807,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gene expression profiles of AML blasts were obtained and a gene expression-based means of predicting the outcome of AML patients was developed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: CD133-positive hematopoietic stem cell-like fractions were purified from the bone marrow of 99 individuals with AML-related disorders and the expression profiles of ~33,000 human transcripts in these cells were characterized with the use of DNA microarray analysis. RESULTS: The comparison of the expression data between individuals with short- or long-term survival by application of Cox's proportional hazard model led to the identification of four genes, whose expression patterns discriminated between the two groups. The gene expression-based stratification (GES) system, based on a combination of the karyotype approach and the risk index calculated from the expression levels of the four outcome predictor genes, was developed to separate the patients into subgroups with distinct prognoses. CONCLUSION: DNA microarray analysis of purified fractions provides novel stratification schemes for AML based on the expression profiles of a handful of genes.","['Yamashita, Yoshihiro', 'Ohashi, Jun', 'Hirai, Yuji', 'Choi, Young Lim', 'Kaneda, Ruri', 'Fujiwara, Shin-Ichiro', 'Arai, Yukihiro', 'Akutsu, Miyuki', 'Tsutsumi, Chizuko', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Usuki, Kensuke', 'Teramura, Masanao', 'Mitani, Kinuko', 'Kano, Yasuhiko', ""O'Neill, Michael C"", 'Urabe, Akio', 'Tomonaga, Masao', 'Ozawa, Keiya', 'Mano, Hiroyuki']","['Yamashita Y', 'Ohashi J', 'Hirai Y', 'Choi YL', 'Kaneda R', 'Fujiwara SI', 'Arai Y', 'Akutsu M', 'Tsutsumi C', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Usuki K', 'Teramura M', 'Mitani K', 'Kano Y', ""O'Neill MC"", 'Urabe A', 'Tomonaga M', 'Ozawa K', 'Mano H']",,"['Division of Functional Genomics, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi 329-0498.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo 162-8666."", 'Division of Functional Genomics, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi 329-0498.', 'Division of Functional Genomics, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi 329-0498.', 'Division of Functional Genomics, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi 329-0498.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi 329-0498.', 'Department of Hematology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi 321-0293.', 'Tochigi Cancer Center, Tochigi 320-0834.', 'Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8523.', 'Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8523.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanto Medical Center NTT EC, Tokyo 141-8625, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo 162-8666."", 'Department of Hematology, Dokkyo University School of Medicine, Tochigi 321-0293.', 'Tochigi Cancer Center, Tochigi 320-0834.', 'Department of Biological Sciences, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland 21250, U.S.A.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanto Medical Center NTT EC, Tokyo 141-8625, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Molecular Medicine Unit, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki 852-8523.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi 329-0498.', 'Division of Functional Genomics, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi 329-0498 hmano@jichi.ac.jp.', 'CREST, Japan Science and Technology Agency, Saitama 332-0012, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,,IM,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA microarray', 'gene expression profile', 'prognosis prediction']",2006/05/01 00:00,2006/05/01 00:01,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2006/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2006/05/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2006/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2006/05/01 00:01 [medline]']",['3/3-4/169 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2006 May-Aug;3(3-4):169-181.

It would be of great value to know whether or not an individual tumor responds to the proposed therapy. The concept of sensitivity testing of tumors for individualized therapy traces back to the 1970s. Currently, an astonishing revival has taken place due to the thriving development of genomic and proteomic technologies. This review discusses our own results on protein expression profiles of non-small cell lung cancer, kidney carcinoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia regarding the prediction of drug sensitivity or resistance. A great diversity of drug resistance mechanisms are operative in the clinical drug resistance of cancer e.g., resistance proteins, proliferative, apoptotic, angiogenic factors, proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor-genes. Hierarchical cluster analyses and cluster image maps reveal different resistance profiles even within cancer types of homogeneous histology. Protein arrays may be appropriate to perform sensitivity or resistance tests for individual patients because thousands of proteins may be detected in a single experiment. On the other hand, results suggest that already a set of a limited number of factors may be sufficient to detect the sensitivity or resistance of a cancer.","['Volm, Manfred', 'Koomagi, Reet', 'Efferth, Thomas']","['Volm M', 'Koomagi R', 'Efferth T']",,"['German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'University Brunel, Uxbridge W-London, U.K.', 'Center for Molecular Biology of the University Heidelberg (ZMBH), Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Greece,Cancer Genomics Proteomics,Cancer genomics & proteomics,101188791,,IM,,,,,,2004/03/01 00:00,2004/03/01 00:01,['2019/08/10 06:00'],"['2003/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2004/02/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2004/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2004/03/01 00:01 [medline]']",['1/2/157 [pii]'],ppublish,Cancer Genomics Proteomics. 2004 Mar-Apr;1(2):157-166.

Following treatment, cells were analyzed for alterations in cell cycle and RNA was studied for alterations in gene expression. Additional in vivo studies employed NZB mice in which the IL-10 gene was deleted. RESULTS: IL-10 (-/-) knockout NZB mice overwhelmingly failed to develop leukemia. In vitro antisense IL-10 treatment resulted in a G2/M block and apoptosis and in vivo treatment with antisense IL-10 increased the survival of mice. Microarray analysis indicated a significant role for IL-10 in cell cycle regulation via cdc25C up-regulation and decreased p47(phox) redox activity.

Premature study termination before 24 months of follow-up occurred in 61 patients (33.3%), and was essentially due to nilotinib treatment discontinuation (n = 53; 29%), motivated by treatment intolerance (n = 29; 15.8%) and inefficacy (n = 19; 10.4%). After 24 months of treatment, 112/122 patients (91.8%) had a molecular assessment, 95.5% of whom achieved a major molecular response (MMR), 32.1% achieved uMR(4) , defined as an undetectable molecular disease with 4-log molecular response sensitivity (>/=10 000 ABL1 transcripts). The Morisky Green Levine Medication Adherence Scale was completed by 94/122 patients (77.0%), and 89.4% of these patients obtained a satisfactory level of treatment adherence, defined as a score >/=3. Patients' QoL was good at baseline and stable during the follow-up period. The two most common nilotinib-related adverse events (AEs) were pruritus (14.8%) and asthenia (13.7%). Seven patients (3.8%) experienced at least one cardiovascular ischaemic AE. This French nationwide cohort study provides relevant information in daily clinical practice indicating that nilotinib is a valuable first-line treatment option for CML-CP patients.","['Huguet, Francoise', 'Cayuela, Jean-Michel', 'Cambier, Nathalie', 'Carpentier, Nathalie', 'Tindel, Malka', 'Violet, Isabelle', 'Zunic, Patricia', 'Lascaux, Axelle', 'Etienne, Gabriel']","['Huguet F', 'Cayuela JM', 'Cambier N', 'Carpentier N', 'Tindel M', 'Violet I', 'Zunic P', 'Lascaux A', 'Etienne G']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7600-4954'],"['Department of Haematology, Toulouse University Cancer Institute, Toulouse, France.', 'Laboratory of Haematology, University Hospital Saint-Louis AP-HP and EA3518, University Paris Diderot, Paris, France.', 'Department of Oncology and Haematology, Saint Vincent de Paul Hospital, Lille, France.', 'Novartis Pharma S.A.S., Rueil-Malmaison, France.', 'Novartis Pharma S.A.S., Rueil-Malmaison, France.', 'Novartis Pharma S.A.S., Rueil-Malmaison, France.', 'Department of Haematology, University Hospital Centre, Saint-Pierre, Reunion Island, France.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology and Cell Therapy, Haut-Leveque Hospital, Bordeaux University Hospital, Pessac, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Institut Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asthenia/chemically induced', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Drug Eruptions/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Medication Adherence/statistics & numerical data', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Pruritus/chemically induced', 'Psychometrics', 'Pyrimidines/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', '*Quality of Life', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*adherence', '*chronic myeloid leukaemia', '*daily clinical practice', '*nilotinib', '*tyrosine-kinase inhibitor']",2019/08/09 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16145 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Dec;187(5):615-626. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16145.

The aim of this study was to analyze outcomes of umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) in AYAs with acute leukemia reported to Eurocord/European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation. Patients (N = 504) had acute lymphoblastic (59%) or myeloid leukemia (41%), were aged 15 to 25 years, and received UCBT after myeloablative conditioning regimens between 2004 and 2016. The primary endpoint was 3-year overall survival (OS). Median follow-up was 3.9 years. Transplant was single in 58% and double UCBT in 42%. Three-year OS was 45% and leukemia free survival (LFS) was 41%. Cumulative incidence functions (CIFs) of nonrelapse mortality (NRM) and relapse were 31% and 28%, respectively. CIF of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) grades II to IV at day 100 was 28%. Three-year CIF of chronic GVHD was 25%. In adjusted analysis, better disease status at UCBT (hazard ratio [HR], 2.74; P < .001) and more recent UCBT (HR, 1.43; P=.01) were associated with increased OS, and a similar effect of these factors was observed on LFS. Contrastingly, the use of antithymocyte globulin had a negative effect in LFS. The risk of acute GVHD grades II to IV increased with the use of double UCBT (HR, 1.65; P =.02) and decreased with more recent transplant period (HR, .65; P=.02) and antithymocyte globulin use (HR, .55; P =.01). Outcomes of AYA UCBT improved in more recent years, becoming comparable with pediatric results. Demonstrating the feasibility of UCBT in AYAs facilitates stem cell source selection and provides the basis for future prospective studies.","['Hayashi, Hiromi', 'Volt, Fernanda', 'Sanz, Jaime', 'Petersen, Eefke', 'Dhedin, Nathalie', 'Hough, Rachael', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Angelucci, Emanuele', 'Yakoub-Agha, Ibrahim', 'Michallet, Mauricette', 'Michel, Gerard', 'Aljurf, Mahmoud', 'Kenzey, Chantal', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Dalle, Jean-Hugues', 'Bader, Peter', 'Ruggeri, Annalisa', 'Gluckman, Eliane']","['Hayashi H', 'Volt F', 'Sanz J', 'Petersen E', 'Dhedin N', 'Hough R', 'Milpied N', 'Angelucci E', 'Yakoub-Agha I', 'Michallet M', 'Michel G', 'Aljurf M', 'Kenzey C', 'Rocha V', 'Dalle JH', 'Bader P', 'Ruggeri A', 'Gluckman E']",,"['Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Principaute de Monaco, Monaco; Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Principaute de Monaco, Monaco.', 'Hospital Universitario La Fe, Valencia, Spain.', 'University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Hematology for Adolescents and Young Adults Unit, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.', 'University College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Hospital Haut-Leveque, Bordeaux, France.', 'Hematology and Transplant Center, Istituto di Ricovero e Cura a Carattere Scientifico Ospedale Policlinico San Martino, Genova, Italy.', 'Centre hospitalier universitaire de Lille, Lille Inflammation Research International Center, Institut national de la sante et de la recherche medical U995, Universite de Lille, Lille, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France."", 'Hopital de la Timone Enfant, Marseille, France.', 'King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Principaute de Monaco, Monaco.', 'Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Principaute de Monaco, Monaco.', 'Hopital Universitaire Robert-Debre, Paris, France; Paediatric Disease Working Party of European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Paediatric Disease Working Party of European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation; Goethe-Universitat Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Principaute de Monaco, Monaco; Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy; Cellular Therapy & Immunobiology Working Party of European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation.', 'Eurocord, Hopital Saint Louis, Assistance Publique-Hopitaux de Paris, Universite de Paris, Paris, France; Monacord, Centre Scientifique de Monaco, Principaute de Monaco, Monaco.

To preserve ovarian function, we have been investigating ovarian shielding during total body irradiation (TBI) with a myeloablative dose. In this report, we update the clinical outcomes. Female patients with standard-risk hematologic diseases, aged 40 years or younger, who desired to have children, were included (n=19). The conditioning regimen consisted of TBI at 12 Gy with ovarian shielding and cyclophosphamide (120 mg/kg) or cytarabine (24 g/m(2)). Ovarian shielding reduced the actual irradiation dose applied to the ovaries from 12 Gy to 2 to 3 Gy. The median age at hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) was 24 years (range, 19 to 33 years). With a median follow-up period of 1449 days (range, 64 to 3694) after HSCT, 5-year overall survival and 1- and 5-year relapse rates were 67%, 17%, and 31%, respectively. Only 2 of 14 patients with acute myeloid or lymphoid leukemia in remission have relapsed thus far. The 6-month and 1-year cumulative rates of menstrual recovery were 42% and 78%, respectively. In all patients with menstrual recovery, menstruation recovered within 1 year. The serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) level tended to gradually increase after menstrual recovery. Three patients with extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease experienced delayed recovery of menstruation and serum AMH. Five pregnancies in 3 patients resulted in normal delivery in 1, selective cesarean operation in 1, current pregnancy in 1, and natural abortion in 2. These results suggest that a myeloablative TBI regimen with ovarian shielding could preserve fertility after HSCT without an apparent increase in relapse in standard-risk patients. Because serum AMH recovered gradually over time, the AMH level during the early phase after HSCT may have little value as a marker of ovarian reserve.","['Ashizawa, Masahiro', 'Akahoshi, Yu', 'Nakano, Hirofumi', 'Kawamura, Shunto', 'Takeshita, Junko', 'Yoshino, Nozomu', 'Misaki, Yukiko', 'Yoshimura, Kazuki', 'Gomyo, Ayumi', 'Tamaki, Masaharu', 'Kusuda, Machiko', 'Kameda, Kazuaki', 'Wada, Hidenori', 'Kawamura, Koji', 'Sato, Miki', 'Terasako-Saito, Kiriko', 'Tanihara, Aki', 'Kimura, Shun-Ichi', 'Nakasone, Hideki', 'Kako, Shinichi', 'Akahane, Keiko', 'Wakatsuki, Masaru', 'Shirai, Katsuyuki', 'Kanda, Yoshinobu']","['Ashizawa M', 'Akahoshi Y', 'Nakano H', 'Kawamura S', 'Takeshita J', 'Yoshino N', 'Misaki Y', 'Yoshimura K', 'Gomyo A', 'Tamaki M', 'Kusuda M', 'Kameda K', 'Wada H', 'Kawamura K', 'Sato M', 'Terasako-Saito K', 'Tanihara A', 'Kimura SI', 'Nakasone H', 'Kako S', 'Akahane K', 'Wakatsuki M', 'Shirai K', 'Kanda Y']",,"['Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Radiology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Radiology, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Division of Radiology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Tochigi, Japan; Division of Hematology, Jichi Medical University Saitama Medical Center, Saitama, Japan.

Furthermore, recognising that children can commonly present with musculoskeletal or abdominal symptoms increases the diagnostic yield, thereby preventing missed or late diagnoses. Childhood cancer has a huge impact on the child and their family, both at diagnosis and in the long term; providing advice and signposting families to appropriate support groups is an important aspect of their management.

Little is known about the infectious risk in survivors. We compared the relative rate (RR) of infections after treatment completion between pediatric leukemia survivors and the general population. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, population-based cohort study of children diagnosed with leukemia between 1992 and 2015 in Ontario, Canada, who were alive and relapse free 30 days after treatment completion (index date). Leukemia survivors were matched 5:1 with the general population by year of birth, sex, and rural status and stratified by initial treatment, including and excluding hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). The primary outcome was time to infections, as identified using validated diagnostic codes from administrative databases. Individuals were censored at the earliest of death, first relapse, loss to follow-up, or end of study. RESULTS: A total of 2,204 leukemia survivors were included and matched with 11,020 controls. The rate of infections was elevated after treatment completion compared with controls (RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.45 to 1.57) and at less than 1 year (RR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.69 to 1.86); 1 to 4.99 years (RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.62 to 1.71), and 5 or more years (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.22 to 1.36) from the index date. Among those whose initial treatment excluded HSCT, the rate remained elevated more than 5 years from the index date (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.35). Infection-related death was significantly increased in leukemia survivors both among the entire cohort (hazard ratio, 149.3; 95% CI, 20.4 to 1,091.9) and among those without HSCT (hazard ratio, 92.7; 95% CI, 12.4 to 690.7). CONCLUSION: A significant association was found between a history of leukemia therapy and an increased risk of infections. Additional study is needed to establish which exposures in patients with leukemia lead to late infections.","['Pelland-Marcotte, Marie-Claude', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Hwee, Jeremiah', 'Sutradhar, Rinku', 'Science, Michelle', 'Nathan, Paul C', 'Sung, Lillian']","['Pelland-Marcotte MC', 'Pole JD', 'Hwee J', 'Sutradhar R', 'Science M', 'Nathan PC', 'Sung L']",,"['The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Services, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Services, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Trillium Health Partners, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'Institute for Clinical Evaluative Services, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.', 'University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Databases, Factual', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infections/*epidemiology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Male', 'Ontario/epidemiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*epidemiology/microbiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk']",,,,2019/08/09 06:00,2020/06/18 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.00570 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Oct 10;37(29):2651-2660. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.00570.

The central role of the TP53 protein in several fundamental processes such as cancer, aging, senescence, and DNA repair has ensured enormous attention. However, the role of TP53 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is enigmatic. Unlike many other human cancers, a vast majority of AMLs display no genomic TP53 alterations. There is now growing appreciation of the fact that the unaltered TP53 status of tumor cells can be exploited therapeutically. As most AMLs have an intact TP53 gene, its physiological tumor-suppressive roles could be harnessed. Therefore, the use of pharmacological activators of the TP53 pathway may provide clinical benefit in AML. Conversely, even though the frequency of TP53 mutations in AML is substantially lower than in other human cancers, TP53 mutations are associated with chemoresistance and high risk of relapse. In patients with TP53 mutations, these alterations may lead to novel, selective vulnerabilities, creating opportunities for therapeutic targeting of TP53 mutant AML. The mutational status of TP53 therefore poses challenges and opportunities in terms of advancing effective treatment strategies in AML. An increasing armamentarium of small-molecule activators of the TP53 pathway, and a growing understanding of molecular pathways triggered by mutant TP53 have accelerated efforts aimed at targeting TP53 function in AML. In combination with standard AML chemotherapy or emerging targeted therapies, pharmacological targeting of the TP53 pathway may provide therapeutic benefit in AML.","['Barbosa, Karina', 'Li, Sha', 'Adams, Peter D', 'Deshpande, Aniruddha J']","['Barbosa K', 'Li S', 'Adams PD', 'Deshpande AJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6233-3332'],"['Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California.', 'Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California.', 'Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California.', 'Tumor Initiation and Maintenance Program, Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute, La Jolla, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)'],IM,,"['Genes, p53/*genetics/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*P53', '*TP53', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*leukemia', '*therapy']",2019/08/09 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22796 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Dec;58(12):875-888. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22796.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 53-year-old Chinese man suffered a 6-month history of systemic symmetrical dermatitis, accompanied with profound itching. The patient was diagnosed as ""eczema"" in several hospitals, and the effects of antihistamine and topical steroid creams were poor. Nocturnal sleep was seriously affected by aggravating pruritus. Laboratorial examination was compatible with AML-M4. DIAGNOSES: AML-M4 with AD as first manifestation. INTERVENTIONS: IA regimen (ayninen and cytarabine) were used in induction chemotherapy. However, the patient did not achieve complete remission, and although his rash had improved, he still experienced severely general body itching. On the seventh day of chemotherapy, the patient entered the period of granulocyte deficiency with infection. OUTCOMES: The patient died due to septic shock after chemotherapy. LESSONS: The case strengthens the awareness of AML with AD as first manifestation and raises oncological vigilance in patients with AD refractory.","['Ma, Wei-Wei', 'Kasyanju Carrero, Lorna Martin', 'Yin, Xu-Feng', 'Liu, Hou-Fang', 'Zhou, Bing-Rong']","['Ma WW', 'Kasyanju Carrero LM', 'Yin XF', 'Liu HF', 'Zhou BR']",,"['Department of Dermatology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Dermatitis, Atopic/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/*diagnosis/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",PMC6708621,,,2019/08/09 06:00,2019/09/04 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000016362 [doi]', '00005792-201908090-00005 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Aug;98(32):e16362. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000016362.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Kinases play a crucial role in signaling pathways that regulate cell functions. Deregulation of kinases leads to a variety of pathological changes, activating cancer cell proliferation and metastases. The molecular mechanism of cancer is complex and the dysregulation of tyrosine kinases like Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK), Bcr-Abl (Fusion gene found in patient with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML), JAK (Janus Activated Kinase), Src Family Kinases (SFKs), ALK (Anaplastic lymphoma Kinase), c-MET (Mesenchymal- Epithelial Transition), EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor receptor), PDGFR (Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor), RET (Rearranged during Transfection) and VEGFR (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor) plays major role in the process of carcinogenesis. Recently, kinase inhibitors have overcome many problems of traditional cancer chemotherapy as they effectively separate out normal, non-cancer cells as well as rapidly multiplying cancer cells. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to explore the small molecule tyrosine kinases by polyphenols with the help of docking study (Glide-7.6 program interfaced with Maestro-v11.3 of Schrodinger 2017) to show the binding energies of polyphenols inhibitor with different tyrosine kinases in order to differentiate between the targets. RESULTS: From the literature survey, it was observed that the number of polyphenols derived from natural sources alters the expression and signaling cascade of tyrosine kinase in various tumor models. Therefore, the development of polyphenols as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor against targeted proteins is regarded as an upcoming trend for chemoprevention. CONCLUSION: In this review, we have discussed the role of polyphenols as chemoreceptive which will help in future for the development and discovery of novel semisynthetic anticancer agents coupled with polyphenols.","['Sakle, Nikhil S', 'More, Shweta A', 'Dhawale, Sachin A', 'Mokale, Santosh N']","['Sakle NS', 'More SA', 'Dhawale SA', 'Mokale SN']",,"['Dr. Rafiq Zakaria Campus, Y.

Pulmonary sequelae have been documented following respiratory viral infections (RVIs) in hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients; however potential late effects in children undergoing nonmyeloablative chemotherapy have not been investigated. AIM: To evaluate the long-term pulmonary morbidity of respiratory viral infections during chemotherapy in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). METHODS: Childhood ALL survivors, aged 7 to 18 years, greater than 6 months posttreatment were recruited. Exclusion criteria included HSCT or proven bacterial/fungal respiratory infection during treatment. Subjects were classified into ""viral"" or ""control"" groups according to retrospective medical records that documented the presence of laboratory-proven RVIs during chemotherapy. Symptom questionnaires (Liverpool, ISAAC) and lung function testing (spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity, forced oscillation technique to ATS/ERS standards) were then performed cross-sectionally at the time of recruitment. RESULTS: Fifty-four patients (31 viral, 23 control) were recruited: median (range) age 11.2 (7.2-18.1) years, and at 4.9 (0.5-13) years posttherapy. Abnormalities were detected in 17 (31%) individuals (8 viral, 9 control), with the most common being DLCO impairment (3 viral, 4 control) and reduced respiratory reactance at 5 Hz (5 viral, 6 control). Children with RVIs during chemotherapy reported more current respiratory symptoms, particularly wheeze (odds ratio [OR], 3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.9-10.0; P = .09) and cough (OR, 2.7; 95% CI: 0.8-9.5; P = .11). No differences in lung function tests were observed between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found children with RVIs during chemotherapy developed more long-term respiratory symptoms than controls; however, differences did not reach statistical significance. No differences in static lung function were found between the two groups. Overall, pulmonary abnormalities and/or significant ongoing respiratory symptoms were detected in nearly a third of ALL survivors treated without HSCT.

Methods: The expression of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and phosphorylated BTK (p-BTK) on CD5(+)CD19(+)B and CD5(-)CD19(+)B lymphocytes were detected using flow cytometry in AIHA/ES patients with different disease states, healthy controls (HCs) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients. The correlations of expressed BTK and p-BTK with clinical variables were analyzed. Results: Thirty six AIHA/ES patients (16 hemolytic, 20 remission), 11 CLL patients, and 15 HCs were enrolled. The expression levels of BTK and p-BTK on CD5(+)B lymphocytes in AIHA/ES patients were higher than those in HCs and CLL patients. The latter two groups had no significant difference, and were positively correlated with the quantity of IgE. The ratio of p-BTK to BTK on CD5(+)B lymphocytes of the hemolytic and remission groups was obviously higher than that on CD5(-)B lymphocytes (74.62 +/- 6.42% and 29.63 +/- 10.19%, respectively; P = 0.001 versus 77.95 +/- 9.57% and 26.29 +/- 6.86%, respectively; P = 0.006). The ratio of p-BTK to BTK on CD5(+)B lymphocytes (54.89 +/- 9.56%) and CD5(-)B lymphocytes (30.86 +/- 12.47%) did not differ significantly in HCs (P = 0.109). BTK did not differ significantly between CD5(+) and CD5(-)B lymphocytes in AIHA/ES, but p-BTK on CD5(+)B lymphocytes was significantly higher than that on CD5(-)B lymphocytes in AIHA/ES patients. Conclusions: CD5(+)B lymphocytes are the major B subtype that is activated in AIHA/ES patients and it positively correlates with IgE.","['Duan, Ningning', 'Zhao, Manjun', 'Wang, Yi', 'Qu, Yingying', 'Liu, Hong', 'Wang, Huaquan', 'Xing, Limin', 'Shao, Zonghong']","['Duan N', 'Zhao M', 'Wang Y', 'Qu Y', 'Liu H', 'Wang H', 'Xing L', 'Shao Z']",,"['a Hematology department of General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'a Hematology department of General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'a Hematology department of General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'b Doppler Ultrasonic department of Tianjin Third Center Hospital , Tianjin , China.', 'a Hematology department of General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'a Hematology department of General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'a Hematology department of General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.', 'a Hematology department of General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University , Tianjin , China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (BTK protein, human)', 'Evans Syndrome']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/*metabolism', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thrombocytopenia/*immunology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Autoimmune hemolytic anemia', 'B subsets', ""Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'CD5', 'Evans syndromes', 'IgE', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', ""phosphorylated Bruton's tyrosine kinase""]",2019/08/09 06:00,2020/01/31 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2019.1652005 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2019 Dec;24(1):588-595. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2019.1652005.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two complexes as an example to the iron and nickel centered ones were crystallographically analyzed to confirm the molecular structures. Cytotoxic effects of the complexes on K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. For comparison, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was used as a noncancerous cell line. While four of the iron(III) complexes exhibited the antileukemic effect with 50% inhibition of cell growth (IC50 ) values in the 3.4 to 6.9 mug/mL range on K562 cell line, the nickel(II) complexes showed no significant effect on both cell lines. The complexes Fe4, Fe5, and Fe6, bearing 4-methoxy substituent exhibited relatively high antiproliferative activity on both cell lines. Complex Fe3 with 3-methoxy and S-allyl groups exhibited a selectivity between K562 and HUVEC cells by IC50 values of 6.9 and >10 mug/mL, respectively. Lipophilicity, a key parameter for bioavailability and oral administration, was found in the range of -0.3 and +1.3 that desired for drug active ingredients.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to assess the cost effectiveness of a HMGA2 prognostic test based on HMGA2(+)/HMGA2(-) expression, which improves genetic risk stratification in acute myeloid leukemia, and compare this test with the current standard of care in Canada. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness model was developed from the Canadian National Healthcare Service and societal perspective using data from the Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, published literature, and physician surveys. The model includes a lifetime horizon assessing the HMGA2 test vs. standard of care. RESULTS: The HMGA2 test outperformed the standard of care at all time horizons culminating with estimated improvements of 1.92 and 3.12 months in leukemia-free survival and overall survival, respectively. Costs associated with the HMGA2 test were consistently lower, except diagnostic costs, routine medical costs, and costs related to infections and false positives. From a societal perspective, total lifetime costs were $161,358 CAD and $151,908 CAD with the standard of care and the HMGA2 test, respectively. The incremental quality-adjusted life-year gain was 0.138, which led to dominance over the standard of care. Deterministic sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the base-case scenario. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses revealed that for a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 CAD, the probability of cost effectiveness was 87.19%. CONCLUSIONS: The HMGA2 test is estimated to improve leukemia-free survival and overall survival outcomes, and yield costs savings from a healthcare system and societal perspective.","['Tremblay, Gabriel', 'Rousseau, Ben', 'Marquis, Miriam', 'Beaubois, Cyrielle', 'Sauvageau, Guy', 'Hebert, Josee']","['Tremblay G', 'Rousseau B', 'Marquis M', 'Beaubois C', 'Sauvageau G', 'Hebert J']",,"['Purple Squirrel Economics, New York, NY, USA. gabrielt.ecn@gmail.com.', 'Geneconomics Inc, 1372 rue Du crepuscule, Levis, QC, Canada, G7A 4K3. gabrielt.ecn@gmail.com.', 'Adelphi Values, Bollington, UK.', 'The Leucegene Project, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Research Centre, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, 5415 l'Assomption Blvd, Montreal, QC, H1T 2M4, Canada."", 'The Leucegene Project, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Research Centre, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, 5415 l'Assomption Blvd, Montreal, QC, H1T 2M4, Canada."", 'The Leucegene Project, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Research Centre, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, 5415 l'Assomption Blvd, Montreal, QC, H1T 2M4, Canada."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'The Leucegene Project, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada. josee.hebert@umontreal.ca.', ""Quebec Leukemia Cell Bank, Research Centre, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, 5415 l'Assomption Blvd, Montreal, QC, H1T 2M4, Canada. josee.hebert@umontreal.ca."", 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada. josee.hebert@umontreal.ca.', 'Department of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada. josee.hebert@umontreal.ca.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Applied health economics and health policy,101150314,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HMGA2 Protein)', '0 (HMGA2 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Biomarkers/analysis', 'Canada', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures/*economics', 'HMGA2 Protein/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*physiopathology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years']",PMC6885508,,,2019/08/09 06:00,2020/08/12 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40258-019-00503-5 [doi]', '10.1007/s40258-019-00503-5 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2019 Dec;17(6):827-839. doi: 10.1007/s40258-019-00503-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the ongoing U.S. Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) prospective study, standard and pegylated asparaginase were the most frequent cause of liver injury with jaundice among anti-cancer agents (8 of 40: 20%). The unique features of this hepatotoxicity are described. METHODS: Eight cases from 5 DILIN centers were reviewed for clinical course, laboratory values, imaging, and histopathology. RESULTS: Seven females, aged 29-59 years, and one 8-year-old boy, all with leukemia, developed jaundice within 9-21 days (median 15 days) of starting asparaginase or pegaspargase, during the first (n = 6) or second (n = 2) cycle. Prominent symptoms were jaundice (n = 8), fatigue (6), abdominal pain (6) but rarely pruritus (1). Initial median ALT level was 284 U/L (range 83-1076), Alk P 159 U/L (64-452), and bilirubin 4.4 mg/dL (3.7-8.4). Bilirubin levels rose thereafter in all patients to median peak of 17.5 mg/dL (11.7-25.7), INR rose to 1.1-1.7 and serum albumin fell to 1.5-2.6 g/dL. Hepatic imaging revealed fatty liver in all patients. Liver biopsy showed steatosis but minimal hepatocyte necrosis. One patient restarted on pegaspargase re-developed less severe injury. CONCLUSION: Asparaginase is a common cause of antineoplastic-induced liver injury with jaundice, typically with short latency, marked steatosis, and prolonged jaundice, which can lead to delays in antileukemic therapy. The cause of injury is likely direct inhibition of hepatic protein synthesis caused by asparagine depletion.","['Kamal, Natasha', 'Koh, Christopher', 'Samala, Niharika', 'Fontana, Robert J', 'Stolz, Andrew', 'Durazo, Francisco', 'Hayashi, Paul H', 'Phillips, Elizabeth', 'Wang, Tongrong', 'Hoofnagle, Jay H']","['Kamal N', 'Koh C', 'Samala N', 'Fontana RJ', 'Stolz A', 'Durazo F', 'Hayashi PH', 'Phillips E', 'Wang T', 'Hoofnagle JH']",,"['Liver Diseases Branch, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 10 Center Drive, 5-2740NW, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD, 20892-1804, USA.', 'Liver Diseases Branch, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 10 Center Drive, 5-2740NW, Bldg 10, Bethesda, MD, 20892-1804, USA.

This study aimed to assess general trends in the use of various types of HSCTs performed between 2001 and 2015 in Europe, based on data reported to the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation registry. We also evaluated HSCT rates with respect to ALL incidence in selected countries. Altogether, 15,346 first allogeneic (n = 13,460) or autologous (n = 1886) HSCTs were performed in the study period. Comparing 2013-2015 and 2001-2003, the number of allogeneic HSCTs performed in first complete remission increased by 136%, most prominently for transplantations from unrelated (272%) and mismatched related donors (339%). The number of HSCTs from matched sibling donors increased by 42%, while the total number of autologous HSCTs decreased by 70%. Increased use of allogeneic HSCT was stronger for Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive (166%) than for Ph-negative ALL (38%) and for patients aged > 55 years (599%) than for younger adults (59%). The proportion of allogeneic HSCT with reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) increased from 6 to 27%. The age-standardized rates of allogeneic HSCT per ALL incidence varied strongly among countries. Our analysis showed a continued trend toward increased allogeneic HSCT use for adults with ALL, which may be attributed to increasing availability of unrelated donors, wider use of RIC regimens, and improving efficacy of pretransplant therapy, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors for Ph-positive ALL. Allogeneic HSCT remains a major tool in the fight against ALL in adults.","['Giebel, Sebastian', 'Boumendil, Ariane', 'Labopin, Myriam', 'Seesaghur, Anouchka', 'Baron, Frederic', 'Ciceri, Fabio', 'Esteve, Jordi', 'Gorin, Norbert-Claude', 'Savani, Bipin', 'Schmid, Christoph', 'Wetten, Sally', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Nagler, Arnon']","['Giebel S', 'Boumendil A', 'Labopin M', 'Seesaghur A', 'Baron F', 'Ciceri F', 'Esteve J', 'Gorin NC', 'Savani B', 'Schmid C', 'Wetten S', 'Mohty M', 'Nagler A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4827-4401'],"['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Onco-Hematology, Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute - Oncology Center, Gliwice Branch, Str.

However, data on long-term follow-up of these patients are still lacking. To investigate treatment response and outcome, we retrospectively revised an Italian database of 263 very elderly CML patients receiving IM from the time of diagnosis. Median age at diagnosis was 78.5 years and 56% of patients had 2 or 3 comorbidities. A complete haematological and cytogenetic response were achieved in 244 (92.8%) and 184 (69.9%) patients, respectively. In 148 cases (56.2%), a major molecular response was observed, which was deep in 63 cases (24%). A blastic phase occurred in 11 patients (4.2%). After a median follow-up of 45.0 months, 93 patients have died (9 from disease progression) and 104 (39.5%) are still in treatment with IM. Incidence of grades 3-4 haematological and non-haematological toxicity was similar to those reported in younger patients. Five-year event-free survival was 54.5% and 45.2% in patients </= 80 years and > 80 years, respectively (p = 0.098). Five years OS was 75.7% and 61.6% in patients </=80 years and > 80 years, respectively (p = 0.003). These findings show that IM plays an important role in frontline treatment of very elderly CML patients without increased toxicity and any effort to treat these patients with standard doses should be made in order to achieve responses as in younger subjects.","['Crugnola, Monica', 'Castagnetti, Fausto', 'Breccia, Massimo', 'Ferrero, Dario', 'Trawinska, Malgorzata Monika', 'Abruzzese, Elisabetta', 'Annunziata, Mario', 'Stagno, Fabio', 'Tiribelli, Mario', 'Binotto, Gianni', 'Bonifacio, Massimiliano', 'Fava, Carmen', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Bucelli, Cristina', 'Mansueto, Giovanna', 'Gozzini, Antonella', 'Falzetti, Franca', 'Montefusco, Enrico', 'Crisa, Elena', 'Gugliotta, Gabriele', 'Russo, Sabina', 'Cedrone, Michele', 'RussoRossi, Antonella', 'Pregno, Patrizia', 'Isidori, Alessandro', 'Mauro, Endri', 'Atelda, Romano', 'Giglio, Gianfranco', 'Celesti, Francesca', 'Sora, Federica', 'Storti, Sergio', ""D'Addosio, Adam"", 'Galimberti, Sara', 'Orlandi, Ester', 'Calistri, Elisabetta', 'Bocchia, Monica', 'Cavazzini, Francesco', 'Rege Cambrin, Giovanna', 'Orofino, Nicola', 'Luciano, Luigiana', 'Sgherza, Nicola', 'Rosti, Gianantonio', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Capodanno, Isabella']","['Crugnola M', 'Castagnetti F', 'Breccia M', 'Ferrero D', 'Trawinska MM', 'Abruzzese E', 'Annunziata M', 'Stagno F', 'Tiribelli M', 'Binotto G', 'Bonifacio M', 'Fava C', 'Iurlo A', 'Bucelli C', 'Mansueto G', 'Gozzini A', 'Falzetti F', 'Montefusco E', 'Crisa E', 'Gugliotta G', 'Russo S', 'Cedrone M', 'RussoRossi A', 'Pregno P', 'Isidori A', 'Mauro E', 'Atelda R', 'Giglio G', 'Celesti F', 'Sora F', 'Storti S', ""D'Addosio A"", 'Galimberti S', 'Orlandi E', 'Calistri E', 'Bocchia M', 'Cavazzini F', 'Rege Cambrin G', 'Orofino N', 'Luciano L', 'Sgherza N', 'Rosti G', 'Latagliata R', 'Capodanno I']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8477-203X'],"['Hematology and BMT Center, ""Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Parma,"" Department Medicine and Surgery, University of Parma, Parma, Italy. mcrugnola@ao.pr.it.', 'Institute of Hematology ""L and A Seragnoli,"" Department of Experimental Hematology, Diagnostic and Speciality Medicine, S.Orsola Malpighi, University Hospital Bologna, Bologna, Italy.', 'Department of Cellular Biotechnologies and Hematology, University ""La Sapienza"" of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, University of Turin, Turin, Italy.', 'Hematology, S.

Dysregulation of apoptosis promotes tumorigenesis and limits the efficacy of chemotherapy. To assess the complex interactions among caspases during apoptosis, we disrupted caspase-8, -9, -3, -7, or -6 and combinations thereof, using CRISPR-based genome editing in living human leukemia cells. While loss of apical initiator caspase-8 or -9 partially blocked extrinsic or intrinsic apoptosis, respectively, only combined loss of caspase-3 and -7 fully inhibited both apoptotic pathways, with no discernible effect of caspase-6 deficiency alone or in combination. Caspase-3/7 double knockout cells exhibited almost complete inhibition of caspase-8 or -9 activation. Furthermore, deletion of caspase-3 and -7 decreased mitochondrial depolarization and cytochrome c release upon apoptosis activation. Thus, activation of effector caspase-3 or -7 sets off explosive feedback amplification of upstream apoptotic events, which is a key feature of apoptotic signaling essential for efficient apoptotic cell death.","['McComb, Scott', 'Chan, Pik Ki', 'Guinot, Anna', 'Hartmannsdottir, Holmfridur', 'Jenni, Silvia', 'Dobay, Maria Pamela', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Bornhauser, Beat C']","['McComb S', 'Chan PK', 'Guinot A', 'Hartmannsdottir H', 'Jenni S', 'Dobay MP', 'Bourquin JP', 'Bornhauser BC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4616-7864', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5290-7825', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9933-8356', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1952-0714', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2890-3191']","[""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", 'IQVIA Technology and Services AG Theaterstrasse 4, 4051 Basel, Switzerland.', ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Centre, University Children's Hospital Zurich, 8032 Zurich, Switzerland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Sci Adv,Science advances,101653440,"['9007-43-6 (Cytochromes c)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (CASP3 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 3)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 7)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 8)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspase 9)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Caspase 3/*genetics', 'Caspase 7/*genetics', 'Caspase 8/genetics', 'Caspase 9/genetics', 'Cell Polarity/genetics', 'Cytochromes c/genetics', '*Feedback, Physiological', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Mitochondria/genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",PMC6669006,,,2019/08/09 06:00,2020/04/30 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2018/07/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/30 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1126/sciadv.aau9433 [doi]', 'aau9433 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Adv. 2019 Jul 31;5(7):eaau9433. doi: 10.1126/sciadv.aau9433. eCollection 2019 Jul.,,20190731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the characteristic clinicopathological and endoscopic features of GI ATLL. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 61 GI tract lesions in 54 ATLL patients. Results: Thirty-six (67%) patients were classified as having lymphoma-type ATLL and 18 (33%) patients were classified as having acute-type with leukemic changes. Examined ATLL lesions in the stomach and intestine (small intestine and colorectum) were 40 (66%) and 21 (34%), respectively. Gastric ATLL lesions were frequently found in the lymphoma-type (29/38; 76%) compared with the acute-type lesions (11/23; 48%; P=0.023). Intestinal ATLL lesions were frequent in the acute-type (12/23; 52%) compared with the lymphoma-type lesions (9/38; 24%; P=0.023). Endoscopically, tumor-forming type lesions were significantly more frequent in lymphoma-type ATLL lesions (29/38 lesions; 76%) compared with acute-type lesions (10/23; 44%; P=0.0096). The superficial spreading-type was significantly more frequent in acute-type lesions (12/23 lesions; 52%) compared with lymphoma-type lesions (3/38; 8%; P=0.0003). Additionally, gastropathy-, enteropathy-, or proctocolitis-like lesions were distinct features, mainly in the acute type (9/23 lesions; 39%). Twenty three of 39 tumor-forming-type lesions (59%) were significantly composed of pleomorphic or anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and 13 of 15 superficial spreading-type lesions (87%) were significantly composed of pleomorphic medium-sized cells (P=0.007, in each). Six patients (11%) who were estimated as having primary GI ATLL based on restricted clinical stages, showed a significantly better overall survival (OS) compared with the 48 advanced-stage patients (P=0.017). Twenty patients with solitary tumor-forming-type lesions showed a significantly better OS than 17 patients with the multiple tumor-forming-type (P=0.015) and five with the mucosal-thickening-type lesions (P=0.04). Twenty-six patients with pleomorphic or anaplastic large cell ATLL showed a significantly better prognosis compared with 28 patients with pleomorphic medium-sized ATLL (P=0.034). Conclusions: ATLL predominantly involves the stomach. Leukemic behavior of ATLL had a large influence on the tumor location and endoscopic features of GI tract lesions. Gastropathy-, enteropathy-, and proctocolitis-like lesions showed additional distinct characteristics. Primary GI ATLL in the early clinical stages, solitary tumor-forming-type lesions and large tumor cells showed better prognostic factors than other factors, respectively.","['Ishibashi, Hideki', 'Nimura, Satoshi', 'Kayashima, Yoshiyuki', 'Takamatsu, Yasushi', 'Iwasaki, Hiroki', 'Harada, Naohiko', 'Momosaki, Seiya', 'Takedatsu, Hidenori', 'Sakisaka, Shotaro', 'Takeshita, Morishige']","['Ishibashi H', 'Nimura S', 'Kayashima Y', 'Takamatsu Y', 'Iwasaki H', 'Harada N', 'Momosaki S', 'Takedatsu H', 'Sakisaka S', 'Takeshita M']",,"['Department of Gastroenterology and Medicine, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Medicine, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization, Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, National Hospital Organization, Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, National Hospital Organization, Kyushu Medical Center, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Medicine, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Medicine, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology, Hematology and Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Fukuoka University, Fukuoka, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,J Gastrointest Oncol,Journal of gastrointestinal oncology,101557751,,,,,PMC6657316,['NOTNLM'],"['Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL)', 'endoscopy', 'gastroenteropathy', 'gastrointestinal tract']",2019/08/09 06:00,2019/08/09 06:01,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/09 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/jgo.2019.03.03 [doi]', 'jgo-10-04-723 [pii]']",ppublish,J Gastrointest Oncol. 2019 Aug;10(4):723-733. doi: 10.21037/jgo.2019.03.03.,,,,,['Conflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, both metal complexes induced phosphorylation of histone H2AX (S139), JNK2 (T183/Y185) and p38alpha (T180/Y182), and cotreatment with JNK/SAPK and p38 MAPK inhibitors reduced complexes-induced apoptosis, indicating DNA double-strand break and activation of caspase-mediated apoptosis through JNK/p38 pathways. Complex 1 also reduced HL-60 cell growth in xenograft model. Overall, the outcome indicated the ruthenium(II) complexes with 6-methyl-2-thiouracil as a novel promising antileukemic drug candidates.","['Bomfim, Larissa M', 'de Araujo, Fenix A', 'Dias, Rosane B', 'Sales, Caroline B S', 'Rocha, Clarissa A Gurgel', 'Correa, Rodrigo S', 'Soares, Milena B P', 'Batista, Alzir A', 'Bezerra, Daniel P']","['Bomfim LM', 'de Araujo FA', 'Dias RB', 'Sales CBS', 'Rocha CAG', 'Correa RS', 'Soares MBP', 'Batista AA', 'Bezerra DP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6774-2063'],"['Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Department of Biomorphology, Institute of Health Sciences, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, 40110-902, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, 35400-000, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo, 13561-901, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. danielpbezerra@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (6-methyl-2-thiouracil)', '0 (Coordination Complexes)', '59X161SCYL (Thiouracil)', '7UI0TKC3U5 (Ruthenium)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coordination Complexes/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded/*drug effects', 'Female', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Ruthenium/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Thiouracil/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6686011,,,2019/08/09 06:00,2020/10/28 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/03/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-47914-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-47914-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Aug 7;9(1):11483. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-47914-x.,,20190807,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Progress has been made to define molecular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis due, in part, to the near-complete understanding of AML genome. Nonetheless, functional studies are necessary to assess the significance of AML-associated mutations and devise urgently needed therapies. Genome-wide knockout screening, employing CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, is a powerful tool in functional genomics. In this study, genome-wide CRISPR screening was performed using mouse leukemia cell lines developed in our Center, followed by in vivo screening. Among 20,611 genes, 130 AML essential genes were identified, including clinically actionable candidates. It was shown that mRNA decapping enzyme scavenger (DCPS), an enzyme implicated in mRNA decay pathway, is essential for AML survival. ShRNA-mediated gene knockdown and DCPS inhibitor (RG3039) were employed to validate findings. RG3039 induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, mass spectrometry analysis revealed an association between DCPS and RNA metabolic pathways, and RNA-Seq showed that RG3039 treatment induced aberrant mRNA splicing in AML cells. Importantly, RG3039 exhibited anti-leukemia effects in PDX models.

In very rare cases, the BCR-ABL1 IS measurement fails to detect BCR-ABL1 chimeric messages for unknown reasons. Such a situation was also experienced in our study; therefore, molecular analysis of BCR-ABL1 fusion gene was performed. A breakpoint in the ABL1 gene was identified in the middle of the a2 exon, leading to generation of chimeric messages lacking a nucleic acid sequence encoded by this exon (e14a3 chimeric message). The ABL1 a2 exon is critical for quantification of BCR-ABL1 chimeric messages with the measurement scales used in medical laboratories. Absence of this referred nucleic acid sequence was the reason why BCR-ABL1 IS measurement failed to detect the chimeric messages in our study.

In particular, it is associated with a wide range of hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma and leukemia. Novel targeted therapies have only been successful for some subtypes of these malignancies, underlining the need for developing robust mouse models to better dissect the role of this pathway in specific tumorigenic processes. Here, we investigated the role of selective gp130/JAK/STAT3 activation by generating a conditional mouse model. This model targeted constitutively active, cell-autonomous gp130 activity to B cells, as well as to the entire hematopoietic system. We found that regardless of the timing of activation in B cells, constitutively active gp130 signaling resulted in the formation specifically of mature B cell lymphomas and plasma cell disorders with full penetrance, only with different latencies, where infiltrating CD138+ cells were a dominant feature in every tumor. Furthermore, constitutively active gp130 signaling in all adult hematopoietic cells also led to the development specifically of largely mature, aggressive B cell cancers, again with a high penetrance of CD138+ tumors. Importantly, gp130 activity abrogated the differentiation block induced by a B cell-targeted Myc transgene and resulted in a complete penetrance of the gp130-associated, CD138+, mature B cell lymphoma phenotype. Thus, gp130 signaling selectively provides a strong growth and differentiation advantage for mature B cells and directs lymphomagenesis specifically toward terminally differentiated B cell cancers.","['Scherger, Anna K', 'Al-Maarri, Mona', 'Maurer, H.

This proinflammatory effect is mediated primarily by extracellular release of IL-33 from stromal cells and binding of the C-terminal domain of IL-33 to its receptor ST2 on targets such as CD4(+) Th2 cells, ILC2, and mast cells. Notably, IL-33 has a distinct N-terminal domain that mediates nuclear localization and chromatin binding. However, a defined in vivo cell-intrinsic role for IL-33 has not been established. We identified IL-33 expression in the nucleus of progenitor B (pro-B) and large precursor B cells in the bone marrow, an expression pattern unique to B cells among developing lymphocytes. The IL-33 receptor ST2 was not expressed within the developing B cell lineage at either the transcript or protein level. RNA sequencing analysis of wild-type and IL-33-deficient pro-B and large precursor B cells revealed a unique, IL-33-dependent transcriptional profile wherein IL-33 deficiency led to an increase in E2F targets, cell cycle genes, and DNA replication and a decrease in the p53 pathway. Using mixed bone marrow chimeric mice, we demonstrated that IL-33 deficiency resulted in an increased frequency of developing B cells via a cell-intrinsic mechanism starting at the pro-B cell stage paralleling IL-33 expression. Finally, IL-33 was detectable during early B cell development in humans and IL33 mRNA expression was decreased in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia samples compared with healthy controls. Collectively, these data establish a cell-intrinsic, ST2-independent role for IL-33 in early B cell development.","['Stier, Matthew T', 'Mitra, Ramkrishna', 'Nyhoff, Lindsay E', 'Goleniewska, Kasia', 'Zhang, Jian', 'Puccetti, Matthew V', 'Casanova, Holly C', 'Seegmiller, Adam C', 'Newcomb, Dawn C', 'Kendall, Peggy L', 'Eischen, Christine M', 'Peebles, R Stokes Jr']","['Stier MT', 'Mitra R', 'Nyhoff LE', 'Goleniewska K', 'Zhang J', 'Puccetti MV', 'Casanova HC', 'Seegmiller AC', 'Newcomb DC', 'Kendall PL', 'Eischen CM', 'Peebles RS Jr']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6181-9066', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1429-7875']","['Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107; and.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA 19107; and christine.eischen@jefferson.edu stokes.peebles@vanderbilt.edu.', 'Department of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232; christine.eischen@jefferson.edu stokes.peebles@vanderbilt.edu.', 'Division of Allergy, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN 37232.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (IL33 protein, human)', '0 (Il33 protein, mouse)', '0 (Interleukin-33)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'DNA Replication/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-33/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'RNA, Messenger/immunology', 'Signal Transduction/immunology', 'Th2 Cells/immunology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/immunology']",PMC6736727,,,2019/08/09 06:00,2020/05/16 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1900408 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1900408 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 Sep 15;203(6):1457-1467. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1900408.

CASE REPORT: We adopted a desensitization protocol from Gutierrez-Fernandez et al., which included three aliquots (0.15 mg intravenously (IV), 1.5 mg IV, and 28.5 mg IV) given approximately 1 h apart on day 1 followed by a full 30 mg dose IV on day 3. Unlike prior attempts to administer alemtuzumab to this patient, she tolerated the medication well and did not require any rescue medications. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Successful plan development required a significant amount of strategic communication between hematology/oncology and MICU-related physicians, pharmacists, and nurses to ensure a safe and effective desensitization. The first step of planning required creation of a desensitization order set with directions for medication preparation and administration, premedications, and available medications in the event of an adverse reaction or anaphylaxis. Anaphylactoid-related medications were prepared at bedside and ready for administration prior to beginning the desensitization. Alemtuzumab was compounded in a chemotherapy-certified hood and verified by at least two chemotherapy-certified pharmacists. Foreword planning was also necessary to ensure multiple people were available or present at bedside for the desensitization, including a chemotherapy-certified nurse, a second chemotherapy-certified nurse for verification, a critical care-certified pharmacist, a pulmonary/critical care attending physician, and hematology attending physician. DISCUSSION: This case exemplifies the importance of clear and coordinated communication between different healthcare fields to safely and effectively complete extensive protocols such as desensitization strategies.","['McKenzie, Matt G', 'Bissell, Brittany D', 'Disselkamp, Margaret A', 'Hildebrandt, Gerhard C', 'Cox, Jessica N']","['McKenzie MG', 'Bissell BD', 'Disselkamp MA', 'Hildebrandt GC', 'Cox JN']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1945-9471'],"['Department of Pharmacy Practice, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Hematology and Bone & Marrow Transplantation, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacy Practice, University of Kentucky Medical Center, Lexington, KY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,['3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)'],IM,,"['Alemtuzumab/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Anaphylaxis/etiology', 'Communication', 'Desensitization, Immunologic/*methods', '*Drug Hypersensitivity', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Middle Aged', 'Pharmacists/organization & administration', 'Physicians/organization & administration']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Desensitization', 'alemtuzumab', 'hypersensitivity', 'intensive care unit', 'prolymphocytic leukemia']",2019/08/09 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155219865313 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Apr;26(3):742-746. doi: 10.1177/1078155219865313.

Determining these changes at the time of diagnosis can help the therapeutic decision, and contributes to the prediction of patients' clinical outcomes. A part of B-ALL (B-other) lacks cytogenetic abnormalities with clinical relevance for prognosis. Our first goal was to retrospectively review genetic results of patients from 2013-2017 and identify number of B-other patients in Slovak population. The second goal was to implement single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis to improve the diagnosis and risk stratification. In this study we reviewed 133 B-ALL patients. We found that nearly 40% of them (52 cases) belonged to the B-other ALL group. Eighteen B-other ALL patients were subjected to the analysis using SNP-array. Overall, we identified 126 cytogenomic changes and in 4 patients the SNP array revealed clinically relevant markers of adverse prognosis and high relapse risk. Integrating identified genetic changes into clinical practice can bring improvement of prognosis assessment for children with ALL in Slovakia.","['Vaska, A', 'Makohusova, M', 'Plevova, K', 'Skalicka, K', 'Cermak, M', 'Chovanec, F', 'Fabri, O', 'Svec, P', 'Kolenova, A']","['Vaska A', 'Makohusova M', 'Plevova K', 'Skalicka K', 'Cermak M', 'Chovanec F', 'Fabri O', 'Svec P', 'Kolenova A']",,"[""Laboratory of Clinical and Molecular Genetics, Department of Children's University Hospital and Comenius University, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School and University Children's Hospital, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia."", 'Center of Molecular Biology and Gene Therapy, Department of Internal Medicine - Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Brno and Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', 'Center of Molecular Medicine, CEITEC - Masaryk University, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic.', ""Laboratory of Clinical and Molecular Genetics, Department of Children's University Hospital and Comenius University, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia."", 'Department of Clinical Genetics, National Institute of Oncology, Bratislava, Slovakia.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School and University Children's Hospital, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School and University Children's Hospital, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School and University Children's Hospital, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia."", ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Medical School and University Children's Hospital, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,,IM,,"['Child', 'Genomics', 'Humans', 'Pilot Projects', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Slovakia']",,,,2019/08/09 06:00,2019/12/04 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/03/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.4149/neo_2019_190328N274 [doi]', '190328N274 [pii]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2019 Nov;66(6):1009-1018. doi: 10.4149/neo_2019_190328N274.

However, the role of lncRNA potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily Q member 1 overlapping transcript 1 (KCNQ1OT1) in AML progression and its mechanism remain largely unknown. The expressions of KCNQ1OT1, microRNA-326 (miR-326) and c-Myc were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blot, respectively. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) was used for cell differentiation. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation were measured by MTT assay, flow cytometry and qRT-PCR, respectively. The interaction between miR-326 and KCNQ1OT1 or c-Myc was explored by luciferase activity, RNA immunoprecipitation or RNA pull-down assay. We found that the expression of KCNQ1OT1 was enhanced in AML samples compared with control. KCNQ1OT1 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation but promoted apoptosis and cell differentiation. KCNQ1OT1 was a decoy of miR-326 and c-Myc was a target of miR-326. KCNQ1OT1 regulated AML cell proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation by sponging miR-326. Moreover, overexpression of miR-326 suppressed proliferation but promoted apoptosis and PMA-induced differentiation by targeting c-Myc in AML cells. Besides, c-Myc protein level was suppressed by KCNQ1OT1 interference and rescued by miR-326 abrogation. Our data showed that KCNQ1OT1 regulates proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis in AML cells by acting as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-326 to regulate c-Myc, providing a novel avenue for AML treatment.","['Cheng, P', 'Lu, P', 'Guan, J', 'Zhou, Y', 'Zou, L', 'Yi, X', 'Cheng, H']","['Cheng P', 'Lu P', 'Guan J', 'Zhou Y', 'Zou L', 'Yi X', 'Cheng H']",,"['Department of Hematology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Anesthesiology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Wuhan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital, Wuhan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Slovakia,Neoplasma,Neoplasma,0377266,"['0 (KCNQ1OT1 RNA)', '0 (MIRN326 microRNA, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics']",,,,2019/08/09 06:00,2020/08/18 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2018/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.4149/neo_2018_181215N972 [doi]', '181215N972 [pii]']",ppublish,Neoplasma. 2020 Mar;67(2):238-248. doi: 10.4149/neo_2018_181215N972.

Age, white blood cell count (WBC), and specific genetic abnormalities are the most important factors that define risk groups for ALL. State-of-the-art diagnosis of ALL requires cytological and cytogenetical analyses, as well as flow cytometry and high-throughput sequencing assays. An important aspect in the diagnostic characterization of patients with ALL is the identification of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, which warrants the addition of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) to the chemotherapy backbone. Data that support the benefit of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in high risk patient subsets or in late relapse patients are still questioned and have yet to be determined conclusive. This article presents the newly published data in ALL workup and treatment, putting it into perspective for the attending physician in hematology and oncology.","['Sas, Valentina', 'Moisoiu, Vlad',

The goal of the present study was to investigate the presence of FcaGHV1 in Swiss domestic cats and analyze potential risk factors. Blood samples from 881 cats presented to veterinarians in all Swiss cantons and from 91 stray cats and neoplastic tissue samples from 17 cats with lymphoma were evaluated. FcaGHV1 was detected by real-time PCR targeting the glycoprotein B gene, followed by sequencing. Blood samples were also tested for feline hemoplasmas, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). The molecular prevalence of FcaGHV1 was 6.0% (95% confidence interval (CI), 4.5-7.8%) in cats presented to veterinarians and 5.5% (95% CI, 1.8-12.4%) in stray cats. FcaGHV1 PCR-positive cats originated from 19/26 Swiss cantons. Factors significantly associated with FcaGHV1 detection included male sex, age >3 years, nonpedigree status and co-infection with FIV and hemoplasmas. Moreover, FeLV viremia tended to be associated with FcaGHV1 detection. High FcaGHV1 blood loads were found more frequently in FeLV-viremic cats and less frequently in hemoplasma-infected cats than in uninfected cats. Clinical information was unavailable for most of the 881 cats, but leukemia, carcinoma and cardiomyopathy were reported in FcaGHV1-positive cats. None of the tissue samples from the 17 cats with lymphoma tested positive for FcaGHV1. Sequence analyses revealed homogeneity among the Swiss isolates and >99.7% identity to published FcaGHV1 sequences. In conclusion, FcaGHV1 is present in Switzerland with a similar prevalence in cats presented to veterinarians and in stray cats. The pathogenic potential of FcaGHV1 needs further evaluation.","['Novacco, Marilisa', 'Kohan, Neda Ranjbar', 'Stirn, Martina', 'Meli, Marina L', 'Diaz-Sanchez, Adrian Alberto', 'Boretti, Felicitas S', 'Hofmann-Lehmann, Regina']","['Novacco M', 'Kohan NR', 'Stirn M', 'Meli ML', 'Diaz-Sanchez AA', 'Boretti FS', 'Hofmann-Lehmann R']",,"['Clinical Laboratory, Department for Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland. mnovacco@vetclinics.uzh.ch.', 'Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland. mnovacco@vetclinics.uzh.ch.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department for Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department for Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department for Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department for Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Centro Nacional de Sanidad Agropecuaria (CENSA), San Jose de las Lajas 32700, Mayabeque, Cuba.', 'Clinic for Small Animal Internal Medicine, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Clinical Laboratory, Department for Clinical Diagnostics and Services, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Center for Clinical Studies, Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich, 8057 Zurich, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Viruses,Viruses,101509722,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', '*Animals, Domestic', 'Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cat Diseases/*epidemiology/immunology/*virology', 'Cats', 'Coinfection/*veterinary', 'Female', '*Gammaherpesvirinae/classification/genetics', 'Geography, Medical', 'Herpesviridae Infections/*veterinary', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/immunology', 'Male', 'Phylogeny', 'Prevalence', 'Public Health Surveillance', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Switzerland/epidemiology']",PMC6723517,['NOTNLM'],"['*FIV', '*FeLV', '*Switzerland', '*cat', '*gammaherpesvirus', '*hemoplasma', '*qPCR', '*retrovirus', '*veterinary sciences', '*virus load']",2019/08/09 06:00,2020/08/25 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/07/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/25 06:00 [medline]']","['v11080721 [pii]', '10.3390/v11080721 [doi]']",epublish,Viruses. 2019 Aug 6;11(8). pii: v11080721. doi: 10.3390/v11080721.,,20190806,,,['The authors declare no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although investigation of specific lncRNAs revealed their role in the metabolism of cellular RNA, our understanding of their contribution to post-transcriptional regulation is relatively limited. In this study, we explore the role of lncRNAs in modulating alternative splicing and their impact on downstream protein-RNA interaction networks. Analysis of alternative splicing events across 39 lncRNA knockdown and wildtype RNA-sequencing datasets from three human cell lines-HeLa (cervical cancer), K562 (myeloid leukemia), and U87 (glioblastoma)-resulted in the high-confidence (false discovery rate (fdr) < 0.01) identification of 11,630 skipped exon events and 5895 retained intron events, implicating 759 genes to be impacted at the post-transcriptional level due to the loss of lncRNAs. We observed that a majority of the alternatively spliced genes in a lncRNA knockdown were specific to the cell type. In tandem, the functions annotated to the genes affected by alternative splicing across each lncRNA knockdown also displayed cell-type specificity. To understand the mechanism behind this cell-type-specific alternative splicing pattern, we analyzed RNA-binding protein (RBP)-RNA interaction profiles across the spliced regions in order to observe cell-type-specific alternative splice event RBP binding preference. Despite limited RBP binding data across cell lines, alternatively spliced events detected in lncRNA perturbation experiments were associated with RBPs binding in proximal intron-exon junctions in a cell-type-specific manner. The cellular functions affected by alternative splicing were also affected in a cell-type-specific manner. Based on the RBP binding profiles in HeLa and K562 cells, we hypothesize that several lncRNAs are likely to exhibit a sponge effect in disease contexts, resulting in the functional disruption of RBPs and their downstream functions. We propose that such lncRNA sponges can extensively rewire post-transcriptional gene regulatory networks by altering the protein-RNA interaction landscape in a cell-type-specific manner.","['Porto, Felipe Wendt', 'Daulatabad, Swapna Vidhur', 'Janga, Sarath Chandra']","['Porto FW', 'Daulatabad SV', 'Janga SC']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5288-8599', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7351-6268']","['Department of BioHealth Informatics, School of Informatics and Computing, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of BioHealth Informatics, School of Informatics and Computing, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.', 'Department of BioHealth Informatics, School of Informatics and Computing, IUPUI, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. scjanga@iupui.edu.', 'Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. scjanga@iupui.edu.', 'Centre for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. scjanga@iupui.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Genes (Basel),Genes,101551097,"['0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,,"['*Alternative Splicing', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Protein Binding', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6722645,['NOTNLM'],"['*RNA-binding proteins', '*alternative splicing', '*cancer', '*cell-type-specific', '*functional enrichment', '*long non-coding RNA', '*protein binding lncRNA sponges', '*secondary RNA structure']",2019/08/09 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/06/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['genes10080593 [pii]', '10.3390/genes10080593 [doi]']",epublish,Genes (Basel). 2019 Aug 6;10(8). pii: genes10080593. doi: 10.3390/genes10080593.,,20190806,,['R01 GM123314/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, the presence of BLV RNA in whole blood from seven asymptomatic cows naturally infected with BLV during one year, including a complete milking cycle and two delivery time points, was investigated by nested-PCR using the oligonucleotides complementary to the tax and pol gene. BLV RNA was detected in four cows at different time points, especially in high blood proviral load cows and around delivery time. This study describes for the first time the detection of free BLV RNA in blood from BLV-infected asymptomatic cows. The results obtained suggest the occurrence of persistent low-level expression of the tax and pol genes that could be a result of viral reactivation, within the asymptomatic period. This finding may be important in the pathogenesis of BLV infection, associated with the delivery period.","['Alvarez, Irene', 'Porta, Natalia Gabriela', 'Trono, Karina']","['Alvarez I', 'Porta NG', 'Trono K']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5194-670X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4793-2652']","['Instituto de Virologia, Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA), Buenos Aires C1686, Argentina. alvarez.irene@inta.gob.ar.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), Godoy Cruz 2290, Ciudad autonoma de Buenos Aires C1425FQB, Argentina. alvarez.irene@inta.gob.ar.', 'Instituto de Virologia, Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA), Buenos Aires C1686, Argentina.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), Godoy Cruz 2290, Ciudad autonoma de Buenos Aires C1425FQB, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Virologia, Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria (INTA), Buenos Aires C1686, Argentina.', 'Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Cientificas y Tecnicas (CONICET), Godoy Cruz 2290, Ciudad autonoma de Buenos Aires C1425FQB, Argentina.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Vet Sci,Veterinary sciences,101680127,,,,,PMC6789540,['NOTNLM'],"['RNA detection', 'bovine leukemia virus', 'pol gene', 'tax gene', 'viral expression']",2019/08/09 06:00,2019/08/09 06:01,['2019/08/09 06:00'],"['2019/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/09 06:01 [medline]']","['vetsci6030066 [pii]', '10.3390/vetsci6030066 [doi]']",epublish,Vet Sci. 2019 Aug 6;6(3). pii: vetsci6030066. doi: 10.3390/vetsci6030066.,,20190806,,"['PICT2013-0929/undefined <span style=""color:gray;font-size:10px;"">undefined</span>', 'PNSA115054/Instituto Nacional de Tecnologia Agropecuaria']",,,,,,,['Vet Sci. 2019 Oct 23;6(4):.

However, little is known about the association of maternal folic acid intake with the occurrence of childhood cancer. Hence, this study aimed to determine the effects of maternal folic acid consumption on the risk of childhood cancer. METHODS: A total of 158 related articles were obtained from PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and ProQuest using standardized keywords, of which 17 were included in the final review. RESULTS: Eleven of the 17 articles showed a significant protective association between maternal folic acid supplementation and childhood cancer. Using a random-effects model, pooled odds ratios (ORs) showed a protective association between maternal folic acid supplementation and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (OR, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66 to 0.86). However, there was no significant association between maternal folic acid supplementation and acute myeloid leukaemia (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.46 to 1.06) or childhood brain tumours (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.88 to 1.19). CONCLUSIONS: Maternal folic acid supplementation was found to have a protective effect against childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Thus, healthcare professionals are recommended to provide regular health education and health promotion to the community on the benefits of folic acid supplementation during pregnancy.","['Wan Ismail, Wan Rosmawati', 'Abdul Rahman, Raudah', 'Rahman, Nur Ashiqin Abd', 'Atil, Azman', 'Nawi, Azmawati Mohammed']","['Wan Ismail WR', 'Abdul Rahman R', 'Rahman NAA', 'Atil A', 'Nawi AM']",,"['Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Malaysia Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia.', 'Department of Community Health, Faculty of Medicine, University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Review', 'Systematic Review']",Korea (South),J Prev Med Public Health,Journal of preventive medicine and public health = Yebang Uihakhoe chi,101242972,"['0 (Protective Agents)', '12001-76-2 (Vitamin B Complex)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,,"['Dietary Supplements', 'Folic Acid/*standards/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Maternal Health Services/standards', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/*physiopathology', 'Protective Agents/therapeutic use', 'Vitamin B Complex/therapeutic use']",PMC6686110,['NOTNLM'],"['Childhood cancer', 'Folate', 'Maternal', 'Vitamin supplementation']",2019/08/09 06:00,2020/03/17 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/17 06:00 [medline]']","['jpmph.19.020 [pii]', '10.3961/jpmph.19.020 [doi]']",ppublish,J Prev Med Public Health. 2019 Jul;52(4):205-213. doi: 10.3961/jpmph.19.020.

The efficacy of TKIs compared with other ALL treatment options is emphasized by a rapid increase in the number of TKI clinical trials. Subsequently, the use of traditional approaches, such as combined chemotherapy and even allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), for the treatment of ALL is being challenged in the clinic. In light of the increased use of TKIs in the clinic, several questions have been raised. First, is it necessary to use intensive chemotherapy during the induction course of therapy to achieve a minimal residual disease (MRD)-negative status? Must a patient reach a complete molecular response/major molecular response before receiving allo-HSCT? Does MRD status affect long-term survival after allo-HSCT? Is auto-HSCT an appropriate alternative for allo-HSCT in those Ph+ ALL patients who lack suitable donors? Here, we review the recent literature in an attempt to summarize the current status of TKI usage in the clinic, including several new therapeutic approaches, provide answers for the above questions, and speculate on the future direction of TKI utilization for the treatment of Ph+ ALL patients.","['Ma, Yingying', 'Zhang, Quanchao', 'Kong, Peiyan', 'Xiong, Jingkang', 'Zhang, Xi', 'Zhang, Cheng']","['Ma Y', 'Zhang Q', 'Kong P', 'Xiong J', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang C']",,"['Hematology Department, State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Shigatse Branch, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Shigatse, China.', 'Hematology Department, State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Hematology Department, State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Hematology Department, State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University, Chongqing, China.', 'Hematology Department, State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Xinqiao Hospital of Army Medical University, Chongqing, China, chzhang2014@163.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy,0144731,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*therapeutic use']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Philadelphia chromosome', 'Tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2019/08/08 06:00,2019/11/15 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/02/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['000501061 [pii]', '10.1159/000501061 [doi]']",ppublish,Chemotherapy. 2019;64(2):81-93. doi: 10.1159/000501061.

Reactivation of p53 tumor suppressor activity, via disruption of interactions between MDM2/X and p53 in the cytosol, is a promising strategy to treat cancer. Peptides able to bind MDM2 and/or MDMX were shown to prevent MDM2/X:p53 interactions, but most possess low cell penetrability, low stability, and/or high toxicity to healthy cells. Recently, the designed peptide cHLH-p53-R was reported to possess high affinity for MDM2, resistance toward proteases, cell-penetrating properties, and toxicity toward cancer cells. This peptide uses a stable cyclic helix-loop-helix (cHLH) scaffold, which includes two helices connected with a Gly loop and cyclized to improve stability. In the current study, we were interested in examining the cell selectivity of cHLH-p53-R, its cellular internalization, and ability to reactivate the p53 pathway. We designed analogues of cHLH-p53-R and employed biochemical and biophysical methodologies using in vitro model membranes and cell-based assays to compare their structure, activity, and mode-of-action. Our studies show that cHLH is an excellent scaffold to stabilize and constrain p53-mimetic peptides with helical conformation, and reveal that anticancer properties of cHLH-p53-R are mediated by its ability to selectively target, cross, and disrupt cancer cell membranes, and not by activation of the p53 pathway. These findings highlight the importance of examining the mode-of-action of designed peptides to fully exploit their potential to develop targeted therapies.","['Philippe, Gregoire J-B', 'Gaspar, Diana', 'Sheng, Caibin', 'Huang, Yen-Hua', 'Benfield, Aurelie H', 'Condon, Nicholas D', 'Weidmann, Joachim', 'Lawrence, Nicole', 'Lower, Alexander', 'Castanho, Miguel A R B', 'Craik, David J', 'Troeira Henriques, Sonia']","['Philippe GJ', 'Gaspar D', 'Sheng C', 'Huang YH', 'Benfield AH', 'Condon ND', 'Weidmann J', 'Lawrence N', 'Lower A', 'Castanho MARB', 'Craik DJ', 'Troeira Henriques S']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9602-567X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6937-2660', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9013-1770', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7891-7562', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0007-6796', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9564-9651']","['Institute for Molecular Bioscience , the University of Queensland , St. Lucia , QLD 4072 , Australia.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular , Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa , 1649-028 Lisboa , Portugal.', 'Technische Universitat Darmstadt , 64287 Darmstadt , Germany.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience , the University of Queensland , St. Lucia , QLD 4072 , Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience , the University of Queensland , St. Lucia , QLD 4072 , Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Health & Biomedical Innovation , Queensland University of Technology , Translational Research Institute, Brisbane , QLD 4102 , Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience , the University of Queensland , St. Lucia , QLD 4072 , Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience , the University of Queensland , St. Lucia , QLD 4072 , Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience , the University of Queensland , St. Lucia , QLD 4072 , Australia.', 'Technische Universitat Darmstadt , 64287 Darmstadt , Germany.', 'Instituto de Medicina Molecular , Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa , 1649-028 Lisboa , Portugal.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience , the University of Queensland , St. Lucia , QLD 4072 , Australia.', 'Institute for Molecular Bioscience , the University of Queensland , St. Lucia , QLD 4072 , Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Sciences, Institute of Health & Biomedical Innovation , Queensland University of Technology , Translational Research Institute, Brisbane , QLD 4102 , Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,ACS Chem Biol,ACS chemical biology,101282906,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Cell-Penetrating Peptides)', '0 (Lipid Bilayers)', '0 (MDM4 protein, human)', '0 (Peptides, Cyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (MDM2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane/chemistry/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Cell-Penetrating Peptides/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Helix-Loop-Helix Motifs', 'Humans', 'Lipid Bilayers/metabolism', 'Peptides, Cyclic/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Protein Binding/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-mdm2/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'Tumor Suppressor Proteins/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity']",,,,2019/08/08 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acschembio.9b00593 [doi]'],ppublish,ACS Chem Biol. 2019 Sep 20;14(9):2071-2087. doi: 10.1021/acschembio.9b00593.

We reported success in the development of two PROTACs (C3 and C5) that potently and selectively induce the degradation of Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 (DC50 = 0.7 and 3.0 muM), respectively, by introducing the E3 ligase cereblon-binding ligand pomalidomide to Mcl-1/Bcl-2 dual inhibitors S1-6 and Nap-1 with micromolar-range affinity. C3-induced Mcl-1 ubiquitination translated into much more lethality in Mcl-1-dependent H23 cells than the most potent Mcl-1 occupancy-based inhibitor A-1210477 with nanomolar-range affinity. Moreover, structure-activity relationship analysis and molecular dynamic simulations discovered the structural basis for turning nonselective or promiscuous Bcl-2 family ligands into selective PROTACs. C3 and C5 exhibited reversible depletion in living cells, which provides a new potent toolkit for gain-of-function studies to probe the dynamic roles of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in apoptosis networks.","['Wang, Ziqian', 'He, Nianzhe', 'Guo, Zongwei', 'Niu, Cuili', 'Song, Ting', 'Guo, Yafei', 'Cao, Keke', 'Wang, Anhui', 'Zhu, Junjie', 'Zhang, Xiaodong', 'Zhang, Zhichao']","['Wang Z', 'He N', 'Guo Z', 'Niu C', 'Song T', 'Guo Y', 'Cao K', 'Wang A', 'Zhu J', 'Zhang X', 'Zhang Z']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2774-2384'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'D2UX06XLB5 (pomalidomide)']",IM,,"['Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Ligands', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Structure', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thalidomide/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,2019/08/08 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00919 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2019 Sep 12;62(17):8152-8163. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00919.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 40 AML patients. The AML cells were cultured. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) was used to detect cell proliferation and flow cytometry was applied to analyze cell cycle and determine the apoptosis rate. Moreover, the action target of lncRNA-H19 was detected through a dual-luciferase reporter assay and Western blotting was performed to detect the change in protein level. RESULTS: The expression of lncRNA-H19 in AML patients was markedly higher than that in normal controls and compared with human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293T cells, AML cell Kasumi-1 exhibited an increased lncRNA-H19 expression. LncRNA-H19 could promote cell proliferation, but suppress cell apoptosis. It is bound to micro RNA (miR)-29a-3p in a targeted manner. and the expression level of miR-29a-3p in AML patients was prominently lower than that in normal controls. After miR-29a-3p was inhibited, the expression of intranuclear beta-catenin was significantly increased and the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway critical molecules T-cell factor (TCF) and lymphoid enhancer factor 1 (LEF1) were evidently up-regulated after the down-regulation of miR-29a-3p.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, randomized study included adult patients (age >18 years) with newly diagnosed CML-CP. Patients received either a single oral dose of imatinib 400 mg/day in combination with a subcutaneous injection of ara-c 20 mg/m(2)/day (imatinib + ara-c) or a single oral dose of imatinib 400 mg/day. Primary endpoints were hematological and molecular responses at 3 months and cytogenetic responses at 6 and 12 months. Secondary endpoints included grade 3/4 hematological and nonhematological adverse events (AEs). RESULTS: Of 30 patients included, 14 were randomized to imatinib + ara-c and 16 to imatinib alone. Complete hematologic response (CHR) at 3 months was higher with imatinib + ara-c vs. imatinib alone (100% vs. 87.5%, P = 0.48). The median time to achieve CHR was significantly (P < 0.001) lower with imatinib + ara-c (32.07 vs. 23.43 days). Molecular response at 3 months was significantly higher (P = 0.04) with imatinib + ara-c vs. imatinib alone (100% vs. 68.75%). Complete cytogenetic response was also higher with imatinib + ara-c vs. imatinib alone (42.85% vs. 25% at 6 months and 71.4% vs. 62.5% at 12 months). Neutropenia followed by thrombocytopenia and anemia were the most common AEs. Grade 3/4 hematological and nausea events were significantly (P < 0.05) higher with imatinib + ara-c. Other nonhematological events were not significantly different between the treatments. The median follow-up duration was 20 months (range: 15-23 months). CONCLUSION: Imatinib with low-dose ara-c can be considered as a potential first-line treatment option for CML-CP.","['Samal, Priyanka', 'Chakrabarti, Prantar', 'Nath, Uttam K']","['Samal P', 'Chakrabarti P', 'Nath UK']",,"['Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine (IHTM), Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine (IHTM), Kolkata, West Bengal, India.', 'Institute of Hematology and Transfusion Medicine (IHTM), Kolkata, West Bengal, India.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",India,Indian J Cancer,Indian journal of cancer,0112040,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Chronic-Phase/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Safety', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'chronic phase', 'cytarabine', 'imatinib mesylate']",2019/08/08 06:00,2020/01/10 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/10 06:00 [medline]']","['IndianJournalofCancer_2019_56_3_211_263029 [pii]', '10.4103/ijc.IJC_303_18 [doi]']",ppublish,Indian J Cancer. 2019 Jul-Sep;56(3):211-215. doi: 10.4103/ijc.IJC_303_18.,,,,,['None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: The clinical data of 21 patients with JMML who were diagnosed in our hospital from January 2013 to May 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among the 21 children with JMML, 16 were male and 5 were female. Out of the 21 children who were diagnosed with JMML, 7 were lost after treatment while the remaining 14 received A-3V chemotherapy regimen of South Korea. The effective response rate was 78.5%. The three-year overall survival (OS) rate and three-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate were (76.2 +/- 14.8)% and (66.2 +/- 14)%, respectively. Single factor analysis showed that PLT count </=33x109/L, LDH level >500 U/L and HbF level >10% and chemotherapy only were the significant factors that lead to poor prognosis in children. Cox multivariate analysis showed that the choice of treatment options affected the prognosis of JMML children. By taking prognostic factors for long-term efficacy into account, patients with treatment strategy of chemotherapy alongside hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have a better prognosis. Conclusion: The PLT count, LDH level, HbF level and choice of treatment plan are important for the evaluation of prognosis for children with JMML. Although there is a lack of consistency in terms of donors but the A-3V scheme is relatively stable, so HSCT should be preferred for children with poor prognostic factors.","['Liao, Xiong-Yu', 'Qiu, Kun-Yin', 'Fang, Jian-Pei', 'Wu, Ruo-Hao', 'Guo, Shu-Yi', 'Huang, Ke', 'Zhou, Dun-Hua']","['Liao XY', 'Qiu KY', 'Fang JP', 'Wu RH', 'Guo SY', 'Huang K', 'Zhou DH']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2865-4685'],"[""a Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""b Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""b Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""b Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""b Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""b Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""b Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Paediatrics, Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China."", ""b Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Malignant Tumor Epigenetics and Gene Regulation, Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University , Guangzhou , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,,IM,,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/*diagnosis/pathology/*therapy', 'Male']",,['NOTNLM'],"['A-3V scheme', 'Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia', 'clinical features', 'diagnosis', 'disease-free survival', 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'overall survival', 'prognosis', 'treatment']",2019/08/08 06:00,2020/01/31 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2019.1651548 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2019 Dec;24(1):577-582. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2019.1651548.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Developing cellular models for these inherited diseases would enable drug discovery, benefiting feline health and welfare as well as enhancing the potential of cats as relevant animal models for translation to human medicine. Advances in our understanding of these diseases at the cellular level have come from the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs can differentiate into virtually any cell type and can be derived from adult somatic cells, therefore overcoming the ethical implications of destroying embryos to obtain embryonic stem cells. No studies, however, report the generation of iPSCs from domestic cats [feline iPSCs (fiPSCs)]. Feline adipose-derived fibroblasts were infected with amphotropic retrovirus containing the coding sequences for human Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, cMyc, and Nanog. Isolated iPSC clones were expanded on inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in the presence of feline leukemia inhibitory factor (fLIF). Retroviral delivery of human pluripotent genes gave rise to putative fiPSC colonies within 5-7 days. These iPS-like cells required fetal bovine serum and fLIF for maintenance. Colonies were domed with refractile edges, similar to mouse iPSCs. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated positive staining for stem cell markers: alkaline phosphatase, Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and SSEA1. Cells were negative for SSEA4. Expression of endogenous feline Nanog was confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The cells were able to differentiate in vitro into cells representative of the three germ layers. These results confirm the first generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from domestic cats. These cells will provide valuable models to study genetic diseases and explore novel therapeutic strategies.","['Dutton, Luke C', 'Dudhia, Jayesh', 'Guest, Deborah J', 'Connolly, David J']","['Dutton LC', 'Dudhia J', 'Guest DJ', 'Connolly DJ']",,"['Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hatfield, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hatfield, United Kingdom.', 'Centre for Preventative Medicine, Animal Health Trust, Newmarket, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Clinical Science and Services, Royal Veterinary College, University of London, Hatfield, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Stem Cells Dev,Stem cells and development,101197107,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (KLF4 protein, human)', '0 (Klf4 protein, mouse)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Factor 4)', '0 (Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lewis X Antigen)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (NANOG protein, human)', '0 (Nanog Homeobox Protein)', '0 (Octamer Transcription Factor-3)', '0 (POU5F1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (SOX2 protein, human)', '0 (SOXB1 Transcription Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",IM,,"['Adipose Tissue/cytology/metabolism', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers/metabolism', 'Cats', 'Cell Differentiation/*genetics', 'Feeder Cells', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/*metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genetic Vectors/chemistry/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Kruppel-Like Factor 4', 'Kruppel-Like Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Lewis X Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/metabolism', 'Nanog Homeobox Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Octamer Transcription Factor-3/genetics/metabolism', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'SOXB1 Transcription Factors/genetics/metabolism', 'Transfection/*methods']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*characterization', '*feline', '*induced pluripotent stem cells']",2019/08/08 06:00,2020/07/23 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/scd.2019.0142 [doi]'],ppublish,Stem Cells Dev. 2019 Oct 1;28(19):1299-1309. doi: 10.1089/scd.2019.0142.

The objective is, therefore, to examine the relation between co-morbid CVD at cancer diagnosis and HRQoL among cancer survivors diagnosed with colorectal, thyroid, prostate, endometrium, ovarian cancer, melanoma, (non-)Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), or multiple myeloma (MM) in an exploratory population-based cross-sectional study.Material and methods: Analyses were performed on combined data sets from the PROFILES and Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR). Data on co-morbid CVD at cancer diagnosis was extracted from the NCR. HRQoL was measured via PROFILES at a median of 4.6 years after cancer diagnosis. General Linear Model Analyses were run for the total group of cancer survivors and for each malignancy.Results: In total, 5930 cancer survivors (2281 colorectal, 280 thyroid, 1054 prostate, 177 endometrium, 389 ovarian cancer, 212 melanoma, 874 non-Hodgkin and 194 Hodgkin lymphoma, 242 CLL, and 227 MM survivors) were included. For the total group, survivors who had a CVD at cancer diagnosis (n = 1441, 23.4%) reported statistically significant and clinically important lower scores on global QoL and physical functioning and higher scores for dyspnea (p < .05) compared to those without CVD. Co-morbid CVD at cancer diagnosis was negatively related to global QoL, the five functional scales and the symptoms fatigue and dyspnea across most malignancies (i.e., colorectal, and prostate cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarium cancer, melanoma, and CLL). No significant relations were found among thyroid and endometrium cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma and MM survivors, likely due to small numbers.Conclusion: In conclusion, co-morbid CVD at cancer diagnosis was negatively related to HRQoL, especially to global QoL, physical and role functioning, and the symptoms fatigue and dyspnea.","['Schoormans, Dounya', 'Husson, Olga', 'Oerlemans, Simone', 'Ezendam, Nicole', 'Mols, Floortje']","['Schoormans D', 'Husson O', 'Oerlemans S', 'Ezendam N', 'Mols F']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4476-2747', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1387-8686', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1595-7262', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5878-4210', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0818-2913']","['CoRPS - Center of Research on Psychological and Somatic Disorders, Department of Medical and Clinical Psychology, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Psychosocial and Epidemiological Research, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Organisation, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Organisation, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.', 'CoRPS - Center of Research on Psychological and Somatic Disorders, Department of Medical and Clinical Psychology, Tilburg University, Tilburg, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Acta Oncol,"Acta oncologica (Stockholm, Sweden)",8709065,,IM,,"['Angina Pectoris/epidemiology', 'Arrhythmias, Cardiac/epidemiology', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/epidemiology', 'Comorbidity', 'Coronary Artery Disease/epidemiology', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Dyspnea/epidemiology', 'Fatigue/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myocardial Infarction/epidemiology', 'Neoplasms/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Netherlands/epidemiology', 'Peripheral Arterial Disease/epidemiology', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/epidemiology', '*Quality of Life']",,,,2019/08/08 06:00,2020/03/21 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/0284186X.2019.1648861 [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Oncol. 2019 Dec;58(12):1684-1691. doi: 10.1080/0284186X.2019.1648861.

As such, haematologists can play an important role in managing this complication. However, these accident and incident scenarios are complex and often involve injuries to other organs and tissues from heat, projectiles and chemicals. In the case of a large-scale event there will likely be severe infrastructure disruptions and injury or death to medical personnel. Accurate estimates of dose and uniformity of exposure are needed to intelligently direct appropriate interventions, which range from antibiotics, antifungals and anti-virus drugs, molecularly-cloned haematopoietic growth factors and, in rare instances, haematopoietic cell transplants. These therapies are ones that haematologists often use in the context of anti-cancer therapy, especially therapy of haematological cancers like leukaemia. However, most haematologists have little knowledge of radiation biology and should consider updating this aspect of their expertise in continuing medical education. As in other areas of medicine, prevention is better than cure and haematologists should be active in decreasing risks of a nuclear war.","['Gale, Robert P', 'Armitage, James O', 'Hashmi, Shahrukh K']","['Gale RP', 'Armitage JO', 'Hashmi SK']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9156-1676'],"['Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, Centre for Haematology Research, Imperial College London, London, UK.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Medicine, University of Nebraska, Omaha, NE, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', 'Oncology Centre, King Faisal Specialist Hospital Research Centre, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Humans', 'Radiation Injuries/*therapy', '*Radioactive Hazard Release', '*Whole-Body Irradiation']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*emergency response to radiological incidents', '*nuclear accidents', '*radiological accidents']",2019/08/08 06:00,2021/08/03 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/08/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16138 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2021 Mar;192(6):968-972. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16138.

Identification of new cancer biomarkers may allow for earlier detection of disease progression and treatment strategy modifications. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study to determine the feasibility and prognostic utility of droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR)-based BCSC gene mutation analysis of cfDNA in patients with breast cancer. RESULTS: Detection of quantitative BCSC gene mutation in cfDNA by ddPCR mirrors disease progression and thus may represent a valuable and cost-effective measure of tumor burden. We have previously shown that hematological and neurological expressed 1-like (HN1L), ribosomal protein L39 (RPL39), and myeloid leukemia factor 2 (MLF2) are novel targets for BCSC self-renewal, and targeting these genetic alterations could be useful for personalized genomic-based therapy. CONCLUSION: BCSC mutation detection in cfDNA may have important implications for diagnosis, prognosis, and serial monitoring.","['Liu, Zhe-Bin', 'Ezzedine, Nader E', 'Eterovic, Agda K', 'Ensor, Joe E', 'Huang, Helen J', 'Albanell, Joan', 'Choi, Dong S', 'Lluch, Ana', 'Liu, Yi', 'Rojo, Federico', 'Wong, Helen', 'Martinez-Duenas, Eduardo', 'Guerrero-Zotano, Angel', 'Shao, Zhi-Min', 'Darcourt, Jorge G', 'Mills, Gordon B', 'Dave, Bhuvanesh', 'Chang, Jenny C']","['Liu ZB', 'Ezzedine NE', 'Eterovic AK', 'Ensor JE', 'Huang HJ', 'Albanell J', 'Choi DS', 'Lluch A', 'Liu Y', 'Rojo F', 'Wong H', 'Martinez-Duenas E', 'Guerrero-Zotano A', 'Shao ZM', 'Darcourt JG', 'Mills GB', 'Dave B', 'Chang JC']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0890-9302'],"['Department of Breast Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, 20032, China.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Institute of Personalized Cancer Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Institute of Personalized Cancer Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Cancer Center, 6445 Main St P21-34, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, Department of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'GEICAM (Spanish Breast Cancer Group), San Sebastian de los Reyes, 28703, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Oncologia, CIBERONC-ISCIII, 28029, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital del Mar, 08003, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Cancer Center, 6445 Main St P21-34, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'GEICAM (Spanish Breast Cancer Group), San Sebastian de los Reyes, 28703, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Oncologia, CIBERONC-ISCIII, 28029, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Clinico Universitario de Valencia, 46010, Valencia, Spain.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Cancer Center, 6445 Main St P21-34, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'GEICAM (Spanish Breast Cancer Group), San Sebastian de los Reyes, 28703, Madrid, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Oncologia, CIBERONC-ISCIII, 28029, Madrid, Spain.', 'Fundacion Jimenez Diaz, 28040, Madrid, Spain.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Cancer Center, 6445 Main St P21-34, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'GEICAM (Spanish Breast Cancer Group), San Sebastian de los Reyes, 28703, Madrid, Spain.', 'Hospital Provincial de Castellon, 12002, Castellon, Spain.', 'GEICAM (Spanish Breast Cancer Group), San Sebastian de los Reyes, 28703, Madrid, Spain.', 'Instituto Valenciano de Oncologia, 46009, Valencia, Spain.', 'Department of Breast Surgery, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center, Shanghai, 20032, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Shanghai Medical College, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Houston Methodist Cancer Center, 6445 Main St P21-34, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology and Institute of Personalized Cancer Therapy, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Cancer Center, 6445 Main St P21-34, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Houston Methodist Research Institute, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. jcchang@houstonmethodist.org.', 'Houston Methodist Cancer Center, 6445 Main St P21-34, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. jcchang@houstonmethodist.org.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Breast Cancer Res Treat,Breast cancer research and treatment,8111104,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Circulating Tumor DNA)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast Neoplasms/blood/*genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', '*Circulating Tumor DNA', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Prognosis']",PMC8272952,['NOTNLM'],"['Breast carcinoma', 'Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction', 'Metastasis', 'Mutation', 'Stem cell']",2019/08/08 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10549-019-05374-x [doi]', '10.1007/s10549-019-05374-x [pii]']",ppublish,Breast Cancer Res Treat. 2019 Nov;178(2):251-261. doi: 10.1007/s10549-019-05374-x.

RECENT FINDINGS: Next-generation sequencing has provided valuable information on the mutational landscape of MPNs and has been used for various applications, including diagnosis, risk stratification, monitoring of residual disease or disease progression, and target therapy. Most commonly, targeted sequencing of a panel of genes that have been shown to be recurrently mutated in myeloid neoplasms is used. Although numerous studies have shown the benefit of using NGS in the routine clinical care of MPN patients, the complexity of NGS data and how these data may contribute to the clinical outcome have limited the development of a standard clinical guideline.

He underwent abscess drainage and bilateral tonsillectomy. At H36 post-surgery, he presented with tonsillar hemorrhage requiring surgical revision. Hemorrhage relapsed 2 days later, with a total of 7 episodes, 5 of which required surgical revisions. Laboratory investigations were normal except for a markedly low factor XIII (FXIII) activity at 7%. After administration of a single dose of 40 IU/kg plasma-derived FXIII (Fibrogammin((R))) I.V., the bleeding stopped with no further recurrence. FXIII activity gradually normalized (75%) at 6 weeks, confirming the transient character of factor XIII deficiency. Severe congenital FXIII deficiency (FXIIID) (<1%) is very rare (1:2,000,000 births), whereas partial congenital deficiency and/or acquired deficiency may be more frequent but likely underreported. Acquired FXIIID may result from impaired synthesis (liver failure) or increased consumption (surgery, sepsis, leukemia, Henoch-Schonlein, inflammatory bowel disease, stroke, disseminated intravascular coagulation). FXIII replacement in form of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or plasma-derived FXIII may be necessary for the presence of bleeding.","['Jankovic, M', 'Choucair, M L', 'Hallak, B', 'Hernandez, E', 'Russo, M', 'Llor, J', ""Kayemba-Kay's, S""]","['Jankovic M', 'Choucair ML', 'Hallak B', 'Hernandez E', 'Russo M', 'Llor J', ""Kayemba-Kay's S""]",,"['Pediatrics & Neonatal Medicine Department, Switzerland.', 'Pediatrics & Neonatal Medicine Department, Switzerland.', 'ENT Department - Centre Hospitalier du Valais Romand, Sion, Switzerland.', 'Pediatrics & Neonatal Medicine Department, Switzerland.', 'Pediatrics & Neonatal Medicine Department, Switzerland.', 'Pediatrics & Neonatal Medicine Department, Switzerland.', 'Pediatrics & Neonatal Medicine Department, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Netherlands,Int J Pediatr Adolesc Med,International journal of pediatrics & adolescent medicine,101670718,,,,,PMC6676365,['NOTNLM'],"['Bleeding', 'Management', 'Tonsillectomy', 'Transient factor XIII deficiency']",2019/08/08 06:00,2019/08/08 06:01,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.ijpam.2019.05.006 [doi]', 'S2352-6467(19)30011-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Pediatr Adolesc Med. 2019 Jun;6(2):55-57. doi: 10.1016/j.ijpam.2019.05.006.

Bosutinib is active against leukemia cells expressing imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL1 mutations. Mechanistically, this agent may also be beneficial for Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) because in preclinical animal models, SRC accelerates ALL disease development. Areas Covered: Here we review the current scientific and medical literature on the role of bosutinib for the treatment of CML. We address the unique therapeutic advantages of this agent, specifically its ability to inhibit mutant BCR-ABL1 kinases conferring resistance to other TKIs and its unique safety profile consisting of mainly manageable self-limited diarrhea, not cardiovascular, side effects. Long-term toxicities reported with dasatinib, nilotinib and ponatinib have not been described with bosutinib. Lastly, we present preclinical data demonstrating that bosutinib inhibits a broader range of tyrosine kinases than any other TKI, including those implicated in acute leukemia. Expert Opinion: We propose that future studies should explore the use of bosutinib in Ph+ ALL due to its multi-kinase inhibitory activity and its relatively long-term safety compared to other second and third generation TKIs.","['Varallo-Rodriguez, Cristina', 'Freyer, Craig W Jr', 'Ontiveros, Evelena P', 'Griffiths, Elizabeth A', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Wetzler, Meir']","['Varallo-Rodriguez C', 'Freyer CW Jr', 'Ontiveros EP', 'Griffiths EA', 'Wang ES', 'Wetzler M']",,"['Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.', 'Leukemia Section, Department of Medicine, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Expert Opin Orphan Drugs,Expert opinion on orphan drugs,101601398,,,,,PMC6684277,,,2015/01/01 00:00,2015/01/01 00:01,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2015/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2015/01/01 00:01 [medline]']",['10.1517/21678707.2015.1036027 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Orphan Drugs. 2015;3(5):599-608. doi: 10.1517/21678707.2015.1036027.

Methods: We produced a kind of lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticle (LPHN) with a core-shell structure in which DOX and GA were co-loaded. In vitro and in vivo leukemia therapeutic effects of the HA modified, DOX and GA co-delivered LPHNs (HA-DOX/GA-LPHNs) were evaluated in DOX resistant human HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60/ADR cells), DOX resistant human K562 chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562/ADR cells), and HL-60/ADR cells bearing mouse model. Results: The sizes and zeta potentials of HA modified LPHNs were about 160 nm and -40 mV. HA-DOX/GA-LPHNs showed the most prominent cytotoxicity and the best synergistic effect was obtained when DOX/GA ratio was 2/1. In vivo studies revealed that HA-DOX/GA-LPHNs inhibited tumor growth from 956 mm(3) to 213 mm(3), with an inhibition rate of 77.7%. Conclusion: In summary, the study showed that HA-DOX/GA-LPHNs can be applied as a promising leukemia therapy system.","['Shao, Yanping', 'Luo, Wenda', 'Guo, Qunyi', 'Li, Xiaohong', 'Zhang, Qianqian', 'Li, Jing']","['Shao Y', 'Luo W', 'Guo Q', 'Li X', 'Zhang Q', 'Li J']",,"[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou, Zhejiang 317000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou, Zhejiang 317000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Taizhou, Zhejiang 317000, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hebei Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050011, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hebei Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050011, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hebei Province Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Shijiazhuang, Hebei 050011, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Lipids)', '0 (Polymers)', '632XD903SP (Gallic Acid)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9004-61-9 (Hyaluronic Acid)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Drug Liberation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Gallic Acid/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Hyaluronic Acid/administration & dosage/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Lipids/chemistry', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Nanoparticles/chemistry', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Particle Size', 'Polymers/chemistry', 'Surface Properties']",PMC6607984,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'doxorubicin', 'gallic acid', 'lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles', 'multidrug resistance']",2019/08/08 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/01/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S202818 [doi]', '202818 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2019 Jun 28;13:2043-2055. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S202818. eCollection 2019.,,20190628,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Retrospective analysis of 218 consecutive cases of acute leukaemia diagnosed by multiparametric flow cytometry (FCM) was done. MPAL cases were identified in accordance with European Group for the Immunological Classification of Leukaemias Criteria and World Health Organization 2008/2016 guidelines for lineage assignment. Nine out of 218 (4.1%) cases were classified as MPAL. Eight out of nine patients (88.8%) were male and 4/9 (44.4%) were < 20 years of age. There were three cases of B/T and T/myeloid MPAL each. Two cases were B/myeloid MPAL and one case was chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) in B/myeloid blast crisis. B/myeloid MPAL and CML in B/myeloid blast crisis cases were Philadelphia chromosome positive. The latter case had a complex karyotype as well. Seven cases were treated with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia treatment regimen; two of them achieved complete remission (CR). The patient with CML in B/myeloid blast crisis was treated with imatinib based regimen, attained CR, underwent allogenic bone marrow stem cell transplantation, but developed graft versus host disease. Five patients died due to complications of febrile neutropenia early in the course of treatment (62.5%). The last patient (B/T MPAL) refused therapy and was lost to follow-up. Early accurate diagnosis of MPAL requires FCM. It may be misdiagnosed if a limited panel of antibodies is used.","['Koulmane Laxminarayana, Sindhura Lakshmi', 'Madireddy, Nishika', 'Manohar, Chethan', 'Udupa, Karthik']","['Koulmane Laxminarayana SL', 'Madireddy N', 'Manohar C', 'Udupa K']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-8925-0000'],"['1Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Udupi, Karnataka 576104 India.0000 0001 0571 5193grid.411639.8', ""2Department of Pathology, Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India.0000 0004 1767 2356grid.416345.1"", '1Department of Pathology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Udupi, Karnataka 576104 India.0000 0001 0571 5193grid.411639.8', '3Department of Medical Oncology, Kasturba Medical College, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India.0000 0001 0571 5193grid.411639.8']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus,Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion,9425818,,,,,PMC6646430,['NOTNLM'],"['Immunophenotype', 'Leukemia of ambiguous lineage', 'Mixed phenotype acute leukemia', 'Multiparametric flow cytometry']",2019/08/08 06:00,2019/08/08 06:01,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/08/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/08 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12288-019-01101-0 [doi]', '1101 [pii]']",ppublish,Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus. 2019 Jul;35(3):451-458. doi: 10.1007/s12288-019-01101-0.

Patients with lower family income reported higher subjective and objective burden and were more overwhelmed. Patients belonging to lower socioeconomic status reported more financial burden. Caregiver burden was higher among caregivers who reported lower perceived social support, who more often used avoidance and escape as coping and less often used acceptability-responsibility and positive appraisal coping.

The oncogenic form of FLT3 is an important therapeutic target, and inhibitors specifically targeting FLT3 kinase can induce complete remission; however, relapse after remission has been observed due to acquired resistance with secondary mutations in FLT3, highlighting the need for new strategies to target FLT3-ITD mutations. Recent studies have reported that the aberrant formations of circular RNAs (circRNAs) are biological tumorigenesis-relevant mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets. Herein, we discovered a circRNA, circMYBL2, derived from the cell-cycle checkpoint gene MYBL2. circMYBL2 is more highly expressed in AML patients with FLT3-ITD mutations than in those without the FLT3-ITD mutation. We found that circMYBL2 knockdown specifically inhibits proliferation and promotes the differentiation of FLT3-ITD AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, we found that circMYBL2 significantly influences the protein level of mutant FLT3 kinase, which contributes to the activation of FLT3-ITD-dependent signaling pathways. Mechanistically, circMYBL2 enhanced the translational efficiency of FLT3 kinase by increasing the binding of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) to FLT3 messenger RNA. Moreover, circMYBL2 knockdown impaired the cytoactivity of inhibitor-resistant FLT3-ITD+ cells, with a significant decrease in FLT3 kinase expression, followed by the inactivation of its downstream pathways. In summary, we are the first to reveal a circRNA that specifically influences FLT3-ITD AML and regulates FLT3 kinase levels through translational regulation, suggesting that circMYBL2 may be a potential therapeutic target for FLT3-ITD AML.","['Sun, Yu-Meng', 'Wang, Wen-Tao', 'Zeng, Zhan-Cheng', 'Chen, Tian-Qi', 'Han, Cai', 'Pan, Qi', 'Huang, Wei', 'Fang, Ke', 'Sun, Lin-Yu', 'Zhou, Yan-Fei', 'Luo, Xue-Qun', 'Luo, Chengwei', 'Du, Xin', 'Chen, Yue-Qin']","['Sun YM', 'Wang WT', 'Zeng ZC', 'Chen TQ', 'Han C', 'Pan Q', 'Huang W', 'Fang K', 'Sun LY', 'Zhou YF', 'Luo XQ', 'Luo C', 'Du X', 'Chen YQ']",,"['MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China; and.', ""Department of Hematology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Guangzhou, China."", 'MOE Key Laboratory of Gene Function and Regulation, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cell Cycle Proteins)', '0 (Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins)', '0 (MYBL2 protein, human)', '0 (PTBP1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '139076-35-0 (Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Proteins/*genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Disease Progression', 'Heterogeneous-Nuclear Ribonucleoproteins/*metabolism', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Polypyrimidine Tract-Binding Protein/*metabolism', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Circular/*genetics', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC6839953,,,2019/08/08 06:00,2020/02/23 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/08/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)74010-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000802 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Oct 31;134(18):1533-1546. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000802.,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our purpose was to measure cellular changes in AML associated with CB-839 treatment and to test the ability of hyperpolarized pyruvate for interrogating these changes to OCI-AML3 cells. Our results show that treatment with CB-839 interfered with the citric acid cycle, reduced the NADH/NAD(+) ratio and ATP levels, reduced cell proliferation and viability, and reduced the basal and maximal respiratory capacities [oxygen consumption rate (OCR)]. We observed a reduction of the conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate in cell lines and in a mouse AML model after CB-839 treatment. Our in vitro and in vivo results support the hypothesis that, in AML, glutamine is utilized to generate reducing equivalents (NADH, FADH2) through the citric acid cycle and that reduction in redox state by GLS inhibition decreases the rate of pyruvate to lactate conversion catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase. We propose hyperpolarized pyruvate/lactate measurement as a method for direct monitoring of metabolic changes occurring in AML patients receiving CB-839. With further optimization, this method may provide a noninvasive imaging tool to assess the early efficacy of therapeutic intervention with GLS inhibitors.","['Zacharias, Niki M', 'Baran, Natalia', 'Shanmugavelandy, Sriram S', 'Lee, Jaehyuk', 'Lujan, Juliana Velez', 'Dutta, Prasanta', 'Millward, Steven W', 'Cai, Tianyu', 'Wood, Christopher G', 'Piwnica-Worms, David', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Bhattacharya, Pratip K']","['Zacharias NM', 'Baran N', 'Shanmugavelandy SS', 'Lee J', 'Lujan JV', 'Dutta P', 'Millward SW', 'Cai T', 'Wood CG', 'Piwnica-Worms D', 'Konopleva M', 'Bhattacharya PK']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0618-4798'],"['Department of Cancer Systems Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Urology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Cancer Systems Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Cancer Systems Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Cancer Systems Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Cancer Systems Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Urology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Cancer Systems Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. pkbhattacharya@mdanderson.org mkonople@mdanderson.org.', 'Department of Cancer Systems Imaging, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas. pkbhattacharya@mdanderson.org mkonople@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['0 (Benzeneacetamides)', '0 (CB-839)', '0 (Thiadiazoles)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '8558G7RUTR (Pyruvic Acid)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Benzeneacetamides/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Lactic Acid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnostic imaging/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Pyruvic Acid/*metabolism', 'Thiadiazoles/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC7080291,,,2019/08/08 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2018/08/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-18-0985 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-0985 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2019 Nov;18(11):1937-1946. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-0985.

METHODS: We carried out a longitudinal cohort study of 1,214,506 women who delivered infants between 1989 and 2016 in Quebec, Canada. We identified women whose infants had birth defects and followed the mothers over time to identify cancers up to 28 years after delivery. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between birth defects and maternal cancer, adjusted for maternal characteristics. RESULTS: A total of 36,050 women developed cancer during 19,251,851 person-years of follow-up. Relative to no birth defects, women whose infants had defects did not have an elevated risk of cancer overall (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.99-1.06). However, associations were present with placental cancer (HR 2.23, 95% CI 1.04-4.77) and lymphoid leukemia (HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.03-2.51). Among specific birth defects, women whose infants had heart (HR 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.21) or sensory (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.04-1.30) defects had a higher risk of cancer.

It remains ill-defined how MC accumulation is established by the cutaneous microenvironment, in part because research on human MCs rarely employs MCs matured in the tissue, and extrapolations from other MC subsets have limitations, considering the high level of MC heterogeneity. Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)-released by epithelial cells, like keratinocytes, following disturbed homeostasis and inflammation-has attracted much attention, but its impact on skin MCs remains undefined, despite the vast expression of the TSLP receptor by these cells. Using several methods, each detecting a distinct component of the apoptotic process (membrane alterations, DNA degradation, and caspase-3 activity), our study pinpoints TSLP as a novel survival factor of dermal MCs. TSLP confers apoptosis resistance via concomitant activation of the TSLP/ signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-5 / myeloid cell leukemia (Mcl)-1 route and a newly uncovered TSLP/ c-Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK)/ B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-xL axis, as evidenced by RNA interference and pharmacological inhibition. Our findings highlight the potential contribution of TSLP to the MC supportive niche of the skin and, vice versa, highlight MCs as crucial responders to TSLP in the context of TSLP-driven disorders.","['Hazzan, Tarek', 'Eberle, Jurgen', 'Worm, Margitta', 'Babina, Magda']","['Hazzan T', 'Eberle J', 'Worm M', 'Babina M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-4500-7615'],"['Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergy, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Chariteplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergy, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Chariteplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergy, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Chariteplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany. margitta.worm@charite.de.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venerology and Allergy, Charite-Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Chariteplatz 1, 10117 Berlin, Germany. magda.babina@charite.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (TSLP protein, human)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', 'EC 2.7.12.2 (MAP Kinase Kinase 4)']",IM,,"['*Apoptosis', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase 4/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/metabolism', '*Signal Transduction', 'bcl-X Protein/metabolism']",PMC6721763,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bcl-xL', '*JNK', '*Mcl-1', '*RNA interference', '*STAT5', '*TSLP', '*apoptosis', '*mast cells', '*skin', '*survival']",2019/08/08 06:00,2020/04/14 06:00,['2019/08/08 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/08 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['cells8080829 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8080829 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2019 Aug 5;8(8). pii: cells8080829. doi: 10.3390/cells8080829.,,20190805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

MTT assay was carried out to determine the cell viability of HUVEC cells following pretreatment with ZCF. Fluorescent microscopy measurements were performed to evaluate apoptosis of HUVEC cells. Furthermore, the effects of ZCF on the activities of antioxidants superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde production (MDA) and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels were analyzed. Apoptosis was observed by Hoechst33258 staining and AO staining. Real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Real-time PCR) was used to detect the expression of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and aspartate proteolytic enzyme-3 (Caspase-3) mRNA. The expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2), protein kinase B (Akt), phosphorylated protein kinase B (p-Akt), Bax, Bcl-2 and Caspase-3 were detected by western blot. ZCF attenuated H2O2-induced cell death, as determined by the MTT assay. ZCF decreased malondialdehyde and lactic dehydrogenase levels, increased superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase activities and inhibited apoptosis. Moreover, pretreatment with ZCF decreased the expression of Bax and Caspase-3 at mRNA level, increased the expression of Bcl-2 mRNA level, decreased the levels of VEGFR2, Bax and Caspase-3 protein, and increased the level of p-Akt / Akt and Bcl-2 protein in HUVEC cells. These results suggested that ZCF protected against H2O2-induced injury in HUVEC cells. The mechanism for this effect is related to the enhancement of antioxidant capacity, suppression of angiogenesis and apoptosis.","['Wu, Yuche', 'Wang, Yanming', 'Nabi, Xinhua']","['Wu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Nabi X']",,"['College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi 830000, China.

Platelet recovery is an early predictor of AZA response. We prospectively studied the expression profile of transcription factors, critical for late megakaryopoiesis and changes in their expression after AZA treatment in patients with HR-MDS and LBC-AML enrolled in the BMT-AZA trial (EudraCT number 2010-019673-15). Twenty-five additional patients with low-risk (LR)-MDS were also studied. At the time of diagnosis, GATA2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in MDS as compared to controls, with increasing levels from LR- to HR-MDS/AML. RUNX1 expression was also significantly higher in MDS, as compared to controls, but no differences were found between LR- and HR-MDS. Looking at biomarkers of response, we found that patients AZA responsive had higher basal GATA1 and lower FLI1 expression, compared to those with stable or progressive disease after treatment. Univariate analysis showed that increased GATA2 mRNA expression was associated with a worse overall survival. Our findings suggest that high GATA2 expression is a poor prognostic marker for survival in patients with HR-MDS and LBC-AML treated with azacitidine. Moreover, GATA1 and FLI1 mRNA expression may predict response to AZA treatment.","['Falconi, Giulia', 'Fabiani, Emiliano', 'Criscuolo, Marianna', 'Fianchi, Luana', 'Finelli, Carlo', 'Cerqui, Elisa', 'Pelosi, Elvira', 'Screnci, Maria', 'Gurnari, Carmelo', 'Zangrilli, Ilaria', 'Postorino, Massimiliano', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Piciocchi, Alfonso', 'Testa, Ugo', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Voso, Maria Teresa']","['Falconi G', 'Fabiani E', 'Criscuolo M', 'Fianchi L', 'Finelli C', 'Cerqui E', 'Pelosi E', 'Screnci M', 'Gurnari C', 'Zangrilli I', 'Postorino M', 'Laurenti L', 'Piciocchi A', 'Testa U', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Voso MT']",,"['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Rome Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Dipartimento Scienze Radiologiche Radioterapiche ed Ematologiche, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

Confirming the underlying etiology in a timely manner is crucial as, while infiltration carries a poor prognosis, treatment modalities can have serious consequences themselves. Methods: A review of the literature was conducted for cases of isolated optic neuropathy in the context of leukemia or lymphoma, in which the underlying etiology remained unclear following initial clinical examination and neuroimaging. Clinical, radiological, and pathological characteristics of the cases are summarized. Results: Ninety-two cases meeting inclusion criteria were identified. Leukemic or lymphomatous infiltration was the presumed diagnosis in 72% of the reports, indicating this is the most likely etiology in such cases. The remaining reports were attributed to inflammation, infection, or drug toxicity. For illustrative purposes, the previously unpublished case of an 11-year-old girl with remitted T lymphoblastic lymphoma is presented. She suffered recurrence in the form of isolated left optic nerve infiltration that required transconjunctival biopsy to confirm diagnosis. Conclusions: Optic nerve infiltration by leukemia or lymphoma requires both diagnostic certainty and urgent management. Recommendations are made for a step-wise, yet rapid investigative approach that may ultimately require biopsy of the optic nerve.","['Myers, Kenneth A', 'Nikolic, Ana', 'Romanchuk, Kenneth', 'Weis, Ezekiel', 'Brundler, Marie-Anne', 'Lafay-Cousin, Lucie', 'Costello, Fiona']","['Myers KA', 'Nikolic A', 'Romanchuk K', 'Weis E', 'Brundler MA', 'Lafay-Cousin L', 'Costello F']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, Section of Neurology;

Immunodeficiency, chemotherapy or chronic steroids use increase the risk of developing LD. Extrapulmonary manifestations of LD include cardiac complications: myocarditis, pericarditis or endocarditis. A CASE REPORT: The authors describe a case of a 51-year-old female with a history of cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, Sjogren syndrome and chronic lymphocytic leukemia who was admitted due to a high fever, fatigue, tachycardia, dyspnea and cough. Chest X-ray and CT showed bilateral pulmonary infiltrations and pleural effusion. LD was diagnosed on positive L. pneumophila urinary antigen test. Echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction with substantially decreased ejection fraction and global longitudinal strain (GLS), with a pattern resembling reverse takotsubo syndrome (rTTS). The coronary arteries in non-invasive coronary angiography were normal. During therapy with levofloxacin and intravenous immunoglobulins as well as with carvedilol, ramipril and diuretics, gradual clinical improvement with complete normalization of LV function was observed within 5 weeks. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) performed on day 35 revealed only small intramural foci of late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) with localization not corresponding to the most decreased regional longitudinal strain in the initial echocardiographic examination. The authors suggest that the mechanism of transient LV dysfunction in the case presented may have been of complex nature, including LD myocarditis and stress-induced cardiomyopathy (with the prevalence of the latter) which has not so far been reported in the literature.","['Elikowski, Waldemar', 'Malek-Elikowska, Malgorzata', 'Greberska, Weronika', 'Fertala, Natalia', 'Zawodna, Magdalena', 'Marchlewska, Joanna', 'Dudziak, Joanna']","['Elikowski W', 'Malek-Elikowska M', 'Greberska W', 'Fertala N', 'Zawodna M', 'Marchlewska J', 'Dudziak J']",,"['Jozef Strus Hospital, Poznan, Poland: Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poland: 2nd Department of Cardiology.', 'Jozef Strus Hospital, Poznan, Poland: Department of Cardiology.', 'Jozef Strus Hospital, Poznan, Poland: Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Jozef Strus Hospital, Poznan, Poland: Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Jozef Strus Hospital, Poznan, Poland: Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Jozef Strus Hospital, Poznan, Poland: Department of Cardiology.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Poland,Pol Merkur Lekarski,Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego,9705469,"['0 (Contrast Media)', 'AU0V1LM3JT (Gadolinium)']",IM,,"['Contrast Media', 'Female', 'Gadolinium', 'Humans', '*Legionella', '*Legionella pneumophila', ""*Legionnaires' Disease/complications"", 'Middle Aged', '*Pneumonia/complications', '*Ventricular Dysfunction, Left/etiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Legionella pneumophila', ""Legionnaires' disease"", 'longitudinal strain', 'myocarditis', 'reversible heart failure', 'stress+induced cardiomyopathy', 'takotsubo syndrome', 'transient left ventricular dysfunction']",2019/08/07 06:00,2019/10/17 06:00,['2019/08/07 06:00'],"['2019/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/17 06:00 [medline]']",['PML277-019 [pii]'],ppublish,Pol Merkur Lekarski. 2019 Jul 29;47(277):19-24.,['(c) 2019 MEDPRESS.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to define the risk factors for bacteremia in febrile neutropenic children with hemato-oncological malignancies. Materials and methods: The records of 150 patients aged </=18 years who developed FN in hematology and oncology clinics were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with bacteremia were compared to patients with negative blood cultures. Results: The mean age of the patients was 7.5 +/- 4.8 years. Leukemia was more prevalent than solid tumors (61.3% vs. 38.7%). Bacteremia was present in 23.3% of the patients. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most frequently isolated microorganism. Leukopenia, severe neutropenia, positive peripheral blood and central line cultures during the previous 3 months, presence of a central line, previous FN episode(s), hypotension, tachycardia, and tachypnea were found to be risk factors for bacteremia. Positive central line cultures during the previous 3 months and presence of previous FN episode(s) were shown to increase bacteremia risk by 2.4-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. Conclusion: Presence of a bacterial growth in central line cultures during the previous 3 months and presence of any previous FN episode(s) were shown to increase bacteremia risk by 2.4-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. These factors can predict bacteremia in children with FN.","['Kara, Soner Sertan', 'Tezer, Hasan', 'Polat, Meltem', 'Cura Yayla, Burcu Ceylan', 'Bedir Demirdag, Tugba', 'Okur, Arzu', 'Fettah, Ali', 'Kanik Yuksek, Saliha', 'Tapisiz, Anil', 'Kaya, Zuhre', 'Ozbek, Namik', 'Yenicesu, Idil', 'Yarali, Nese', 'Kocak, Ulker']","['Kara SS', 'Tezer H', 'Polat M', 'Cura Yayla BC', 'Bedir Demirdag T', 'Okur A', 'Fettah A', 'Kanik Yuksek S', 'Tapisiz A', 'Kaya Z', 'Ozbek N', 'Yenicesu I', 'Yarali N', 'Kocak U']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8129-6063', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6871-4112', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4608-1286', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5153-2136', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6341-1849', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2043-0748', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4109-2143', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2538-2872', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6897-8297', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3798-7246', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6857-0681', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2819-6327', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5488-2385', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8701-5285']","['Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ankara Hematology Oncology Children's Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey"", ""Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Ankara Hematology Oncology Children's Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey"", 'Department of Pediatric Infectious Diseases, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ankara Hematology Oncology Children's Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey"", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology, Ankara Hematology Oncology Children's Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey"", 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Ankara, Turkey']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Med Sci,Turkish journal of medical sciences,9441758,,IM,,"['Adolescent', '*Bacteremia/complications/epidemiology/physiopathology', '*Chemotherapy-Induced Febrile Neutropenia/complications/epidemiology/physiopathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/complications/epidemiology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",PMC7018307,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bacteremia', '*children', '*febrile neutropenia', '*risk factor']",2019/08/07 06:00,2020/02/19 06:00,['2019/08/07 06:00'],"['2019/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3906/sag-1901-90 [doi]'],epublish,Turk J Med Sci. 2019 Aug 8;49(4):1198-1205. doi: 10.3906/sag-1901-90.,"['This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International', 'License.']",20190808,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Compared to children with ALL and no DS (non-DS-ALL), those with DS and ALL (DS-ALL) harbor uncommon genetic alterations, suggesting DS-ALL could have distinct biological features. Recent studies have implicated several genes on chromosome 21 in DS-ALL, but the precise mechanisms predisposing children with DS to ALL remain unknown. Our integrated genetic/epigenetic analysis revealed that DS-ALL was highly heterogeneous with many subtypes. Although each subtype had genetic/epigenetic profiles similar to those found in non-DS-ALL, the subtype distribution differed significantly between groups. The Philadelphia chromosome-like subtype, a high-risk B-cell lineage variant relatively rare among the entire pediatric ALL population, was the most common form in DS-ALL. Hypermethylation of RUNX1 on chromosome 21 was also found in DS-ALL, but not non-DS-ALL. RUNX1 is essential for differentiation of blood cells, especially B cells; thus, hypermethylation of the RUNX1 promoter in B-cell precursors might be associated with increased incidence of B-cell precursor ALL in DS patients.","['Kubota, Yasuo', 'Uryu, Kumiko', 'Ito, Tatsuya', 'Seki, Masafumi', 'Kawai, Tomoko', 'Isobe, Tomoya', 'Kumagai, Tadayuki', 'Toki, Tsutomu', 'Yoshida, Kenichi', 'Suzuki,

Therefore, the development of new therapeutic approaches is necessary. Various studies have shown that certain cancers, including some chemoresistant AML subsets, have upregulated oxidative phosphorylation. In this study, we aimed to assess treatment-resistant AML patients' cell modulation using oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors metformin and atovaquone alone and in various combinations with cytosine analog cytarabine and apoptosis inducer venetoclax. Metabolic activity analysis using Agilent Seahorse XF Extracellular Flux Analyzer revealed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells' metabolic state was different among treatment-resistant AML patients. We demonstrated that metformin decreased therapy-resistant-AML cell oxidative phosphorylation ex vivo, cotreatment with cytarabine and venetoclax slightly increased the effect. However, treatment with atovaquone did not have a marked effect in our experiment. Cell treatment had a slight effect on cell proliferation inhibition; combination of metformin, cytarabine, and venetoclax had the strongest effect. Moreover, a slightly higher effect on cell proliferation and cell cycle regulation was demonstrated in the cells with higher initial oxidative phosphorylation rate as demonstrated by gene expression analysis using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Proteomic analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated that chemoresistant AML cell treatment with metformin modulated metabolic pathways, while metformin combination with cytarabine and venetoclax boosted the effect. We suggest that oxidative phosphorylation inhibition is effective but not sufficient for chemoresistant AML treatment. Indeed, it causes anticancerous changes that might have an important additive role in combinatory treatment.","['Vitkeviciene, Aida', 'Janulis, Vytautas', 'Zucenka, Andrius', 'Borutinskaite, Veronika', 'Kaupinis, Algirdas', 'Valius, Mindaugas', 'Griskevicius, Laimonas', 'Navakauskiene, Ruta']","['Vitkeviciene A', 'Janulis V', 'Zucenka A', 'Borutinskaite V', 'Kaupinis A', 'Valius M', 'Griskevicius L', 'Navakauskiene R']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9347-5333'],"['Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Centre of Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Proteomics Centre, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Proteomics Centre, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Centre of Hematology, Oncology and Transfusion Medicine, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania.', 'Department of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry, Life Sciences Center, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Carcinog,Molecular carcinogenesis,8811105,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '9100L32L2N (Metformin)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism/pathology', 'Metformin/*pharmacology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Oxidative Phosphorylation/drug effects', '*Proteomics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*metabolism', '*metformin']",2019/08/07 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/08/07 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mc.23092 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Carcinog. 2019 Nov;58(11):2008-2016. doi: 10.1002/mc.23092.

Thus, to analyze the performance of decitabine in clinical practice, we pooled together patient-level data of three multicentric observational studies conducted since 2013 throughout Italy, including 306 elderly AML patients (median age 75 years), unfit for intensive chemotherapy, treated with first-line decitabine therapy at the registered schedule of 20 mg/m(2) /iv daily for 5 days every 4 weeks. Overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS) curves, and multivariate hazard ratios (HRs) of all-cause mortality were computed. Overall, 1940 cycles of therapy were administered (median, 5 cycles/patient). A total of 148 subjects were responders and, therefore, ORR was 48.4%. Seventy-one patients (23.2%) had complete remission, 32 (10.5%) had partial remission, and 45 (14.7%) had haematologic improvement. Median OS was 11.6 months for patients with favourable-intermediate cytogenetic risk and 7.9 months for those with adverse cytogenetic risk. Median relapse-free survival after CR was 10.9 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.7-16.0). In multivariate analysis, mortality was higher in patients with adverse cytogenetic risk (HR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.13-2.21) and increased continuously with white blood cell (WBC) count (HR=1.12; 95% CI: 1.06-1.18). A total of 183 infectious adverse events occurred in 136 patients mainly (>90%) within the first five cycles of therapy. This pooled analysis of clinical care studies confirmed, outside of clinical trials, the effectiveness of decitabine as first-line therapy for AML in elderly patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy. An adverse cytogenetic profile and a higher WBC count at diagnosis were, in this real life setting, unfavourable predictors of survival.","['Bocchia, Monica', 'Candoni, Anna', 'Borlenghi, Erika', 'Defina, Marzia', 'Fili, Carla', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Sammartano, Vincenzo', 'Fanin, Renato', 'Sciume, Margherita', 'Sicuranza, Anna', 'Imbergamo, Silvia', 'Riva, Marta', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola', 'Latagliata, Roberto', 'Caizzi, Emanuela', 'Mazziotta, Francesco', 'Alunni, Giulia', 'Di Bona, Eros', 'Crugnola, Monica', 'Rossi, Marianna', 'Consoli, Ugo', 'Fontanelli, Giulia', 'Greco, Giuseppina', 'Nadali, Gianpaolo', 'Rotondo, Francesco', 'Todisco, Elisabetta', 'Bigazzi, Catia', 'Capochiani, Enrico', 'Molteni, Alfredo', 'Bernardi, Massimo', 'Fumagalli, Monica', 'Rondoni, Michela', 'Scappini, Barbara', 'Ermacora, Anna', 'Simonetti, Federico', 'Gottardi, Michele', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers, Daniela', 'Michieli, Mariagrazia', 'Basilico, Claudia', 'Galeone, Carlotta', 'Pelucchi, Claudio', 'Rossi, Giuseppe']","['Bocchia M', 'Candoni A', 'Borlenghi E', 'Defina M', 'Fili C', 'Cattaneo C', 'Sammartano V', 'Fanin R', 'Sciume M', 'Sicuranza A', 'Imbergamo S', 'Riva M', 'Fracchiolla N', 'Latagliata R', 'Caizzi E', 'Mazziotta F', 'Alunni G', 'Di Bona E', 'Crugnola M', 'Rossi M', 'Consoli U', 'Fontanelli G', 'Greco G', 'Nadali G', 'Rotondo F', 'Todisco E', 'Bigazzi C', 'Capochiani E', 'Molteni A', 'Bernardi M', 'Fumagalli M', 'Rondoni M', 'Scappini B', 'Ermacora A', 'Simonetti F', 'Gottardi M', 'Lambertenghi Deliliers D', 'Michieli M', 'Basilico C', 'Galeone C', 'Pelucchi C', 'Rossi G']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4436-1310', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4666-3817', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7741-862X']","['Unita di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese e Universita di Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Clinica Ematologica, Centro Trapianti e Terapie Cellulari, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata, Udine, Italy.', 'UO Ematologia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Unita di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese e Universita di Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Clinica Ematologica, Centro Trapianti e Terapie Cellulari, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata, Udine, Italy.', 'UO Ematologia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Unita di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese e Universita di Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Clinica Ematologica, Centro Trapianti e Terapie Cellulari, Azienda Sanitaria Universitaria Integrata, Udine, Italy.', 'UO Ematologia, ASST Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Unita di Ematologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese e Universita di Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Ematologia ed Immunologia Clinica, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria, Padua, Italy.', 'S.C.

Acid-reducing agents (ARAs; e.g., proton pump inhibitors) are frequently used during AML treatment. Since quizartinib demonstrates pH-dependent solubility, the effect of lansoprazole coadministration on pharmacokinetics (PK) of quizartinib tablet formulation was assessed. METHODS: An open-label, parallel-group study randomized 64 healthy adults to single-dose quizartinib 30 mg alone (reference) or lansoprazole (60 mg once daily, days 1-5) + single-dose quizartinib 30 mg (day 5) (test). Plasma concentrations of quizartinib and its active metabolite, AC886, were measured to 504 h postdose; the effect of lansoprazole on quizartinib PK was assessed by analysis of variance. RESULTS: Quizartinib geometric mean ratios (test/reference) and 90% confidence intervals for maximum observed plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration-time curve to last measurable drug concentration (AUClast), and AUC to infinity were 86.11% (78.4%, 94.6%), 93.96% (79.6%, 110.9%), and 95.30% (80.2%, 113.3%), respectively. Comparisons showed a modest decrease in quizartinib absorption when co-administered with lansoprazole, with lower limits for Cmax and AUClast just below 80-125% limits. Treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate; the most frequent in either treatment group were headache [quizartinib alone: (n = 3) 10%], upper respiratory tract infection [quizartinib alone: (n = 2) 6.7%; lansoprazole + quizartinib: (n = 3) 9.1%], and muscle tightness [quizartinib alone: (n = 2) 6.7%]. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant lansoprazole had minimal effect on quizartinib PK as a formulated tablet, indicating that quizartinib can be administered with ARAs.","['Li, Jianke', 'Trone, Denise', 'Mendell, Jeanne', ""O'Donnell, Patrick"", 'Cook, Natalie']","['Li J', 'Trone D', 'Mendell J', ""O'Donnell P"", 'Cook N']",,"['Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., 10201 Wateridge Circle, Suite 240, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA. jiankelius@yahoo.com.', 'Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., 10201 Wateridge Circle, Suite 240, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., Basking Ridge, NJ, USA.', 'Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., 10201 Wateridge Circle, Suite 240, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.', 'Daiichi Sankyo, Inc., 10201 Wateridge Circle, Suite 240, San Diego, CA, 92121, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Proton Pump Inhibitors)', '0K5C5T2QPG (Lansoprazole)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', '*Benzothiazoles/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Monitoring/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Lansoprazole/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Phenylurea Compounds/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Proton Pump Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics', 'Treatment Outcome', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC6768889,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Drug interaction', '*Gastric acid modifier', '*Proton pump inhibitor', '*Quizartinib']",2019/08/07 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/08/07 06:00'],"['2019/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00280-019-03915-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00280-019-03915-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 2019 Oct;84(4):799-807. doi: 10.1007/s00280-019-03915-1.

It is a progressive disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness caused by selective vulnerability of upper and lower motor neurons. In disease research, it has been common to use mouse models carrying mutations in responsible genes for familial ALS as pathological models of ALS. However, there is no model that has reproduced the actual conditions of human spinal cord pathology. Thus, we developed a method of producing human spinal motor neurons using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and an innovative experimental technique for drug screening. As a result, ropinirole hydrochloride was eventually discovered after considering such results as its preferable transitivity in the brain and tolerability, including possible adverse reactions. Therefore, we explore the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ropinirole hydrochloride as an ALS treatment in this clinical trial. Methods: The ROPALS trial is a single-center double-blind randomized parallel group-controlled trial of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the ropinirole hydrochloride extended-release tablet (Requip CR) at 2- to 16-mg doses in patients with ALS. Twenty patients will be recruited for the active drug group (fifteen patients) and placebo group (five patients). All patients will be able to receive the standard ALS treatment of riluzole if not changed the dosage during this trial. The primary outcome will be safety and tolerability at 24 weeks, defined from the date of randomization. Secondary outcome will be the efficacy, including any change in the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), change in the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS), and the composite endpoint as a sum of Z-transformed scores on various clinical items. Notably, we will perform an explorative search for a drug effect evaluation using the patient-derived iPSCs to prove this trial concept. Eligible patients will have El Escorial Possible, clinically possible and laboratory-supported, clinically probable, or clinically definite amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with disease duration less than 60 months (inclusive), an ALSFRS-R score >/=2 points on all items and age from 20 to 80 years. Conclusion: Patient recruitment began in December 2018 and the last patient is expected to complete the trial protocol in November 2020.

Dysregulation of LSD1 has been implicated in the development of various cancers. Herein, we report the discovery of the hit compound 8a (IC50 = 3.93mumol/L) and further medicinal chemistry efforts, leading to the generation of compound 15u (IC50 = 49nmol/L, and K i = 16nmol/L), which inhibited LSD1 reversibly and competitively with H3K4me2, and was selective to LSD1 over MAO-A/B. Docking studies were performed to rationalize the potency of compound 15u. Compound 15u also showed strong antiproliferative activity against four leukemia cell lines (OCL-AML3, K562, THP-1 and U937) as well as the lymphoma cell line Raji with the IC50 values of 1.79, 1.30, 0.45, 1.22 and 1.40mumol/L, respectively. In THP-1 cell line, 15u significantly inhibited colony formation and caused remarkable morphological changes. Compound 15u induced expression of CD86 and CD11b in THP-1 cells, confirming its cellular activity and ability of inducing differentiation. The findings further indicate that targeting LSD1 is a promising strategy for AML treatment, the triazole-fused pyrimidine derivatives are new scaffolds for the development of LSD1/KDM1A inhibitors.","['Li, Zhonghua', 'Ding, Lina', 'Li, Zhongrui', 'Wang, Zhizheng', 'Suo, Fengzhi', 'Shen, Dandan', 'Zhao, Taoqian', 'Sun, Xudong', 'Wang, Junwei', 'Liu, Ying', 'Ma, Liying', 'Zhao, Bing',

Based on each patients unique characteristics, more accurate dosages and drug selection can be made to achieve better therapeutic efficacy and less adverse reactions in precision medicine. A patients individual parameters that affect drug transporter action can be used to develop a precision medicine guidance, due to the fact that therapeutic efficacy and adverse reactions of drugs can both be affected by expression and function of drug transporters on the cell membrane surface. The purpose of this review is to summarize unique characteristics of human breast cancer resistant protein (BCRP) and the genetic variability in the BCRP encoded gene ABCG2 in the development of precision medicine. Inter-individual variability of BCRP/ABCG2 can impact choices and outcomes of drug treatment for several diseases, including cancer chemotherapy. Several factors have been implicated in expression and function of BCRP, including genetic, epigenetic, physiologic, pathologic, and environmental factors. Understanding the roles of these factors in controlling expression and function of BCRP is critical for the development of precision medicine based on BCRP-mediated drug transport.","['Chen, Liming', 'Manautou, Jose E', 'Rasmussen, Theodore P', 'Zhong, Xiao-Bo']","['Chen L', 'Manautou JE', 'Rasmussen TP', 'Zhong XB']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, USA.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, School of Pharmacy, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT 06269, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Acta Pharm Sin B,Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

The aim of this study was to gain comprehensive insights into the activity of signaling pathways in AML. In this study, using a high-throughput PepChip Kinomics microarray system, pediatric AML samples were analyzed to gain insights of active signal transduction pathway. Unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis separated the AML blast profiles into two clusters. These two clusters were independent of patient characteristics, whereas the cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) was significantly higher in the patients belonging to cluster-2. In addition, cluster-2 samples showed to be significantly less sensitive to various chemotherapeutic drugs. The activated peptides in cluster-1 and cluster-2 reflected the activity of cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, PI3K/AKT, MAPK, metabolism regulation, transcription factors and GPCRs signaling pathways. The difference between two clusters might be explained by the higher cell cycle arrest response in cluster-1 patients and higher DNA repair mechanism in cluster-2 patients. In conclusion, our study identifies different signaling profiles in pediatric AML in relation with CIR involving DNA damage response and repair.","['Mahmud, Hasan', 'Ter Elst, Arja', 'Scherpen, Frank J G', 'Boer, Tiny Meeuwsen-de', 'Kampen, Kim R', 'de Haas, Valerie', 'Guryev, Victor', 'Peppelenbosch, Maikel M', 'Kornblau, Steven M', 'de Bont, Eveline S J M']","['Mahmud H', 'Ter Elst A', 'Scherpen FJG', 'Boer TM', 'Kampen KR', 'de Haas V', 'Guryev V', 'Peppelenbosch MM', 'Kornblau SM', 'de Bont ESJM']",,"['Stephenson Cancer Center, The University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands."", ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands."", 'Dutch Childhood Oncology Group, Stichting Kinderoncologie Nederland, The Hague, The Netherlands.', 'Laboratory of Genome Structure and Aging, European Research Institute for the Biology of Aging, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Beatrix Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC6659796,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'DNA damage and repair', 'leukemia', 'peptide microarray', 'signal transduction']",2019/08/07 06:00,2019/08/07 06:01,['2019/08/07 06:00'],"['2019/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/07 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27086 [doi]', '27086 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2019 Jul 23;10(45):4679-4690. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27086. eCollection 2019 Jul 23.,,20190723,,,['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare no competing financial interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the influence of CAR-T therapy on host immune system has not been well elucidated. Thus, We applied high-throughput T cell receptor beta chain sequencing to track the dynamic change of T-cell repertoire induced by CAR-T therapy in B-cell ALL patients. Six Chinese patients achieving complete remission were under observation, whose blood samples, bone marrow samples and infused CAR-T samples were collected at serial time points before and after CAR-T therapy. We observed decreased TCR diversity and increased clonality of T-cell repertoire in both peripheral blood and bone marrow after CAR-T administration. The persistent T cell clones in blood and bone marrow expanded following leukemic cell destruction and were barely detected in CAR T-cell pool. For the first time, our results demonstrated CAR-T therapy could stimulate the clonal proliferation of CAR-negative T cells in patients. Considering other groups' animal results indicating that CAR-T therapy could facilitate the proliferation of tumor antigen-specific T cells and that the emergence of these T cell clones followed the destruction of leukemic cells, they are most likely tumor antigen-specific.","['Wang, Xiujian', 'Hu, Yongxian', 'Liu, Xiao', 'Yu, Jian', 'Xu, Pengfei', 'Wei, Guoqing', 'Jin, Chao', 'Wu, Wenjun', 'Fu,

Serumfree light-chain (sFLC) measures are a prognostic factor for CLL, but their role in susceptibility to CLL is not clear. We investigated differences between sFLC measurements in pre-treatment serum from five groups to inform the association of sFLC with familial and sporadic CLL: (1) familial CLL (n = 154), (2) sporadic CLL (n = 302), (3) familial MBL (n = 87), (4) unaffected first-degree relatives from CLL/MBL families (n = 263), and (5) reference population (n = 15,396). The percent of individuals having elevated monoclonal and polyclonal sFLCs was compared using age-stratified and age- and sex-adjusted logistic regression models. In age groups >50 years, monoclonal sFLC elevations were increased in sporadic and familial CLL cases compared to the reference population (p's < 0.05). However, there were no statistically significant differences in sFLC monoclonal or polyclonal elevations between familial and sporadic CLL cases (p's > 0.05).

Primary human hemangioma endothelial cells (HemECs) were isolated from fresh surgical specimens of patients. HemECs was treated with LBP and the changes in proliferative and apoptotic signaling pathways were investigated by performing cell counting kit-8, cloning formation experiment, in vitro angiogenesis experiment, flow cytometry, Western blot, immunofluorescence, HE stain and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. We found that LBP potently inhibited the proliferation of HemECs and achieved a low-micromolar IC50 (45 and 40 mug/ml, the half maximal inhibitory concentration) value and less angiogenesis, however, the IC50 had no effect on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) viability. LBP treatment induced apoptosis in HemECs, which was supported by positive Annexin-V-FITC staining, the activation of cleaved caspase-3 and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) and the inhibition of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia-2 (Bcl-2). Moreover, the result demonstrated that LBP suppressed the expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), Ki67, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGFR2 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signal pathway. PI3K-specific agonist (IGF-1) had promotive effects on HemECs proliferation, which was reversed by LBP. Our study suggests that the effectiveness of LBP in IHs may be associated with its potent anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities in HemECs. Thus, our findings may provide an effective medicine for IHs treatment.","['Lou, Lin', 'Chen, Guo', 'Zhong, Bing', 'Liu, Feng']","['Lou L', 'Chen G', 'Zhong B', 'Liu F']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4198-5806'],"['Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, West China Hospital, West China Medical School, Sichuan University China, No. 37 Guo Xue Alley, Chengdu City 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', ""Department of Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery, The People's Hospital of Jianyang City, No. 180, Hospital Road, Jianyang City 641400, Sichuan Province, China."", 'Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, West China Hospital, West China Medical School, Sichuan University China, No. 37 Guo Xue Alley, Chengdu City 610041, Sichuan Province, China.', 'Department of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, West China Hospital, West China Medical School, Sichuan University China, No. 37 Guo Xue Alley, Chengdu City 610041, Sichuan Province, China liufeg_lf@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biosci Rep,Bioscience reports,8102797,"['0 (Polysaccharides)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Female', 'Hemangioma/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Lycium/*chemistry', 'Male', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Polysaccharides/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",PMC6702356,['NOTNLM'],"['*HemECs', '*Infantile hemangioma', '*Lycium barbarum polysaccharide', '*PI3K/AKT signal pathway', '*apoptosis']",2019/08/07 06:00,2020/09/10 06:00,['2019/08/07 06:00'],"['2019/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']","['BSR20191182 [pii]', '10.1042/BSR20191182 [doi]']",epublish,Biosci Rep. 2019 Aug 19;39(8). pii: BSR20191182. doi: 10.1042/BSR20191182.

However, it remains to be determined how PRC2 activity is regulated in normal and diseased settings. We here report a PRC2-associated cofactor, PHD finger protein 19 (PHF19; also known as polycomb-like 3), as a crucial mediator of tumorigenicity in multiple myeloma (MM). Overexpression and/or genomic amplification of PHF19 is found associated with malignant progression of MM and plasma cell leukemia, correlating to worse treatment outcomes. Using various MM models, we demonstrated a critical requirement of PHF19 for tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PHF19-mediated oncogenic effect relies on its PRC2-interacting and chromatin-binding functions. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing profiling showed a critical role for PHF19 in maintaining the H3K27me3 landscape. PHF19 depletion led to loss of broad H3K27me3 domains, possibly due to impaired H3K27me3 spreading from cytosine guanine dinucleotide islands, which is reminiscent to the reported effect of an ""onco""-histone mutation, H3K27 to methionine (H3K27M). RNA-sequencing-based transcriptome profiling in MM lines also demonstrated a requirement of PHF19 for optimal silencing of PRC2 targets, which include cell cycle inhibitors and interferon-JAK-STAT signaling genes critically involved in tumor suppression. Correlation studies using patient sample data sets further support a clinical relevance of the PHF19-regulated pathways. Lastly, we show that MM cells are generally sensitive to PRC2 inhibitors. Collectively, this study demonstrates that PHF19 promotes MM tumorigenesis through enhancing H3K27me3 deposition and PRC2's gene-regulatory functions, lending support for PRC2 blockade as a means for MM therapeutics.","['Ren, Zhihong', 'Ahn, Jeong Hyun', 'Liu, Hequn', 'Tsai, Yi-Hsuan', 'Bhanu, Natarajan V', 'Koss, Brian', 'Allison, David F', 'Ma, Anqi', 'Storey, Aaron J', 'Wang, Ping', 'Mackintosh, Samuel G', 'Edmondson, Ricky D', 'Groen, Richard W J', 'Martens, Anton C', 'Garcia, Benjamin A', 'Tackett, Alan J', 'Jin, Jian', 'Cai, Ling', 'Zheng, Deyou', 'Wang, Gang Greg']","['Ren Z', 'Ahn JH', 'Liu H', 'Tsai YH', 'Bhanu NV', 'Koss B', 'Allison DF', 'Ma A', 'Storey AJ', 'Wang P', 'Mackintosh SG', 'Edmondson RD', 'Groen RWJ', 'Martens AC', 'Garcia BA', 'Tackett AJ', 'Jin J', 'Cai L', 'Zheng D', 'Wang GG']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-8417-1792', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2107-4300', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4089-5008', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3672-4460', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2387-3862', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7210-9940']","['Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Epigenetics Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Center for Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery, Departments of Pharmacological Sciences and Oncological Sciences, Tisch Cancer Institute, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Department of Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam UMC, Cancer Center Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Epigenetics Institute, Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR.', ""Arkansas Children's Research Institute and UAMS Winthrop P.

Although fetal B-lymphopoiesis remains poorly defined, it is key to understanding leukemia initiation in early life. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the human fetal B-cell developmental hierarchy. We report the presence in fetal tissues of 2 distinct CD19(+) B-progenitors, an adult-type CD10+ve ProB-progenitor and a new CD10-ve PreProB-progenitor, and describe their molecular and functional characteristics. PreProB-progenitors and ProB-progenitors appear early in the first trimester in embryonic liver, followed by a sustained second wave of B-progenitor development in fetal bone marrow (BM), where together they form >40% of the total hematopoietic stem cell/progenitor pool. Almost one-third of fetal B-progenitors are CD10-ve PreProB-progenitors, whereas, by contrast, PreProB-progenitors are almost undetectable (0.53% +/- 0.24%) in adult BM. Single-cell transcriptomics and functional assays place fetal PreProB-progenitors upstream of ProB-progenitors, identifying them as the first B-lymphoid-restricted progenitor in human fetal life. Although fetal BM PreProB-progenitors and ProB-progenitors both give rise solely to B-lineage cells, they are transcriptionally distinct. As with their fetal counterparts, adult BM PreProB-progenitors give rise only to B-lineage cells in vitro and express the expected B-lineage gene expression program. However, fetal PreProB-progenitors display a distinct, ontogeny-related gene expression pattern that is not seen in adult PreProB-progenitors, and they share transcriptomic signatures with CD10-ve B-progenitor infant acute lymphoblastic leukemia blast cells. These data identify PreProB-progenitors as the earliest B-lymphoid-restricted progenitor in human fetal life and suggest that this fetal-restricted committed B-progenitor might provide a permissive cellular context for prenatal B-progenitor leukemia initiation.","[""O'Byrne, Sorcha"", 'Elliott, Natalina', 'Rice, Siobhan', 'Buck, Gemma', 'Fordham, Nicholas', 'Garnett, Catherine', 'Godfrey,

It is known to commonly cause differentiation syndrome, but an association with cardiovascular complications is not well established. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 34-year-old female with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia post-allogeneic transplant who developed ivosidenib-induced differentiation syndrome complicated by myopericarditis and cardiogenic shock. MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Ivosidenib was discontinued, and aggressive management was pursued with high-dose steroids, ventilatory and pressure support and diuresis. She had significant improvement and later tolerated reintroduction of ivosidenib without recurrent episodes of differentiation syndrome or cardiac complications. DISCUSSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of myopericarditis and cardiogenic shock related to ivosidenib use. This case highlights the high index of suspicion required to recognize early signs of targeted therapy-related complications and exemplifies the beneficial collaborative role a cardio-oncology team provides in improving patient care.","['Hernandez Burgos, Paula', 'Patel, Jaymin', 'Chen, Allan']","['Hernandez Burgos P', 'Patel J', 'Chen A']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2576-3675'],"['Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Division of Cardiology, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Division of Cardiology, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.', 'Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Pyridines)', 'Q2PCN8MAM6 (ivosidenib)', 'TE7660XO1C (Glycine)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Female', 'Glycine/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Mutation', 'Myocarditis/*chemically induced', 'Pyridines/*administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Shock, Cardiogenic/*chemically induced', 'Syndrome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cardiogenic shock', 'cardiomyopathy', 'differentiation syndrome', 'ivosidenib', 'targeted therapy']",2019/08/07 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/08/07 06:00'],"['2019/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155219865934 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Apr;26(3):754-757. doi: 10.1177/1078155219865934.

Small-molecule CDK8/19 inhibitors have recently entered or are entering clinical trials, starting with breast cancer and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To identify other cancers where these novel drugs may provide benefit, we queried genomic and transcriptomic databases for potential impact of CDK8, CDK19, or their binding partner CCNC. sgRNA analysis of a panel of tumor cell lines showed that most tumor types represented in the panel, except for some central nervous system tumors, were not dependent on these genes. In contrast, analysis of clinical samples for alterations in these genes revealed a high frequency of gene amplification in two highly aggressive subtypes of prostate cancer and in some cancers of the GI tract, breast, bladder, and sarcomas. Analysis of survival correlations identified a group of cancers where CDK8 expression correlated with shorter survival (notably breast, prostate, cervical cancers, and esophageal adenocarcinoma). In some cancers (AML, melanoma, ovarian, and others), such correlations were limited to samples with a below-median tumor mutation burden. These results suggest that Mediator kinases are especially important in cancers that are driven primarily by transcriptional rather than mutational changes and warrant an investigation of their role in additional cancer types.","['Roninson, Igor B', 'Gyorffy, Balazs', 'Mack, Zachary T', 'Shtil, Alexander A', 'Shtutman, Michael S', 'Chen, Mengqian', 'Broude, Eugenia V']","['Roninson IB', 'Gyorffy B', 'Mack ZT', 'Shtil AA', 'Shtutman MS', 'Chen M', 'Broude EV']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5772-3766'],"['Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA.', 'Institute of Gene Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 119334 Moscow, Russia.', 'MTA TTK Lendulet Cancer Biomarker Research Group, Institute of Enzymology, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Magyar tudosok korutja 2., H-1117 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Tuzolto utca 7-9, H-1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA.', 'Institute of Gene Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 119334 Moscow, Russia.', 'Blokhin National Medical Research Center of Oncology, 115478 Moscow, Russia.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA.', 'Department of Drug Discovery and Biomedical Sciences, University of South Carolina, Columbia, SC 29208, USA. broude@cop.sc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (CCNC protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin C)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK19 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK8 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 8)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)']",IM,,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin C/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 8/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors/*physiology', 'Databases, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6721656,['NOTNLM'],"['*CDK19', '*CDK8', '*Cyclin C', '*cancer genomics', '*survival correlations']",2019/08/07 06:00,2020/05/12 06:00,['2019/08/07 06:00'],"['2019/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/07 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/12 06:00 [medline]']","['cells8080821 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8080821 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2019 Aug 3;8(8). pii: cells8080821. doi: 10.3390/cells8080821.,,20190803,,"['P20 GM109091/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R03 DA043428/DA/NIDA NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 GM103336/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Venous thrombosis, often at unusual sites, including splanchnic vein thrombosis and arterial thrombosis, as well as a hemorrhagic tendency and a propensity to transform into myelofibrosis or acute leukemia are common complications in patients with MPNs. The pathogenesis of thrombosis in MPN patients is complex and multifactorial. Disease related factors, such as an increase in blood cell counts (i.e., leukocytosis, erythrocytosis, and thrombocytosis), and more importantly presence of JAK2 mutation can interact with non-disease patient related factors such as age, previous history of thrombotic events, obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and presence of thrombophilic defects. The overall rate of recurrent thrombosis after venous thromboembolism (VTE) is 6.0 to 6.5 per 100 patient-years in patients with MPN compared to 2.7 to 3.7 per 100 patient-years in patients without MPN, and antithrombotic therapy with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is associated with a clear benefit, reducing the incidence of recurrence by 48 to 69%. Life-long oral anticoagulation with VKAs is the cornerstone of the antithrombotic treatment for splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT). Patients with MPN-related cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT) should also be treated with long-term anticoagulation with VKAs. The role of direct acting oral anticoagulants in patients with thrombosis and MPN is not established and the use of these anticoagulants should be considered on an individual basis according to the risk of recurrent of VTE and bleeding.","['Arachchillage, Deepa Rj', 'Laffan, Mike']","['Arachchillage DR', 'Laffan M']",,"['Department of Haematology, Imperial College Healthcare, National Health Service Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Brompton Hospital, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Imperial College Healthcare, National Health Service Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)']",IM,,"['Anticoagulants/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*complications', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Venous Thromboembolism/*drug therapy']",,,,2019/08/06 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-0039-1693477 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 2019 Sep;45(6):604-611. doi: 10.1055/s-0039-1693477.

Occupational exposures to the leukomogen benzene during loading, unloading, and tank cleaning are possible causes. Studies on older types of tankers carrying gasoline with most handling being done manually have revealed important exposures to benzene. Our study explores benzene exposures on tankers with both automatic and manual systems. Correlations between benzene exposure and benzene in alveolar air (AlvBe), benzene in urine (UBe), and trans,trans-muconic acid (ttMA) in urine were investigated. METHODS: Forty-three male seafarers (22 deck crewmembers and 21 not on deck) on five Swedish different product and chemical tankers transporting 95- or 98-octane gasoline were investigated between 1995 and 1998. The tankers used closed systems for the loading and unloading of gasoline but stripping and tank cleaning were done manually. Benzene in respiratory air was measured using personal passive dosimeters during a 4-h work shift. Samples for biomarker analyses were collected pre- and post-shift. Smoking did occur and crewmembers did not use any respiratory protection during work. RESULTS: The average 4-h benzene exposure level for exposed was 0.45 mg m-3 and for non-exposed 0.02 mg m-3. Benzene exposure varied with type of work (range 0.02-143 mg m-3). AlvBe, UBe, and ttMA were significantly higher in post-shift samples among exposed and correlated with exposure level (r = 0.89, 0.74, and 0.57, respectively). Smoking did not change the level of significance among exposed. DISCUSSION: Benzene in alveolar air, unmetabolized benzene, and ttMA in urine are potential biomarkers for occupational benzene exposure. Biomarkers were detectable in non-exposed, suggesting benzene exposure even for other work categories on board tankers. Work on tankers carrying gasoline with more or less closed handling of the cargo may still lead to significant benzene exposure for deck crewmembers, and even exceed the Swedish Occupational Exposure Limit (OEL; 8-h time-weighted average [TWA]) of 1.5 mg m-3.","['Forsell, Karl', 'Liljelind, Ingrid', 'Ljungkvist, Goran', 'Nordlinder, Rolf', 'Andersson, Eva', 'Nilsson, Ralph']","['Forsell K', 'Liljelind I', 'Ljungkvist G', 'Nordlinder R', 'Andersson E', 'Nilsson R']",,"['Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Umea University, Umea, Sweden.', 'Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Goteborg, Sweden.', 'Occupational and Environmental Medicine, Sahlgrenska Academy, Gothenburg University, Goteborg, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Ann Work Expo Health,Annals of work exposures and health,101698454,"['0 (Air Pollutants, Occupational)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Gasoline)', '3KD92ZL2KH (muconic acid)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'X045WJ989B (Sorbic Acid)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Air Pollutants, Occupational/*analysis', 'Benzene/*analysis', 'Biomarkers/*analysis/urine', 'Environmental Monitoring/*methods', '*Gasoline', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Exposure/*analysis', 'Pulmonary Alveoli/*chemistry', 'Sorbic Acid/analogs & derivatives/analysis', 'Young Adult']",PMC6855362,['NOTNLM'],"['* t,t-muconic acid', '*biological monitoring', '*chemical/product tanker', '*gasoline', '*seafarer']",2019/08/06 06:00,2020/07/15 06:00,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['5543981 [pii]', '10.1093/annweh/wxz055 [doi]']",ppublish,Ann Work Expo Health. 2019 Oct 11;63(8):890-897. doi: 10.1093/annweh/wxz055.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

Epidemiological and functional studies have highlighted the influence of an overstimulation of the immune system on leukemia development. This study aimed at assessing if the cell-of-origin of t(4;11) MLL-AF4 acute leukemia is sensitive to a viral or bacterial mimic and if maternal immune activation can lead to a full-blown leukemia. To answer this, we used the Mll-AF4 pre-leukemia mouse model that initiates the expression of Mll-AF4 in the first definitive hematopoietic cells formed during embryonic development. We observed an increase in proliferation upon hematopoietic differentiation of fetal liver Mll-AF4+ Lineage-Sca1+ckit+ (LSK) cells exposed to the immune stimulants, poly(I:C) or LPS/lipopolysaccharide. This was accompanied by increased expression of a subset of MLL-AF4 signature genes and members of the Toll-like receptor signaling pathways in fetal liver Mll-AF4+ LSK exposed to poly(I:C), suggesting that the cell-of-origin responds to inflammatory stimuli. Maternal immune activation using a single dose of poly(I:C) did not lead to the development of leukemia in Mll-AF4+ and control offspring.

The objective of this study was to analyze the effect of BLV infection on cell viability, apoptosis and morphology of a bovine mammary epithelial cell line (MAC-T), as well as Toll like receptors (TLR) and cytokine mRNA expression. Our findings show that BLV infection causes late syncytium formation, a decrease in cell viability, downregulation of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2, and an increase in TLR9 mRNA expression. Moreover, we analyzed how this stably infected cell line respond to the exposure to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), a pathogen known to cause chronic mastitis. In the presence of S. aureus, MAC-T BLV cells had decreased viability and decreased Bcl-2 and TLR2 mRNA expression. The results suggest that mammary epithelial cells infected with BLV have altered the apoptotic and immune pathways, probably affecting their response to bacteria and favoring the development of mastitis.","['Martinez Cuesta, Lucia', 'Nieto Farias, Maria Victoria', 'Lendez, Pamela A', 'Rowland, Raymond R R', 'Sheahan, Maureen A', 'Cheuquepan Valenzuela, Felipe A', 'Marin, Maia S', 'Dolcini, Guillermina', 'Ceriani, Maria Carolina']","['Martinez Cuesta L', 'Nieto Farias MV', 'Lendez PA', 'Rowland RRR', 'Sheahan MA', 'Cheuquepan Valenzuela FA', 'Marin MS', 'Dolcini G', 'Ceriani MC']",,"['Laboratorio de Virologia, Centro de Investigacion Veterinaria de Tandil (CIVETAN, CONICET-CICPBA), Facultad de Cs.

These mutations often result in partial rather than complete loss of function of the transcription factor. While the functional dose of PAX5 has a clear connection to human malignancy, there is limited evidence for that heterozygote loss of PAX5 have a dramatic effect on the development and function of B-cell progenitors. One possible explanation comes from the finding that PAX5 mutated B-ALL often display complex karyotypes and additional mutations. Thus, PAX5 might be one component of a larger transcription factor network targeted in B-ALL. To investigate the functional network associated with PAX5 we used BioID technology to isolate proteins associated with this transcription factor in the living cell. This identified 239 proteins out of which several could be found mutated in human B-ALL. Most prominently we identified the commonly mutated IKZF1 and RUNX1, involved in the formation of ETV6-AML1 fusion protein, among the interaction partners. ChIP- as well as PLAC-seq analysis supported the idea that these factors share a multitude of target genes in human B-ALL cells. Gene expression analysis of mouse models and primary human leukemia suggested that reduced function of PAX5 increased the ability of an oncogenic form of IKZF1 or ETV6-AML to modulate gene expression. Our data reveals that PAX5 belong to a regulatory network frequently targeted by multiple mutations in B-ALL shedding light on the molecular interplay in leukemia cells.","['Okuyama, Kazuki', 'Strid, Tobias', 'Kuruvilla, Jacob', 'Somasundaram, Rajesh', 'Cristobal, Susana', 'Smith, Emma', 'Prasad, Mahadesh', 'Fioretos, Thoas', 'Lilljebjorn, Henrik', 'Soneji, Shamit', 'Lang, Stefan', 'Ungerback, Jonas', 'Sigvardsson, Mikael']","['Okuyama K', 'Strid T', 'Kuruvilla J', 'Somasundaram R', 'Cristobal S', 'Smith E', 'Prasad M', 'Fioretos T', 'Lilljebjorn H', 'Soneji S', 'Lang S', 'Ungerback J', 'Sigvardsson M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2166-5170', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4034-8752', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0669-9644', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8007-2260', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0854-2328', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2190-3896', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8527-7276']","['Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Clinical Genetics Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stemcell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Linkoping University, Linkoping, Sweden.', 'Division of Molecular Hematology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.', 'Lund Stemcell Center, Lund University, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Genet,PLoS genetics,101239074,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (PAX5 Transcription Factor)', '0 (PAX5 protein, human)', '0 (Pax5 protein, mouse)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (TEL-AML1 fusion protein)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mutation', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/genetics', 'PAX5 Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Precursor Cells, B-Lymphoid', 'Primary Cell Culture', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",PMC6695195,,,2019/08/06 06:00,2020/01/08 06:00,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pgen.1008280 [doi]', 'PGENETICS-D-19-00377 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Genet. 2019 Aug 5;15(8):e1008280. doi: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1008280. eCollection 2019 Aug.,,20190805,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These analytics typically are constructed from clinical and laboratory variables. These variables often are combined into scores or staging systems, some of which are prognostic (therapy-independent), whereas others are predictive (therapy-dependent). Predictive variables differ with different therapies. Because response to therapy is a necessary condition for the improvement of survival, predictive biomarkers are extremely important. However, despite some progress to identify new predictive biomarkers, del(17p)/TP53 mutation remains the only widely accepted variable used to guide therapy. New laboratory techniques and analytical tools may contribute to improvements in the precision and accuracy of outcome indicators. However, there are inherent limitations when applying cohort-based estimates to individuals within the cohort. The accuracy and precision of prediction also are limited by measurement error and chance. Ultimately, estimating outcomes requires a careful balance between clinical experience, imperfect prediction, and uncertainty.","['Montserrat, Emili', 'Gale, Robert Peter']","['Montserrat E', 'Gale RP']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2868-995X'],"['Institute of Hematology and Oncology, Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Division of Experimental Medicine, Department of Medicine, Hematology Research Centre, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)']",IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17/genetics', 'Cohort Studies', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Mutation', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care/*methods', 'Probability', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', '*Uncertainty']",,['NOTNLM'],"['biomarkers', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'personalized medicine', 'prediction', 'prognostication', 'uncertainty']",2019/08/06 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32353 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Nov 1;125(21):3699-3705. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32353.

Growing evidence shows that there are disease processes that are caused by both short and long telomere length extremes. The genetic basis of these short and long telomere syndromes may be linked to mutations in the same genes, such as the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), but through differential effects on telomere length. Short telomere syndromes have a predominant degenerative phenotype marked by organ failure that most commonly manifests as pulmonary fibrosis and are associated with a relatively low cancer incidence. In contrast, insights from studies of cancer-prone families as well as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified both rare and common variants that lengthen telomeres as being strongly associated with cancer risk. We have hypothesized that these cancers represent a long telomere syndrome that is associated with a high penetrance of cutaneous melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

Emphasis is placed on overall response rates, complete response rates, minimal residual disease rates, and toxicities. The drugs vemurafenib, moxetumumab-pasudotox, bendamustine, and ibrutinib, all of which are commercially available, are reviewed in greatest detail.Expert opinion: Despite the number of prospective studies recently published on these agents in HCL, questions remain about which agents to use, when to best utilize them, how to best dose or schedule them, and the role of combination therapy. Further clinical research is required to answer these questions and to discover other drugs effective in the treatment of relapsed HCL.","['Sarvaria, Aditya', 'Saven, Alan']","['Sarvaria A', 'Saven A']",,"['Division of Hematology and Oncology, Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*BRAF', '*Hairy Cell Leukemia', '*bendamustine', '*ibrutinib', '*moxetumomab-pasudotox', '*vemurafenib']",2019/08/06 06:00,2020/06/12 06:00,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2019.1652589 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 Nov;12(11):983-987. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2019.1652589.

Thus, with some exceptions, B-cell and T-cell childhood leukemias are supposed to arise from B- or T-committed cells. In contrast, several recent studies have revealed that genetic alterations may act in a ""hit-and-run"" way in the cell-of-origin by imposing the tumor cell identity giving rise to either B-cell or T-cell leukemias. This novel mechanism of cell transformation is mediated by an epigenetic priming mechanism that is established by the initial genetic lesion.

However, the majority of patients are not cured and developing novel therapeutic strategies that target epigenetic processes are a promising avenue to improve cure rates. A number of epigenetic mechanisms are altered or reprogrammed during the development and progression of CML, resulting in alterations in histone modifications, DNA methylation and dysregulation of the transcriptional machinery. In this review these epigenetic alterations are examined and the potential of epigenetic therapies are discussed as a means of eradicating residual disease and offering a potential cure for CML in combination with current therapies.","['Bugler, Jane', 'Kinstrie, Ross', 'Scott, Mary T', 'Vetrie, David']","['Bugler J', 'Kinstrie R', 'Scott MT', 'Vetrie D']",,"['Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Cell Dev Biol,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,101630250,,,,,PMC6652210,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'drug resistance', 'epigenetics', 'stem cells', 'therapies']",2019/08/06 06:00,2019/08/06 06:01,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fcell.2019.00136 [doi]'],epublish,Front Cell Dev Biol. 2019 Jul 17;7:136. doi: 10.3389/fcell.2019.00136. eCollection 2019.,,20190717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the lack of a functional role of BAFF/APRIL system during normal early B-cell development, previous studies indicated a contribution of these molecules in the pathogenesis of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). Here, we evaluated the expression of this system in B-ALL and its involvement in spontaneous and drug-induced apoptosis of B-lymphoblasts, taking into consideration the distinct disease subtypes. We found that BAFFR is the most predominant aberrantly expressed receptor in B-ALL and that its expression, along with BCMA and APRIL, positively correlates with the maturation stage of B-lymphoblasts. Moreover, the binding of the E2A-PBX1 chimeric protein to the BAFFR promoter suggests that the transcriptional activator promotes the increase in BAFFR expression observed in about 50% of pre-B-ALL patients carrying the t (1, 19) translocation. BAFF binding to BAFFR led to the processing of NF-kappaB2 p100 in pre-B ALL cells suggesting that BAFFR can activate the NF-kappaB2 pathway in pre-B ALL cells. Surprisingly, we found that BAFF treatment promotes the cell death of primary BCR-ABL(+) BAFFR(+) pre-B-lymphoblasts in adult B-ALL. It also enhances glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis in the E2A-PBX1(+) pre-B-ALL cell line 697. These data suggest that BAFF/BAFFR signaling in B-ALL cells differs from normal B cells and that it may affect the pathogenesis of the disease.","['Sevdali, Eirini', 'Katsantoni, Eleni', 'Smulski, Cristian R', 'Moschovi, Maria', 'Palassopoulou, Maria', 'Kolokotsa, Eleni-Nefeli', 'Argentou, Nikoletta', 'Giannakoulas, Nikolaos', 'Adamaki, Maria', 'Vassilopoulos, Georgios', 'Polychronopoulou, Sophia', 'Germenis, Anastasios E', 'Eibel, Hermann', 'Speletas, Matthaios']","['Sevdali E', 'Katsantoni E', 'Smulski CR', 'Moschovi M', 'Palassopoulou M', 'Kolokotsa EN', 'Argentou N', 'Giannakoulas N', 'Adamaki M', 'Vassilopoulos G', 'Polychronopoulou S', 'Germenis AE', 'Eibel H', 'Speletas M']",,"['Department of Immunology and Histocompatibility, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Basic Research Center, Biomedical Research Foundation of the Academy of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'Hematology/Oncology Unit, First Department of Pediatrics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, ""Aghia Sophia"" Children\'s Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology and Histocompatibility, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology and Histocompatibility, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Hematology/Oncology Unit, First Department of Pediatrics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Medical School, ""Aghia Sophia"" Children\'s Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, ""Aghia Sophia"" Children\'s Hospital, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Immunology and Histocompatibility, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.', 'Center for Chronic Immunodeficiency, University Medical Center Freiburg, Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany.', 'Department of Immunology and Histocompatibility, Faculty of Medicine, School of Health Sciences, University of Thessaly, Larissa, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,,PMC6657364,['NOTNLM'],"['B-ALL', 'BAFFR', 'E2A-PBX1', 'apoptosis', 'glucocorticoids']",2019/08/06 06:00,2019/08/06 06:01,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2018/11/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00594 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Jul 18;9:594. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00594. eCollection 2019.,,20190718,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, arsenic class of mineral, arsenic trioxide, clinically approved for treating acute promyelocytic leukemia, is demonstrated to reactivate latent provirus in CD4+ T cells from HIV-1 patients and Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected macaques, without significant systemic T cell activation and inflammatory responses. In a proof-of-concept study using chronically SIVmac239-infected macaques, arsenic trioxide combined with ART delays viral rebound after ART termination, reduces the integrated SIV DNA copies in CD4+ T cells, and restores CD4+ T cells counts in vivo. Most importantly, half of arsenic trioxide-treated macaques show no detectable viral rebound in the plasma for at least 80 days after ART discontinuation. Mechanistically, the study reveals that CD4 receptors and CCR5 co-receptors of CD4+ T cells are significantly downregulated by arsenic trioxide treatment, which reduces susceptibility to infection after provirus reactivation. Furthermore, an increase in SIV-specific immune responses after arsenic trioxide treatment may contribute to suppression of viral rebound. This work suggests that arsenic trioxide in combination with ART is a novel regimen in down-sizing or even eradicating latent HIV-1 reservoir.","['Yang, Qing', 'Feng, Fengling', 'Li, Pingchao', 'Pan, Enxiang', 'Wu, Chunxiu', 'He, Yizi', 'Zhang, Fan', 'Zhao, Jin', 'Li, Ruiting', 'Feng, Liqiang', 'Hu, Fengyu', 'Li, Linghua', 'Zou, Huachun', 'Cai, Weiping', 'Lehner, Thomas', 'Sun, Caijun', 'Chen, Ling']","['Yang Q', 'Feng F', 'Li P', 'Pan E', 'Wu C', 'He Y', 'Zhang F', 'Zhao J', 'Li R', 'Feng L', 'Hu F', 'Li L', 'Zou H', 'Cai W', 'Lehner T', 'Sun C', 'Chen L']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2000-7053'],"['State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH) Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou 510530 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH) Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou 510530 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH) Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou 510530 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH) Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou 510530 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH) Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou 510530 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH) Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou 510530 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH) Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou 510530 China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen) Sun Yat-sen University Guangdong 518107 China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen) Sun Yat-sen University Guangdong 518107 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH) Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou 510530 China.', ""Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital Guangzhou Medical University Guangzhou 510182 China."", ""Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital Guangzhou Medical University Guangzhou 510182 China."", 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen) Sun Yat-sen University Guangdong 518107 China.', ""Guangzhou Eighth People's Hospital Guangzhou Medical University Guangzhou 510182 China."", ""Mucosal Immunology Unit King's College London at Guy's Hospital London WC2R 2LS UK."", 'State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH) Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou 510530 China.', 'School of Public Health (Shenzhen) Sun Yat-sen University Guangdong 518107 China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Disease Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH) Chinese Academy of Sciences Guangzhou 510530 China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Adv Sci (Weinh),"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",101664569,,,,,PMC6662089,['NOTNLM'],"['Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)', 'antiretroviral therapy (ART)', 'arsenic trioxide', 'functional cures', 'human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)', 'latency']",2019/08/06 06:00,2019/08/06 06:01,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/02/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/06 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1002/advs.201900319 [doi]', 'ADVS1136 [pii]']",epublish,Adv Sci (Weinh). 2019 May 7;6(13):1900319. doi: 10.1002/advs.201900319. eCollection 2019 Jul 3.,,20190507,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The KIR A haplotype encodes a distinctive set of HLA-specific NK cell inhibiting receptors having strong influence on immunity. We observed higher frequency of KIR A homozygosity among 745 healthy Chinese Southern Han than 836 adult patients representing three types of leukemia: ALL (OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.52-0.89, p = 0.004), AML (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.59-0.98, p = 0.034), and CML (OR = 0.72 95% CI = 0.51-1.0, ns). We observed the same trend for NHL (OR = 0.47 95% CI = 0.26-0.88 p = 0.017). For ALL, the protective effect of the KIR AA genotype was greater in the presence of KIR ligands C1 (Pc = 0.01) and Bw4 (Pc = 0.001), which are tightly linked in East Asians. By contrast, the C2 ligand strengthened protection from CML (Pc = 0.004). NK cells isolated from KIR AA individuals were significantly more cytotoxic toward leukemic cells than those from other KIR genotypes (p < 0.0001). These data suggest KIR allotypes encoded by East Asian KIR A haplotypes are strongly inhibitory, arming NK cells to respond to leukemogenic cells having altered HLA expression. Thus, the study of populations with distinct KIR and HLA distributions enlightens understanding of immune mechanisms that significantly impact leukemia pathogenesis.","['Deng, Zhihui', 'Zhao, Jun', 'Cai, Siqi', 'Qi, Ying', 'Yu, Qiong', 'Martin, Maureen P', 'Gao, Xiaojiang', 'Chen, Rui', 'Zhuo, Jiacai', 'Zhen, Jianxin', 'Zhang, Mingjie', 'Zhang, Guobin', 'He, Liumei', 'Zou, Hongyan', 'Lu, Liang', 'Zhu, Weigang', 'Hong, Wenxu', 'Carrington, Mary', 'Norman, Paul J']","['Deng Z', 'Zhao J', 'Cai S', 'Qi Y', 'Yu Q', 'Martin MP', 'Gao X', 'Chen R', 'Zhuo J', 'Zhen J', 'Zhang M', 'Zhang G', 'He L', 'Zou H', 'Lu L', 'Zhu W', 'Hong W', 'Carrington M', 'Norman PJ']",,"['Immunogenetics Laboratory, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'School of Ophthalmology and Optometry, Shenzhen Eye Hospital, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China.', 'Immunogenetics Laboratory, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Basic Science Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, United States.', 'Immunogenetics Laboratory, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Basic Science Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, United States.', 'Basic Science Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, United States.', 'Immunogenetics Laboratory, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, China.', ""Department of Hematology, Shenzhen Second People's Hospital, Shenzhen, China."", 'Immunogenetics Laboratory, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Central Laboratory, Baoan Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Shenzhen, China.', 'Research and Development Department, Shenzhen Hank Bioengineering Institute, Shenzhen, China.', 'Immunogenetics Laboratory, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Immunogenetics Laboratory, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Immunogenetics Laboratory, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Immunogenetics Laboratory, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Immunogenetics Laboratory, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Immunogenetics Laboratory, Shenzhen Blood Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Basic Science Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, United States.', 'Ragon Institute of MGH MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, United States.', 'Division of Biomedical Informatics and Personalized Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, CO, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class I)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Asians', 'Child', 'Female', 'Genotype', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class I/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Male', 'Receptors, KIR/immunology']",PMC6646668,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*AML', '*CML', '*Chinese Southern Han', '*HLA', '*KIR', '*NHL', '*leukemia']",2019/08/06 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01646 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jul 16;10:1646. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01646. eCollection 2019.,,20190716,,"['U01 AI090905/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'U19 NS095774/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While the impact of individual mHAs on allo-HSCT outcome such as graft-vs.-host and graft-vs.-leukemia effects has been demonstrated, it is likely that established mHAs constitute only a small fraction of all immunogenic non-synonymous variants. In the present study, we have analyzed the genetic mismatching in 157 exome-sequenced sibling allo-HSCT pairs to evaluate the significance of polymorphic HLA class I associated peptides on clinical outcome. We applied computational mismatch estimation approaches based on experimentally verified HLA ligands available in public repositories, published mHAs, and predicted HLA-peptide affinites, and analyzed their associations with chronic graft-vs.-host disease (cGvHD) grades. We found that higher estimated recipient mismatching consistently increased the risk of severe cGvHD, suggesting that HLA-presented mismatching influences the likelihood of long-term complications in the patient. Furthermore, computational approaches focusing on estimation of HLA-presentation instead of all non-synonymous mismatches indiscriminately may be beneficial for analysis sensitivity and could help identify novel mHAs.","['Ritari, Jarmo', 'Hyvarinen, Kati', 'Koskela, Satu', 'Niittyvuopio, Riitta', 'Nihtinen, Anne', 'Salmenniemi, Urpu', 'Putkonen, Mervi', 'Volin, Liisa', 'Kwan, Tony', 'Pastinen, Tomi', 'Itala-Remes, Maija', 'Partanen, Jukka']","['Ritari J', 'Hyvarinen K', 'Koskela S', 'Niittyvuopio R', 'Nihtinen A', 'Salmenniemi U', 'Putkonen M', 'Volin L', 'Kwan T', 'Pastinen T', 'Itala-Remes M', 'Partanen J']",,"['Finnish Red Cross Blood Service, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Finnish Red Cross Blood Service, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Finnish Red Cross Blood Service, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Department of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Department of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Division of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Division of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Department of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Human Genetics, McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Human Genetics, McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', ""Center for Pediatric Genomic Medicine, Children's Mercy, Kansas City, MO, United States."", 'Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, Division of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland.', 'Finnish Red Cross Blood Service, Helsinki, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,,"['Genotype', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Histocompatibility/immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing/methods', 'Humans', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/*immunology', 'Siblings', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",PMC6646417,['NOTNLM'],"['*HLA', '*HSCT', '*genomics', '*graft-vs.-host', '*minor histocompatibility antigen', '*whole-exome sequencing']",2019/08/06 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01625 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jul 16;10:1625. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01625. eCollection 2019.,,20190716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impressive clinical results obtained with CAR-T cell therapy in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma have fueled the development of CAR-T cells targeting other malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM). The field of CAR-T cell therapy for MM is still in its infancy, but remains promising. To date, most studies have been performed with B cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-targeted CARs, for which high response rates have been obtained in early-phase clinical trials. However, responses are usually temporary, and relapses have frequently been observed. One of the major reasons for relapse is the loss or downregulation of BCMA expression following CAR-T therapy.

Retrospective analysis of all patients with new MDS onset in the SEER-18 database from 2001 to 2013. We identified 36 558 patients with primary MDS. The rate of secondary AML (sAML) was 3.7% among patients 40 years or younger and 2.5% among those older than 40 (P = .039). The median transformation interval was significantly shorter for the younger group (4.04 vs 13.1 mo; P < .001). For both age groups, median overall and cancer-specific survival were significantly longer for patients who did not develop sAML. Although the younger patients survived longer than the older patients, sAML development had a more negative effect on the survival of younger patients. Female sex, age, and World Health Organization (WHO) type MDS with single lineage dysplasia (MDS-SLD) were associated with a decreased risk of sAML for older but not younger patients. Among older patients with MDS, a married status, Black race, female sex, shorter time to sAML, and WHO type MDS-SLD or MDS with ringed sideroblasts were favorable prognostic factors for survival. In the SEER database, the rate of sAML among patients with MDS is lower than that in previous reports, but these patients still have worse survival. Risk assessment should include clinical and demographic factors.","['Ye, Xingnong', 'Chen, Dan', 'Zheng, Yan', 'Wu, Cai', 'Zhu, Xiaoqiong', 'Huang, Jian']","['Ye X', 'Chen D', 'Zheng Y', 'Wu C', 'Zhu X', 'Huang J']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2657-6716'],"[""Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Fourth Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'SEER Program', 'Socioeconomic Factors', 'United States/epidemiology']",PMC6900108,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'epidemiology', 'myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)', 'risk factors']",2019/08/06 06:00,2019/11/20 06:00,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2660 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2019 Oct;37(4):438-446. doi: 10.1002/hon.2660.

At present, several studies have indicated that the bone marrow microenvironment played an essential role in drug resistance of leukemia, forming a protective spot for them by interacting with leukemic cells, offering protective effects of leukemia cells from cytotoxic drugs. The bone marrow microenvironment can mediate the development of drug resistance in leukemia through many signal pathways, by affecting the growth, propagation, and apoptosis of leukemia cells. The microenvironment can promote cell survival, proliferation, and anti-apoptosis, and then mediate the drug resistance of leukemia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression level of PLZF in AML cell lines KG-1a, HL-60, OCI-AML3, THP-1 and K562 was detected by quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and Western blot, respectively. Subsequently, THP-1 cells were divided into mock group (no treatment), scramble group (transfection with scramble shRNA) and shPLZF group (transfection with shPLZF). THP-1 cell line stably expressing shPLZF was constructed, followed by determination of its transfection efficiency by qPCR and Western blot, respectively. The proliferation and colony formation of THP-1 cells were accessed using CCK-8 (cell counting kit-8) assay and colony formation assay, respectively. The apoptotic rate in THP-1 cells was determined using flow cytometry. Protein levels of apoptosis-related genes in THP-1 cells were detected by Western blot. Finally, protein levels of AKT, Foxo3a, pAKT and pFoxo3a were detected by Western blot as well. RESULTS: Both mRNA and protein levels of PLZF were relatively high in THP-1 cells, and were selected for the following experiments. After construction of THP-1 cell line stably expressing shPLZF, proliferative rate and colony formation abilities increased in the shPLZF group compared with the mock group and the scramble group. We found a decreased apoptotic rate, downregulated Bax and upregulated Bcl-2 in the shPLZF group than those of the mock group and scramble group. Phosphorylation levels of AKT and Foxo3a increased after interference with PLZF, whereas no significant changes in total levels of AKT and Foxo3a were observed. CONCLUSIONS: PLZF inhibits the malignant phenotype of AML by regulating the AKT/Foxo3a pathway.","['Li, J-X', 'Zhang, Z-F', 'Wang, X-B', 'Yang, E-Q', 'Dong, L', 'Meng, J']","['Li JX', 'Zhang ZF', 'Wang XB', 'Yang EQ', 'Dong L', 'Meng J']",,"['Department of Clinical Laboratory, Yantaishan Hospital, Yantai, China. pzal89@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (FOXO3 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein O3)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*physiology', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'Forkhead Box Protein O3/*metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/*physiology']",,,,2019/08/06 06:00,2020/10/03 06:00,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201908_18522 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Aug;23(15):6411-6418. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201908_18522.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling and its strength are central for thymocyte development, mature T cell homeostasis and immune responses, their roles in T-ALL remain undetermined. Indeed, in contrast to mouse models, in which absence of TCR or major histocompatibility complex binding does not impact on leukemogenesis, other mouse models suggest that basal or weak signaling drives leukemia development. However, recent reports indicate that strong TCR signaling can be detrimental to leukemic cells. Indeed, sustained/high level TCR signaling, stimulated by antigen or CD3 antibody, is strongly anti-leukemic in both murine T-ALL expressing endogenous or transgenic TCR and diagnostic T-ALL cases. As discussed, further work should address the efficacy of T-ALL therapeutic targeting with either TCR/CD3 antibodies or TCR-directed chimeric antigen receptor T cells.","['Dos Santos, Nuno R', 'Ghysdael, Jacques', 'Tran Quang, Christine']","['Dos Santos NR', 'Ghysdael J', 'Tran Quang C']",,"['i3S - Instituto de Investigacao e Inovacao em Saude, Universidade do Porto, 4200-135, Porto, Portugal; Institute of Molecular Pathology and Immunology of the University of Porto (IPATIMUP), 4200-135, Porto, Portugal.

T-ALL is commonly thought to originate from the thymus albeit recent literature describes the possible acquisition of the first oncogenic hits in hematopoietic progenitor cells of the bone marrow (BM). The journey of T-ALL from its arising to full blown expansion meets different microenvironments, including the BM in which leukemic cells settle down early after the disease spreading. We take advantage of recent literature to give an overview of important cells and factors that participate in T-ALL, especially in the BM, arguing in favor of a home marrow niche for this rare leukemia.","['Calvo, Julien', 'Fahy, Lucine', 'Uzan, Benjamin', 'Pflumio, Francoise']","['Calvo J', 'Fahy L', 'Uzan B', 'Pflumio F']",,"[""UMRE008 Stabilite Genetique Cellules Souches et Radiations, U1274 Inserm, Universite de Paris, Universite Paris-Saclay, CEA, F-92260 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Leukemia, Team Niche and Cancer in Hematopoiesis, U1274, Inserm, CEA, 18 route du panorama, 92260, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; Laboratoire labellise par l'Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer, France."", ""UMRE008 Stabilite Genetique Cellules Souches et Radiations, U1274 Inserm, Universite de Paris, Universite Paris-Saclay, CEA, F-92260 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Leukemia, Team Niche and Cancer in Hematopoiesis, U1274, Inserm, CEA, 18 route du panorama, 92260, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; Laboratoire labellise par l'Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer, France."", ""UMRE008 Stabilite Genetique Cellules Souches et Radiations, U1274 Inserm, Universite de Paris, Universite Paris-Saclay, CEA, F-92260 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Leukemia, Team Niche and Cancer in Hematopoiesis, U1274, Inserm, CEA, 18 route du panorama, 92260, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; Laboratoire labellise par l'Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer, France."", ""UMRE008 Stabilite Genetique Cellules Souches et Radiations, U1274 Inserm, Universite de Paris, Universite Paris-Saclay, CEA, F-92260 Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; Laboratory of Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Leukemia, Team Niche and Cancer in Hematopoiesis, U1274, Inserm, CEA, 18 route du panorama, 92260, Fontenay-aux-Roses, France; Laboratoire labellise par l'Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer, France.

Using a conditional mouse model where zinc-finger TF Gata2 was deleted specifically in hematopoietic cells, we show that knockout of Gata2 leads to rapid and complete cell-autonomous loss of adult hematopoietic stem cells. By using short hairpin RNAi to target GATA2, we also identify a requirement for GATA2 in human HSPCs. In Meis1a/Hoxa9-driven AML, deletion of Gata2 impedes maintenance and self-renewal of LSCs. Ablation of Gata2 enforces an LSC-specific program of enhanced apoptosis, exemplified by attenuation of anti-apoptotic factor BCL2, and re-instigation of myeloid differentiation--which is characteristically blocked in AML. Thus, GATA2 acts as a critical regulator of normal and leukemic stem cells and mediates transcriptional networks that may be exploited therapeutically to target key facets of LSC behavior in AML.","['Menendez-Gonzalez, Juan Bautista', 'Vukovic, Milica', 'Abdelfattah, Ali', 'Saleh, Lubaid', 'Almotiri, Alhomidi', 'Thomas, Leigh-Anne', 'Agirre-Lizaso, Alona', 'Azevedo, Aleksandra', 'Menezes, Ana Catarina', 'Tornillo, Giusy', 'Edkins, Sarah', 'Kong, Kay', 'Giles, Peter', 'Anjos-Afonso, Fernando', 'Tonks, Alex', 'Boyd, Ashleigh S', 'Kranc, Kamil R', 'Rodrigues, Neil P']","['Menendez-Gonzalez JB', 'Vukovic M', 'Abdelfattah A', 'Saleh L', 'Almotiri A', 'Thomas LA', 'Agirre-Lizaso A', 'Azevedo A', 'Menezes AC', 'Tornillo G', 'Edkins S', 'Kong K', 'Giles P', 'Anjos-Afonso F', 'Tonks A', 'Boyd AS', 'Kranc KR', 'Rodrigues NP']",,"['European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, UK.', 'Centre for Hemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, UK.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, UK.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, UK.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, UK.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, UK.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University, School of Medicine, Cardiff CF14 4XW, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University, School of Medicine, Cardiff CF14 4XW, UK.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, UK.', 'Wales Gene Park and Wales Cancer Research Centre, Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3XQ, UK.', 'MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4UU, UK.', 'Wales Gene Park and Wales Cancer Research Centre, Division of Cancer and Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff CF10 3XQ, UK.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, UK.', 'Department of Hematology, Division of Cancer and Genetics, Cardiff University, School of Medicine, Cardiff CF14 4XW, UK.', 'Department of Surgical Biotechnology, Division of Surgery and Interventional Science, Royal Free Hospital, University College London, London NW3 2PF, UK; Institute of Immunity and Transplantation, University College London, London NW3 2QG, UK.', 'Centre for Hemato-Oncology, Barts Cancer Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London EC1M 6BQ, UK; MRC Centre for Regenerative Medicine, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh EH16 4UU, UK.', 'European Cancer Stem Cell Research Institute, Cardiff University, School of Biosciences, Cardiff CF24 4HQ, UK.

The transcription factor E2F1 is a down-stream target of the tyrosine kinase BCR-ABL1 and is up-regulated in TKI-resistant leukemia stem cells (LSC). Pyrrole imidazole polyamides (PA) are minor groove binders which can be programmed to target DNA sequences in a gene-selective manner. This manuscript describes such an approach with a PA designed to down-regulate E2F1 controlled gene expression by targeting a DNA sequence within 100 base pairs (bp) upstream of the E2F1 consensus sequence. Human BC-CML KCL22 cells were assessed after treatment with PA, TKI or their combination. Our PA inhibited BC-CML cell expansion based on cell density analysis compared to an untreated control after a 48-hour time-course of PA treatment. However, no evidence of cell cycle arrest was observed among BC-CML cells treated with PA, with respect to their no drug control counterparts. Thus, this work demonstrates that PAs are effective in inhibiting E2F1 TF activity which results in a temporal reduction in BC-CML cell number. We envisage that PAs could be used in the future to map genes under E2F1 control in CML LSCs.","['Hayatigolkhatmi, K', 'Padroni, G', 'Su, W', 'Fang, L', 'Gomez-Castaneda, E', 'Hsieh, Y C', 'Jackson, L', 'Pellicano, F', 'Burley, G A', 'Jorgensen, H G']","['Hayatigolkhatmi K', 'Padroni G', 'Su W', 'Fang L', 'Gomez-Castaneda E', 'Hsieh YC', 'Jackson L', 'Pellicano F', 'Burley GA', 'Jorgensen HG']",,"[""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, UK."", 'Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry, University of Strathclyde, Thomas Graham Building, Glasgow, UK.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nanomedicine, Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, Guangdong, PR China.', 'Guangdong Key Laboratory of Nanomedicine, Institute of Biomedicine and Biotechnology, Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen, Guangdong, PR China.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, UK."", ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, UK."", 'Drug Discovery Program, Cancer Research UK Beatson Institute, Garscube Estate, Glasgow, UK.', 'Department of Pure and Applied Chemistry, University of Strathclyde, Thomas Graham Building, Glasgow, UK.', ""Paul O'Gorman Leukaemia Research Centre, Institute of Cancer Sciences, College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, University of Glasgow, UK.

Bovine leukemia virus causes lymphoma in <5% of infected cattle, and increased lymphocyte counts (lymphocytosis) in about one-third. Recent research has shown that dairy cows infected with BLV have altered immune function associated with decreases in milk production and lifespan. Recent findings show that a minority of infected cattle have PVL concentrations in blood and other body fluids of over 1,000 times that of other infected cattle. In combination with a high LC, these animals are thought to be responsible for most transmission of BLV in a herd. Milk or blood samples from adult cows in our 3 Midwestern dairy farm field trials were tested semiannually with ELISA for BLV antibodies, and ELISA-positive cattle were then retested using a blood LC and a quantitative PCR test for PVL to identify the animals presumed to be most infectious. Herd managers were encouraged to consider PVL and LC status when making cull decisions, and to segregate cows with the highest PVL and LC from their BLV ELISA-negative herd mates where possible. After 2 to 2.5 yr of this intervention, the incidence risk of new infections decreased in all 3 herds combined, from 13.8 to 2.2, and the overall herd prevalence decreased in all 3 herds combined from 62.0 to 20.7%, suggesting that this approach can efficiently reduce BLV transmission as well as prevalence. This is encouraging, because a very low prevalence of BLV infection would make it economically feasible to cull the remaining ELISA-positive cattle, as was achieved in national eradication programs in other countries decades ago.","['Ruggiero, V J', 'Norby, B', 'Benitez, O J', 'Hutchinson, H', 'Sporer, K R B', 'Droscha, C', 'Swenson, C L', 'Bartlett, P C']","['Ruggiero VJ', 'Norby B', 'Benitez OJ', 'Hutchinson H', 'Sporer KRB', 'Droscha C', 'Swenson CL', 'Bartlett PC']",,"['Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48824.

Fluorescence multiplex immunohistochemistry staining revealed ALV-J, MDV, and REV antigens co-expressed in the same tissue, even the same cell.","['Liu, Hongmei', 'Ma, Kui', 'Liu, Miaomiao', 'Yang, Chengcheng', 'Huang, Xueting', 'Zhao, Yu', 'Qi, Kezong']","['Liu H', 'Ma K', 'Liu M', 'Yang C', 'Huang X', 'Zhao Y', 'Qi K']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8613-1145'],"['Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.', 'Anhui Province Key Laboratory of Veterinary Pathobiology and Disease Control, Anhui Agricultural University, Hefei, Anhui, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Vet Diagn Invest,"Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",9011490,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Avian Leukosis/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Avian Leukosis Virus/physiology', '*Chickens', 'Coinfection/immunology/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Female', 'Herpesvirus 2, Gallid/physiology', 'Marek Disease/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Poultry Diseases/immunology/pathology/*virology', 'Reticuloendotheliosis virus/physiology', 'Retroviridae Infections/immunology/pathology/*veterinary/virology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/immunology/pathology/*veterinary/virology']",PMC6727128,['NOTNLM'],"[""Marek's disease virus"", 'antigen distribution', 'chickens', 'coinfection', 'reticuloendotheliosis virus', 'subgroup J avian leukosis virus']",2019/08/06 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/08/06 06:00'],"['2019/08/06 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/06 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1040638719868274 [doi]'],ppublish,J Vet Diagn Invest. 2019 Sep;31(5):761-765. doi: 10.1177/1040638719868274.

We aim to conduct a systematic review to evaluate the effects of bisphosphonates on bone mineral density (BMD) and fracture incidence in children with ALL. METHODS: EMBASE, Medline and the Cochrane Library were thoroughly searched by two researchers. Inclusion criteria was any child under the age of 18 years with a diagnosis of ALL, who had received any bisphosphonate treatment and had serial measurements of bone density performed thereafter. All primary research studies of any study design, excluding case reports, were included. RESULTS: Ten full text papers were identified with two exclusively meeting the inclusion criteria. Both studies administered bisphosphonates to children receiving maintenance chemotherapy for varying durations. Bone density was assessed at regular intervals by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The majority of participants had an improvement in bone density at the end of each study. However, no size adjustment of DXA data was performed. Limited information on fracture occurrence was provided by one study but did not include routine screening for vertebral fractures. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review identified that there is insufficient evidence to support routine use of prophylactic bisphosphonate therapy in childhood ALL for prevention of fracture and improvement of bone mass. Future well-designed clinical trials in those at highest risk of fractures in ALL are now needed.","['Harris, A M', 'Lee, A R', 'Wong, S C']","['Harris AM', 'Lee AR', 'Wong SC']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3179-729X'],"['Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, University of Glasgow, Royal Hospital for Children, 1345 Govan Road, Glasgow, G51 4TF, UK.', 'Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, University of Glasgow, Royal Hospital for Children, 1345 Govan Road, Glasgow, G51 4TF, UK.', 'Developmental Endocrinology Research Group, University of Glasgow, Royal Hospital for Children, 1345 Govan Road, Glasgow, G51 4TF, UK.

An interdepartmental working group was set up, led by the Department of Prevention of the LHA, and made up of representatives of the Institute for Study, Prevention and Cancer Network (ISPRO, Florence), the G. Monasterio Foundation/ Institute of Clinical Physiology of the National Council for Research (CNR) of Pisa, the University of Pisa, the Regional Environmental Protection Agency and community members. Several epidemiological analyses were carried out (namely incidence and mortality analysis, assessment of the residential history of all cases and micro-geographical incidence evaluation, assessment and quantification of local environmental pressures, evaluation of congenital abnormalities). The investigation took over two years to be completed. The work agenda was shared with community members, who contributed to decision-making, study design and the communication plan. Thanks to the interaction with community members, researchers had the chance to become aware of their information needs and of local knowledge concerning the research issues. The final report was published online and presented to citizens in several public meetings. Direct involvement of the local community during project development was found to be useful to reduce the perceived distance between public authorities and the local population, as highlighted in the guidelines on cancer cluster investigations.","['Battisti, Francesca', 'Petronio, Maria Grazia', 'Bernardeschi, Paolo', 'Bianchi, Fabrizio', 'Cori, Liliana', 'Crocetti, Emanuele', 'Minichilli, Fabrizio', 'Manneschi, Gianfranco', 'Mugnaini, Elisabetta', 'Scala, Danila', 'Vigotti, Mariangela', 'Miligi, Lucia']","['Battisti F', 'Petronio MG', 'Bernardeschi P', 'Bianchi F', 'Cori L', 'Crocetti E', 'Minichilli F', 'Manneschi G', 'Mugnaini E', 'Scala D', 'Vigotti M', 'Miligi L']",,"[""SS Epidemiologia dell'Ambiente e del Lavoro, Istituto per lo Studio, la Prevenzione e la Rete Oncologica, Firenze, Italia."", 'GL Ambiente e Salute, Dipartimento di Prevenzione Azienda Usl Toscana Centro, Italia.', 'UOS Ematologia, Ospedale San Giuseppe, Empoli - Azienda Usl Toscana Centro, Italia.', 'Unita di ricerca in Epidemiologia ambientale e registri di patologia, Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica -Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pisa, Italia.', 'Unita di ricerca in Epidemiologia ambientale e registri di patologia, Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica -Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pisa, Italia.', 'Registro Tumori Romagna, Istituto Scientifico Romagnolo per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori IRCCS (IRST), Meldola, (FC), Italia.', 'Unita di ricerca in Epidemiologia ambientale e registri di patologia, Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica -Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pisa, Italia.', 'Registro Tumori Toscano, Unita di Epidemiologia Clinica e Descrittiva, Istituto per lo studio, la Prevenzione e la Rete Oncologica, Firenze, Italia.', 'UOS Ematologia, Ospedale San Giuseppe, Empoli - Azienda Usl Toscana Centro, Italia.', 'Settore Valutazione di Impatto Ambientale/Valutazione Ambientale Strategica, Agenzia regionale per la protezione ambientale della Toscana, Italia.', 'Dipartimento di Biologia, Universita di Pisa, Italia.', ""SS Epidemiologia dell'Ambiente e del Lavoro, Istituto per lo Studio, la Prevenzione e la Rete Oncologica, Firenze, Italia.""]",['ita'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Ig Sanita Pubbl,Igiene e sanita pubblica,0373022,,IM,,"['*Communication', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leukemia/mortality', 'Lymphoma/mortality', '*Public Health']",,,,2019/08/05 06:00,2019/10/24 06:00,['2019/08/05 06:00'],"['2019/08/05 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/05 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/24 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,Ig Sanita Pubbl. 2019 Mar-Apr;75(2):98-104.,,,,,,,,,Segnalazione di un cluster di neoplasie emolinfopoietiche e gestione del processo di comunicazione con la cittadinanza: l'esperienza di una Asl toscana.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The differentiated and undifferentiated embryonic bodies (EBs) were cultured using handing drop method by the control of Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF). Raman spectra of the periphery cells of differentiated EBs (PrE cells) and those of the interior of undifferentiated EBs (ES cells) were obtained to diagnose the stem cells of different differentiation. It was found from the spectra that the protein content increased as the cells differentiated. Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out to further analyze the differences between ES cells and PrE cells. The first three principle components contained 98.19% from the total variance. Characteristic bands of ES and PrE cells were chosen to acquire Raman images of two cells according to the results of PCA. In the Raman images, PrE cells had a clear and bright outline in the peripheral areas while ES cells were difficult to identify, this could be a distinct characteristic to discriminate them. The result of the Raman images was consistent with the biological agreement that the differentiated cells were distributed around the periphery.","['Dou, Xiaoming', 'Zhao, Yubin', 'Li, Mingda', 'Chen, Qinmiao', 'Yamaguchi, Yoshinori']","['Dou X', 'Zhao Y', 'Li M', 'Chen Q', 'Yamaguchi Y']",,"['Institute of Photonics & Bio-medicine, School of Science, East China University of Science and Technology, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, China; Department of Applied Physics, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1, Yamadaoka, Suita City, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.', 'Institute of Photonics & Bio-medicine, School of Science, East China University of Science and Technology, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, China.', 'Institute of Photonics & Bio-medicine, School of Science, East China University of Science and Technology, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, China.', 'Institute of Photonics & Bio-medicine, School of Science, East China University of Science and Technology, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, China.', 'Institute of Photonics & Bio-medicine, School of Science, East China University of Science and Technology, 130 Meilong Road, Shanghai 200237, China; Department of Applied Physics, Graduate School of Engineering, Osaka University, 2-1, Yamadaoka, Suita City, Osaka 565-0871, Japan.

To determine the clonality of CMML, we performed molecular and cytogenetic analysis in Korean patients. To investigate whether monocytes in the PB harbored clonal mutational changes, we performed single-cell sequencing after selecting monocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes by morphology-aided laser microdissection. Targeted sequencing was performed in 35 patients with CMML with 41 bone marrow samples. Single-cell analysis was performed in two cases. Most (94.3%) patients harbored at least one variant, in genes considered as potential therapeutic targets, while cytogenetic aberrations occurred in only 28.6% of cases. ASXL1 (54.3%), SRSF2 (37.1%), NRAS (31.4%), and TET2 (25.7%) were frequently mutated, with lower frequencies of TET2 mutation and higher frequencies of NRAS, DNMT3A (17.1%), and NPM1 (11.4%) mutations compared to in previous studies of Caucasians. Patients with SETBP1 mutation and those with more than two variants showed poorer survival than those without mutation (P < 0.001 and P = 0.007, respectively). Most (70.8%) variants were detected at diagnosis and follow-up with no significant differences in variant allele frequency, warranting sequencing during follow-up if diagnostic samples were unavailable. Single-cell analysis revealed clonal monocytes with mutations, and the same mutations were also identified in lymphocytes and neutrophils. Targeted sequencing aided in clonality detection in most patients with CMML and single-cell sequencing facilitated identification of clonal monocytes and the co-existence of mutations in non-myeloid cells, suggesting that certain mutations are acquired by pluripotent stem cells.","['Hwang, Sang Mee', 'Kim, Sung-Min', 'Nam, Youngwon', 'Kim, Jinhyun', 'Kim, Sungsik', 'Ahn, Yong-Oon', 'Park, Yong', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Shin, Sue', 'Kwon, Sunghoon', 'Lee, Dong Soon']","['Hwang SM', 'Kim SM', 'Nam Y', 'Kim J', 'Kim S', 'Ahn YO', 'Park Y', 'Yoon SS', 'Shin S', 'Kwon S', 'Lee DS']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Republic of Korea; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Interdisciplinary Program for Bioengineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University Boramae Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Seoul National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

Data are growing regarding the use of pediatric-inspired chemotherapy protocols in AYA patients with improvement in OS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: To assess efficacy and tolerability of using a pediatric-inspired protocol in AYA patients, we initiated our local prospective trial using a modified version of the Children's Cancer Group 1900 protocol for newly diagnosed high-risk Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL patients. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were enrolled in the study (from 2015 to 2018). The median age was 18 years (range, 14-34 years). The complete remission rate after induction was 37 patients [93%] and after a median follow-up of 5 years, OS, disease-free survival (DFS), and event-free survival were 75%, 72%, and 60%, respectively.

We show that pamidronate, a FDA-approved drug used for bone disorders, is an attractive candidate for AML treatment. Pamidronate inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of AML cells regardless of cellular and genetic heterogeneity. Pamidronate displays selective anti-AML activity by preferentially inhibiting survival and colony formation of AML CD34(+) cells while normal bone marrow CD34(+) cells are largely unaffected. Importantly, pamidronate remarkably enhances the inhibitory effects of all tested AML standard of care at subtoxic concentration. Mechanism studies show that pamidronate inhibits protein prenylation via dual action on geranylgeranylation and farnesylation, and subsequently decreases Ras activity. The rescue studies using overexpression of constitutively active Ras further confirm that pamidronate augments the efficacy of AML standard of care through inhibiting Ras. Since pamidronate is already used in clinic, our preclinical findings suggest that it may be an effective addition to treatment armamentarium for AML.","['Wang, Chengbin', 'Liu, Xiaohui', 'He, Ru', 'Li, Junhua', 'Pan, Rui']","['Wang C', 'Liu X', 'He R', 'Li J', 'Pan R']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, 441021, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, 441021, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, 441021, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, 441021, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Xiangyang Central Hospital, Hubei University of Arts and Science, Xiangyang, Hubei, 441021, China.

Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains a treatment challenge despite years of research. In this study, we analyzed the status of TIGIT expression in circulating T cells from patients with adult ALL. Compared to the data in healthy controls, the expression of TIGIT in CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells and CD8(+) T cells in adult ALL patients presented a small but significant upregulation. Stimulation via the CD3/CD28 route increased TIGIT mRNA expression at 24h, which peaked at 48h and was maintained at 72h post-stimulation. The frequency of TIGIT(+) cells, on the other hand, consistently increased over time. ALL protein lysate or Wilms' Tumor 1 peptide could significantly increase the expression of TIGIT in ALL, but not healthy control T cells. Compared to TIGIT(-) cells, the TIGIT(+) cells presented significantly higher PD-1 and Tim-3 expression directly ex vivo, and significantly lower IL-2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha after CD3/CD28 stimulation. The high inhibitory molecule and low cytokine expression signature was especially pronounced in ALL TIGIT(+) CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells and TIGIT(+) CD8(+) T cells. Blocking TIGIT alone could minimally increase cytokine expression independent of PD-1 and Tim-3 blocking, whereas blocking TIGIT, PD-1, and Tim-3 altogether was significantly more effective. Together, these data demonstrated that TIGIT regulated T cell function in adult ALL patients, and may serve as a treatment target for ALL.","['Zhang, Xiaole', 'Zhang, Hangfan', 'Chen, Lei', 'Feng, Zhenjun', 'Gao, Lei', 'Li, Qiang']","['Zhang X', 'Zhang H', 'Chen L', 'Feng Z', 'Gao L', 'Li Q']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong Province, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Liaocheng People's Hospital, Liaocheng, Shandong Province, China.

Potential influences of DLEU2 on proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of SMMC7721 and HCLM3 cells were assessed. The interaction between DLUE2 and enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) was evaluated by RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay. Finally, the effect of DLEU2/EZH2 regulatory loop on proliferative ability of HCC cells was detected. DLEU2 was upregulated in HCC tissues, especially in those larger than 5 cm in tumor size, accompanied with vascular invasion and in worse tumor stage. Knockdown of DLEU2 attenuated proliferative, migratory and invasive abilities of SMMC7721 and HCLM3 cells. RIP assay proved that DLEU2 could interact with EZH2.

Previous in vitro studies have successfully differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into germ cells. Because of immunemodulating features, safety, and simple isolation, adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) are good candidates for such studies. However, low availability is the main limitation in using these cells. Different growth factors have been investigated to overcome this issue. In the present study, we aimed to comparatively assess the performance of AT-MSCs cultured under the presence or absence of three different growth factors, epidermal growth factor (EGF), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), following transplantation in testicular torsion-detorsion mice. Materials and Methods: This was an experimental study in which AT-MSCs were first isolated from male Naval Medical Research Institute (NMRI) mice. Then, the mice underwent testicular torsion-detorsion surgery and received bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled AT-MSCs into the lumen of seminiferous tubules. The transplanted cells had been cultured in different conditioned media, containing the three growth factors and without them. The expression of germ cell-specific markers was evaluated with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western-blot. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining was used to trace the labeled cells. Results: The number of transplanted AT-MSCs resided in the basement membrane of seminiferous tubules significantly increased after 8 weeks. The expression levels of Gcnf and Mvh genes in the transplanted testicles by AT-MSCs cultured in the growth factors-supplemented medium was greater than those in the control group (P<0.001 and P<0.05, respectively). The expression levels of the c-Kit and Scp3 genes did not significantly differ from the control group. Conclusion: Our findings showed that the use of EGF, LIF and GDNF to culture AT-MSCs can be very helpful in terms of MSC survival and localization.","['Eliyasi Dashtaki, Masoumeh', 'Hemadi, Masoud', 'Saki, Ghasem', 'Mohammadiasl, Javad', 'Khodadadi, Ali']","['Eliyasi Dashtaki M', 'Hemadi M', 'Saki G', 'Mohammadiasl J', 'Khodadadi A']",,"['Cellular and Molecular Research Center, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Cellular and Molecular Research Center, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.', 'Physiology Research Center, School of Medicine, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran.

Dandelion is a rich source of phenolic compounds with strong biological properties, and the effects of using this plant in the treatment of different illnesses can be linked to the presence of various polyphenols found in the different parts of the plant. Thus, dandelion can potentially be used as a nutraceutical (dietary antioxidant) to prevent different disorders associated with oxidative stress, i.e. cardiovascular disorders, cancer and inflammatory processes. Mutual interference between a drug and a food constituent may result in altered pharmacokinetics of the drug and undesired or even dangerous clinical situations. In the present study, a bioanalytical ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantification of DAS, IMA and NIL in rat plasma. Sample preparation was carried out using solid-phase extraction with C18 cartridges with a good extraction recovery of >/=94.37% for the three drugs.

The catalyst for public awareness initiated from the first epidemiological study in 1979 that reported an association between residential EMFs exposure and the incidence of childhood leukemia. For over 40 years, many epidemiological and laboratory investigations were conducted to identify the possible biological effects of low-frequency EMF. Several studies conducted at frequencies 50/60 Hz, which related to generating of electricity from electrical appliances. Experimental studies on low-frequency EMF have provided conflicting data under specific ""in vivo"" and ""in vitro"" environments. Some original papers have reported the damaging effect on DNA molecule in EMF-exposed cells. Other studies have suggested no such damage in EMF-exposed cells. Also, the conclusions from other studies were inconclusive. These conflicting findings may attribute to the differences in the apparatus used to generate electromagnetic fields, experimental design, exposure time, genetic endpoints, and biological materials such as cell lines and animal species, strain, and age. As DNA damage is frequently a prerequisite for cancer disease, this review provided an experimental body of evidence on the effect of EMF on genetic material.","['Diab, Kawthar A']",['Diab KA'],,"['Genetics and Cytology Department, Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology Division, National Research Centre (NRC), Cairo, Egypt. ka.diab@nrc.sci.eg.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,IM,,"['DNA Damage', 'Electromagnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/genetics', 'Reproducibility of Results']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Carcinogenicity', 'Epidemiological studies', 'Genotoxicity', 'Low-frequency electromagnetic field', 'Mammalian cells']",2019/08/04 06:00,2020/02/11 06:00,['2019/08/04 06:00'],"['2019/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/5584_2019_420 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2020;1237:135-149. doi: 10.1007/5584_2019_420.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three regions-Zhytomyr, Kyiv (except Kyiv city), and Chernihiv were included as areas contaminated by radioactive (137)Cs from 1 to 15 Ci/km(2) with annual effective doses exceeding 1.0 mSv, and Sumy region as the control (non-contaminated) area with (137)Cs contamination less than 1 Ci/km(2) and effective doses less than 0.5 mSv per year. The integrated database of the National Research Centre for Radiation Medicine used in the present study included 1085 childhood leukemia cases. Two aggregated periods were used for analysis: 1980-1986 (pre-accident) and 1987-2000 (post-accident). ICD-9 codes for leukemia (204-208.9) were used to perform analyses according to the extent of leukemic cells maturity (acute, chronic, and maturity unspecified leukemia), leukemic cell lineage (lymphoid, myeloid and lineage unspecified leukemia) and all leukemia cases in different age subgroups (1-4, 5-9, 10-14, and 15-19 years). Standard methods of descriptive epidemiology were used to calculate the prevalence of disease and frequency ratio in regression models. A statistically significant increase in frequency ratio for acute leukemia (1.44; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22-1.71), myeloid leukemia (2.93; 95% CI, 1.71-5.40), cell lineage unspecified leukemia (II) (1.48; 95% CI, 1.18-1.87) and all forms of leukemia (1.59; 95% CI, 1.36-1.86) was found for the post-accident period in highly contaminated areas. The results indicate that the frequency of childhood leukemia (and of some of its types) increased in contaminated areas during the post-accident period, suggesting that radiation exposure after the Chornobyl accident might be the cause of the increase. However, further analytical studies, with individual or at least group dose estimates, are needed to confirm a link between childhood leukemia and the Chornobyl accident.","['Liubarets, T F', 'Shibata, Y', 'Saenko, V A', 'Bebeshko, V G', 'Prysyazhnyuk, A E', 'Bruslova, K M', 'Fuzik, M M', 'Yamashita, S', 'Bazyka, D A']","['Liubarets TF', 'Shibata Y', 'Saenko VA', 'Bebeshko VG', 'Prysyazhnyuk AE', 'Bruslova KM', 'Fuzik MM', 'Yamashita S', 'Bazyka DA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3804-6106'],"['Unit of Radiation Oncohematology and Blood Stem Cells Transplantation, Department of Hematology and Transplantology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Yuriy Illenka Str, 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine. tliubarets@yahoo.com.', 'Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.', 'Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.', 'Unit of Radiation Oncohematology and Blood Stem Cells Transplantation, Department of Hematology and Transplantology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Yuriy Illenka Str, 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'Unit of Radiation Oncohematology and Blood Stem Cells Transplantation, Department of Hematology and Transplantology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Yuriy Illenka Str, 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'Unit of Radiation Oncohematology and Blood Stem Cells Transplantation, Department of Hematology and Transplantology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Yuriy Illenka Str, 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'Unit of Radiation Oncohematology and Blood Stem Cells Transplantation, Department of Hematology and Transplantology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Yuriy Illenka Str, 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.', 'Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, 1-12-4 Sakamoto, Nagasaki, 852-8523, Japan.', 'Unit of Radiation Oncohematology and Blood Stem Cells Transplantation, Department of Hematology and Transplantology, National Research Center for Radiation Medicine of the National Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine, Yuriy Illenka Str, 53, Kyiv, 04050, Ukraine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,,"['*Chernobyl Nuclear Accident', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Prevalence', 'Radiation Exposure/*statistics & numerical data', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*137Cs', '*Childhood leukemia', '*Chornobyl accident', '*Contaminated areas', '*Ionizing radiation']",2019/08/04 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/08/04 06:00'],"['2018/06/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00411-019-00810-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s00411-019-00810-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2019 Nov;58(4):553-562. doi: 10.1007/s00411-019-00810-4.

CLL is characterized by unusual heterogeneity, which probably reflects its biological and genetic lack of homogeneity. Clonal chromosome aberrations belong to the most important prognostic and predictive factors in CLL. This research was aimed at observing clonal evolution in CLL at the chromosomal level, and assessing its clinical significance in relation to selected prognostic factors. The study involved 72 untreated patients with CLL. The preliminary investigations using cytogenetic banding analysis (CBA) and FISH were performed at the time of diagnosis, and again after about 24 months to observe clonal changes (clonal evolution). In addition, other parameters were evaluated, i.e., the expression of ZAP-70 kinase, CD38 antigen, and the mutation statuses of IGVH and NOTCH1 genes. Classic prognostic factors, i.e., categorized ZAP70 and CD38 expressions as well as mutations in IGVH and NOTCH1 genes did not influence the course of clonal evolution in the examined group of patients. Clonal evolution was detected in 45.8% of patients by means of CBA, and in 19.4% patients with FISH. Analysis of chromosomal aberrations in the examined group of patients showed that the incidence of 17p deletions and translocations in karyotypes has a negative impact on overall survival. CE was found to be a risk factor for the occurrence of disease progression (OR = 2.22). Our observations indicate that combined CBA and FISH are the most optimal techniques for monitoring clonal evolution in the course of CLL.","['Koczkodaj, Dorota', 'Popek-Marciniec, Sylwia', 'Zmorzynski, Szymon', 'Wasik-Szczepanek, Ewa', 'Filip, Agata A']","['Koczkodaj D', 'Popek-Marciniec S', 'Zmorzynski S', 'Wasik-Szczepanek E', 'Filip AA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2254-053X'],"['Department of Cancer Genetics with the Cytogenetic Laboratory, Medical University of Lublin, Ul.

We developed an efficient and robust three-dimensional (3D) scaffold culture model supporting terminal erythroid differentiation from both mononuclear (MNC) or CD34(+)-enriched primary bone marrow cells from healthy donors and MDS-RS patients. While CD34(+) cells did not proliferate beyond two weeks in 2D suspension cultures, the 3D scaffolds supported CD34(+) and MNC erythroid proliferation over four weeks demonstrating the importance of the 3D environment. CD34(+) cells cultured in 3D facilitated the highest expansion and maturation of erythroid cells, including generation of erythroblastic islands and enucleated erythrocytes, while MNCs supported multi-lineage hemopoietic differentiation and cytokine secretion relevant for MDS-RS. Importantly, MDS-RS 3D-cultures supported de novo generation of ring sideroblasts and maintenance of the mutated clone. The 3D cultures effectively model a clonal disease characterized by terminal erythroid failure and can be used to assess therapeutic compounds.","['Elvarsdottir, Edda Maria', 'Mortera-Blanco, Teresa', 'Dimitriou, Marios', 'Bouderlique, Thibault', 'Jansson, Monika', 'Hofman, Isabel Juliana F', 'Conte, Simona', 'Karimi, Mohsen', 'Sander, Birgitta', 'Douagi, Iyadh', 'Woll, Petter S', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg, Eva']","['Elvarsdottir EM', 'Mortera-Blanco T', 'Dimitriou M', 'Bouderlique T', 'Jansson M', 'Hofman IJF', 'Conte S', 'Karimi M', 'Sander B', 'Douagi I', 'Woll PS', 'Hellstrom-Lindberg E']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8362-2099', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3926-990X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2340-2526']","['Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Division of Pathology, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Center for Hematology and Regenerative Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Department of Medicine, Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden. eva.hellstrom-lindberg@ki.se.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, CD34)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD34', '*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/cytology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Humans', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/cytology', '*Myelodysplastic Syndromes']",PMC7214248,,,2019/08/04 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2019/08/04 06:00'],"['2019/01/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0532-7 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0532-7 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jan;34(1):271-282. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0532-7.

However, their mechanisms of action remain incompletely understood, and predictive biomarkers for HMA efficacy are lacking. Here, we show that the bioactive metabolite decitabine triphosphate, but not azacytidine triphosphate, functions as activator and substrate of the triphosphohydrolase SAMHD1 and is subject to SAMHD1-mediated inactivation. Retrospective immunohistochemical analysis of bone marrow specimens from AML patients at diagnosis revealed that SAMHD1 expression in leukemic cells inversely correlates with clinical response to decitabine, but not to azacytidine. SAMHD1 ablation increases the antileukemic activity of decitabine in AML cell lines, primary leukemic blasts, and xenograft models. AML cells acquire resistance to decitabine partly by SAMHD1 up-regulation. Together, our data suggest that SAMHD1 is a biomarker for the stratified use of hypomethylating agents in AML patients and a potential target for the treatment of decitabine-resistant leukemia.","['Oellerich, Thomas', 'Schneider, Constanze', 'Thomas, Dominique', 'Knecht, Kirsten M', 'Buzovetsky, Olga', 'Kaderali, Lars', 'Schliemann, Christoph', 'Bohnenberger, Hanibal', 'Angenendt, Linus', 'Hartmann, Wolfgang', 'Wardelmann, Eva', 'Rothenburger, Tamara', 'Mohr, Sebastian', 'Scheich, Sebastian', 'Comoglio, Federico', 'Wilke, Anne', 'Strobel, Philipp', 'Serve, Hubert', 'Michaelis, Martin', 'Ferreiros, Nerea', 'Geisslinger, Gerd', 'Xiong, Yong', 'Keppler, Oliver T', 'Cinatl, Jindrich Jr']","['Oellerich T', 'Schneider C', 'Thomas D', 'Knecht KM', 'Buzovetsky O', 'Kaderali L', 'Schliemann C', 'Bohnenberger H', 'Angenendt L', 'Hartmann W', 'Wardelmann E', 'Rothenburger T', 'Mohr S', 'Scheich S', 'Comoglio F', 'Wilke A', 'Strobel P', 'Serve H', 'Michaelis M', 'Ferreiros N', 'Geisslinger G', 'Xiong Y', 'Keppler OT', 'Cinatl J Jr']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5892-3770', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1038-1030', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2502-9910', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7609-5021', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6788-4910', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6408-3536', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8970-6610', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8472-5516', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5710-5888', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6744-2087']","['Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium/German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60596, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60596, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Virology, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.', 'pharmazentrum frankfurt/ZAFES, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Institute of Bioinformatics, University Medicine Greifswald, Greifswald, 17475, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Munster, Munster, 48149, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center, Gottingen, 37075, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine A, University Hospital Munster, Munster, 48149, Germany.', 'Gerhard Domagk Institute for Pathology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, 48149, Germany.', 'Gerhard Domagk Institute for Pathology, University Hospital Munster, Munster, 48149, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Virology, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.', 'Department of Haematology, Cambridge Institute of Medical Research, Cambridge University, Cambridge, CB2 0XY, UK.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Medical Center, Gottingen, 37075, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine II, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium/German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, 69120, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute, Goethe University Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60596, Germany.', 'Industrial Biotechnology Centre and School of Biosciences, University of Kent, Canterbury, CT2 7NJ, UK.', 'pharmazentrum frankfurt/ZAFES, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.', 'pharmazentrum frankfurt/ZAFES, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Goethe University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.', 'Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME), Project group Translational Medicine and Pharmacology (TMP), Frankfurt, 60596, Germany.', 'Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry, Yale University, New Haven, CT, 06520, USA.', 'Institute of Medical Virology, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany. keppler@mvp.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Max von Pettenkofer Institute, Virology, Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munchen, Munich, 80336, Germany. keppler@mvp.uni-muenchen.de.', 'Institute of Medical Virology, University of Frankfurt, Frankfurt, 60590, Germany.

Although dormancy is a regulated response in brown adipocytes to environmental warmth, its transcriptional mechanisms and functional importance are unknown. Here, we identify B cell leukemia/lymphoma 6 (BCL6) as a critical regulator of dormancy in brown adipocytes but not for their commitment, differentiation, or cold-induced activation. In a temperature-dependent manner, BCL6 suppresses apoptosis, fatty acid storage, and coupled respiration to maintain thermogenic fitness during dormancy. Mechanistically, BCL6 remodels the epigenome of brown adipocytes to enforce brown and oppose white adipocyte cellular identity. Thus, unlike other thermogenic regulators, BCL6 is specifically required for maintaining thermogenic fitness when mammals acclimate to environmental warmth.","['Kutyavin, Vassily I', 'Chawla, Ajay']","['Kutyavin VI', 'Chawla A']",,"['Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0795.', 'Cardiovascular Research Institute, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0795; Ajay.Chawla@ucsf.edu.', 'Department of Physiology, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0795.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA 94143-0795.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Bcl6 protein, mouse)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6)']",IM,,"['Acclimatization/*physiology', 'Adipocytes, Brown/cytology/*metabolism', 'Animals', '*Cold Temperature', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Fatty Acids/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-6/*metabolism', 'Thermogenesis/*physiology']",PMC6708354,['NOTNLM'],"['*acclimation', '*brown fat', '*metabolism', '*thermogenesis', '*transcription']",2019/08/04 06:00,2020/03/24 06:00,['2019/08/04 06:00'],"['2019/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['1907308116 [pii]', '10.1073/pnas.1907308116 [doi]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2019 Aug 20;116(34):17071-17080. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1907308116.

High GGT expression on tumor cells is associated with increased cell proliferation and resistance against chemotherapy. GGT inhibitors evaluated so far in clinical trials are too toxic for human use. In this study, using enzyme kinetics analyses, we demonstrate that ovothiols, 5(Npi)-methyl thiohistidines of marine origin, act as noncompetitive inhibitors of GGT, with an apparent Ki of 21 mum, when we fixed the concentrations of the donor substrate. We found that these compounds are more potent than the known GGT inhibitor 6-diazo-5-oxo-l-norleucine and are not toxic toward human embryonic cells. In particular, cellular process-specific fluorescence-based assays revealed that ovothiols induce a mixed cell-death phenotype of apoptosis and autophagy in GGT-overexpressing cell lines, including human liver cancer and chronic B leukemic cells. The findings of our study provide the basis for further development of 5-thiohistidines as therapeutics for GGT-positive tumors and highlight that GGT inhibition is involved in autophagy.","['Brancaccio, Mariarita', 'Russo, Maria', 'Masullo, Mariorosario', 'Palumbo, Anna', 'Russo, Gian Luigi', 'Castellano, Immacolata']","['Brancaccio M', 'Russo M', 'Masullo M', 'Palumbo A', 'Russo GL', 'Castellano I']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4161-512X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8385-9184', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4485-7383', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5972-5589', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9321-1613', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4274-6738']","['Department of Biology and Evolution of Marine Organisms, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, 80121 Naples, Italy.', 'Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, 83100 Avellino, Italy.', 'Department of Movement Sciences and Wellbeing, University of Naples ""Parthenope,"" 80133 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Biology and Evolution of Marine Organisms, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, 80121 Naples, Italy.', 'Department of Biology and Evolution of Marine Organisms, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, 80121 Naples, Italy.', 'Institute of Food Sciences, National Research Council, 83100 Avellino, Italy.', 'Department of Biology and Evolution of Marine Organisms, Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, 80121 Naples, Italy immacolata.castellano@szn.it.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Methylhistidines)', '0 (Sulfur Compounds)', '105496-34-2 (ovothiol C)', '4QD397987E (Histidine)', 'EC 2.3.2.2 (gamma-Glutamyltransferase)', 'EC 2.3.2.2 (gamma-glutamyltransferase, human)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",IM,,"['Autophagy/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Glutathione/genetics', 'Histidine/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Methylhistidines/*pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Proteolysis', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Sulfur Compounds/pharmacology', 'gamma-Glutamyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics']",PMC6779435,['NOTNLM'],"['*GGT-positive cells', '*apoptosis', '*autophagy', '*enzyme inhibitor', '*enzyme kinetics', '*ergothioneine', '*glutamyl transpeptidase', '*marine drugs', '*ovothiol', '*thiol']",2019/08/04 06:00,2020/05/07 06:00,['2019/08/04 06:00'],"['2019/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/04 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0021-9258(20)35013-4 [pii]', '10.1074/jbc.RA119.009304 [doi]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 2019 Oct 4;294(40):14603-14614. doi: 10.1074/jbc.RA119.009304.

Patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) do not have microscopically detectable chromosome abnormalities, but can harbor UPDs. We examined the prognostic significance of UPDs and frequency of LOH in patients with CN-AML.Experimental Design: We examined the frequency and prognostic significance of UPDs in a set of 425 adult patients with de novo CN-AML who were previously sequenced for 81 genes typically mutated in cancer. Associations of UPDs with outcome were analyzed in the 315 patients with CN-AML younger than 60 years. RESULTS: We detected 127 UPDs in 109 patients. Most UPDs were large and typically encompassed all or most of the affected chromosome arm. The most common UPDs occurred on chromosome arms 13q (7.5% of patients), 6p (2.8%), and 11p (2.8%). Many UPDs significantly cooccurred with mutations in genes they encompassed, including 13q UPD with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD; P < 0.001), and 11p UPD with WT1 mutations (P = 0.02). Among patients younger than 60 years, UPD of 11p was associated with longer overall survival (OS) and 13q UPD with shorter disease-free survival (DFS) and OS. In multivariable models that accounted for known prognostic markers, including FLT3-ITD and WT1 mutations, UPD of 13q maintained association with shorter DFS, and UPD of 11p maintained association with longer OS. CONCLUSIONS: LOH mediated by UPD is a recurrent feature of CN-AML. Detection of UPDs of 13q and 11p might be useful for genetic risk stratification of patients with CN-AML.","['Walker, Christopher J', 'Kohlschmidt, Jessica', 'Eisfeld, Ann-Kathrin', 'Mrozek, Krzysztof', 'Liyanarachchi, Sandya', 'Song, Chi', 'Nicolet, Deedra', 'Blachly, James S', 'Bill, Marius', 'Papaioannou, Dimitrios', 'Oakes, Christopher C', 'Giacopelli, Brian', 'Genutis, Luke K', 'Maharry, Sophia E', 'Orwick, Shelley', 'Archer, Kellie J', 'Powell, Bayard L', 'Kolitz, Jonathan E', 'Uy, Geoffrey L', 'Wang, Eunice S', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Byrd, John C', 'de la Chapelle, Albert', 'Bloomfield, Clara D']","['Walker CJ', 'Kohlschmidt J', 'Eisfeld AK', 'Mrozek K', 'Liyanarachchi S', 'Song C', 'Nicolet D', 'Blachly JS', 'Bill M', 'Papaioannou D', 'Oakes CC', 'Giacopelli B', 'Genutis LK', 'Maharry SE', 'Orwick S', 'Archer KJ', 'Powell BL', 'Kolitz JE', 'Uy GL', 'Wang ES', 'Carroll AJ', 'Stone RM', 'Byrd JC', 'de la Chapelle A', 'Bloomfield CD']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4275-5562', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9844-730X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5465-7591']","['The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, Ohio.

Recently, it was proposed that the prognosis for patients with IPSS lower-risk disease is heterogeneous, with a substantial proportion of these patients having poor survival. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included patients with IPSS lower-risk MDS from the DRAMA (An Observational Study for Dacogen Long-Term Treatment in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome; NCT01400633) and DIVA (A Study for Dacogen Treatment in Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome; NCT01041846) studies, which were prospective observational studies on the efficacy and safety of decitabine treatment in patients with MDS. Using the Lower-Risk Prognostic Scoring System [LR-PSS], we classified IPSS lower-risk MDS. Patients in each LR-PSS category were divided according to overall response (OR) to decitabine treatment, and survival outcomes were compared. RESULTS: One hundred sixteen patients were enrolled: LR-PSS category 1 (n = 12; 10.3%), category 2 (n = 56; 48.3%), and category 3 (n = 48; 41.4%). Survival outcomes differed among the 3 categories (P = .046). The overall survival according to OR showed a significant difference in total patients (P = .008) and category 3 patients (P = .003). We analyzed predictive factors for OR, but no variable was found to significantly affect OR. CONCLUSION: Decitabine treatment showed a survival benefit in the higher-risk group of IPSS lower-risk MDS patients who responded to treatment, and classification using the LR-PSS category was helpful for this subgroup, indicating that decitabine treatment might alter the natural course of disease in these patients.","['Jung, Ki Sun', 'Kim, Yoo-Jin', 'Kim, Yeo-Kyeoung', 'Park, Sung Kyu', 'Kim, Hoon Gu', 'Kim, Soo Jeong', 'Park, Jinny', 'Choi, Chul Won', 'Do, Young Rok', 'Kim, Inho', 'Park, Seonyang', 'Mun, Yeung-Chul', 'Jeong, Seong Hyun', 'Kim, Min-Kyoung', 'Yi, Hyeon Gyu', 'Chang, Myung Hee', 'Kim, Su Youn', 'Lee, Je-Hwan', 'Jang, Jun Ho']","['Jung KS', 'Kim YJ', 'Kim YK', 'Park SK', 'Kim HG', 'Kim SJ', 'Park J', 'Choi CW', 'Do YR', 'Kim I', 'Park S', 'Mun YC', 'Jeong SH', 'Kim MK', 'Yi HG', 'Chang MH', 'Kim SY', 'Lee JH', 'Jang JH']",,"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Samsung Medical Center, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Seoul, Korea; Division of Hematology-Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Pusan National University Yangsan Hospital, Pusan National University School of Medicine, Yangsan, Korea.', ""Acute Leukemia Center, Seoul St Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Department of Hematology, Chonnam National University Hwasun Hospital, Jeollanam-do, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Soonchunhyang University Hospital, Bucheon, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, Gyeongnam Regional Cancer Center, Institute of Health Sciences, Gyeongsang National University School of Medicine, Jinju, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Severance Hospital, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Gachon University Gil Hospital, Incheon, Korea.', 'Division of Oncology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Medical Center, Seoul, Korea.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, School of Medicine, Keimyung University, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, School of Medicine, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, Ajou University School of Medicine, Suwon, Korea.', 'Division of Oncology-Hematology, Department of Medicine, Yeungnam University College of Medicine, Daegu, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Inha University College of Medicine, Incheon, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, National Health Insurance Service Ilsan Hospital, Ilsan, Korea.', 'Medical Affairs, Janssen Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Hematology, Asan Medical Center, University of Ulsan College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.

Etiologies of aseptic meningitis can be classified in three main groups: (i) systemic diseases with meningeal involvement, which include sarcoidosis, Behcet's disease, Sjogren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus and granulomatosis with polyangiitis; (ii) drug-induced aseptic meningitis, mostly reported with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antibiotics (sulfamides, penicillins), intravenous immunoglobulin, and monoclonal antibodies; (iii) neoplastic meningitis, either related to solid cancer metastasis (breast cancer, lung cancer, melanoma) or malignant hemopathy (lymphoma, leukemia). Most series in the literature included groups of meningitis that are not stricto sensu aseptic, but should rather be included in the differential diagnosis: (i) infectious meningitis related to virus, parasites, fungi, or fastidious bacteria that require specific diagnostic investigations; (ii) bacterial meningitis with sterile CSF due to previous antibiotic administration, and (iii) parameningeal infections associated with meningeal reaction. Despite progress in microbiological diagnosis (including PCR, and next generation sequencing), and identification of a growing panel of autoimmune or paraneoplastic neurological syndromes, up to two thirds of aseptic meningitis cases are of unknown etiology, finally labeled as 'idiopathic'. Description of new entities, such as the syndrome of transient headache and neurologic deficits with cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis (HaNDL) may decrease the proportion of idiopathic aseptic meningitis. This state-of-the-art review summarizes the characteristics of main causes of aseptic meningitis.","['Tattevin, P', 'Tchamgoue, S', 'Belem, A', 'Benezit, F', 'Pronier, C', 'Revest, M']","['Tattevin P', 'Tchamgoue S', 'Belem A', 'Benezit F', 'Pronier C', 'Revest M']",,"['Service de maladies infectieuses et reanimation medicale, CHU de Pontchaillou, rue Le Guilloux, 35033 Rennes Cedex, France.

These tumours are rare, but occur more frequently in cats because of an association with the feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). To the best of our knowledge, no studies conducted in Brazil to date have analysed the association between leukaemia and FeLV and FIV infection in cats. The aim of this study was to perform a histopathological analysis of feline leukaemia and evaluate the association between leukaemia and FeLV and FIV infection in cats. The study evaluated 37 cats with leukaemia diagnosed between 2009 and 2017. The animals underwent necropsy examination, histopathology and immunohistochemistry with anti-FeLV gp70 and anti-FIV p24 gag antibodies. Of the evaluated animals, 54% (20/37) were males and 43.2% (16/37) were females. With respect to the life stage of the animals, 24.3% (9/37) were junior, 32.4% (12/37) were prime, 18.9% (7/37) were mature and 10.8% (4/37) were senior, and five animals were of unknown age. Myeloid leukaemia occurred in 56.8% (21/37) of the cases and lymphocytic leukaemia occurred in 43.2% (16/37) of the cases. Acute leukaemia (73%, 27/37) was more common than chronic leukaemia (27%, 10/37). The positivity for FeLV (78.4%, 29/37) and FIV (16.2%, 6/37) indicated a high association between FeLV infection and tumour development in the study region.","['Cristo, T G', 'Biezus, G', 'Noronha, L F', 'Gaspar, T', 'Dal Pont, T P', 'Withoeft, J A', 'Furlan, L V', 'Costa, L S', 'Traverso, S D', 'Casagrande, R A']","['Cristo TG', 'Biezus G', 'Noronha LF', 'Gaspar T', 'Dal Pont TP', 'Withoeft JA', 'Furlan LV', 'Costa LS', 'Traverso SD', 'Casagrande RA']",,"['Laboratory of Animal Pathology, Agroveterinary Sciences Center, University of Santa Catarina State, Av.

A plethora of drugs were developed to block this kinase pathway for clinical application. With the exception of a recently identified agent, EQW, most of these inhibitors target upstream factors but not ERK1/2; no activator of ERK1/2 is currently available. METHOD: A library of compounds isolated from medicinal plants of China was screened for anti-cancer activities. Three limonoid compounds, termed A1541-43, originally isolated from the plant Melia azedarach, exhibiting strong anti-leukemic activity. The anti-neoplastic activity and the biological target of these compounds were explored using various methods, including western blotting, flow cytometry, molecular docking and animal model for leukemia. RESULTS: Compounds A1541-43, exhibiting potent anti-leukemic activity, was shown to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation. In contrast, the natural product Cedrelone, which shares structural similarities with A1541-43, functions as a potent inhibitor of ERK1/2. We provided evidence that A1541-43 and Cedrelone specifically target ERK1/2, but not the upstream MAPK/ERK pathway. Computational docking analysis predicts that compounds A1541-43 bind a region in ERK1/2 that is distinct from that to which Cedrelone and EQW bind. Interestingly, both A1541-43, which act as ERK1/2 agonists, and Cedrelone, which inhibit these kinases, exerted strong anti-proliferative activity against multiple leukemic cell lines, and induced robust apoptosis as well as erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation in erythroleukemic cell lines. These compounds also suppressed tumor progression in a mouse model of erythroleukemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies for the first time activators of ERK1/2 with therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancers driven by dysregulation of the MAPK/ERK pathway and possibly for other disorders.","['Wang, Ning', 'Fan, Yanhua', 'Yuan, Chun-Mao', 'Song, Jialei', 'Yao, Yao', 'Liu, Wuling', 'Gajendran, Babu', 'Zacksenhaus, Eldad', 'Li, Yanmei', 'Liu, Jielin', 'Hao, Xiao Jiang',

Their usefulness is primarily linked to their ability to provide an indefinite source of biological material for experimental purposes. Under the right conditions and with appropriate controls, authenticated cancer cell lines retain most of the genetic properties of the cancer of origin. During the last few years, comparing genomic data of most cancer cell lines has corroborated this statement and those that were observed studying the tumoral tissue equivalents included in the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We are at the disposal of comprehensive open access cell line datasets describing their molecular and cellular alterations at an unprecedented level of accuracy. This aspect, in association with the possibility of setting up accurate culture conditions that mimic the in vivo microenvironment (e.g., three-dimensional (3D) coculture), has strengthened the importance of cancer cell lines for continuing to sustain medical research fields. However, it is important to consider that the appropriate use of cell lines needs to follow established guidelines for guaranteed data reproducibility and quality, and to prevent the occurrence of detrimental events (i.e., those that are linked to cross-contamination and mycoplasma contamination).","['Mirabelli, Peppino', 'Coppola, Luigi', 'Salvatore, Marco']","['Mirabelli P', 'Coppola L', 'Salvatore M']",,"['IRCCS SDN, 80143 Naples, Italy. pmirabelli@sdn-napoli.it.', 'IRCCS SDN, 80143 Naples, Italy.', 'IRCCS SDN, 80143 Naples, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,,PMC6721418,['NOTNLM'],"['biological samples', 'cell lines', 'leukemia', 'medical research', 'solid cancer']",2019/08/04 06:00,2019/08/04 06:01,['2019/08/04 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/04 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/04 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/04 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11081098 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11081098 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Aug 1;11(8). pii: cancers11081098. doi: 10.3390/cancers11081098.,,20190801,,"['Progetti di Ricerca Corrente/Ministero della Salute', '5 per Mille/IRCCS SDN']",['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Linezolid is a reversible inhibitor of mitochondrial function in various cell types. This study investigated the inhibitory effects of linezolid and tedizolid, and their potential recovery on (i) CYTox I expression (subunit I of cytochrome c-oxidase; encoded by the mitochondrial genome), (ii) cytochrome c-oxidase activity and (iii) mitochondrial respiration (Seahorse bioanalysis) in two megakaryocytic cell lines [UT-7 WT (human acute megakaryoblastic leukaemia cells) and UT-7 MPL (transduced to express the thrombopoietin receptor)]. Cells were exposed to linezolid (0.5-25 mg/L) or tedizolid (0.1-5 mg/L) for up to 5 days and recovery followed after drug removal. Both oxazolidinones caused concentration- and time-dependent inhibition of CYTox I expression, cytochrome c-oxidase activity and mitochondrial spare capacity. On electron microscopy, mitochondria appeared dilated with a loss of cristae. Globally, tedizolid exerted stronger effects than linezolid. While CYTox I expression recovered completely after 6 days of drug washout, only partial (linezolid) or no (tedizolid) recovery of cytochrome c-oxidase activity, and no rescue of mitochondrial spare capacity (after 3 days) was observed. Thus, and in contrast to previous studies using a variety of cell lines unrelated to megakaryocytic lineages, the inhibitory effects exerted by oxazolidinones on the mitochondrial function of megakaryoblastic cells appear to be particularly protracted. Given the dynamics of platelet production and destruction, these results may explain why oxazolidinone-induced thrombocytopenia is one of the most common side effects in patients exposed to these antibiotics.","['Milosevic, Tamara V', 'Vertenoeil, Gaelle', 'Payen, Valery L', 'Sonveaux, Pierre', 'Tulkens, Paul M', 'Constantinescu, Stefan N', 'Van Bambeke, Francoise']","['Milosevic TV', 'Vertenoeil G', 'Payen VL', 'Sonveaux P', 'Tulkens PM', 'Constantinescu SN', 'Van Bambeke F']",,"['Pharmacologie cellulaire et moleculaire, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Signal Transduction and Molecular Haematology, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Brussels Branch, Brussels, Belgium; de Duve Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pole of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institute of Experimental and Clinical Research, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pole of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Institute of Experimental and Clinical Research, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pharmacologie cellulaire et moleculaire, Louvain Drug Research Institute, Universite catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium.

While patients living with chronic myeloid leukemia in the chronic phase (CML-CP) have a good response to TKI, blastic phase (CML-BP) patients demonstrate poor efficacy and high fatality rates. However, while the mechanism of blast crisis of chronic myeloid leukemia remains unclear, high expression and activation of BCR-ABL are usually related to CML blast crisis transition. We found that histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) demethylase RBP2 expression is negatively correlated with BCR-ABL expression, which suggests a regulatory link between these two genes. We also discovered that RBP2 mediates the dephosphorylation of BCR-ABL by directly downregulating PTEN expression, depending on histone demethylase activity, while PTEN targets protein phosphatase activity of BCR-ABL, a phosphatase which directly dephosphorylates BCR-ABL. In clinical specimens, the mRNA expression of RBP2 was found to be positively correlated with that of PTEN. These data suggest that the under-expression of RBP2 promotes blast crisis transition by activating an RBP2/PTEN/BCR-ABL cascade.","['Yin, Xiaolin', 'Zhou, Minran', 'Fu, Yue', 'Yang, Lin', 'Xu, Man', 'Sun, Ting', 'Wang, Xiaoming', 'Huang, Tao', 'Chen, Chunyan']","['Yin X', 'Zhou M', 'Fu Y', 'Yang L', 'Xu M', 'Sun T', 'Wang X', 'Huang T', 'Chen C']",,"['Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, No. 107,Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan 250012, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, No. 107,Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan 250012, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, No. 107,Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan 250012, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, No. 107,Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan 250012, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, No. 107,Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan 250012, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, No. 107,Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan 250012, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, No. 107,Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan 250012, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, No. 107,Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan 250012, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Hematology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, No. 107,Wenhua Xi Road, Jinan 250012, Shandong, PR China.

Within this hierarchy, it is thought that an immature subpopulation of tumor-propagating cancer stem cells (CSCs) differentiates into non-tumorigenic progeny, providing a rationale for therapeutic strategies that specifically eradicate CSCs or induce their differentiation. The clinical success of these approaches depends on CSC differentiation being unidirectional rather than reversible, yet this question remains unresolved even in prototypically hierarchical malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Here, we show in murine and human models of AML that, upon perturbation of endogenous expression of the lineage-determining transcription factor PU.1 or withdrawal of established differentiation therapies, some mature leukemia cells can de-differentiate and reacquire clonogenic and leukemogenic properties. Our results reveal plasticity of CSC maturation in AML, highlighting the need to therapeutically eradicate cancer cells across a range of differentiation states.","['McKenzie, Mark D', 'Ghisi, Margherita', 'Oxley, Ethan P', 'Ngo, Steven', 'Cimmino, Luisa', 'Esnault, Cecile', 'Liu, Ruijie', 'Salmon, Jessica M', 'Bell, Charles C', 'Ahmed, Nouraiz', 'Erlichster, Michael', 'Witkowski, Matthew T', 'Liu, Grace J', 'Chopin, Michael', 'Dakic, Aleksandar', 'Simankowicz, Emilia', 'Pomilio, Giovanna', 'Vu, Tina', 'Krsmanovic, Pavle', 'Su, Shian', 'Tian, Luyi', 'Baldwin, Tracey M', 'Zalcenstein, Daniela A', 'DiRago, Ladina', 'Wang, Shu', 'Metcalf, Donald', 'Johnstone, Ricky W', 'Croker, Ben A', 'Lancaster, Graeme I', 'Murphy, Andrew J', 'Naik, Shalin H', 'Nutt, Stephen L', 'Pospisil, Vitek', 'Schroeder, Timm', 'Wall, Meaghan', 'Dawson, Mark A', 'Wei, Andrew H', 'de The, Hugues', 'Ritchie, Matthew E', 'Zuber, Johannes', 'Dickins, Ross A']","['McKenzie MD', 'Ghisi M', 'Oxley EP', 'Ngo S', 'Cimmino L', 'Esnault C', 'Liu R', 'Salmon JM', 'Bell CC', 'Ahmed N', 'Erlichster M', 'Witkowski MT', 'Liu GJ', 'Chopin M', 'Dakic A', 'Simankowicz E', 'Pomilio G', 'Vu T', 'Krsmanovic P', 'Su S', 'Tian L', 'Baldwin TM', 'Zalcenstein DA', 'DiRago L', 'Wang S', 'Metcalf D', 'Johnstone RW', 'Croker BA', 'Lancaster GI', 'Murphy AJ', 'Naik SH', 'Nutt SL', 'Pospisil V', 'Schroeder T', 'Wall M', 'Dawson MA', 'Wei AH', 'de The H', 'Ritchie ME', 'Zuber J', 'Dickins RA']",,"['Molecular Medicine Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, 1G Royal Parade, Parkville, VIC 3052, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Commercial Road, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Commercial Road, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Commercial Road, Melbourne, VIC 3004, Australia.', 'Department of Pathology, New York University School of Medicine, 550 1(st) Avenue, New York, NY 10016, USA.', 'College de France, PSL Research University, 75005 Paris, France;

DIAGNOSIS: Anti-GBM disease was diagnosed by renal biopsy, in which crescentic glomerulonephritis was observed with light microscopy, strong linear immunofluorescent staining for immunoglobulin G on the GBM and positive serum anti-GBM antibody. Given this diagnosis, the patient was treated with plasmapheresis, steroids, and cyclophosphamide for 4 months. The anti-GBM antibody titer was maintained to negative level but the patient remained dialysis-dependent. One year later, the patient suffered with a relapse of anti-GBM disease, after an extensive examination, he was further diagnosed T-LGL leukemia by accident. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received cyclosporine A therapy for T-LGL leukemia. OUTCOMES: After treatment with cyclosporine A, serum anti-GBM antibody became undetectable. During the 16 months follow-up, anti-GBM titer remained normal and abnormal T-lymphocytes in the bone marrow and peripheral blood were also decreased. LESSONS: T-LGL leukemia is an indolent lymphoproliferative disorder that represents a monoclonal expansion of cytotoxic T cells, which has been reported to be accompanied by some autoimmune diseases. This is the first report of coincidence of T-LGL leukemia and anti-GBM disease, and suggests there are some relationships between these 2 diseases. Clinical physicians should exclude hematological tumors when faced with recurrent anti-GBM disease.","['Zhang, Min', 'Guan, Nan', 'Zhu, Ping', 'Chen, Tong', 'Liu, Shaojun', 'Hao, Chuanming', 'Xue, Jun']","['Zhang M', 'Guan N', 'Zhu P', 'Chen T', 'Liu S', 'Hao C', 'Xue J']",,"['Division of Nephrology.', 'Division of Nephrology.', 'Division of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Division of Hematology, Huashan Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.', 'Division of Nephrology.', 'Division of Nephrology.', 'Division of Nephrology.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Anti-Glomerular Basement Membrane Disease/*complications/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Large Granular Lymphocytic/*complications', 'Male', 'Plasmapheresis', 'Renal Dialysis']",PMC6708844,,,2019/08/03 06:00,2019/09/04 06:00,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000016649 [doi]', '00005792-201908020-00035 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Aug;98(31):e16649. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000016649.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter is a rare subtype of acute myeloid leukemia and represents a hematological emergency. The clinical manifestations of DS, after induction therapy with differentiating agents, include unexplained fever, acute respiratory distress with interstitial pulmonary infiltrates, unexplained hypotension, peripheral edema, congestive heart failure and acute renal failure. The therapy is based on early intravenous administration of high-dose dexamethasone, in order to counteract the cytokine storm responsible for the DS. Among the supportive measures for the management of DS, furosemide (in 87% of patients) and dialysis (12% of patients) are used to manage acute renal failure, peripheral and pulmonary edema. We describe a case of acute renal failure, treated with haemodialysis, in a young patient with APL and an early and severe DS after induction therapy. This is a rare condition, not well known among nephrologists, where early recognition and treatment are crucial for the prognosis.","['Di Micco, Lucia', 'Mirenghi, Francesco', 'Morelli, Emanuela', 'De Simone, Emanuele']","['Di Micco L', 'Mirenghi F', 'Morelli E', 'De Simone E']",,"['UOC Nefrologia e Dialisi, Ospedale Del Mare, ASL Napoli 1 Centro, Napoli, Italia.', 'UOC Nefrologia, Azienda Ospedaliera Dei Colli, Napoli, Italia.', 'UOC Ematologia-Oncologia e Trapianto, Istituto nazionale Tumori -IRCCS- Fondazione G.

The persistence of bone marrow leukemia stem cells (LSCs) is the main cause of TKI resistance and CML relapse. Therefore, finding a key target or pathway to selectively target LSCs is of great significance for the thorough treatment of CML. METHODS: In this study, we aimed to identify key microRNAs, microRNA targets and pathways for the treatment of CML LSCs by integrating analyses of three microarray data profiles. We identified 51 differentially expressed microRNAs through integrated analysis of GSE90773 and performed functional gene predictions for microRNAs. Then, GSE11889 and GSE11675 were integrated to obtain differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and the overlapping DEGs were used as models to identify predictive functional genes. Finally, we identified 116 predictive functional genes. Clustering and significant enrichment analysis of 116 genes was based on function and signaling pathways. Subsequently, a protein interaction network was constructed, and module analysis and topology analysis were performed on the network. RESULTS: A total of 11 key candidate targets and 33 corresponding microRNAs were identified. The key pathways were mainly concentrated on the PI3K/AKT, Ras, JAK/STAT, FoxO and Notch signaling pathways. We also found that LSCs negatively regulated endogenous and exogenous apoptotic pathways to escape from apoptosis. CONCLUSION: We identified key candidate targets and pathways for CML LSCs through bioinformatics methods, which improves our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of CML LSCs. These candidate genes and pathways may be therapeutic targets for CML LSCs.","['Li, Huayao', 'Liu, Lijuan', 'Zhuang, Jing', 'Liu, Cun', 'Zhou, Chao', 'Yang, Jing', 'Gao, Chundi', 'Liu, Gongxi', 'Sun, Changgang']","['Li H', 'Liu L', 'Zhuang J', 'Liu C', 'Zhou C', 'Yang J', 'Gao C', 'Liu G', 'Sun C']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6648-3602'],"['College of Basic medical, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.', 'College of First Clinical Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Affilited Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Affilited Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Weifang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.', 'College of First Clinical Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Affilited Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Weifang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Affilited Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Weifang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.', 'College of First Clinical Medicine, Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Affilited Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Weifang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Affilited Hospital of Weifang Medical University, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.', 'Department of Oncology, Weifang Traditional Chinese Hospital, Weifang, Shandong, PR China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Genet Genomic Med,Molecular genetics & genomic medicine,101603758,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['*Biomarkers, Tumor', '*Computational Biology/methods', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Ontology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy/*genetics/*metabolism', 'MicroRNAs/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/*metabolism', 'Protein Interaction Mapping', 'Protein Interaction Maps', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects']",PMC6732304,['NOTNLM'],"['*bioinformatics', '*chronic myeloid leukemia', '*differentially expressed genes', '*differentially expressed microRNAs', '*gene chip', '*leukemia stem cells']",2019/08/03 06:00,2020/06/20 06:00,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/mgg3.851 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Genet Genomic Med. 2019 Sep;7(9):e851. doi: 10.1002/mgg3.851.

METHODS: All SNPs were genotyped in 226 adult AML cases and 406 healthy individuals. AML patients were investigated for FLT3 (ITD, D835), DNMT3A (R882), and NPM1 type A mutations. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that age above 65 years had a negative influence on survival (P < .001). The presence of the rs1800750 variant genotype (P = .005) or FLT3-ITD mutation (P = .009) in a cytogenetic high-risk group (P = .003) negatively influenced OS. A negative association was observed between Eastern Cooperative Oncologic Group Scale status > 2, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, platelet (PLT) count <40 000 cells/mm(3) , and OS. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the presence of the rs1800750 variant genotype was a risk factor for death (P = .007), and that blast percentage, LDH level (>/=600 IU/L), and cytogenetic high-risk were independent significant predictors for death in AML (P = .04, corrected HR = 1.20; P = .022, corrected HR = 1.24; P = .021, corrected HR = 1.34, respectively).

The initial estimation of the frequency was 1:250 000 leukaemic cells, clearly indicating the difficulties ahead in translating knowledge on LSCs to the clinical setting. However, the field has steadily grown in interest, expanse and importance, concomitantly with the realisation of the molecular background for AML culminating in the sequencing of hundreds of AML genomes. The literature is now ripe with contributions describing how different molecular aberrations are more or less specific for LSCs, as well as reports showing selectivity in targeting LSCs in comparison to normal haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. However, we argue here that these important data have not yet been fully realised within the clinical setting. In this clinically focused review, we outline the difficulties in identifying and defining LSCs at the individual patient level, with special emphasis on intraclonal heterogeneity. In addition, we suggest areas of future focus in order to realise the concept as real-time benefit for AML patients.","['Hokland, Peter', 'Woll, Petter S', 'Hansen, Marcus C', 'Bill, Marie']","['Hokland P', 'Woll PS', 'Hansen MC', 'Bill M']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1177-9756', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2340-2526', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3083-4850', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9198-8266']","['Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Medicine, Huddinge, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Odense University Hospital, Odense, Denmark.', 'Department of Haematology, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['*Genome, Human', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology', 'History, 20th Century', 'History, 21st Century', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/history/metabolism/pathology', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/metabolism/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*clinical targeting', '*critical re-evaluation', '*identification', '*leukaemic stem cells']",2019/08/03 06:00,2020/06/10 06:00,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16104 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Oct;187(2):144-156. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16104.

Intrasplenic pseudoaneurysms are rare and more frequently recognize traumatic origin, sometimes are also unexpected lesions due to non-recent trauma. In contrast, non-traumatic intrasplenic pseudoaneurysms are rare complications usually due to splenic infarction, infiltration by malignant systemic disorders, infectious process, chronic pancreatitis, and arteritis. Both traumatic and non-traumatic PSA are potentially life threatening, known to cause spontaneous rupture of the spleen with massive hemoperitoneum. Contrast-enhanced CT is the gold standard technique to detect splenic PSA; however, it is important to know how to recognize it also with other imaging methods such as with ultrasound (US) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). US and CEUS can be often the first-line diagnostic techniques and allow to detect these lesions; they are also very useful in the follow-up. Our case report can be a reminder of the utility of the US and CEUS in detecting splenic pseudoaneurysms, which are potentially a life-threatening complication; we also recall the semiotics of these lesions with baseline ultrasound (US), color Doppler US and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS). Then, we highlight the role of contrast-enhanced CT in confirming the diagnosis and we report about the diagnostic and therapeutic value of angiography. We have to think about the possibility of a pseudoaneurysm even in the absence of a recent trauma, associated with other conditions such as a lymphoproliferative disease.","['Trinci, Margherita', 'Giangregorio, Carlo', 'Calabrese, Giovanna', 'Ottaviani, Pierfrancesco', 'Riu, Pascale', 'Galluzzo, Michele', 'Miele, Vittorio']","['Trinci M', 'Giangregorio C', 'Calabrese G', 'Ottaviani P', 'Riu P', 'Galluzzo M', 'Miele V']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2100-7450', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7848-1567']","['Department of Emergency Radiology, Azienda Ospedaliera San Camillo-Forlanini, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency Radiology, Azienda Ospedaliera San Camillo-Forlanini, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency Radiology, Azienda Ospedaliera San Camillo-Forlanini, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Emergency Radiology, Azienda Ospedaliera San Camillo-Forlanini, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Interventional Radiology, Azienda Ospedaliera S.

We aim to cover some of the current treatment options for MPNs and discuss new agents in development. RECENT FINDINGS: The introduction of ruxolitinib improved the treatment of many patients with intermediate and higher risk myelofibrosis. However, ruxolitinib monotherapy does not benefit all patients, and not all patients can receive this therapy due to limiting cytopenias. The unraveling of new molecular abnormalities and cellular pathways led to the development of several novel targeted agents that are currently under investigation in clinical trials. These agents have different mechanisms of action and are being used either alone or in combination with ruxolitinib. Novel targets include inhibition of apoptosis, the tumor microenvironment, telomerase enzyme action, immunotherapy, and fibrosis with associated cytokines. We comprehensively review and summarize the available preclinical and clinical trials with novel agents for MPNs.","['Economides, Minas P', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen']","['Economides MP', 'Verstovsek S', 'Pemmaraju N']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, The University of Texas School of Health Sciences at Houston, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Boulevard, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. npemmaraju@mdanderson.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Janus Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Janus Kinases/antagonists & inhibitors', '*Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*JAK inhibitors', '*Myeloproliferative neoplasms', '*Novel drugs', '*Novel therapies', '*Ruxolitinib']",2019/08/03 06:00,2020/07/31 06:00,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-019-00538-4 [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-019-00538-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2019 Oct;14(5):460-468. doi: 10.1007/s11899-019-00538-4.,,,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hybrid agents with dual activity, which have been shown to possess anti-cancer effect, are expected to potentially improve the prognosis of AML patients. EDO-S101 is a novel alkylating deacetylase inhibitor molecule synthesized by the addition of the hydroxamic acid of histone deacetylases inhibitor vorinostat into bendamustine, a DNA-damaging agent. However, the effect of EDO-S101 in combination with traditional chemotherapy drugs has not been studied in AML. In this study, we investigated the effect of EDO-S101 in combination with cytarabine in treating AML cells. The synergic activity against AML was identified by remarkable reduction of cell viability, significant apoptosis enhancement and the upregulation of the cleaved PARP, Casepase-3 and -7 proteins compared with monotherapy. To explain the drivers, we detected the DNA damage pathway including DNA double-strand breaks marker gamma-H2AX and DNA damage checkpoint proteins, which was supposed to be responsible for the enhanced apoptosis activity. In summary, our data demonstrated that EDO-S101 in combination with cytarabine could synergistically induce the apoptosis of AML cells and it might be a potential regimen for treating leukemia.","['Jin, Jingrui', 'Mao, Shihui', 'Li, Fenglin', 'Li, Xia', 'Huang, Xin', 'Yu, Mengxia', 'Guo, Wenjian', 'Jin, Jie']","['Jin J', 'Mao S', 'Li F', 'Li X', 'Huang X', 'Yu M', 'Guo W', 'Jin J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8166-9915'],"[""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No.79, Qingchun Road, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No.79, Qingchun Road, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No.79, Qingchun Road, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No.79, Qingchun Road, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No.79, Qingchun Road, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Hangzhou First People's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital & Yuying Children's Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, No.79, Qingchun Road, Shangcheng District, Hangzhou, People's Republic of China. jiej0503@zju.edu.cn."", ""Key Laboratory of Hematopoietic Malignancies, Diagnosis and Treatment, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, People's Republic of China. jiej0503@zju.edu.cn.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Oncol,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",9435512,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '29DKI2H2NY (tinostamustine)']",IM,,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzimidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/drug effects/genetics', 'Drug Synergism', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Apoptosis', 'Cytarabine', 'DNA damage', 'EDO-S101']",2019/08/03 06:00,2020/01/11 06:00,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/05/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s12032-019-1302-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12032-019-1302-0 [pii]']",epublish,Med Oncol. 2019 Aug 1;36(9):77. doi: 10.1007/s12032-019-1302-0.,,20190801,,"['81820108004/Major International Joint Research Programme', '81700137/National Natural Science Foundation of China']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study was approved and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients and controls provided written, informed consent before entering the study. All study participants' medical history and their medication were documented upon enrolling. Results: Lower levels of TAC and Vitamin E were observed in most of the studied groups compared to healthy controls (0.41-0.49 mmol/L vs. 0.56 mmol/L) (19.55-28.55 mumol/L vs. 34.51 mumol/L). Moreover, higher average MDA levels were observed in HL and NHL patients compared to healthy controls (16.6 ng/ml-17.8 ng/ml vs. 7.4 ng/ml). Additionally, the ROS values of all studied groups were found elevated. Serum TAC showed significant negative correlations with MDA values (R= -0.51; P<0.001). Statistical significance was observed in all hematological parameters, producing either positive or negative correlation with at least one OS biomarker. Conclusion: The present data suggest that Sardinian patients with HL and NHL on the day of their diagnosis presented the highest OS in comparison to AML and healthy subjects. Moreover, MDS patients presented high OS status. Likewise, our results also indicated that changes in their hematological indices are eminent of their oxidative and antioxidative status.","['Tsamesidis, Ioannis', 'Pantaleo, Antonella', 'Pekou, Anna', 'Gusani, Amrita', 'Iliadis, Stavros', 'Makedou, Kali', 'Manca, Alessia', 'Carruale, Antonio', 'Lymperaki, Eugenia', 'Fozza, Claudio']","['Tsamesidis I', 'Pantaleo A', 'Pekou A', 'Gusani A', 'Iliadis S', 'Makedou K', 'Manca A', 'Carruale A', 'Lymperaki E', 'Fozza C']",,"['Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Pharmacy, University of Portsmouth, Portsmouth, UK.', 'Department of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Laboratories, Alexander Technological Educational Institute of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Sassari, Sassari, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res,International journal of hematology-oncology and stem cell research,101511150,,,,,PMC6660479,['NOTNLM'],"['Hematological malignancies, Sardinia', 'Malondialdehyde', 'Oxidative stress biomarkers', 'Reactive oxygen species', 'Total antioxidant capacity']",2019/08/03 06:00,2019/08/03 06:01,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/03 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Hematol Oncol Stem Cell Res. 2019 Apr 1;13(2):49-57.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is characterized by presence of two or more of hyperkalemia, hyperuricemia, hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia. TLS may cause acute kidney injury (AKI), arrhythmias and seizures. Our objective was to determine the frequency of TLS and its biochemical abnormalities in children with ALL. Methods: A retrospective study on 91 children, aged 2-13 years with ALL was carried out in Nephrology and Oncology departments of National Institute of Child Health, Karachi from January 2016 to December 2017. Patients already received chemotherapy were excluded. Data including risk categories, immunophenotyping, laboratory parameters like complete blood picture, serum creatinine (SCr), potassium(K), calcium (Ca), phosphorus(P) and uric acid (UA) on day 0,3 and 7 after chemotherapy were collected. Data analyzed on SPSS using descriptive statistics. Independent t- test was applied to compare means and P- value<0.05 was taken as significant. Results: Ninety-one children with mean age of 6.39+/-3.08 years were studied. Male were 57% and 43% female. High risk ALL were 61.5%. Pre -BALL were 82.4% and 17.5% had T-cell ALL. All patients had anemia (hemoglobin7.69+/-2.66 g/dl) and thrombocytopenia (43.61+/- 18.6 x10(9)) where as hyperleukocytosis and blast cells were observed in 20.87% and 73.6% respectively. Comparing the biochemical parameters of ALL, the difference in SCr from D0 vs D3 (0.46+/-0.16 vs0.54+/- 0.35 and D7, 0.44+/-0.22) was significant (p=0.001). Similarly, difference in UA (D0, 4.12+/-2.40 vs D3, 3.82+/-1.73 and D7, 3.56+/-1.42), SP (D0, 4.24+/-1.34 vs D3, 4.61+/-1.76 and D7,4.13+/-1.07mg/dl)and for K (p=0.038) was significant. There was no difference in Ca from D0 vs D3 (0.092) and D7 (0.277). TLS was found in 62.6% children, it was chemotherapy induced in 72% and spontaneous in 28%. Clinical-TLS was observed in 14% and all CTLS had AKI. Hyperuricemia and hyperphosphatemia were the most common biochemical abnormalities in laboratory-TLS and CTLS. Conclusion: TLS was found in 62.6% despite preventive measures. Early recognition and treatment is essential to avoid morbidity and mortality.","['Naeem, Bilqis', 'Moorani, Khemchand N', 'Anjum, Misbah', 'Imam, Uzma']","['Naeem B', 'Moorani KN', 'Anjum M', 'Imam U']",,"['Bilquis Naeem, MBBS, FCPS, FCPS, Assistant Professor, Pediatric Medicine, Departments of Pediatric Nephrology, National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Jinnah Sindh Medical University (JSMU) Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Prof. Khemchand N Moorani, FCPS, MCPS, MBBS, Departments of Pediatric Nephrology, National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Jinnah Sindh Medical University (JSMU) Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Misbah Anjum, MBBS, FCPS, Assistant Professor, Pediatric Medicine Pediatric Medical Unit III, National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Jinnah Sindh Medical University (JSMU) Karachi, Pakistan.', 'Uzma Imam MBBS, Senior Medical officer, Pediatric Oncology, National Institute of Child Health (NICH), Jinnah Sindh Medical University (JSMU) Karachi, Pakistan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Pakistan,Pak J Med Sci,Pakistan journal of medical sciences,100913117,,,,,PMC6659073,['NOTNLM'],"['Tumor lysis syndrome', 'acute kidney injury', 'hyperphosphatemia', 'hyperuricemia', 'hypocalcemia']",2019/08/03 06:00,2019/08/03 06:01,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.12669/pjms.35.4.715 [doi]', 'PJMS-35-899 [pii]']",ppublish,Pak J Med Sci. 2019 Jul-Aug;35(4):899-904. doi: 10.12669/pjms.35.4.715.,,,,,['Conflict of Interest: None'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While recent trials have demonstrated impressive results for ibrutinib, there remains a paucity of real-world data on its use in the clinical setting. Methods: In this single-center study carried out at Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, we retrospectively compared outcomes in 38 patients with relapsed CLL who received ibrutinib versus those who received conventional first- and second-line therapies. Results: Our results demonstrate improved progression-free survival (PFS, p=0.022) with ibrutinib versus conventional second-line therapies and survival comparable to conventional first-line therapies. However, there was a high frequency (81.6%) of adverse events associated with ibrutinib therapy, including 2 cases of death secondary to sepsis and a further 7 cases of discontinuation of treatment due to adverse events. We also identify del13q14.3 as an adverse predictor of response to ibrutinib with respect to both overall survival (p=0.014) and PFS (p=0.008), suggesting that these patients may be better suited to receiving the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax. Conclusion: Whilst there is robust evidence for improved outcomes with ibrutinib, we find that survival in patients with del13q14.3 is reduced and that the rate of adverse events and discontinuation in clinical practice is higher than anticipated from clinical trials.","['Nuttall, Elisabeth', 'Tung, Joanna', 'Trounce, Ellie', 'Johnston, Rosalynd', 'Chevassut, Timothy']","['Nuttall E', 'Tung J', 'Trounce E', 'Johnston R', 'Chevassut T']",,"['Nelson Hospital, Nelson and Marlborough District Health Board, Nelson, New Zealand.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, Brighton, UK.', 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.', 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, Brighton, UK.', 'Department of Haematology, Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust, Brighton, UK.', 'Brighton and Sussex Medical School, University of Sussex, Brighton, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,J Blood Med,Journal of blood medicine,101550884,,,,,PMC6628601,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'adverse events', 'chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', 'ibrutinib', 'real-world', 'relapsed']",2019/08/03 06:00,2019/08/03 06:01,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/01/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/JBM.S202286 [doi]', '202286 [pii]']",epublish,J Blood Med. 2019 Jul 9;10:199-208. doi: 10.2147/JBM.S202286. eCollection 2019.,,20190709,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Subtypes include indolent systemic mastocytosis, smoldering systemic mastocytosis and advanced systemic mastocytosis (AdvSM), a term collectively used for the three most aggressive forms of the disease: aggressive systemic mastocytosis, mast cell leukemia, and systemic mastocytosis with an associated clonal hematological non-mast cell disease (SM-AHNMD). MC activation and proliferation is physiologically controlled in part through stem cell factor (SCF) binding to its cognate receptor, KIT. Gain-of-function KIT mutations that lead to ligand-independent kinase activation are found in most SM subtypes, and the overwhelming majority of AdvSM patients harbor the KIT(D816V) mutation. Several approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib and nilotinib, have activity against wild-type KIT but lack activity against KIT(D816V). Midostaurin, a broad spectrum TKI with activity against KIT(D816V), has a 60% clinical response rate, and is currently the only drug specifically approved for AdvSM. While this agent improves the prognosis of AdvSM patients and provides proof of principle for targeting KIT(D816V) as a driver mutation, most responses are partial and/or not sustained, indicating that more potent and/or specific inhibitors are required. Avapritinib, a KIT and PDGFRalpha inhibitor, was specifically designed to inhibit KIT(D816V). Early results from a Phase 1 trial suggest that avapritinib has potent antineoplastic activity in AdvSM, extending to patients who failed midostaurin. Patients exhibited a rapid reduction in both symptoms as well as reductions of bone marrow MCs, serum tryptase, and KIT(D816V) mutant allele burden. Adverse effects include expected toxicities such as myelosuppression and periorbital edema, but also cognitive impairment in some patients. Although considerable excitement about avapritinib exists, more data are needed to assess long-term responses and adverse effects of this novel TKI.","['Gilreath, J A', 'Tchertanov, L', 'Deininger, M W']","['Gilreath JA', 'Tchertanov L', 'Deininger MW']",,"['Department of Pharmacotherapy, College of Pharmacy and Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.', 'Centre de Mathematiques et de Leurs Applications (CMLA-CNRS), ENS Paris-Saclay, Cachan 94235, France.', 'Division of Hematology and Hematologic Malignancies and Huntsman Cancer Institute, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT 84112, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Clin Pharmacol,Clinical pharmacology : advances and applications,101564865,,,,,PMC6630092,['NOTNLM'],"['BLU285', 'KIT', 'avapritinib', 'systemic mastocytosis', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2019/08/03 06:00,2019/08/03 06:01,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/02/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CPAA.S206615 [doi]', '206615 [pii]']",epublish,Clin Pharmacol. 2019 Jul 10;11:77-92. doi: 10.2147/CPAA.S206615. eCollection 2019.,,20190710,,,"['Dr Jeffrey Gilreath reports personal fees from Novartis, outside of the submitted', 'work.

Due to intrinsic resistance to echinocandins, poor susceptibility to polyenes, and preferred occurrence in immunocompromised patients, such infections are often of poor prognosis. Yet no consensual therapeutic guidelines are presently available. Several clinical cases of Trichosporon infections have been successfully treated with azole therapy, including voriconazole which appeared frequently effective against Trichosporon both in vitro and in vivo. However, the low efficacy associated with some Trichosporon genotypes, complex pharmacokinetics, and the side effects of voriconazole represent limitations for its use and has prompted a search for other therapeutic options. Here, we report a case of T. asahii fungemia in a patient with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia which was successfully treated with isavuconazole consecutive to stopping voriconazole therapy due to severe side effects. This observation suggests that isavuconazole with a similar spectrum to voriconazole, fewer pharmacology interactions, and side effects may be considered as a valuable therapeutic option against Trichosporon infections.","['Feugray, Guillaume', 'Krzisch, Daphne', 'Dehais, Marion', 'Razakandrainibe, Romy', 'Gargala, Gilles', 'Favennec, Loic', 'Lepretre, Stephane', 'Camus, Vincent', 'Costa, Damien']","['Feugray G', 'Krzisch D', 'Dehais M', 'Razakandrainibe R', 'Gargala G', 'Favennec L', 'Lepretre S', 'Camus V', 'Costa D']",,"['Department of Parasitology/Mycology, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Henri Becquerel, Normandie Univ UNIROUEN, Inserm U1245, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Parasitology/Mycology, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Parasitology/Mycology, University of Medicine Pharmacy Rouen EA ESCAPE 7510, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Parasitology/Mycology, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Parasitology/Mycology, University of Medicine Pharmacy Rouen EA ESCAPE 7510, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Parasitology/Mycology, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Parasitology/Mycology, University of Medicine Pharmacy Rouen EA ESCAPE 7510, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Henri Becquerel, Normandie Univ UNIROUEN, Inserm U1245, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Hematology, Centre Henri Becquerel, Normandie Univ UNIROUEN, Inserm U1245, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Parasitology/Mycology, Rouen University Hospital, Rouen, France.', 'Department of Parasitology/Mycology, University of Medicine Pharmacy Rouen EA ESCAPE 7510, Rouen, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Infect Drug Resist,Infection and drug resistance,101550216,,,,,PMC6628197,['NOTNLM'],"['Trichosporon asahii', 'acute lymphoid leukemia', 'fungemia', 'isavuconazole']",2019/08/03 06:00,2019/08/03 06:01,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/IDR.S211148 [doi]', '211148 [pii]']",epublish,Infect Drug Resist. 2019 Jul 9;12:2015-2018. doi: 10.2147/IDR.S211148. eCollection 2019.,,20190709,,,"['Dr Vincent Camus report personal fees, non-financial support from ROCHE, personal', 'fees, non-financial support from AMGEN, outside the submitted work.

While various CA have been previously described, t(15; 17) has not been reported in association with this condition. Case presentation: A 69-year-old male presented with constitutional symptoms, cytopenias and bone marrow biopsy revealed immature blasts with fibrosis. Cytogenetic analysis showed a t(15;17) which initially suggested a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). However, flourescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) studies were negative for transcripts promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene and retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) or PML-RARA fusion. Along with these results, a second review of bone marrow histology, flowcytometry and the detection of a calreticulin gene (CALR) mutation helped with the correct diagnosis of PMF. Patient was then treated with ruxolitinib, a JAK (Janus kinase) 1 and 2 inhibitor, and eventually proceeded to receive a matched unrelated reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) allogeneic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) and has been doing well at the 6-month follow up. Conclusions: Our case highlights two points, that the t(15;17) is diagnostic of Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL) in most cases, there are exceptions and it can be associated with other malignancies without causing any APL like features, as noted in this case. Also, that t(15; 17) by itself is never sufficient to diagnose APL without confirmation by other methods and relying solely on cytogenetics without timely confirmatory tests can lead to risks of delay in diagnosis and appropriate management.","['Nadiminti, Kalyan', 'Silverman, Margarida', 'Bhagavathi, Sharathkumar', 'Vikas, Praveen']","['Nadiminti K', 'Silverman M', 'Bhagavathi S', 'Vikas P']",,"['Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics, Iowa City, IA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology and Blood and Marrow Transplantation, University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics, Iowa City, IA, USA.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,,PMC6633400,['NOTNLM'],"['FISH', 'atypical t(15;17)', 'case report', 'cytogenetics', 'primary myelofibrosis']",2019/08/03 06:00,2019/08/03 06:01,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/03 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S208290 [doi]', '208290 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Jul 11;12:5449-5455. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S208290. eCollection 2019.,,20190711,,,"['Dr Margarida Silverman reports research funding from Incyte Corporation, Gilead', 'Sciences, Inc, Merck, and Sharp & Dohme, outside the submitted work.

Herein, we retrospectively analyzed four cases of sickle cell disease patients who developed myeloid neoplasm. Age at time of diagnosis ranged from 27 to 59 years with a median of 35.5 years. Two patients were treated with hydroxyurea and the other two with supportive care alone, with one out of the four patients receiving additional treatment with hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Three patients presented with leukocytosis, and the remaining patient presented with pancytopenia. Two patients were diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm, one with myelodysplastic syndrome, and the other with acute myeloid leukemia. All four cases demonstrated certain degrees of myelodysplasia and complex cytogenetic abnormalities with - 7/7q- and/or - 5/5q- or with 11q23 (KMT2A) rearrangement. This cytogenetic profile resembles that seen in therapy-related myeloid neoplasm, suggesting that myeloid neoplasm in the setting of sickle cell disease may represent a subcategory of the disease distinct from de novo myeloid neoplasm in general. Extensive literature review further demonstrates this similarity in cytogenetic profile, as well as in other associated pathologic features. Potential etiology includes therapy for sickle cell disease, disease-related immunomodulation, or disease-related chronic inflammation. We hypothesize that constant hematopoietic hyperplasia, stimulated by a hemolysis-induced cytokine storm, may increase the chance of somatic mutations/cytogenetic aberrations, resulting in transformation of myeloid precursors.

Most patients relapse upon tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy cessation. We reported previously that combined BCR-ABL1 and BCL-2 inhibition synergistically targets CML stem/progenitor cells. p53 induces apoptosis mainly by modulating BCL-2 family proteins. Although infrequently mutated in CML, p53 is antagonized by MDM2, which is regulated by BCR-ABL1 signaling. We hypothesized that MDM2 inhibition could sensitize CML cells to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Using an inducible transgenic Scl-tTa-BCR-ABL1 murine CML model, we found, by RT-PCR and CyTOF proteomics increased p53 signaling in CML bone marrow (BM) cells compared with controls in CD45(+) and linage-SCA-1(+)C-KIT(+) populations. CML BM cells were more sensitive to exogenous BH3 peptides than controls. Combined inhibition of BCR-ABL1 with imatinib and MDM2 with DS-5272 increased NOXA level, markedly reduced leukemic linage-SCA-1(+)C-KIT(+) cells and hematopoiesis, decreased leukemia burden, significantly prolonged the survival of mice engrafted with BM cells from Scl-tTa-BCR-ABL1 mice, and significantly decreased CML stem cell frequency in secondary transplantations. Our results suggest that CML stem/progenitor cells have increased p53 signaling and a propensity for apoptosis. Combined MDM2 and BCR-ABL1 inhibition targets CML stem/progenitor cells and has the potential to improve cure rates for CML.","['Carter, Bing Z', 'Mak, Po Yee', 'Mu, Hong', 'Wang, Xiangmeng', 'Tao, Wenjing', 'Mak, Duncan H', 'Dettman, Elisha J', 'Cardone, Michael', 'Zernovak, Oleg', 'Seki, Takahiko', 'Andreeff, Michael']","['Carter BZ', 'Mak PY', 'Mu H', 'Wang X', 'Tao W', 'Mak DH', 'Dettman EJ', 'Cardone M', 'Zernovak O', 'Seki T', 'Andreeff M']",,"['Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA bicarter@mdanderson.org mandreef@mdanderson.org.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Section of Molecular Hematology and Therapy, Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Eutropics, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Eutropics, Cambridge, MA, USA.', 'Daiichi Sankyo Co.

We identified CD99, a gene that is up-regulated in AML patients. In 186 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas AML dataset, CD99 was over-expressed in patients with FLT3-ITD and was down-regulated in patients with TP53 mutations. CD99 is a trans-membrane protein expressed on leukocytes and plays a role in cell adhesion, trans-endothelial migration, and T-cell differentiation. The CD99 gene encodes two isoforms with distinct expression and functional profiles in both normal and malignant tissues. Here we report that, although the CD99 long isoform initially induces an increase in cell proliferation, it also induces higher levels of reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, apoptosis and a subsequent decrease in cell viability. In several leukemia murine models, the CD99 long isoform delayed disease progression and resulted in lower leukemia engraftment in the bone marrow. Furthermore, the CD99 monoclonal antibody reduced cell viability, colony formation, and cell migration, and induced cell differentiation and apoptosis in leukemia cell lines and primary blasts. Mechanistically, CD99 long isoform resulted in transient induction followed by a dramatic decrease in both ERK and SRC phosphorylation. Altogether, our study provides new insights into the role of CD99 isoforms in AML that could potentially be relevant for the preclinical development of CD99 targeted therapy.","['Vaikari, Vijaya Pooja', 'Du, Yang', 'Wu, Sharon', 'Zhang, Tian', 'Metzeler, Klaus', 'Batcha, Aarif M N', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Hiddemann, Wolfgang', 'Akhtari, Mojtaba', 'Alachkar, Houda']","['Vaikari VP', 'Du Y', 'Wu S', 'Zhang T', 'Metzeler K', 'Batcha AMN', 'Herold T', 'Hiddemann W', 'Akhtari M', 'Alachkar H']",,"['Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Medical Biology Program, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Data Processing, Biometrics and Epidemiology (IBE), Faculty of Medicine, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Data Integration for Future Medicine (DiFuture, www.difuture.de), LMU Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Research Unit Apoptosis in Hematopoietic Stem Cells, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen, German Center for Environmental Health (HMGU), Munich Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Titus Family Department of Clinical Pharmacy, School of Pharmacy, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA alachkar@usc.edu.', 'USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (12E7 Antigen)', '0 (CD99 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Isoforms)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['12E7 Antigen', 'Animals', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Mice', 'Protein Isoforms/genetics', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3']",PMC7109747,,,2019/08/03 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2018/09/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.207001 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.207001 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Apr;105(4):999-1012. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.207001.

Furthermore, little is known about the prognostic impact of BIRC3 mutations in CLL cohorts homogeneously treated with first-line fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR). By immunoblotting analysis, we showed that the non-canonical nuclear factor-kappaB pathway is active in BIRC3-mutated cell lines and in primary CLL samples, as documented by the stabilization of MAP3K14 and by the nuclear localization of p52. In addition, BIRC3-mutated primary CLL cells are less sensitive to flu-darabine. In order to confirm in patients that BIRC3 mutations confer resistance to fludarabine-based chemoimmunotherapy, a retrospective multicenter cohort of 287 untreated patients receiving first-line FCR was analyzed by targeted next-generation sequencing of 24 recurrently mutated genes in CLL. By univariate analysis adjusted for multiple comparisons BIRC3 mutations identify a poor prognostic subgroup of patients in whom FCR treatment fails (median progression-free survival: 2.2 years, P<0.001) similar to cases harboring TP53 mutations (median progression-free survival: 2.6 years, P<0.0001). BIRC3 mutations maintained an independent association with an increased risk of progression with a hazard ratio of 2.8 (95% confidence interval 1.4-5.6, P=0.004) in multivariate analysis adjusted for TP53 mutation, 17p deletion and IGHV mutation status. If validated, BIRC3 mutations may be used as a new molecular predictor to select high-risk patients for novel frontline therapeutic approaches.","['Diop, Fary', 'Moia, Riccardo', 'Favini, Chiara',

The dose reduction (0.5 g/m(2)) in DS-patients has reduced toxicity (39 in 51 patients, P<0.001) without increasing the relapse risk (reduced dose, 5-year cumulative relapse incidence = 0.09+/-0.04 vs high dose, 0.10+/-0.05, P=0.51). MTX dose escalation to 1.0 g/m(2) for DS-patients who tolerated 0.5 g/m(2) (n= 28 of 51 patients) did not result in an increased rate of grade 3/4 toxicities after the second course (P=0.285). Differences in MTX plasma levels at 42 and 48 hours after the start of the first methotrexate infusion did not explain higher toxicity rates in DS-patients treated with 0.5 g/m(2) compared to NDS-patients treated with 5 g/m(2) Within the DS cohort a higher MTX plasma level was associated with increased toxicity. In conclusion, dose reduction in the first MTX course reduced severe toxicities without increasing the risk of relapse.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist pioglitazone downregulates signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) and in combination with imatinib induces complete molecular response in imatinib-refractory patients by eroding leukemia stem cells. Thiazolidinediones such as pioglitazone are, however, associated with severe side effects. To identify alternate therapeutic strategies for CML we screened Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs in K562 cells and identified the leprosy drug clofazimine as an inhibitor of viability of these cells. Here we show that clofazimine induced apoptosis of blood mononuclear cells derived from patients with CML, with a particularly robust effect in imatinib-resistant cells. Clofazimine also induced apoptosis of CD34(+)38(-) progenitors and quiescent CD34(+) cells from CML patients but not of hematopoietic progenitor cells from healthy donors. Mechanistic evaluation revealed that clofazimine, via physical interaction with PPARgamma, induced nuclear factor kB-p65 proteasomal degradation, which led to sequential myeloblastoma oncoprotein and peroxiredoxin 1 downregulation and concomitant induction of reactive oxygen species-mediated apoptosis. Clofazimine also suppressed STAT5 expression and consequently downregulated stem cell maintenance factors hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha and -2alpha and Cbp/P300 interacting transactivator with Glu/Asp-rich carboxy-terminal domain 2 (CITED2). Combining imatinib with clofazimine caused a far superior synergy than that with pioglitazone, with clofazimine reducing the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of imatinib by >4 logs and remarkably eroding quiescent CD34(+) cells. In a K562 xenograft study clofazimine and imatinib co-treatment showed more robust efficacy than the individual treatments. We propose clinical evaluation of clofazimine in imatinib-refractory CML.","['Kumar, Harish', 'Chattopadhyay, Sourav', 'Das, Nabanita', 'Shree, Sonal', 'Patel, Dinesh', 'Mohapatra, Jogeswar', 'Gurjar, Anagha', 'Kushwaha, Sapana', 'Singh, Abhishek Kumar', 'Dubey, Shikha', 'Lata, Kiran', 'Kushwaha, Rajesh', 'Mohammed, Riyazuddin', 'Dastidar, Krishnarup Ghosh', 'Yadav, Namrata', 'Vishwakarma, Achchhe Lal', 'Gayen, Jiaur Rahaman', 'Bandyopadhyay, Sanghamitra', 'Chatterjee, Abhijit', 'Jain, Mukul Rameshchandra', 'Tripathi, Anil Kumar', 'Trivedi, Arun Kumar', 'Chattopadhyay, Naibedya', 'Ramachandran, Ravishankar', 'Sanyal, Sabyasachi']","['Kumar H', 'Chattopadhyay S', 'Das N', 'Shree S', 'Patel D', 'Mohapatra J', 'Gurjar A', 'Kushwaha S', 'Singh AK', 'Dubey S', 'Lata K', 'Kushwaha R', 'Mohammed R', 'Dastidar KG', 'Yadav N', 'Vishwakarma AL', 'Gayen JR', 'Bandyopadhyay S', 'Chatterjee A', 'Jain MR', 'Tripathi AK', 'Trivedi AK', 'Chattopadhyay N', 'Ramachandran R', 'Sanyal S']",,"['Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'AcSIR, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute Campus, Lucknow.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'Division of Molecular and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'Zydus Research Center, Moraiya, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.', 'Zydus Research Center, Moraiya, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'AcSIR, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute Campus, Lucknow.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'Division of Molecular and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'Division of Molecular and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'Developmental Toxicology Laboratory, Systems Toxicology and Health Risk Assessment Group, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow.', 'Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'Zydus Research Center, Moraiya, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.', 'Zydus Research Center, Moraiya, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.', 'Sophisticated Analytical Instrument Facility, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'AcSIR, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute Campus, Lucknow.', 'Developmental Toxicology Laboratory, Systems Toxicology and Health Risk Assessment Group, CSIR-Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow.', 'Zydus Research Center, Moraiya, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.', 'Zydus Research Center, Moraiya, Ahmedabad, Gujarat.', ""Department of Clinical Hematology and Medical Oncology, King George's Medical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh."", 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'AcSIR, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute Campus, Lucknow.', 'Division of Endocrinology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow, India.', 'AcSIR, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute Campus, Lucknow.', 'AcSIR, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute Campus, Lucknow.', 'Division of Molecular and Structural Biology, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow.', 'Division of Biochemistry, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute, Lucknow sanyal@cdri.res.in.', 'AcSIR, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute Campus, Lucknow.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (PPAR gamma)', '0 (Pharmaceutical Preparations)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'D959AE5USF (Clofazimine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis', 'Clofazimine/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/genetics', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'K562 Cells', '*Leprosy', '*Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/drug therapy', 'PPAR gamma', '*Pharmaceutical Preparations']",PMC7109729,,,2019/08/03 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.194910 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.194910 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Apr;105(4):971-986. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.194910.

We applied gene expression profiling for comparison of leukemic blasts and leukemic stem cells with their normal counterparts. Here, we show that the T-cell receptor gamma chain alternate reading frame protein (TARP) is over-expressed in de novo pediatric (n=13) and adult (n=17) AML sorted leukemic stem cells and blasts compared to hematopoietic stem cells and normal myeloblasts (15 healthy controls). Moreover, TARP expression was significantly associated with a fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-3 internal tandem duplication in pediatric AML. TARP overexpression was confirmed in AML cell lines (n=9), and was found to be absent in B-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (n=5) and chronic myeloid leukemia (n=1). Sequencing revealed that both a classical TARP transcript, as described in breast and prostate adenocarcinoma, and an AML-specific alternative TARP transcript, were present. Protein expression levels mostly matched transcript levels. TARP was shown to reside in the cytoplasmic compartment and showed sporadic endoplasmic reticulum co-localization. TARP-T-cell receptor engineered cytotoxic T-cells in vitro killed AML cell lines and patient leukemic cells co-expressing TARP and HLA-A*0201. In conclusion, TARP qualifies as a relevant target for immunotherapeutic T-cell therapy in AML.","['Depreter, Barbara', 'Weening, Karin E', 'Vandepoele, Karl', 'Essand, Magnus', 'De Moerloose, Barbara', 'Themeli, Maria', 'Cloos, Jacqueline', 'Hanekamp, Diana', 'Moors, Ine', ""D'hont, Inge"", 'Denys, Barbara', 'Uyttebroeck, Anne', 'Van Damme, An', 'Dedeken, Laurence', 'Snauwaert, Sylvia', 'Goetgeluk, Glenn', 'De Munter, Stijn', 'Kerre, Tessa', 'Vandekerckhove, Bart', 'Lammens, Tim', 'Philippe, Jan']","['Depreter B', 'Weening KE', 'Vandepoele K', 'Essand M', 'De Moerloose B', 'Themeli M', 'Cloos J', 'Hanekamp D', 'Moors I', ""D'hont I"", 'Denys B', 'Uyttebroeck A', 'Van Damme A', 'Dedeken L', 'Snauwaert S', 'Goetgeluk G', 'De Munter S', 'Kerre T', 'Vandekerckhove B', 'Lammens T', 'Philippe J']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Science for Life Laboratory, Department of Immunology, Genetics and Pathology, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Louvain, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, University Hospital Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Queen Fabiola Children's University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium."", 'Department of Hematology, AZ Sint-Jan Hospital Bruges, Bruges, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Hematology, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Internal Medicine and Pediatrics, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium tim.lammens@ugent.be.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Diagnostic Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (TARP)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Nuclear Proteins', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell']",PMC7193481,,,2019/08/03 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.222612 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.222612 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 May;105(5):1306-1316. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.222612.

However, some recent publications suggest that the IGHV mutational load could have a prognostic effect on CLL patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective study on 459 patients with productive rearrangement of the B-cell receptor to evaluate the prognostic and predictive role of IGHV mutational status and burden within the germline sequence. In particular we focused on FCR (fludarabine with cyclophosphamide, and rituximab)- (64 naive and 30 relapsed) and BR (bendamustine with rituximab)-treated patients (17 naive and 61 relapsed). A cutoff value of 2% of difference within the IGHV germline was used to define the IGHV mutational status. RESULTS: We reported that unmutated IGHV (U-IGHV) patients were characterized by a significant shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (P < .0001) compared with mutated IGHV (M-IGHV) patients. Moreover, treatment-naive M-IGHV patients experienced a long-term disease control after FCR or BR, with PFS reaching a plateau regardless of mutational load. In our series the extent of IGHV gene mutation did not provide further relevant prognostic data over the mutational status. Relapsed patients showed dismal outcome with chemoimmunotherapy regardless of IGHV status or load. CONCLUSION: Our data, together with from those from the literature, confirmed the cutoff value of 2% to define the mutational status of IGHV gene and suggest that FCR/BR are good first-line treatment strategies for M-IGHV patients, whereas U-IGHV patients should be managed with B-cell receptor and/or B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) inhibitors.","['Visentin, Andrea', 'Facco, Monica', 'Gurrieri, Carmela', 'Pagnin, Elisa', 'Martini, Veronica', 'Imbergamo, Silvia', 'Frezzato, Federica', 'Trimarco, Valentina', 'Severin, Filippo', 'Raggi, Flavia', 'Scomazzon, Edoardo', 'Pravato, Stefano', 'Piazza, Francesco', 'Semenzato, Gianpietro', 'Trentin, Livio']","['Visentin A', 'Facco M', 'Gurrieri C', 'Pagnin E', 'Martini V', 'Imbergamo S', 'Frezzato F', 'Trimarco V', 'Severin F', 'Raggi F', 'Scomazzon E', 'Pravato S', 'Piazza F', 'Semenzato G', 'Trentin L']",,"['Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.', 'Hematology and Clinical Immunology Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Padua, Padua, Italy; Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Centro di Eccellenza per la Ricerca Biomedica Avanzata, Padua, Italy.

The category of infant ALL patients carrying a translocation involving the mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene (gene KMT2A) is characterized by resistance to GCs and poor clinical outcome. Although some studies examined GC-resistance in infant ALL patients, the understanding of this phenomenon remains limited and impede the efforts to improve prognosis. METHODS: This study integrates differential co-expression (DC) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to find active protein modules associated with GC-resistance in MLL-rearranged infant ALL patients. A network was constructed by linking differentially co-expressed gene pairs between GC-resistance and GC-sensitive samples and later integrated with PPI networks by keeping the links that are also present in the PPI network. The resulting network was decomposed into two sub-networks, specific to each phenotype. Finally, both sub-networks were clustered into modules using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and further analyzed with functional enrichment analysis. RESULTS: Through the integration of DC analysis and PPI network, four protein modules were found active under the GC-resistance phenotype but not under the GC-sensitive. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these modules are related to proteasome, electron transport chain, tRNA-aminoacyl biosynthesis, and peroxisome signaling pathways. These findings are in accordance with previous findings related to GC-resistance in other hematological malignancies such as pediatric ALL. CONCLUSIONS: Differential co-expression analysis is a promising approach to incorporate the dynamic context of gene expression profiles into the well-documented protein interaction networks. The approach allows the detection of relevant protein modules that are highly enriched with DC gene pairs. Functional enrichment analysis of detected protein modules generates new biological hypotheses and may help in explaining the GC-resistance in MLL-rearranged infant ALL patients.","['Mousavian, Zaynab', 'Nowzari-Dalini, Abbas', 'Rahmatallah, Yasir', 'Masoudi-Nejad, Ali']","['Mousavian Z', 'Nowzari-Dalini A', 'Rahmatallah Y', 'Masoudi-Nejad A']",,"['School of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, College of Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. zmousavian@ut.ac.ir.', 'Laboratory of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (LBB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. zmousavian@ut.ac.ir.', 'School of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science, College of Science, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, AR, 72205, USA.', 'Laboratory of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics (LBB), Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran. amasoudin@ut.ac.ir.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Med,"Molecular medicine (Cambridge, Mass.)",9501023,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Databases, Protein', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Regulatory Networks/genetics/physiology', 'Glucocorticoids/*therapeutic use', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/physiology']",PMC6676637,['NOTNLM'],"['*Active protein modules', '*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Differential co-expression network analysis', '*Glucocorticoid resistance', '*Systems biology']",2019/08/03 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s10020-019-0106-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s10020-019-0106-1 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Med. 2019 Aug 1;25(1):36. doi: 10.1186/s10020-019-0106-1.,,20190801,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A highly diverse and flexible metabolism contributes to the aggressiveness of the disease that is still difficult to treat. By using different sources of nutrients for energy and biomass supply, AML cells gain metabolic plasticity and rapidly outcompete normal hematopoietic cells. This review aims to decipher the diverse metabolic strategies and the underlying oncogenic and environmental changes that sustain continuous growth, mediate redox homeostasis and induce drug resistance in AML. We revisit Warburg's hypothesis and illustrate the role of glucose as a provider of cellular building blocks rather than as a supplier of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle for energy production. We discuss how the diversity of fuels for the TCA cycle, including glutamine and fatty acids, contributes to the metabolic plasticity of the disease and highlight the roles of amino acids and lipids in AML metabolism. Furthermore, we point out the potential of the different metabolic effectors to be used as novel therapeutic targets.","['Kreitz, Johanna', 'Schonfeld, Christine', 'Seibert, Marcel', 'Stolp, Verena', 'Alshamleh, Islam', 'Oellerich, Thomas', 'Steffen, Bjorn', 'Schwalbe, Harald', 'Schnutgen, Frank', 'Kurrle, Nina', 'Serve, Hubert']","['Kreitz J', 'Schonfeld C', 'Seibert M', 'Stolp V', 'Alshamleh I', 'Oellerich T', 'Steffen B', 'Schwalbe H', 'Schnutgen F', 'Kurrle N', 'Serve H']",,"['Department of Medicine 2, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and DKFZ, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and DKFZ, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and DKFZ, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and DKFZ, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Biomolecular Magnetic Resonance, Institute of Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Goethe-University, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and DKFZ, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI), 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and DKFZ, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI), 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and DKFZ, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Center for Biomolecular Magnetic Resonance, Institute of Organic Chemistry and Chemical Biology, Goethe-University, 60438 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and DKFZ, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI), 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. kurrle@med.uni-frankfurt.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and DKFZ, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. kurrle@med.uni-frankfurt.de.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI), 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. kurrle@med.uni-frankfurt.de.', 'Department of Medicine 2, Hematology/Oncology, Goethe University, 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. serve@em.uni-frankfurt.de.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK) and DKFZ, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany. serve@em.uni-frankfurt.de.', 'Frankfurt Cancer Institute (FCI), 60590 Frankfurt am Main, Germany. serve@em.uni-frankfurt.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,,IM,,"['*Carbohydrate Metabolism', 'Citric Acid Cycle', '*Energy Metabolism', 'Glycolysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC6721808,['NOTNLM'],"['*TCA cycle', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*aerobic glycolysis', '*amino acids', '*drug resistance', '*fatty acids', '*leukemic stem cells', '*metabolic plasticity', '*oxidative phosphorylation', '*redox homeostasis']",2019/08/03 06:00,2020/04/17 06:00,['2019/08/03 06:00'],"['2019/06/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/03 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/17 06:00 [medline]']","['cells8080805 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8080805 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2019 Jul 31;8(8). pii: cells8080805. doi: 10.3390/cells8080805.,,20190731,,,['The authors declare no conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence, they represent attractive therapeutic targets. Here we developed three lytic hybrid peptides, by fusing a monocyte- and macrophage-binding peptide to pro-apoptotic peptides, and investigated their killing potency on blood monocytes, macrophages, and leukemia cells. We first showed that the targeting NW peptide is effective for depleting monocytes from whole peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Incubating the cells with biotin-conjugated NW peptide, and the subsequent capture on streptavidin-conjugated magnetic beads, depleted monocytes from the PBMCs. The NW peptide also depleted myeloid leukemia blasts from patient PBMCs. The treatment of the PBMCs with the lytic hybrid NW-KLA peptide killed monocytes, but not lymphocytes and primary mammary epithelial cells. Additionally, the fusion peptide exhibited a potent toxicity against macrophages and leukemia cells. The free lytic KLA peptide did not affect cells. Similarly, a second lytic hybrid peptide killed macrophages, leukemia cell lines, and blood leukemia blasts from patients with acute and chronic myeloid leukemia. The IC50 towards target cells were in the low macromolar range (4-12 microM). Overall, the data indicate that the NW peptide could be a potential drug delivery agent for monocytes, macrophages, and leukemia cells. Moreover, the engineered lytic hybrid peptides acting alone, or in combination with other therapeutic agents, might benefit many cancer patients and overcome drug resistance.","['Sioud, Mouldy', 'Pettersen, Solveig', 'Ailte, Ieva', 'Floisand, Yngvar']","['Sioud M', 'Pettersen S', 'Ailte I', 'Floisand Y']",,"['Department of Cancer Immunology, Institute for Cancer Research, Oslo University Hospital-Radiumhospitalet, Ullernchausseen 70, N0379 Oslo, Norway.

ATRA also regulates protein kinase C (PKC) activity. Therapeutic use of ATRA reportedly interferes with hemostatic function in APL patients, including effects on coagulation or other vascular cells, although effects of ATRA on platelets remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effect of therapeutic-relevant doses of ATRA on platelet function. Human platelets were preincubated with ATRA (0-20 muM) for 1 hour at 37 degrees C, followed by analysis of aggregation, granule secretion, receptor expression by flow cytometry, platelet spreading, or clot retraction. Additionally, ATRA (10 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally into mice and tail bleeding time and arterial thrombus formation were evaluated. ATRA inhibited platelet aggregation and adenosine triphosphate release induced by collagen (5 mug/mL) or thrombin (0.05 U/mL) in a dose-dependent manner without affecting P-selectin expression or surface levels of glycoprotein (GP) Ibalpha, GPVI, or alphaIIbbeta3. ATRA-treated platelets demonstrated reduced spreading on immobilized fibrinogen or collagen and reduced thrombin-induced clot retraction together with reduced phosphorylation of Syk and PLCgamma2. In addition, ATRA-treated mice displayed significantly impaired hemostasis and arterial thrombus formation in vivo. Further, in platelets stimulated with either collagen-related peptide or thrombin, ATRA selectively inhibited phosphorylation of PKCssI (Ser661) and PKCdelta (Thr505), but not PKCalpha or PKCssII phosphorylation (Thr638/641). In conclusion, ATRA inhibits platelet function and thrombus formation, possibly involving direct or indirect inhibition of PKCssI/delta, indicating that ATRA might be beneficial for the treatment of thrombotic or cardiovascular diseases.","['Luo, Qi', 'Wei, Guangyu', 'Wang, Xiamin', 'Xu, Xiaoqi', 'Ju, Wen', 'Li, Zhenyu', 'Gardiner, Elizabeth E', 'Andrews, Robert K', 'Zeng, Lingyu', 'Xu, Kailin', 'Qiao, Jianlin']","['Luo Q', 'Wei G', 'Wang X', 'Xu X', 'Ju W', 'Li Z', 'Gardiner EE', 'Andrews RK', 'Zeng L', 'Xu K', 'Qiao J']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9453-9688'],"['Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Jiangsu Province, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Jiangsu Province, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Jiangsu Province, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Jiangsu Province, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Jiangsu Province, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Jiangsu Province, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'ACRF Department of Cancer Biology and Therapeutics, John Curtin School of Medical Research, The Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Jiangsu Province, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Jiangsu Province, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Blood Diseases Institute, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Bone Marrow Stem Cell, Jiangsu Province, Xuzhou Medical University, Xuzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Thromb Haemost,Thrombosis and haemostasis,7608063,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C beta)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C-delta)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Blood Coagulation/drug effects', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/*metabolism', 'Clot Retraction/drug effects', 'Collagen/chemistry', 'Cytoskeleton/metabolism', 'Hemostasis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phosphorylation', 'Platelet Activation/drug effects', 'Platelet Aggregation/drug effects', 'Platelet Function Tests', 'Protein Kinase C beta/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C-delta/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Thrombosis/*drug therapy', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,,,2019/08/02 06:00,2020/03/25 06:00,['2019/08/02 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-0039-1693737 [doi]'],ppublish,Thromb Haemost. 2019 Oct;119(10):1655-1664. doi: 10.1055/s-0039-1693737.

Hemorrhagic complications are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality. Perturbed hemostatic dysfunction is present as the result of abnormalities in both the coagulation and the fibrinolytic systems. The activation of coagulation is distinct from the classical disseminated intravascular coagulation. Multiple abnormalities in the fibrinolytic system have recently been identified. The most significant change is increased production of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and its receptor annexin A2 by the APL promyelocytes. Among the hemorrhagic complications, intracranial hemorrhage predominates. The pathogenesis of this catastrophic event is elucidated by new evidence of adverse effect of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) on the brain, including both the plasmin-dependent and plasmin-independent pathways. In order to address the hemorrhagic complications, a thorough understanding of the hemostatic dysfunction is essential. In this article, our current concept of the abnormal hemostasis in APL is reviewed. The failure to reduce the early death rate, despite the introduction of effective therapy, will also be discussed.","['Kwaan, Hau C', 'Weiss, Ivy', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Kwaan HC', 'Weiss I', 'Tallman MS']",,"['Division of Hematology-Oncology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Semin Thromb Hemost,Seminars in thrombosis and hemostasis,0431155,,IM,,"['Fibrinolysis/*immunology', 'Hemostasis/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*mortality', 'Morbidity', 'Survival Rate']",,,,2019/08/02 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/08/02 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1055/s-0039-1693478 [doi]'],ppublish,Semin Thromb Hemost. 2019 Sep;45(6):612-621. doi: 10.1055/s-0039-1693478.

RESULTS: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and bone cancer were inversely associated with high maternal social contact from conception to birth (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.67-1.10) and birth to diagnosis (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.34-0.86). Children of fathers with high social contact from birth to diagnosis had an increased risk of bone cancers, particularly in rural areas (OR: 1.65, 95% CI: 1.03-2.63). Parental social contact was associated with increased risk of astrocytoma, with strongest associations found in first-born children (maternal: OR: 1.54, 95% CI: 1.02-2.32; paternal: OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.05-3.17). CONCLUSION: Our results support the notion of a role of infections for some cancer types.","['Omidakhsh, Negar', 'Hansen, Johnni', 'Ritz, Beate', 'Olsen, Jorn', 'Heck, Julia E']","['Omidakhsh N', 'Hansen J', 'Ritz B', 'Olsen J', 'Heck JE']",,"['Department of Epidemiology, Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, 10833 Le Conte Ave, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.

Plasma of AML patients is significantly enriched in exosomes, which carry a cargo of immunosuppressive molecules and deliver them to recipient immune cells, suppressing their functions. However, whether these exosomes originate from leukemic blasts or from various normal cells in the bone marrow or other tissues is unknown. In the current study, we developed an AML PDX model in mice and studied the molecular cargo and immune cell effects of the AML PDX exosomes in parallel with the exosomes from plasma of the corresponding AML patients. Fully engrafted AML PDX mice produced exosomes with characteristics similar to those of exosomes isolated from plasma of the AML patients who had donated the cells for engraftment. The engrafted leukemic cells produced exosomes that carried human proteins and leukemia-associated antigens, confirming the human origin of these exosomes. Furthermore, the AML-derived exosomes carried immunosuppressive proteins responsible for immune cell dysfunctions. Our studies of exosomes in AML PDX mice serve as a proof of concept that AML blasts are the source of immunosuppressive exosomes with a molecular profile that mimics the content and functions of the parental cells.","['Hong, Chang-Sook', 'Danet-Desnoyers, Gwenn', 'Shan, Xiaochuan', 'Sharma, Priyanka', 'Whiteside, Theresa L', 'Boyiadzis, Michael']","['Hong CS', 'Danet-Desnoyers G', 'Shan X', 'Sharma P', 'Whiteside TL', 'Boyiadzis M']",,"['University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.', 'University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.', 'University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The extent of ferroptosis on the mode of action is regulated by simple modifications of the substituents at the 1,2-phenylenediamine moiety. In HL-60 cells, the unsubstituted lead exclusively caused ferroptosis. For instance, a 4-F substituent shifted the mode of action toward both ferroptosis and necroptosis, while the analogously chlorinated derivative exerted only necroptosis. Remarkably, cell-death in NB1 neuroblastoma cells was solely induced by ferroptosis, independent of the used substituents. The effects were higher than that of the therapeutically applied drug cisplatin. These data clearly demonstrate for the first time that not only iron ions but also iron salophene complexes are potent ferroptosis inducers, which can be optimized as antitumor agents.","['Sagasser, Jessica', 'Ma, Benjamin N', 'Baecker, Daniel', 'Salcher, Stefan', 'Hermann, Martin', 'Lamprecht, Julia', 'Angerer, Stefanie', 'Obexer, Petra', 'Kircher, Brigitte', 'Gust, Ronald']","['Sagasser J', 'Ma BN', 'Baecker D', 'Salcher S', 'Hermann M', 'Lamprecht J', 'Angerer S', 'Obexer P', 'Kircher B', 'Gust R']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0427-4012'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, CMBI-Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck , University of Innsbruck, CCB-Center for Chemistry and Biomedicine , Innrain 80-82 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, CMBI-Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck , University of Innsbruck, CCB-Center for Chemistry and Biomedicine , Innrain 80-82 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, CMBI-Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck , University of Innsbruck, CCB-Center for Chemistry and Biomedicine , Innrain 80-82 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute , Innrain 66 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Department of Anesthesiology and Critical Care Medicine , Medical University Innsbruck , Anichstrasse 35 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute , Innrain 66 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute , Innrain 66 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Immunobiology and Stem Cell Laboratory, Department of Internal Medicine V (Hematology and Oncology) , Medical University Innsbruck , Anichstrasse 35 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute , Innrain 66 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Department of Pediatrics II , Medical University Innsbruck , Innrain 66 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Tyrolean Cancer Research Institute , Innrain 66 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Immunobiology and Stem Cell Laboratory, Department of Internal Medicine V (Hematology and Oncology) , Medical University Innsbruck , Anichstrasse 35 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Institute of Pharmacy, CMBI-Center for Molecular Biosciences Innsbruck , University of Innsbruck, CCB-Center for Chemistry and Biomedicine , Innrain 80-82 , 6020 Innsbruck , Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Coordination Complexes)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Iron Compounds)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', ""0 (chlorido(N,N'-disalicylidene-1,2-phenylenediamine)iron(III))""]",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Coordination Complexes/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', '*Drug Discovery', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ferric Compounds', 'Ferroptosis/*drug effects', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Iron Compounds/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neuroblastoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Phenylenediamines/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,,,2019/08/02 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/08/02 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00814 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2019 Sep 12;62(17):8053-8061. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00814.

Components of transcriptional networks are a common target of these aberrations, leading to network-wide changes and deployment of novel or developmentally inappropriate transcriptional programs. Genome-wide techniques are beginning to reveal the full complexity of normal hematopoietic stem cell transcriptional networks and the extent to which they are deregulated in AML, and new understandings of the mechanisms by which AML cells maintain self-renewal and block differentiation are starting to emerge. The hope is that increased understanding of the network architecture in AML will lead to identification of key oncogenic dependencies that are downstream of multiple network aberrations, and that this knowledge will be translated into new therapies that target these dependencies. Here, we review the current state of knowledge of network perturbation in AML with a focus on major mechanisms of transcription factor dysregulation, including mutation, translocation, and transcriptional dysregulation, and discuss how these perturbations propagate across transcriptional networks. We will also review emerging mechanisms of network disruption, and briefly discuss how increased knowledge of network disruption is already being used to develop new therapies.","['Thoms, Julie A I', 'Beck, Dominik', 'Pimanda, John E']","['Thoms JAI', 'Beck D', 'Pimanda JE']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4876-7230', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0509-8962']","['School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'School of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, Faculty of Medicine, UNSW Sydney, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,['0 (Transcription Factors)'],IM,,"['Gene Regulatory Networks/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia', '*epigenetics', '*transcription factors', '*transcriptional networks']",2019/08/02 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,['2019/08/02 06:00'],"['2019/04/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22794 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Dec;58(12):859-874. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22794.

However, the relationship between outcomes and distinct DLI cellular composition has not been previously reported. Additionally, there are limited published data on efficacy in pediatrics. We evaluated whether DLI cellular content and development of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) impacted disease and influenced overall survival (OS) in children receiving DLI for recurrent leukemia. METHODS: We performed an Institutional Review Board-approved, retrospective study investigating all consecutive DLIs given to patients at the Children's Hospital of Wisconsin between 1980 and 2018. Analyses were conducted using Mann-Whitney, Fisher exact, and chi-square tests. RESULTS: Thirty patients </=20 years old with hematologic malignancies (myeloid [AML/MDS/CML/JMML], n = 23; lymphoid [ALL], n = 7) received DLI to treat post-transplant relapse. We found no significant difference in OS or development of GVHD based on CD3, CD4, CD8, CD56, or CD19 DLI cellular composition. With a median follow-up of 0.69 (range, 0.04-16.61) years, OS at five years was 32% +/- 9%. The lymphoid group had a five-year survival rate at 71% +/- 17% compared with the myeloid group at 22% +/- 9%, although not statistically significant (P = 0.11). The development of GVHD did not affect OS (P = 0.62). CONCLUSION: Here, we report a single-center, long-term experience of pediatric DLIs. Surprisingly, many children with ALL were able to achieve durable remissions.

METHODS: Acute leukemias were reviewed in two sessions: ""Genetic Testing in Diagnosis of Acute Leukemias"" (53 cases) and ""Genetics Revealing the Biology of Acute Leukemias"" (41 cases). RESULTS: Cases included acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage. Many cases demonstrated genetic alterations of known diagnostic, prognostic, and/or therapeutic significance, while others exhibited alterations that illuminated disease biology. The workshop highlighted the complexity of acute leukemia diagnosis and follow-up, while illustrating advantages and pitfalls of molecular genetic testing. CONCLUSIONS: Our understanding of the molecular genetics of acute leukemias continues to grow rapidly. Awareness of the potential complexity of genetic architecture and environment is critical and emphasizes the importance of integrating clinical information with morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular genetic evaluation.","['Harris, Marian H', 'Czuchlewski, David R', 'Arber, Daniel A', 'Czader, Magdalena']","['Harris MH', 'Czuchlewski DR', 'Arber DA', 'Czader M']",,"[""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Indiana University, Indianapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,,IM,,"['Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Pathology, Molecular', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Genetics', '*Hematopathology', '*Molecular diagnostics']",2019/08/02 06:00,2020/03/25 06:00,['2019/08/02 06:00'],"['2019/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [medline]']","['5542438 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqz093 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2019 Aug 1;152(3):322-346. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqz093.,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

However, the visual analysis of (18)F-FDG diffuse bone marrow uptake in detecting bone marrow involvement (BMI) in routine clinical practice is still challenging. This study aims to improve the diagnostic performance of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in detecting BMI for patients with suspected relapsed AL. Methods: Forty-one patients (35 in training group and 6 in independent validation group) with suspected relapsed AL were retrospectively included in this study. All patients underwent both bone marrow biopsy (BMB) and (18)F-FDG PET/CT within one week. The BMB results were used as the gold standard or real ""truth"" for BMI. The bone marrow (18)F-FDG uptake was visually diagnosed as positive and negative by three nuclear medicine physicians. The skeletal volumes of interest were manually drawn on PET/CT images. A total of 781 PET and 1045 CT radiomic features were automatically extracted to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the embedded pattern. To select the most important and predictive features, an unsupervised consensus clustering method was first performed to analyze the feature correlations and then used to guide a random forest supervised machine learning model for feature importance analysis. Cross-validation and independent validation were conducted to justify the performance of our model. Results: The training group involved 16 BMB positive and 19 BMB negative patients. Based on the visual analysis of (18)F-FDG PET, 3 patients had focal uptake, 8 patients had normal uptake, and 24 patients had diffuse uptake. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of visual analysis for BMI diagnosis were 62.5%, 73.7%, and 68.6%, respectively. With the cross-validation on the training group, the machine learning model correctly predicted 31 patients in BMI. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the machine learning model in BMI detection were 87.5%, 89.5%, and 88.6%, respectively, significantly higher than the ones in visual analysis (P < 0.05). The evaluation on the independent validation group showed that the machine learning model could achieve 83.3% accuracy. Conclusions: (18)F-FDG PET/CT radiomic analysis with machine learning model provided a quantitative, objective and efficient mechanism for identifying BMI in the patients with suspected relapsed AL. It is suggested in particular for the diagnosis of BMI in the patients with (18)F-FDG diffuse uptake patterns.","['Li, Hebei', 'Xu, Chongrui', 'Xin, Bowen', 'Zheng, Chaojie', 'Zhao, Yunyun', 'Hao, Keji', 'Wang, Qian', 'Wahl, Richard L', 'Wang, Xiuying', 'Zhou, Yun']","['Li H', 'Xu C', 'Xin B', 'Zheng C', 'Zhao Y', 'Hao K', 'Wang Q', 'Wahl RL', 'Wang X', 'Zhou Y']",,"[""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", 'Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, United States of America.', 'School of Computer Science, the University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'School of Computer Science, the University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'School of Computer Science, the University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', ""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", ""Department of Nuclear Medicine, Peking University People's Hospital, Beijing 100044, China."", 'Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, United States of America.', 'School of Computer Science, the University of Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia.', 'Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO 63110, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Evaluation Study', 'Journal Article']",Australia,Theranostics,Theranostics,101552395,"['0 (Radiopharmaceuticals)', '0Z5B2CJX4D (Fluorodeoxyglucose F18)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Female', 'Fluorodeoxyglucose F18/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Machine Learning', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Radiopharmaceuticals/administration & dosage', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",PMC6643435,['NOTNLM'],"['* 18F-FDG PET/CT', '*bone marrow involvement', '*machine learning', '*radiomics', '*relapsed leukemia']",2019/08/02 06:00,2020/08/26 06:00,['2019/08/02 06:00'],"['2019/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/26 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/thno.33841 [doi]', 'thnov09p4730 [pii]']",epublish,Theranostics. 2019 Jul 9;9(16):4730-4739. doi: 10.7150/thno.33841. eCollection 2019.,,20190709,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the cell death induction by Ru(II)-thymine complex in human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells, as well as its effect in xenograft tumor model. The Ru(II)-thymine complex increased significantly the percentage of apoptotic HCT116 cells. Co-treatment with a JNK/SAPK inhibitor, p38 MAPK inhibitor and MEK inhibitor, which inhibit the activation of ERK1/2, caused a marked reduction of the percentage of complex-induced apoptotic cells. Moreover, the Ru(II)-thymine complex induced an increase in phospho-JNK2 (T183/Y185), phospho-p38alpha (T180/Y182) and phospho-ERK1 (T202/Y204) levels in HCT116 cells. Treatment with the Ru(II)-thymine complex increased significantly the phospho-histone H2AX (S139) expression, a DNA damage marker. The expression of phospho-p53 (S15) and MDM2 were not changed, and the co-treatment with a p53 inhibitor (cyclic pifithrin-alpha) did not reduce the complex-induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells, indicating that the Ru(II)-thymine complex induces DNA damage-mediated apoptosis by JNK/p38/ERK1/2 via a p53-independent signaling. The Ru(II)-thymine complex (1 and 2 mg/kg/day) also inhibited HCT116 cell growth in a xenograft model, reducing the tumor mass at 32.6-40.1%. Altogether, indicate that the Ru(II)-thymine complex is a promising anti-colon cancer drug candidate.","['Silva, Suellen L R', 'Baliza, Ingrid R S', 'Dias, Rosane B', 'Sales, Caroline B S', 'Rocha, Clarissa A Gurgel', 'Soares, Milena B P', 'Correa, Rodrigo S', 'Batista, Alzir A', 'Bezerra, Daniel P']","['Silva SLR', 'Baliza IRS', 'Dias RB', 'Sales CBS', 'Rocha CAG', 'Soares MBP', 'Correa RS', 'Batista AA', 'Bezerra DP']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6774-2063'],"['Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, 40296-710, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, 40296-710, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, 40296-710, Brazil.', 'Department of Biomorphology, Institute of Health Sciences, Federal University of Bahia, Salvador, Bahia, 40110-902, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, 40296-710, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, 40296-710, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Ouro Preto, Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, 35400-000, Brazil.', 'Department of Chemistry, Federal University of Sao Carlos, Sao Carlos, Sao Paulo, 13561-901, Brazil.', 'Goncalo Moniz Institute, Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (IGM-FIOCRUZ/BA), Salvador, Bahia, 40296-710, Brazil. danielpbezerra@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '7UI0TKC3U5 (Ruthenium)', 'EC 2.7.11.24 (p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases)', 'QR26YLT7LT (Thymine)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Colon/drug effects/metabolism', 'Colonic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'HCT116 Cells', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/drug effects', 'Ruthenium/*pharmacology', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Thymine/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/metabolism', 'p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases/metabolism']",PMC6668648,,,2019/08/02 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/08/02 06:00'],"['2019/02/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-47539-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-47539-0 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jul 31;9(1):11094. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-47539-0.,,20190731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We explored the molecular mechanism of KHDRBS1 to be a prognostic marker in four different cancers. Within specific cancer, including kidney renal papillary cell carcinoma (KIRP), lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), acute myeloid leukemia (LAML), and ovarian cancer (OV), KHDRBS1 expression is heterogeneous and patient specific. In KIRP and LUAD, higher expression of KHDRBS1 affects the patient survival, but not in LAML and OV. Genome-wide coexpression analysis reveals genes and transcripts which are coexpressed with KHDRBS1 in KIRP and LUAD, form the functional modules which are majorly involved in cancer-specific events. However, in case of LAML and OV, such modules are absent. Irrespective of the higher expression of KHDRBS1, the significant divergence of its biological roles and prognostic value is due to its cancer-specific interaction partners and correlation networks. We conclude that rewiring of KHDRBS1 interactions in cancer is directly associated with patient prognosis.","['Sumithra, B', 'Saxena, Urmila', 'Das, Asim Bikas']","['Sumithra B', 'Saxena U', 'Das AB']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1801-7487'],"['Department of Biotechnology, National Institute of Technology Warangal, Warangal, 506004, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, National Institute of Technology Warangal, Warangal, 506004, Telangana, India.', 'Department of Biotechnology, National Institute of Technology Warangal, Warangal, 506004, Telangana, India. asimbikas@nitw.ac.in.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KHDRBS1 protein, human)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/*genetics', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/genetics']",PMC6668649,,,2019/08/02 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/08/02 06:00'],"['2018/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-47558-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-47558-x [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jul 31;9(1):11083. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-47558-x.,,20190731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were sampled from acute myeloid leukemia patients longitudinally and single-cell DNA sequencing libraries were generated with a novel droplet-based microfluidics approach. Molecular profiling of single nucleotide variants across thousands of cells revealed genetic chimerism in patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Importantly, hierarchical clustering analysis of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) uncovered a distinct oncogenic clone of cells carrying mutated tumor-suppressor and/or oncogene(s). This novel single-cell DNA sequencing approach enabled precise monitoring of engraftment and revealed clonal evolution of oncogenic cells during the progression and treatment of the disease.","['Xu, Liwen', 'Durruthy-Durruthy, Robert', 'Eastburn, Dennis J', 'Pellegrino, Maurizio', 'Shah, Omid', 'Meyer, Everett', 'Zehnder, James']","['Xu L', 'Durruthy-Durruthy R', 'Eastburn DJ', 'Pellegrino M', 'Shah O', 'Meyer E', 'Zehnder J']",,"['Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, 94305, USA.', 'Mission Bio, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, 94080, USA.', 'Mission Bio, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, 94080, USA.', 'Mission Bio, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, 94080, USA.', 'Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation.

Our previous study demonstrated that PGE2, a product of cyclooxygenase (COX) 2, suppresses Th1 responses in cattle and contributes to the progression of Johne disease, a chronic bacterial infection in cattle. However, little information is available on the association of PGE2 with chronic viral infection. Thus, we analyzed the changes in plasma PGE2 concentration during BLV infection and its effects on proviral load, viral gene transcription, Th1 responses, and disease progression. Both COX2 expression by PBMCs and plasma PGE2 concentration were higher in the infected cattle compared with uninfected cattle, and plasma PGE2 concentration was positively correlated with the proviral load. BLV Ag exposure also directly enhanced PGE2 production by PBMCs. Transcription of BLV genes was activated via PGE2 receptors EP2 and EP4, further suggesting that PGE2 contributes to disease progression. In contrast, inhibition of PGE2 production using a COX-2 inhibitor activated BLV-specific Th1 responses in vitro, as evidenced by enhanced T cell proliferation and Th1 cytokine production, and reduced BLV proviral load in vivo. Combined treatment with the COX-2 inhibitor meloxicam and anti-programmed death-ligand 1 Ab significantly reduced the BLV proviral load, suggesting a potential as a novel control method against BLV infection. Further studies using a larger number of animals are required to support the efficacy of this treatment for clinical application.","['Sajiki, Yamato', 'Konnai, Satoru', 'Okagawa, Tomohiro', 'Nishimori, Asami', 'Maekawa, Naoya', 'Goto, Shinya', 'Watari, Kei', 'Minato, Erina', 'Kobayashi, Atsushi', 'Kohara, Junko', 'Yamada, Shinji', 'Kaneko, Mika K', 'Kato, Yukinari', 'Takahashi, Hirofumi', 'Terasaki, Nobuhiro', 'Takeda, Akira', 'Yamamoto, Keiichi', 'Toda, Mikihiro', 'Suzuki, Yasuhiko', 'Murata, Shiro', 'Ohashi, Kazuhiko']","['Sajiki Y', 'Konnai S', 'Okagawa T', 'Nishimori A', 'Maekawa N', 'Goto S', 'Watari K', 'Minato E', 'Kobayashi A', 'Kohara J', 'Yamada S', 'Kaneko MK', 'Kato Y', 'Takahashi H', 'Terasaki N', 'Takeda A', 'Yamamoto K', 'Toda M', 'Suzuki Y', 'Murata S', 'Ohashi K']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1391-9732', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3936-7515', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0066-8655', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5385-8201', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1313-1494']","['Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0818, Japan.', 'Department of Disease Control, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido University, Sapporo 060-0818, Japan;

In this study, we show that the transcription factor PLZF, which is known for its essential role in the function and development of several innate lymphocyte subsets, is also important for the myeloid-derived basophil lineage. PLZF-deficient mice had decreased numbers of basophil progenitors in the bone marrow and mature basophils in multiple peripheral tissues. Functionally, PLZF-deficient basophils were less responsive to IgE activation and produced reduced amounts of IL-4. The altered function of basophils resulted in a blunted Th2 T cell response to a protein allergen. Additionally, PLZF-deficient basophils had reduced expression of the IL-18 receptor, which impacted migration to lungs. PLZF, therefore, is a major player in controlling type 2 immune responses mediated not only by innate lymphocytes but also by myeloid-derived cells.","['Zhang, Sai', 'Vieth, Joshua A', 'Krzyzanowska, Agata', 'Henry, Everett K', 'Denzin, Lisa K', 'Siracusa, Mark C', ""Sant'Angelo, Derek B""]","['Zhang S', 'Vieth JA', 'Krzyzanowska A', 'Henry EK', 'Denzin LK', 'Siracusa MC', ""Sant'Angelo DB""]","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8756-2759', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3884-2612', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5510-9367']","['Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901.', 'Rutgers Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Piscataway, NJ 08854.', 'Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901.', 'Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901.', 'Rutgers Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Piscataway, NJ 08854.', 'Department of Medicine, Center for Immunity and Inflammation, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103; and.', 'Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901.', 'Rutgers Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Piscataway, NJ 08854.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901.', 'Department of Medicine, Center for Immunity and Inflammation, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, Newark, NJ 07103; and.', 'Child Health Institute of New Jersey, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901; santandb@rwjms.rutgers.edu.', 'Rutgers Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Piscataway, NJ 08854.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ 08901.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Allergens)', '0 (Interleukin-8)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)']",IM,,"['Allergens/immunology', 'Animals', 'Basophils/*immunology', 'Immunity, Innate/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/immunology', 'Interleukin-8/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Myeloid Cells/immunology', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/*immunology', 'Th2 Cells/immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*immunology']",,,,2019/08/02 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/08/02 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [entrez]']","['jimmunol.1900068 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1900068 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 Sep 1;203(5):1230-1241. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1900068.

There is strong morphologic resemblance among these distinct diagnostic entities as well as a lack of specific molecular markers and limited understanding of disease pathogenesis, which has made diagnosis challenging in certain cases. The treatment has remained empirical, resulting in dismal outcomes. We, therefore, performed whole-exome and RNA sequencing of these rare hematologic malignancies and present the most complete survey of the genomic landscape of these diseases to date.

Here, we demonstrate that LMO2 is activated by deacetylation on lysine 74 and 78 via the nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT)/sirtuin 2 (SIRT2) pathway. LMO2 deacetylation enables LMO2 to interact with LIM domain binding 1 and activate the TAL1 complex. NAMPT/SIRT2-mediated activation of LMO2 by deacetylation appears to be important for hematopoietic differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells and blood formation in zebrafish embryos. In T-ALL, deacetylated LMO2 induces expression of TAL1 complex target genes HHEX and NKX3.1 as well as LMO2 autoregulation. Consistent with this, inhibition of NAMPT or SIRT2 suppressed the in vitro growth and in vivo engraftment of T-ALL cells via diminished LMO2 deacetylation. This new molecular mechanism may provide new therapeutic possibilities in T-ALL and may contribute to the development of new methods for in vitro generation of blood cells.","['Morishima, Tatsuya', 'Krahl, Ann-Christin', 'Nasri, Masoud', 'Xu, Yun', 'Aghaallaei, Narges', 'Findik, Betul', 'Klimiankou, Maksim', 'Ritter, Malte', 'Hartmann, Marcus D', 'Gloeckner, Christian Johannes', 'Stefanczyk, Sylwia', 'Lindner, Christian', 'Oswald, Benedikt', 'Bernhard, Regine', 'Hahnel, Karin', 'Hermanutz-Klein, Ursula', 'Ebinger, Martin', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Casadei, Nicolas', 'Welte, Karl', 'Andre, Maya', 'Muller, Patrick', 'Bajoghli, Baubak', 'Skokowa, Julia']","['Morishima T', 'Krahl AC', 'Nasri M', 'Xu Y', 'Aghaallaei N', 'Findik B', 'Klimiankou M', 'Ritter M', 'Hartmann MD', 'Gloeckner CJ', 'Stefanczyk S', 'Lindner C', 'Oswald B', 'Bernhard R', 'Hahnel K', 'Hermanutz-Klein U', 'Ebinger M', 'Handgretinger R', 'Casadei N', 'Welte K', 'Andre M', 'Muller P', 'Bajoghli B', 'Skokowa J']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-3876-3217', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9890-3229', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6937-5677', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6494-6944', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4134-4171', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2209-0580', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0702-6209', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7368-7523', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4399-2324']","['Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Protein Evolution, Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology, Tubingen, Germany.', 'German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Center for Ophthalmology, Institute for Ophthalmic Research, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology, Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, University Hospital Tubingen, Germany.', ""University Children's Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""University Children's Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", 'Institute of Medical Genetics and Applied Genomics, University Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany.', ""University Children's Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""University Children's Hospital Tubingen, Tubingen, Germany."", ""Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, University of Basel Children's Hospital, Basel, Switzerland;

The t(8;21)(q22;q22) is a frequent chromosomal abnormality strongly associated with acute myeloblastic leukemia with maturation (AML-M2), but is rarely associated with other subtypes. Translocation involving a third chromosome could produce new genetic rearrangements that lead to leukemogenesis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Conventional cytogenetic analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed to identify the karyotype. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the AML1/ETO transcript. RESULTS/CONCLUSION: We herein report a novel rearrangement with a three-way translocation involving chromosomes 8, 21 and another unknown chromosome, in an 83-year-old female patient diagnosed as AML-M4, with an ALM1/ETO negative transcript. This is an uncommon case of AML-M4 with three-way translocation in a new variant of t(8;21) acute myeloid leukaemia. The detailed mechanism of different phenotype expression is unclear. Further study is needed to identify the leukemogenetic transformation resulting from t(8;21) translocation.","['Consoli, Maria Letizia', 'Romano, Alessandra', 'Parrinello, Nunziatina Laura', 'Tambe, Loredana', 'Romeo, Maria Anna', 'Salemi, Domenico', 'Santoro, Alessandra', 'DI Raimondo, Francesco']","['Consoli ML', 'Romano A', 'Parrinello NL', 'Tambe L', 'Romeo MA', 'Salemi D', 'Santoro A', 'DI Raimondo F']",,"['Division of Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplant, A.O.U.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six human leukaemia cell lines were cultured under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Cell growth, recovery of clonogenic cells, and the expression and activation of various signalling proteins were examined. RESULTS: Hypoxia suppressed cell growth and the recovery of clonogenic cells. Moreover, hypoxia up-regulated hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1alpha and HIF2alpha expression while suppressing the expression and activation of NOTCH1, mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR) activation, and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: We found that hypoxia up-regulated HIF expression while it suppressed the self-renewal capacity of leukaemia cells, NOTCH activity, and expression of its down-stream signalling molecules, which differs from previous reports mentioning that HIF activates NOTCH signalling.

One of the most frequent chromosomal translocations found in acute myeloid leukemia patients is the t(8;21), in which RUNX1 and ETO genes recombine. In RUNX1 gene, the DNA double-strand breaks that originate the t(8;21) are generated in the intron 5, specifically within three regions designated as BCR1, BCR2, and BCR3. To date, what determines that these regions are more susceptible to DNA double-strand breaks is not completely clear. In this report, we characterized RUNX1 intron 5, by analyzing DNase-seq and ChIP-seq data, available in the ENCODE Project server, to evaluate DNaseI hypersensitivity and the presence of the epigenetic mark H3K4me3 in 124 and 51 cell types, respectively. RESULTS: Our results show that intron 5 exhibits an epigenetic mark distribution similar to known promoter regions. Moreover, using the online tool YAPP and available CAGE data from the ENCODE Project server, we identified several putative transcription start sites within intron 5 in regions BCR2 and BCR3. Finally, available EST data was analyzed, identifying a novel uncharacterized long non-coding RNA, which is expressed in hematopoietic cell lines as shown by RT-PCR. Our data suggests that the core promoter of the novel long non-coding RNA locates within the region BCR3. CONCLUSION: We identified a novel long non-coding RNA within RUNX1 intron 5, transcribed from a promoter located in the region BCR3, one of the chromosomal breakpoints of RUNX1 gene.","['Schnake, Nicolas', 'Hinojosa, Marcela', 'Gutierrez, Soraya']","['Schnake N', 'Hinojosa M', 'Gutierrez S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1086-3726'],"['Laboratory of Epigenetics [EpiGene], Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Barrio Universitario s/n, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Laboratory of Epigenetics [EpiGene], Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Barrio Universitario s/n, Concepcion, Chile.', 'Laboratory of Epigenetics [EpiGene], Departamento de Bioquimica y Biologia Molecular, Facultad de Ciencias Biologicas, Universidad de Concepcion, Barrio Universitario s/n, Concepcion, Chile. sgutierr@udec.cl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Hum Genomics,Human genomics,101202210,"['0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1T1 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/*genetics', 'DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded', 'Humans', 'Introns/*genetics', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'RUNX1 Translocation Partner 1 Protein/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",PMC6670153,['NOTNLM'],"['*Breakpoint cluster region', '*Intron', '*Non-coding RNA', '*Promoter', '*RUNX1']",2019/08/02 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/08/02 06:00'],"['2019/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/02 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40246-019-0219-1 [doi]', '10.1186/s40246-019-0219-1 [pii]']",epublish,Hum Genomics. 2019 Jul 31;13(1):33. doi: 10.1186/s40246-019-0219-1.,,20190731,,['1130697/Comision Nacional de Investigacion Cientifica y Tecnologica/International'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: In a phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) patients 70 years of age or younger with previously untreated CLL to receive either ibrutinib and rituximab for six cycles (after a single cycle of ibrutinib alone), followed by ibrutinib until disease progression, or six cycles of chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab. The primary end point was progression-free survival, and overall survival was a secondary end point. We report the results of a planned interim analysis. RESULTS: A total of 529 patients underwent randomization (354 patients to the ibrutinib-rituximab group, and 175 to the chemoimmunotherapy group). At a median follow-up of 33.6 months, the results of the analysis of progression-free survival favored ibrutinib-rituximab over chemoimmunotherapy (89.4% vs. 72.9% at 3 years; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.56; P<0.001), and the results met the protocol-defined efficacy threshold for the interim analysis. The results of the analysis of overall survival also favored ibrutinib-rituximab over chemoimmunotherapy (98.8% vs. 91.5% at 3 years; hazard ratio for death, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.54; P<0.001). In a subgroup analysis involving patients without immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) mutation, ibrutinib-rituximab resulted in better progression-free survival than chemoimmunotherapy (90.7% vs. 62.5% at 3 years; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.50). The 3-year progression-free survival among patients with IGHV mutation was 87.7% in the ibrutinib-rituximab group and 88.0% in the chemoimmunotherapy group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.14 to 1.36). The incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or higher (regardless of attribution) was similar in the two groups (in 282 of 352 patients [80.1%] who received ibrutinib-rituximab and in 126 of 158 [79.7%] who received chemoimmunotherapy), whereas infectious complications of grade 3 or higher were less common with ibrutinib-rituximab than with chemoimmunotherapy (in 37 patients [10.5%] vs. 32 [20.3%], P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The ibrutinib-rituximab regimen resulted in progression-free survival and overall survival that were superior to those with a standard chemoimmunotherapy regimen among patients 70 years of age or younger with previously untreated CLL.

As this number of entities implies, lymphomas show marked pathological, genetic, and clinical heterogeneity. Recent molecular findings have significantly advanced our understanding of lymphomas. Areas covered: The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms was updated in 2017. The present review summarizes the new findings that have been gained in the areas of mature T-cell neoplasms, Hodgkin lymphomas, and histiocytic/dendritic cell neoplasms since the publication of the 2017 WHO classification. Expert opinion: Although formal revisions to the WHO classification are published only periodically, our understanding of the pathologic, genetic, and clinical features of lymphoid neoplasms is constantly evolving, particularly in the age of -omics technologies and targeted therapeutics. Even in the relatively short time since the publication of the 2017 WHO classification, many significant findings have been identified in the entities covered in this review.","['Satou, Akira', 'Bennani, N Nora', 'Feldman, Andrew L']","['Satou A', 'Bennani NN', 'Feldman AL']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA.', 'Department of Surgical Pathology, Aichi Medical University Hospital , Nagakute , Aichi , Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic , Rochester , MN , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Review']",England,Expert Rev Hematol,Expert review of hematology,101485942,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/immunology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Dendritic Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Histiocytic Disorders, Malignant/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Hodgkin Disease/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*classification/diagnosis/genetics/immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology/pathology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Terminology as Topic', 'World Health Organization']",PMC6763378,['NOTNLM'],"['*Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma', '*EBV-associated T-/NK-cell neoplasms', '*Hodgkin lymphoma', '*WHO classification', '*genetic abnormalities', '*histiocytic/dendritic cell tumors', '*mature T-cell neoplasms']",2019/08/01 06:00,2020/06/12 06:00,['2019/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/17474086.2019.1647777 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Rev Hematol. 2019 Oct;12(10):833-843. doi: 10.1080/17474086.2019.1647777.

To date, algorithm development has involved manual modifications to predefined classification rules. In this study, we propose a supervised learning algorithm for determining the best-performing proxy for number of lines of therapy and validate this approach in four patient groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed BC Cancer pharmacy records from patients' cancer diagnosis until end of follow-up (cohort-specific, 2014/2015). We created and validated a cyclic algorithm in patients with advanced cancers of varying histologies, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. To assess internal and external validity, we used a split-sample approach for all analyses and considered lines of therapy identified through manual review as our criterion standard. We measured agreement using correlation coefficients, mean squared error, nonparametric hypothesis testing, and quantile-quantile plots. RESULTS: Cohorts comprised 91 patients with advanced cancers, 121 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 440 with follicular lymphoma, and 679 with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Number of lines of therapy received and patients' treatment period length varied substantially across cohorts. Despite these differences, our algorithm successfully identified a best-performing proxy for number of lines of therapy for each cohort, which was moderate to highly correlated with (within-sample: 0.73 </= Pearson correlation </= 0.84; out-of-sample: 0.52 </= Pearson correlation </= 0.76) and whose distribution did not significantly differ from the criterion standard within or out of sample (P > .10). CONCLUSION: Supervised learning is an ideal tool for generating a best-performing proxy that recognizes prescription drug patterns and approximates number of lines of therapy. Our cyclic approach can be used in jurisdictions with access to administrative pharmacy data.","['Weymann, Deirdre', 'Costa, Sarah', 'Regier, Dean A']","['Weymann D', 'Costa S', 'Regier DA']",,"['BC Cancer, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'BC Cancer, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'BC Cancer, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,JCO Clin Cancer Inform,JCO clinical cancer informatics,101708809,,IM,,"['*Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/pathology/*therapy', 'Registries', 'Research Design', '*Supervised Machine Learning']",,,,2019/08/01 06:00,2020/06/03 06:00,['2019/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1200/CCI.19.00022 [doi]'],ppublish,JCO Clin Cancer Inform. 2019 Aug;3:1-10. doi: 10.1200/CCI.19.00022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the use of clinical flow cytometry is restricted by its lack of reproducibility across multiple centers. Since 2006, the EuroFlow consortium has been developing a standardized procedure detailing the whole process from instrument settings to data analysis. The FranceFlow group was created in 2010 with the intention to educate participating centers in France about the standardized instrument setting protocol (SOP) developed by the EuroFlow consortium and to organise several rounds of quality controls (QCs) in order to evaluate the feasibility of its application and its results. Here, we report the 5 year experience of the FranceFlow group and the results of the seven QCs of 23 instruments, involving up to 19 centers, in France and in Belgium. The FranceFlow group demonstrates that both the distribution and applicability of the SOP have been successful. Intercenter reproducibility was evaluated using both normal and pathological blood samples. Coefficients of variation (CVs) across the centers were <7% for the percentages of cell subsets and <30% for the median fluorescence intensities (MFIs) of the markers tested. Intracenter reproducibility provided similar results with CVs of <3% for the percentages of the majority of cell subsets, and CVs of <20% for the MFI values for the majority of markers. Altogether, the FranceFlow group show that the 19 participating labs might be considered as one unique laboratory with 23 identical flow cytometers able to reproduce identical results. Therefore, SOP significantly improves reproducibility of clinical flow in hematology and opens new avenues by providing a robust companion diagnostic tool for clinical trials in hematology.

Their most common risk factors are fair skin, a history of excessive ultraviolet light exposure, chronic inflammatory skin conditions, exposure to radiation, and contact with arsenic. Certain drugs can also be associated with a higher risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer. These include hydroxyurea, which acts as a metabolic inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase and a potent nonalkylating myelosuppressive agent. It is used for the treatment of various myeloproliferative disorders, including chronic myeloid leukemia, polycythemia vera, and essential thrombocytopenia. Several publications describe an increased occurrence of skin manifestations following hydroxyurea treatment. A growing body of evidence indicates a possible role of hydroxyurea in skin cancer progression. In this review article, we summarize some relevant observations about the association of hydroxyurea and skin cancer, and we describe our own clinical experiences to provide up to date recommendations about the care of patients on hydroxyurea therapy.","['Cantisani, Carmen', 'Kiss, Norbert', 'Naqeshbandi, Ahmad Faiq', 'Tosti, Giulio', 'Tofani, Sonia', 'Cartoni, Claudio', 'Carmosino, Ida', 'Cantoresi, Franca']","['Cantisani C', 'Kiss N', 'Naqeshbandi AF', 'Tosti G', 'Tofani S', 'Cartoni C', 'Carmosino I', 'Cantoresi F']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2181-951X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9947-1755']","['UOC of Dermatology, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza Medical School of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Dermatology, Venereology and Dermatooncology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'Victor Babes University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Faculty of Medicine, Romania.', 'Melanoma and Soft Tissue Sarcoma Division, IRCCS, European Institute of Oncology, Milan, Italy.', 'UOC of Dermatology, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza Medical School of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'Translational and precision medicine Hematology Department Umberto I Hospital Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'Translational and precision medicine Hematology Department Umberto I Hospital Sapienza University, Rome, Italy.', 'UOC of Dermatology, Policlinico Umberto I, Sapienza Medical School of Rome, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Dermatol Ther,Dermatologic therapy,9700070,['X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)'],IM,,"['Carcinoma, Squamous Cell/*chemically induced/pathology/therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Photochemotherapy/*methods', 'Polycythemia Vera/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment', 'Skin Neoplasms/*chemically induced/pathology/therapy', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*hydroxyurea treatment', '*myeloproliferative disorders', '*nonmelanoma skin cancer']",2019/08/01 06:00,2020/04/11 06:00,['2019/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/dth.13043 [doi]'],ppublish,Dermatol Ther. 2019 Sep;32(5):e13043. doi: 10.1111/dth.13043.

As the cornerstone of the immune system, macrophages are a key part of innate immunity. They ingest and degrade foreign substances including aging cells and microorganisms, coordinate the inflammatory process, and are the first line of defense against M. tb infection. Recent advances in cellular mycobacteriology have indicated that M. tb uses an remarkably complex strategy to disrupt macrophage function, in order to counteract the antimicrobial mechanisms of the innate and adaptive immune responses, thereby achieving immune escape. With the popularity of microarray technology, a variety of public platforms have provided a variety of gene expression data associated with physiological and disease conditions. Metaanalysis can systematically and quantitatively analyze multiple independent data concerning the same disease, greatly improving the statistical significance and credibility of the gene expression data analysis performed. In the present study, 6 microarray expression datasets of human acute monocytic leukemia THP1 cell line infected by M. tb H37Rv strain were collected from the GEO database. A total of 4 highquality datasets were identified using metaanalysis methods in R language, and 306 differentially expressed genes with statistical significance were obtained. Then, a proteinprotein interaction (PPI) network of these differentially expressed genes was constructed on the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins Database online tool and visualized by Cytoscape v. 3.6.1 software. Using CentiScape and MCODE plugin in the Cytoscape software to mine the functional modules associated with M. tb infection process, 32 characteristic genes were identified. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis was performed on the 32 characteristic genes, and it was demonstrated that these genes were primarily associated with the type I interferon (IFN) pathway. In the established model of THP1derived macrophages infected by M. tb, the actual differential expression levels of IFNstimulated gene 15 (ISG15), 2'5oligoadenylate synthetase like (OASL), IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and DExD/Hbox helicase 58 (DDX58), the first 4 genes of the 32 characteristic genes, were verified by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results were consistent with the results of microarray analysis. The association between ISG15, OASL and IRF7 and TB infection was also verified. Although a number of studies have identified that the type I IFN pathway may assist M. tb to achieve immune escape, the present study used a metaanalysis of microarray data and PPI network analysis to examine some of the novel genes identified in the IFN pathway. The results furthered the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the TB immune response and provided a novel perspective for future therapeutic goals.","['Zhang, Yu-Wei', 'Lin, Yan', 'Yu, Hui-Yuan', 'Tian, Ruo-Nan', 'Li, Fan']","['Zhang YW', 'Lin Y', 'Yu HY', 'Tian RN', 'Li F']",,"['Department of Pathogen Biology, The Key Laboratory of Zoonosis, Chinese Ministry of Education, College of Basic Medicine, Jilin University, Changchun, Jilin 130021, P.R.

Nevertheless, TRAIL has noticeable anti-cancer abilities; some cancer cells acquire resistance to TRAIL, and consequently, its potential for inducing apoptosis in target cells is strongly diminished. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia MOLT-4 cell line is one of the most resistant cells to TRAIL that developed resistance to TRAIL through different pathways. TRAIL plus kaempferol was used to eliminate the resistance of the MOLT-4 cells to TRAIL. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Firstly, IC50 for kaempferol (95muM) was determined by using the MTT assay. Secondly, the viability of the MOLT-4 cells was assayed by FACS after Annexin V/PI staining, following treatment with TRAIL (50 and 100nM) and kaempferol (95muM) alone and in combination. Finally, the expression levels of the candidate genes involved in resistance to TRAIL were assayed by real-time PCR technique. RESULTS: Kaempferol plus TRAIL induced apoptosis robustly in MOLT-4 cells at 12, 24 and 48 hours after treatment. Additionally, it was found that kaempferol could inhibit the expression of c-FLIP, X-IAP, cIAP1/2, FGF-8 and VEGF-beta, and conversely augment the expression of DR4/5 in MOLT-4 cells. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that co-treatment of MOLT-4 cells with TRAIL plus kaempferol is a practical and attractive approach to eliminate cancers' resistance to TRAIL by inhibition of the intracellular anti-apoptotic proteins, upregulation of DR4/5 and also by suppression of the VEGF-beta (VEGFB) and FGF-8 expressions.","['Hassanzadeh, Ali', 'Naimi, Adel', 'Hagh, Majid F', 'Saraei, Raedeh', 'Marofi, Faroogh', 'Solali, Saeed']","['Hassanzadeh A', 'Naimi A', 'Hagh MF', 'Saraei R', 'Marofi F', 'Solali S']",,"['Immunology research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Molecular Medicine Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)', '0 (Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Kaempferols)', '0 (Receptors, Death Domain)', '0 (Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '0 (TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand)', '731P2LE49E (kaempferol)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Kaempferols/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Receptors, Death Domain/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/metabolism', 'TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)', '*MOLT-4', '*TRAIL', '*VEGF', '*kaempferol', '*resistance.']",2019/08/01 06:00,2020/08/14 06:00,['2019/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-100073 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520619666190731155859 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2019;19(15):1835-1845. doi: 10.2174/1871520619666190731155859.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite undergoing extensive chemotherapy designed to target the rapidly proliferating leukemia cells, many of these children experience relapse. In refractory leukemia, the existence of cell populations with stemness characteristics, termed leukemia stem cells (LSCs), which remain quiescent and subsequently replenish the blast population, has been described. A significant body of evidence exists, derived largely from xenograft models of adult acute myeloid leukemia, to support the idea that LSCs may play a fundamental role in refractory disease. In addition, clinical studies have also linked LSCs with increased minimal residual disease, higher relapse rate, and decreased survival rates in these patients. Recently, a number of reports have addressed effective ways to utilize new-generation genomic sequencing and transcriptomic analyses to identify targeted therapeutic agents aimed at LSCs, while sparing normal hematopoietic stem cells. These data underscore the value of timely translation of knowledge from adult studies to the unique molecular and physiological characteristics seen in pediatric leukemia.

Although the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD), which is indicated by RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript levels, plays a key role in directing treatment, risk stratification needs to be improved, and other markers need to be assessed. A total of 66 t(8;21) AML patients were tested for aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity by flow cytometry at diagnosis, and 52 patients were followed up for a median of 20 (1-34) months. The median percentage of CD34+ALDH+, CD34+CD38-ALDH+, and CD34+CD38+ALDH+ cells among nucleated cells were 0.028%, 0.012%, and 0.0070%, respectively. The CD34+ALDH+-H, CD34+CD38-ALDH+-H, and CD34+CD38+ALDH+-H statuses (the percentage of cells that were higher than the individual cutoffs) were all significantly associated with a lower 2-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate in both the whole cohort and adult patients (P = .015, .016, and .049; P = .014, .018, and .032). Patients with < 3-log reduction in the RUNX1-RUNX1T1 transcript level after the second consolidation therapy (defined as MRD-H) had a significantly lower 2-year RFS rate than patients with >/= 3-log reduction (MRD-L) (P = .017). The CD34+ALDH+ status at diagnosis was then combined with the MRD status. CD34+ALDH+-L/MRD-H patients had similar 2-year RFS rates to both CD34+ALDH+-L/MRD-L and CD34+ALDH+-H/MRD-L patients (P = .50 and 1.0); and CD34+ALDH+-H/MRD-H patients had significantly lower 2-year RFS rate compared with CD34+ALDH+-L and/or MRD-L patients (P < .0001). Multivariate analysis showed that CD34+ALDH+-H/MRD-H was an independent adverse prognostic factor for relapse.

The disease typically occurs in elderly patients and has a highly variable clinical course. Leukemic transformation is initiated by specific genomic alterations that impair apoptosis of clonal B-cells. DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis is established by blood counts, blood smears, and immunophenotyping of circulating B-lymphocytes, which identify a clonal B-cell population carrying the CD5 antigen, as well as typical B-cell markers. PROGNOSIS: The two similar clinical staging systems, Rai and Binet, create prognostic information by using results of physical examination and blood counts. Various biological and genetic markers also have prognostic value. Deletions of the short arm of chromosome 17 (del [17p]) and/or mutations of the TP53 gene, predict resistance to chemoimmunotherapy and a shorter time to progression, with most targeted therapies. A comprehensive, international prognostic score (CLL-IPI) integrates genetic, biological and clinical variables to identify distinct risk groups of CLL patients. THERAPY: Only patients with active or symptomatic disease, or with advanced Binet or Rai stages require therapy. When treatment is indicated, several options exist for most CLL patients: a combination of venetoclax with obinutuzumab, ibrutinib monotherapy, or chemoimmunotherapy. For physically fit patients younger than 65 (in particular when presenting with a mutated IGVH gene), chemoimmunotherapy with fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab remains a standard therapy, since it may have curative potential. At relapse, the initial treatment may be repeated, if the treatment-free interval exceeds 3 years. If the disease relapses earlier, therapy should be changed using an alternative regimen. Patients with a del (17p) or TP53 mutation are a different, high-risk category and should be treated with targeted agents. An allogeneic SCT may be considered in relapsing patients with TP53 mutations or del (17p), or patients that are refractory to inhibitor therapy. FUTURE CHALLENGES: Targeted agents (ibrutinib, idelalisib, venetoclax, obinutuzumab) will be increasingly used in combination to allow for short, but potentially definitive therapies of CLL. It remains to be proven that they generate a superior outcome when compared to monotherapies with inhibitors of Bruton tyrosine kinase, which can also yield long-lasting remissions. Moreover, the optimal sequencing of drug combinations is unknown. Therefore, CLL patients should be treated in clinical trials whenever possible.","['Hallek, Michael']",['Hallek M'],,"['Department I of Internal Medicine, University of Cologne, Center for Integrated Oncology Aachen Bonn Koln Dusseldorf, Center of Excellence on ""Cellular Stress Responses in Aging-Associated Diseases"", Koln, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Forecasting', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotherapy', '*Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/epidemiology/genetics/therapy', 'Male', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Staging/methods', 'Prognosis', 'Risk Assessment/methods']",,,,2019/08/01 06:00,2020/03/27 06:00,['2019/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25595 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Nov;94(11):1266-1287. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25595.

Covalent low-MW BTK kinase inhibitors have shown impressive clinical efficacy in B-cell malignancies. However, the mutant Btk(C481S) poses a major challenge in the management of B-cell malignancies by disrupting the formation of the covalent bond between BTK and irreversible inhibitors, such as ibrutinib. The present studies were designed to develop novel BTK inhibitors targeting ibrutinib-resistant Btk(C481S) mutation. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: BTK-Ba/F3, BTK(C481S)-Ba/F3 cells, and human malignant B-cells JeKo-1, Ramos, and NALM-6 were used to evaluate cellular potency of BTK inhibitors. The in vitro pharmacological efficacy and compound selectivity were assayed via cell viability, colony formation, and BTK-mediated signalling. A tumour xenograft model with BTK-Ba/F3, Ramos and BTK(C481S)-Ba/F3 cells in Nu/nu BALB/c mice was used to assess in vivo efficacy of XMU-MP-3. KEY RESULTS: XMU-MP-3 is one of a group of low MW compounds that are potent non-covalent BTK inhibitors. XMU-MP-3 inhibited both BTK and the acquired mutant BTKC481S, in vitro and in vivo. Further computational modelling, site-directed mutagenesis analysis, and structure-activity relationships studies indicated that XMU-MP-3 displayed a typical Type-II inhibitor binding mode. CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS: XMU-MP-3 directly targets the BTK signalling pathway in B-cell lymphoma. These findings establish XMU-MP-3 as a novel inhibitor of BTK, which could serve as both a tool compound and a lead for further drug development in BTK relevant B-cell malignancies, especially those with the acquired ibrutinib-resistant C481S mutation.","['Gui, Fu', 'Jiang, Jie', 'He, Zhixiang', 'Li, Li', 'Li, Yunzhan', 'Deng, Zhou', 'Lu, Yue', 'Wu, Xinrui', 'Chen, Guyue', 'Su, Jingyi', 'Song,

For the majority of patients, CLL follows an indolent clinical course, while a proportion of patients experience rapid disease progression. Despite the strong correlation between certain genetic defects and prognosis, there remains no single unifying pathogenic lesion in CLL. With recent advances in therapy it is increasingly important to stratify CLL patients according to risk. This has been highlighted by two recent studies, the first showing that immunoglobulin heavy chain mutational status predicts a durable response to frontline chemoimmunotherapy and the second showing that complex karyotype is a stronger predictor of poor response to ibrutinib and venetoclax therapy than TP53 deletion. In this review we discuss the molecular features of CLL and how technological advances can identify patient subsets and stratify them according to risk.","['Crassini, Kyle', 'Stevenson, William S', 'Mulligan, Stephen P', 'Best, O Giles']","['Crassini K', 'Stevenson WS', 'Mulligan SP', 'Best OG']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3785-2931', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2685-3880']","['Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'School of Life and Environmental Science, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Northern Blood Research Centre, Kolling Institute of Medical Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'School of Life and Environmental Science, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,,"['Cytogenetics/*methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*chronic lymphocytic leukaemia', '*molecular', '*pathology']",2019/08/01 06:00,2020/07/17 06:00,['2019/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16102 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Sep;186(5):668-684. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16102.

Studies have found that NANOG has many interacting partners and some of these were shown to play a role in its ability to mediate reprogramming. In this study, we set out to analyse the effect of NANOG interactors on the reprogramming process. Methods: Epiblast stem cells and somatic cells were reprogrammed to naive pluripotency using MEK/ERK inhibitor PD0325901, GSK3beta inhibitor CHIR99021 and Leukaemia Inhibitory Factor (together termed 2i Plus LIF). Zmym2 was knocked out using the CRISPR/Cas9 system or overexpressed using the PiggyBac system. Reprogramming was quantified after ZMYM2 deletion or overexpression, in diverse reprogramming systems. In addition, embryonic stem cell self renewal was quantified in differentiation assays after ZMYM2 removal or overexpression. Results: In this work, we identified ZMYM2/ZFP198, which physically associates with NANOG as a key negative regulator of NANOG-mediated reprogramming of both epiblast stem cells and somatic cells. In addition, ZMYM2 impairs the self renewal of embryonic stem cells and its overexpression promotes differentiation. Conclusions: We propose that ZMYM2 curtails NANOG's actions during the reprogramming of both somatic cells and epiblast stem cells and impedes embryonic stem cell self renewal, promoting differentiation.","['Lawrence, Moyra', 'Theunissen, Thorold W', 'Lombard, Patrick', 'Adams, David J', 'Silva, Jose C R']","['Lawrence M', 'Theunissen TW', 'Lombard P', 'Adams DJ', 'Silva JCR']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9386-5633', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9490-0306', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5487-1117']","['Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Developmental Biology and Center of Regenerative Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, USA.', 'Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Experimental Cancer Genetics, Wellcome Sanger Institute, Cambridge, CB10 1SA, UK.', 'Wellcome-MRC Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, CB2 1QR, UK.', 'Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, CB2 1QR, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Wellcome Open Res,Wellcome open research,101696457,,,,,PMC6640293,['NOTNLM'],"['Nanog', 'Zinc finger protein', 'differentiation', 'pluripotency', 'reprogramming']",2019/08/01 06:00,2019/08/01 06:01,['2019/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/01 06:01 [medline]']",['10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15250.1 [doi]'],epublish,Wellcome Open Res. 2019 Jun 6;4:88. doi: 10.12688/wellcomeopenres.15250.1. eCollection 2019.,,20190606,,"['MC_PC_12009/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom', 'MR/R017735/1/MRC_/Medical Research Council/United Kingdom']",['No competing interests were disclosed.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Acute Leukaemia Working Party of the European Society for Blood and Bone Marrow Transplantation Registry studied an AML CR2 cohort characterised by age >/= 18 years, first allo-HCT 2007-2016, available cytogenetic profile at diagnosis, donors who were matched family, volunteer unrelated with HLA antigen match 10/10 or 9/10 or haplo-identical. The 1879 eligible patients included 1010 (54%) MAC allo-HCT recipients. In patients <50 years (y), two year outcomes for MAC vs RIC allo-HCT were equivalent with leukaemia-free survival (LFS) 54% for each, overall survival (OS), 61% vs 62%, non-relapse mortality (NRM) 18% vs 15% and graft versus host disease relapse-free survival (GRFS) 38% vs 42%. In patients >/=50 y, 2 y outcomes for MAC vs RIC allo-HCT were equivalent for LFS 52% vs 49%, OS 58% vs 55% and GRFS 42.4% vs 36%. However, NRM was significantly inferior after MAC allo-HCT, 27% vs 19% (P = 0.01) despite worse cGVHD after RIC-allo (32% vs 39%).

Our results suggest that there is crosstalk between Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) signaling and bioenergetic stress responses. In primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lymphocytes, pharmacological interference with mitochondrial ATP synthesis or glucose metabolism affects BTK activity. Conversely, an inhibitor of BTK used clinically (ibrutinib) induces bioenergetic stress responses that in turn affect ibrutinib resistance. Although the detailed molecular mechanisms are still to be defined, our work shows for the first time that in primary B cells, metabolic stressors enhance BTK signaling and suggest that metabolic rewiring to hyperglycemia affects ibrutinib resistance in TP53 deficient chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) lymphocytes.","['Sharif-Askari, Bahram', 'Doyon, Daniel', 'Paliouras, Miltiadis', 'Aloyz, Raquel']","['Sharif-Askari B', 'Doyon D', 'Paliouras M', 'Aloyz R']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1321-4414', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6812-497X']","['Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research & Cancer Segal Center, Jewish General Hospital, Quebec, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research & Cancer Segal Center, Jewish General Hospital, Quebec, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research & Cancer Segal Center, Jewish General Hospital, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Quebec, Canada.', 'Lady Davis Institute for Medical Research & Cancer Segal Center, Jewish General Hospital, Quebec, Canada. raquel.aloyz@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Experimental Medicine, McGill University, Quebec, Canada. raquel.aloyz@mcgill.ca.', 'Department of Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Quebec, Canada. raquel.aloyz@mcgill.ca.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Sci Rep,Scientific reports,101563288,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/physiology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*physiology', 'Energy Metabolism/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Piperidines', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects/physiology']",PMC6667467,,,2019/08/01 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2019/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41598-019-47305-2 [doi]', '10.1038/s41598-019-47305-2 [pii]']",epublish,Sci Rep. 2019 Jul 30;9(1):11069. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-47305-2.,,20190730,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SLL typically presents with lymphadenopathy and is rarely associated with cardiac involvement. This report is of a case of lymphomatous pericardial effusion in a 61-year-old woman who presented with dyspnea. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old woman presented to the emergency department with a three-month history of worsening shortness of breath on exertion. Her symptoms progressed to shortness of breath at rest, with night sweats and chills. She had no weight loss. She was found to have a pericardial effusion, and an urgent pericardiocentesis was performed to prevent cardiac tamponade. Analysis of the pericardial fluid was consistent with a diagnosis of SLL. A bone marrow biopsy and a biopsy of a renal mass were consistent with a diagnosis of SLL. She was treated with rituximab and bendamustine with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) support and was discharged home. CONCLUSIONS A case is presented of a rare association between SLL and pericardial effusion with a favorable outcome following urgent pericardiocentesis to prevent cardiac tamponade followed by chemotherapy.","['Nnaoma, Christopher', 'Chika-Nwosuh, Ogechukwu', 'Mbonu, Ikechukwu', 'Sossou, Christoph W', 'Okonkwo, Christian C', 'Isedeh, Anthony']","['Nnaoma C', 'Chika-Nwosuh O', 'Mbonu I', 'Sossou CW', 'Okonkwo CC', 'Isedeh A']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Newark, NJ, USA.', 'Department of Clinical Documentation, Doctors Hospital at Renaissance, Edinburg, TX, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Newark Beth Israel Medical Center, Newark, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,,IM,,"['Computed Tomography Angiography', 'Dyspnea/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis', 'Middle Aged', 'Pericardial Effusion/diagnostic imaging/*etiology', 'Tomography, X-Ray Computed']",PMC6686746,,,2019/08/01 06:00,2020/01/30 06:00,['2019/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/08/01 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['915576 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.915576 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2019 Jul 31;20:1128-1131. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.915576.,,20190731,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ceramide, a sphingolipid (SL), plays a critical role in cancer cell apoptosis in response to chemotherapy. Here, we investigated the effects of chemotherapy selection pressure with Ara-C and dnr on SL composition and enzyme activity in the AML cell line HL-60. Resistant cells, those selected for growth in Ara-C- and dnr-containing medium (HL-60/Ara-C and HL-60/dnr, respectively), demonstrated upregulated expression and activity of glucosylceramide synthase, acid ceramidase (AC), and sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1); were more resistant to ceramide than parental cells; and displayed sensitivity to inhibitors of SL metabolism. Lipidomic analysis revealed a general ceramide deficit and a profound upswing in levels of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and ceramide 1-phosphate (C1P) in HL-60/dnr cells versus parental and HL-60/Ara-C cells. Both chemotherapy-selected cells also exhibited comprehensive upregulations in mitochondrial biogenesis consistent with heightened reliance on oxidative phosphorylation, a property that was partially reversed by exposure to AC and SPHK1 inhibitors and that supports a role for the phosphorylation system in resistance. In summary, dnr and Ara-C selection pressure induces acute reductions in ceramide levels and large increases in S1P and C1P, concomitant with cell resilience bolstered by enhanced mitochondrial remodeling. Thus, strategic control of ceramide metabolism and further research to define mitochondrial perturbations that accompany the drug-resistant phenotype offer new opportunities for developing therapies that regulate cancer growth.","['Kao, Li-Pin', 'Morad, Samy A F', 'Davis, Traci S', 'MacDougall, Matthew R', 'Kassai, Miki', 'Abdelmageed, Noha', 'Fox, Todd E', 'Kester, Mark', 'Loughran, Thomas P Jr', ""Abad, Jose' L"", 'Fabrias, Gemma', 'Tan, Su-Fern', 'Feith, David J', 'Claxton, David F', 'Spiegel, Sarah', 'Fisher-Wellman, Kelsey H', 'Cabot, Myles C']","['Kao LP', 'Morad SAF', 'Davis TS', 'MacDougall MR', 'Kassai M', 'Abdelmageed N', 'Fox TE', 'Kester M', 'Loughran TP Jr', 'Abad JL', 'Fabrias G', 'Tan SF', 'Feith DJ', 'Claxton DF', 'Spiegel S', 'Fisher-Wellman KH', 'Cabot MC']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Greenville, NC.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Greenville, NC; Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, South Valley University, Qena, Egypt.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Greenville, NC.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Greenville, NC.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Greenville, NC.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Sohag University, Sohag, Egypt.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Virginia School of Medicine, Charlottesville, VA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center Charlottesville, VA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center Charlottesville, VA; Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.', 'Instituto de Quimica Avanzada de Cataluna, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Instituto de Quimica Avanzada de Cataluna, Barcelona, Spain.', 'Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.', 'University of Virginia Cancer Center Charlottesville, VA; Department of Medicine, Hematology/Oncology, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA.', 'Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute, Hershey, PA.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Massey Cancer Center, Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine, Richmond, VA.', 'Department of Physiology, Brody School of Medicine, East Carolina University, and the East Carolina Diabetes and Obesity Institute, Greenville, NC.

Recently, it has been proposed that phytochemicals, such as flavonoids due to their low side effects and notable safety have the potential to be used for CML therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: K-562 cells were exposed with three concentrations of the querectin (10, 40 and 80microM) for 12, 24 and 48 hours. After that, these cells apoptosis rate was estimated using Annexin-V/PI staining and flowcytometry analysis, and their proliferation rate was evaluated using 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT). Finally, the expression of the 70 and 90 kilodalton heat shock proteins (HSP70 and 90), methionine adenosyltransferase 2A (MAT2A), Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1), caspase-3 and -8, Bcl-X(L) and Bax involved in leukemic cells survival and proliferation was assessed using Real-Time PCR within 12, 24 and 48 hours after exposure with quercetin 40 and 80microM. RESULTS: Considering consequences, querecetin induced apoptosis in K-562 cells, and also abrogated these cells proliferation. On the other hand, RT-PCR results showed a reduction in some of the candidate genes expression, especially HSP70, Bcl-X(L) and FOXM1, when cells were treated with quercetin 40 and 80microM. Also, Bax, caspase-3 and caspase-8 expression was significantly improved in K-562 cells upon quercetin exposure. CONCLUSION: We concluded that CML therapy by querecetin due to its anti-proliferative and anti-survival potentials could lead to the promising therapeutic outcome through targeting major survival and proliferation involved genes expression.","['Hassanzadeh, Ali', 'Hosseinzadeh, Elham', 'Rezapour, Saleheh', 'Vahedi, Ghasem', 'Haghnavaz, Navideh', 'Marofi, Faroogh']","['Hassanzadeh A', 'Hosseinzadeh E', 'Rezapour S', 'Vahedi G', 'Haghnavaz N', 'Marofi F']",,"['Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetic, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Genetic, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Faculty of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences, Zanjan, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Department of Immunology, Division of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Immunology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.', 'Hematology and Oncology Research Center, Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Anticancer Agents Med Chem,Anti-cancer agents in medicinal chemistry,101265649,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (FOXM1 protein, human)', '0 (Forkhead Box Protein M1)', '0 (HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins)', '9IKM0I5T1E (Quercetin)', 'EC 2.5.1.6 (MAT2A protein, human)', 'EC 2.5.1.6 (Methionine Adenosyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Forkhead Box Protein M1/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'HSP70 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Methionine Adenosyltransferase/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Quercetin/chemical synthesis/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML)', '*HSP', '*K-562', '*apoptosis', '*proliferation', '*quercetin.']",2019/08/01 06:00,2020/04/01 06:00,['2019/08/01 06:00'],"['2019/01/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/08/01 06:00 [entrez]']","['ACAMC-EPUB-100012 [pii]', '10.2174/1871520619666190729150442 [doi]']",ppublish,Anticancer Agents Med Chem. 2019;19(12):1523-1534. doi: 10.2174/1871520619666190729150442.,"['Copyright(c) Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at', 'epub@benthamscience.net.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY: A 44-year-old African-American man with pancytopenia was transferred to an academic medical center for evaluation. His medical history included bipolar depression, gynecomastia, and HIV infection (diagnosed 5 years prior) for which he was being treated with atazanavir, emtricitabine-tenofovir, and ritonavir. He was diagnosed with AML with 60% myeloblasts found during bone marrow biopsy. He had primary refractory disease after induction chemotherapy treatment. His disease was refractory to subsequent therapy with high-dose cytarabine and then etoposide and mitoxantrone. The patient then underwent treatment with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor-primed clofarabine and cytarabine (G-CLAC). At blood count recovery, he was diagnosed with refractory disease, with 17% blasts in peripheral blood and was subsequently discharged home on hospice 38 days after G-CLAC and 19 days after the last dose of filgrastim. He arrived at the outpatient clinic 79 days after G-CLAC chemotherapy with significantly improved blood counts. Two weeks later, a bone marrow biopsy confirmed complete remission with incomplete hematologic recovery. CONCLUSION: A patient with relapsed AML achieved a delayed response to clofarabine at least 38 days after treatment.","['Walchack, Robert', 'Cumpston, Aaron', 'Vos, Jeffrey', 'Kanate, Abraham S']","['Walchack R', 'Cumpston A', 'Vos J', 'Kanate AS']",,"['Department of Pharmacy, West Virginia University Medicine, Morgantown, WV.', 'Department of Pharmacy, West Virginia University Medicine, Morgantown, WV.', 'Osborn Hematopoietic Malignancy and Transplantation Program, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV.', 'Department of Pathology, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV.', 'Osborn Hematopoietic Malignancy and Transplantation Program, West Virginia University, Morgantown, WV.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Am J Health Syst Pharm,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,9503023,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '762RDY0Y2H (Clofarabine)', 'PVI5M0M1GW (Filgrastim)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clofarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Filgrastim/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['refractory disease', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'clofarabine', 'delayed-onset', 'remission']",2019/07/31 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]']","['5354452 [pii]', '10.1093/ajhp/zxy055 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Health Syst Pharm. 2019 Feb 21;76(6):349-352. doi: 10.1093/ajhp/zxy055.,"['(c) American Society of Health-System Pharmacists 2019.

However, the psychological well-being and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of these 2 groups of cancer survivors have not been compared. OBJECTIVE: To examine and compare the impact of cancer and treatment-related effects on psychological well-being and HRQOL between survivors of childhood solid tumors and leukemia. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 65 Hong Kong survivors of solid tumors and 70 survivors of leukemia aged 8 to 18 years who had their medical follow-up in a pediatric outpatient clinic. Participants' depressive symptoms, self-esteem, and HRQOL were assessed. Twenty-two survivors of childhood solid tumors and 15 survivors of childhood leukemia were then selected for semistructured interviews. RESULTS: Survivors of childhood solid tumors reported significantly higher mean scores for depressive symptoms, and lower mean self-esteem and HRQOL scores than survivors of childhood leukemia. Qualitative data revealed that survivors of childhood solid tumors faced more challenges in their daily life than survivors of childhood leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood solid tumors reported poorer psychological well-being and HRQOL than survivors of childhood leukemia. This vulnerable group warrants more attention and support. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: It is vital for healthcare professionals to understand the impact of cancer and treatment-related effects in the context of different types of cancer. This will facilitate development and evaluation of appropriate psychological interventions to promote psychological well-being and HRQOL among childhood cancer survivors.","['Ho, Laurie Long Kwan', 'Li, William Ho Cheung', 'Ho, Ka Yan', 'Cheung, Ankie Tan', 'Chan, Godfrey Chi Fung', 'Chiu, Sau Ying', 'Chung, Joyce Oi Kwan']","['Ho LLK', 'Li WHC', 'Ho KY', 'Cheung AT', 'Chan GCF', 'Chiu SY', 'Chung JOK']",,"['Author Affiliations: School of Nursing, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong (Ms Ho, Dr Li, Dr Ho, Ms Cheung, and Dr Chung); Department of Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong (Dr Chan); and Paediatric Oncology Unit, Queen Mary Hospital (Ms Chiu), Hong Kong, China.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Nurs,Cancer nursing,7805358,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/*therapy', 'Quality of Life/*psychology']",,,,2019/07/31 06:00,2021/04/27 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/NCC.0000000000000736 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Nurs. 2020 Nov/Dec;43(6):446-454. doi: 10.1097/NCC.0000000000000736.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AG-221, an inhibitor primarily targeting the IDH2-R140Q mutant, has shown remarkable clinical benefits in the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia patients. However, AG-221 has weak inhibitory activity toward IDH2-R172K, a mutant form of IDH2 with more severe clinical manifestations. Herein, we report TQ05310 as the first mutant IDH2 inhibitor that potently targets both IDH2-R140Q and IDH2-R172K mutants. TQ05310 inhibited mutant IDH2 enzymatic activity, suppressed (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) production and induced differentiation in cells expressing IDH2-R140Q and IDH2-R172K, but not in cells expressing wild-type IDH1/2 or mutant IDH1. TQ05310 bound to both IDH2-R140Q and IDH2-R172K, with Q316 being the critical residue mediating the binding of TQ05310 with IDH2-R140Q, but not with IDH2-R172K. TQ05310 also had favorable pharmacokinetic characteristics and profoundly inhibited 2-HG production in a tumor xenografts model. The results of the current study establish a solid foundation for further clinical investigation of TQ05310, and provide new insight into the development of novel mutant IDH2 inhibitors.","['Gao, Mingzhao', 'Zhu, Hongmei', 'Fu, Li', 'Li, Yun', 'Bao, Xubin', 'Fu, Haoyu', 'Quan, Haitian', 'Wang, Lei', 'Lou, Liguang']","['Gao M', 'Zhu H', 'Fu L', 'Li Y', 'Bao X', 'Fu H', 'Quan H', 'Wang L', 'Lou L']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7396-7122'],"['Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Enzyme Inhibitors)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (IDH2, human)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,,"['*Amino Acid Substitution', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Enzyme Inhibitors/*administration & dosage/chemistry/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Isocitrate Dehydrogenase/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*genetics/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Models, Molecular', 'Molecular Docking Simulation', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6778631,['NOTNLM'],"['AG-221', 'IDH2', 'R140Q', 'R172K', 'leukemia']",2019/07/31 06:00,2019/10/12 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/05/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14152 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Oct;110(10):3306-3314. doi: 10.1111/cas.14152.

CD71 expression has been found to be significantly increased in rapidly proliferating cells. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 37 bone marrow samples of acute leukemia cases diagnosed between October 2016 to April 2018. The samples were analysed on BD FACS Canto II. We evaluated the expression of CD71 on leukemic blasts and compared median fluorescent intensities (MFI) of blasts in different types of acute leukemias. Results: The 37 cases comprised of 21 Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML), 13 B-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL), 2 T- Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) and 1 mixed phenotypic acute leukemia (MPAL), T/Myeloid. CD 71 expression was noted in 70.3% (n= 26/37) of acute leukemia cases. CD71 expression was most commonly observed in AML (n= 15/21;71.4%), followed by B-ALL (n= 9/13;69.2%) and T-ALL (n= 1/2;50%). Single case of MPAL revealed blasts positive for CD71. MFI of leukemic blasts of single CD71 positive T-ALL was found to be highest, followed by AML, MPAL (T/Myeloid) and least in B ALL. Of the AML cases, the blasts of AML-M6, acute promyelocytic leukemia and AML-M1 showed higher CD71 expression in terms of MFI.

Their structures were identified by NMR and high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HRESIMS). The derivatives were screened in vitro for antiproliferative activity against three human leukemic cell lines (MV4-11, HL-60, K562). All of the derivatives displayed cytotoxicity against the human FLT-3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line MV4-11 with IC50 values of 0.32-0.96 muM. The mechanism of action studies indicated that the most effective 3-chloro-5'''-fluorofradcarbazole A (6) induced apoptosis of the MV4-11 cells and arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase. Furthermore, compound 6 can reduce the expression of FLT-3, CDK2, and c-kit. The results suggest that 3-chloro-5'''-fluorofradcarbazole A (6) is a potential candidate for developing novel anti-AML agents in the future.","['Li, Mingpeng', 'Xu, Yanchao', 'Zuo, Mingxing', 'Liu, Wen', 'Wang, Liping', 'Zhu, Weiming']","['Li M', 'Xu Y', 'Zuo M', 'Liu W', 'Wang L', 'Zhu W']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7591-3264'],"['State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang 550014 , China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang 550025 , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Guiyang 550014 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang 550014 , China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang 550025 , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Guiyang 550014 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang 550014 , China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang 550025 , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Guiyang 550014 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang 550014 , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Guiyang 550014 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang 550014 , China.', 'School of Pharmaceutical Sciences , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang 550025 , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Chemistry for Natural Products of Guizhou Province , Chinese Academy of Sciences , Guiyang 550014 , China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Functions and Applications of Medicinal Plants , Guizhou Medical University , Guiyang 550014 , China.', 'Key Laboratory of Marine Drugs, Ministry of Education of China, School of Medicine and Pharmacy , Ocean University of China , Qingdao 266003 , China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Nat Prod,Journal of natural products,7906882,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '0 (fradcarbazole A)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Staurosporine/*analogs & derivatives/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Thiazoles/chemistry/*pharmacology']",,,,2019/07/31 06:00,2020/10/22 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b00468 [doi]'],ppublish,J Nat Prod. 2019 Aug 23;82(8):2279-2290. doi: 10.1021/acs.jnatprod.9b00468.

Inhibitors of an arginine-binding cavity in WDR5, known as the WDR5-interaction (WIN) site, have been proposed to selectively kill MLL-rearranged malignancies via an epigenetic mechanism. We discovered potent WIN site inhibitors and found that they kill MLL cancer cells not through changes in histone methylation, but by displacing WDR5 from chromatin at protein synthesis genes, choking the translational capacity of these cells, and inducing death via a nucleolar stress response. The mechanism of action of WIN site inhibitors reveals new aspects of WDR5 function and forecasts broad therapeutic utility as anti-cancer agents.","['Aho, Erin R', 'Weissmiller, April M', 'Fesik, Stephen W', 'Tansey, William P']","['Aho ER', 'Weissmiller AM', 'Fesik SW', 'Tansey WP']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3900-0978'],"['Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.', 'Department of Cell and Developmental Biology, School of Medicine, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Epigenet Insights,Epigenetics insights,101735398,,,,,PMC6640055,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer therapy', 'MYC', 'WDR5', 'chromatin', 'epigenetic mechanisms', 'histone methylation', 'small molecule inhibitors']",2019/07/31 06:00,2019/07/31 06:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/06/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2516865719865282 [doi]', '10.1177_2516865719865282 [pii]']",epublish,Epigenet Insights. 2019 Jul 18;12:2516865719865282. doi: 10.1177/2516865719865282. eCollection 2019.,,20190718,,"['HHSN261200800001C/RC/CCR NIH HHS/United States', 'HHSN261200800001E/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA200709/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA119925/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['Declaration of Conflicting Interests:S.W.F., S.R.

Methods: The analysis was based on individual data of 4830 patients from two large phase III trials that asked a randomized question on the effect of different corticosteroids (dexamethasone vs prednisone) during induction chemotherapy on EFS. The association between MRD classified in three ordered categories [negative = 0, low positive = (>0 and <5 x 10(-4)), and positive = (>/=5 x 10(-4))] and EFS at the individual and trial levels was evaluated with the meta-analytic approach based on the Plackett copula model. Centers within trial were grouped according to geographical area, and a total of 28 units were identified for the analysis. Results: MRD at the end of induction was a poor surrogate for treatment effect on EFS at the trial level, with R trial 2 = 0.09 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.00 to 0.29), whereas at the individual level it was strongly associated with EFS, with an odds ratio of 3.90 (95% CI = 3.35 to 4.44) of failure for patients with higher compared with lower MRD levels. Additional sensitivity and relevant subgroup analyses confirmed these findings at both trial- and patient-level association. Conclusions: Although MRD is a robust biomarker highly predictive of outcome for individual patients, clinicians and regulatory bodies should be cautious in using early MRD response in the context of complex multiagent acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy as an early surrogate endpoint to predict the effect of a randomized treatment intervention on long-term EFS.","['Galimberti, Stefania', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Lucenti, Ausiliatrice', 'Cazzaniga, Giovanni', 'Moricke, Anja', 'Bartram, Claus R', 'Mann, Georg', 'Carroll, William', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Borowitz, Michael', 'Wood, Brent', 'Basso, Giuseppe', 'Conter, Valentino', 'Zimmermann, Martin', 'Suciu, Stefan', 'Biondi, Andrea', 'Schrappe, Martin', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Valsecchi, Maria Grazia']","['Galimberti S', 'Devidas M', 'Lucenti A', 'Cazzaniga G', 'Moricke A', 'Bartram CR', 'Mann G', 'Carroll W', 'Winick N', 'Borowitz M', 'Wood B', 'Basso G', 'Conter V', 'Zimmermann M', 'Suciu S', 'Biondi A', 'Schrappe M', 'Hunger SP', 'Valsecchi MG']",,"['Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano - Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Biostatistics, College of Medicine, Public Health and Health Professions, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL.', 'Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano - Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Fondazione Tettamanti, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', 'Institute of Human Genetics, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'St. Anna Kinderspital, Wien, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatrics, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, NY.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'Hematologic Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA.', 'Department SDB, University of Padua, Padova, Italy.', 'Pediatric Clinics, University of Milano - Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'EORTC, EORTC Headquarters, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Pediatric Clinics, University of Milano - Bicocca, Monza, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Kiel, Germany.', ""Department of Pediatrics and the Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA."", 'Center of Biostatistics for Clinical Epidemiology, School of Medicine and Surgery, University of Milano - Bicocca, Monza, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,JNCI Cancer Spectr,JNCI cancer spectrum,101721827,,,,,PMC6649800,,,2019/07/31 06:00,2019/07/31 06:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2018/04/17 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/06 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/jncics/pky069 [doi]', 'pky069 [pii]']",epublish,JNCI Cancer Spectr. 2018 Dec 19;2(4):pky069. doi: 10.1093/jncics/pky069. eCollection 2018 Oct.,,20181219,,"['U10 CA180886/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'U10 CA180899/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed mortality and risk of SPCs in MM patients with siblings or parents affected with same cancer compared with that of the general population. Methods: We used the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to assess relative risks (RRs) and causes of death in SPCs until 2015 in patients with a MM diagnosis between 1958 and 2015. We identified 35 451patients with MM among whom 3212 received a subsequent diagnosis of SPC. RRs of SPCs after MM diagnosis were calculated stratifying over concordant family history of cancer in first-degree relatives. Results: Familial RRs were increased for second melanoma (RR = 19.28, 95% CI = 16.71 to 22.25), squamous cell skin cancer (RR = 7.58, 95% CI = 5.57 to 10.29), leukemia (RR = 5.69, 95% CI = 2.96 to 10.94), bladder (RR = 4.15, 95% CI = 2.50 to 6.89), ovarian (RR = 3.89, 95% CI = 1.46 to 10.37), kidney cancer (RR = 3.77, 95% CI = 1.57 to 9.06), cancer of unknown primary (RR = 3.67, 95% CI = 1.65 to 8.16), nervous system (RR = 2.88, 95% CI = 1.20 to 6.93), breast (RR = 2.34, 95% CI = 1.92 to 2.84), lung (RR = 2.24, 95% CI = 1.50 to 3.35), and prostate cancer (RR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.89 to 2.61) with statistical significance. For all cancers, familial RR was in excess (2.09, 95% CI = 2.02 to 2.16 vs 1.78, 95% CI = 1.69 to 1.87; Ptrend < .0001). Cause of death in MM patients with SPC is shown to be dependent on the cancer site though SPCs contributed to majority of deaths. Conclusions: SPCs appear higher with prior family history of cancer and contribute to mortality. SPC was the most common cause of death in patients with SPC and is almost uniformly the major contributing cause of death for all cancer sites. For improved survival in MM patients, prevention and early detection of SPCs would be important.","['Chattopadhyay, Subhayan', 'Hemminki, Akseli', 'Forsti, Asta', 'Sundquist, Kristina', 'Sundquist, Jan', 'Hemminki, Kari']","['Chattopadhyay S', 'Hemminki A', 'Forsti A', 'Sundquist K', 'Sundquist J', 'Hemminki K']",,"['Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Cancer Gene Therapy Group, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Division of Molecular Genetic Epidemiology, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Cancer Gene Therapy Group, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Cancer Gene Therapy Group, Faculty of Medicine, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Center for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education (CoHRE) Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.', 'Department of Family Medicine and Community Health, Department of Population Health Science and Policy, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY.', 'Center for Community-based Healthcare Research and Education (CoHRE) Department of Functional Pathology, School of Medicine, Shimane University, Matsue, Japan.', 'Center for Primary Health Care Research, Lund University, Malmo, Sweden.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,JNCI Cancer Spectr,JNCI cancer spectrum,101721827,,,,,PMC6649697,,,2019/07/31 06:00,2019/07/31 06:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2018/09/12 00:00 [received]', '2018/10/09 00:00 [revised]', '2018/10/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/jncics/pky068 [doi]', 'pky068 [pii]']",epublish,JNCI Cancer Spectr. 2019 Jan 9;2(4):pky068. doi: 10.1093/jncics/pky068. eCollection 2018 Oct.,,20190109,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Few studies have investigated how social and socioeconomic factors influence and modify school performance. This study investigates the hypothesis that social and parental socioeconomic factors influence ninth grade school performance in childhood leukemia and central nervous system (CNS) tumor survivors and that the effect is different from that in healthy peers. Methods: We analyzed data from nationwide Danish registers on school grades for children who finished ninth grade during 2002-2015 in Denmark. Using a unique within-school matched design, we compared grades from childhood cancer survivors with grades from healthy peers. Social factors were maternal/paternal civil status, immigrant status, and country of origin. Parental socioeconomic factors were measured by education and income. The study consisted of 36 426 children, of whom 460 and 289 were leukemia and CNS tumor survivors, respectively. Results: School grades varied considerably across social strata. However, the grades among CNS tumor survivors varied notably less in the following effect modifiers: parental educational attainment, income, and immigrant status. On the contrary, no significant effect modifiers were found among leukemia survivors as compared with healthy peers. Conclusion: There is a strong effect of social and parental socioeconomic factors on school performance in healthy adolescence in Denmark. The same pattern is seen in survivors of leukemia, but a different pattern is seen in survivors of CNS tumors. This finding suggests that impairment of school-related functions differ between leukemia and CNS tumor survivors. This study contributes to knowledge on learning in adolescence in childhood cancer survivors by investigating several social and socioeconomic effect modifiers with nationwide register data and a unique statistical method particularly suitable for comparing school grades. Improved insight could make it possible to identify high-risk groups that may need different means of help.","['Lindahl, Merete', 'Addington, Silas Victor', 'Winther, Jeanette Falck', 'Schmiegelow, Kjeld', 'Andersen, Klaus Kaae']","['Lindahl M', 'Addington SV', 'Winther JF', 'Schmiegelow K', 'Andersen KK']",,"['Unit of Statistics, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Unit of Statistics, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Unit of Cancer Survivorship, Childhood Cancer Survivorship, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Unit of Statistics, Danish Cancer Society Research Center, Strandboulevarden 49, 2100 Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,JNCI Cancer Spectr,JNCI cancer spectrum,101721827,,,,,PMC6649790,,,2018/04/25 00:00,2018/04/25 00:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2017/10/19 00:00 [received]', '2018/01/18 00:00 [revised]', '2018/02/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2018/04/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '2018/04/25 00:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/jncics/pky003 [doi]', 'pky003 [pii]']",epublish,JNCI Cancer Spectr. 2018 Apr 25;2(1):pky003. doi: 10.1093/jncics/pky003. eCollection 2018 Jan.,,20180425,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through characteristic angioinvasive growth, infections with mucor spores can occur as a pulmonary, rhinocerebral or cutaneous form. Infections mainly affect immunosuppressed patients with a history of uncontrolled diabetes or haematological malignancies, among others. Treatment is multimodal and requires an immediate combination of intravenous amphotericin B therapy and serial surgical debridements. Only a limited number of cases of cutaneous mucormycosis of the hand have been documented and described previously. Case presentation: We report a cutaneous mucormycosis in an elderly patient with a therapy-resistant acute myeloid leukaemia after a minor trauma on his right hand, sustained whilst gardening. The fungal infection was treated with serial radical debridements, vacuum-assisted negative-pressure wound closure technique and intravenous antifungals. Despite successful eradication of the fungal infection, a palliative open wound care concept was implemented during the terminal course of the patient's leukaemia. Conclusions: Cutaneous mucormycosis is a rare but fulminant fungal infection mostly affecting immunosuppressed patients. Survival is possible when diagnosed and treated early, yet mortality rates remain high.","['Maleitzke, Tazio', 'Stahnke, Katharina', 'Trampuz, Andrej', 'Mardian, Sven']","['Maleitzke T', 'Stahnke K', 'Trampuz A', 'Mardian S']",,"['Center for Musculoskeletal Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Julius Wolff Institute, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), 10178 Berlin, Germany.', 'Center for Musculoskeletal Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Center for Musculoskeletal Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.', 'Center for Musculoskeletal Surgery, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Augustenburger Platz 1, 13353 Berlin, Germany.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],Netherlands,Trauma Case Rep,Trauma case reports,101711730,,,,,PMC6637271,['NOTNLM'],"['Cutaneous mucormycosis', 'Fungal infection', 'Immunosuppression', 'Leukaemia', 'Mucorales']",2019/07/31 06:00,2019/07/31 06:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.tcr.2019.100221 [doi]', 'S2352-6440(19)30055-X [pii]', '100221 [pii]']",epublish,Trauma Case Rep. 2019 Jul 15;23:100221. doi: 10.1016/j.tcr.2019.100221. eCollection 2019 Oct.,,20190715,,,"['None of the authors (TM, KS, AT, SM) state any conflicts of interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we assess the effects of five polyphenols alone and in combination with three alkylating agents: cisplatin, cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil in lymphoid and myeloid leukaemia cells lines, and non-tumour control cells. In lymphoid leukaemia cell lines there was a synergistic reduction in ATP and glutathione levels, an induction of cell cycle arrest, DNA damage and apoptosis when quercetin, apigenin, emodin and rhein were combined with cisplatin and cyclophosphamide; and when apigenin and rhein were combined with chlorambucil. In myeloid leukaemia cells quercetin, apigenin and emodin showed a similar synergistic effect with all alkylating agents; however antagonistic effects were observed with some or all alkylating agents when combined with emodin, rhein and cis-stilbene. All synergistic effects were associated with reduced glutathione levels, DNA damage and apoptosis; whilst during antagonism the reverse effects were observed. The combination of alkylating agents, particularly cisplatin with polyphenols could be promising for the treatment of lymphoid leukaemias, with apigenin showing the greatest effects. Likewise in myeloid cells apigenin also synergised the action of all alkylating agents, suggesting that apigenin may also be beneficial in myeloid leukaemias.","['Mahbub, Amani A', 'Maitre, Christine L Le', 'Haywood-Small, Sarah', 'Cross, Neil A', 'Jordan-Mahy, Nicola']","['Mahbub AA', 'Maitre CLL', 'Haywood-Small S', 'Cross NA', 'Jordan-Mahy N']",,"['Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences, Laboratory Medicine Department, Umm Al Qura University, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Research Centre, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Research Centre, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Research Centre, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.', 'Biomolecular Sciences Research Centre, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncotarget,Oncotarget,101532965,,,,,PMC6642044,['NOTNLM'],"['chlorambucil', 'cisplatin', 'cyclophosphamide', 'leukaemia', 'polyphenols']",2019/07/31 06:00,2019/07/31 06:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.18632/oncotarget.27068 [doi]', '27068 [pii]']",epublish,Oncotarget. 2019 Jul 16;10(44):4570-4586. doi: 10.18632/oncotarget.27068. eCollection 2019 Jul 16.,,20190716,,,"['CONFLICTS OF INTEREST The authors declare that they have no conflicts of', 'interest.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assessments of cell cycle distribution, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were performed by flow cytometry. Constituents of DCB were isolated by column chromatography. Triterpenoid 1 and flavone 4 had cytotoxic effects towards the 9 tested cancer cell lines with IC50 values below 50 muM. The recorded IC50 values varied from 7.65 muM (towards multidrug-resistant CEM-ADR5000 leukemia cells) to 44.17 muM (against HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cells) for 1, 18.90 muM (CCRF-CEM leukemia cells) to 88.86 muM (against HCT116p53(+/+) colon adenocarcinoma cells) for 4, and 0.02 muM (against CCRF-CEM cells) to 122.96 muM (against CEM/ADR5000 cells) for doxorubicin. DCB induced apoptosis in CCRF-CEM cells mostly mediated by MMP alteration and enhanced ROS production; compound 1 induced apoptosis through caspases activation and MMP alteration and increased ROS production.

Although several studies have shown that TLX3 is aberrantly up-regulated in leukemia, its expression and function in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unknown. We found that TLX3 expression was decreased in 68/100 (68%) HCC cases and negatively correlated with the expression of p-STAT3, SNAI1, and Vimentin, while it was positively associated with E-cadherin expression. ITRAQ proteomic profiling revealed significantly less TLX3 expression in primary HCC tumors than in portal vein tumor thrombi. Comparison of Kaplan-Meier curves showed that down-regulation of TLX3 in HCC was associated with poor post-surgical survival. TLX3 over-expression inhibited HCC cell viability, proliferation, migration, invasion and enhanced 5-FU treatment, whereas silencing TLX3 produced the opposite results. Further experiments showed that TLX3 attenuated the EMT phenotype. In vivo experiments showed that knockdown of TLX3 promoted the growth of HCC xenografts and attenuated the anti-tumor effects of 5-FU treatment. Gene expression microarray analysis revealed that TLX3 inhibited IL-6/STAT3 signaling. In additional mechanistic studies TLX3 reversed the EMT phenotype of HCC cells by binding to STAT3, inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation, and down-regulating SNAI1 expression. Taken together, loss of expression of TLX3 induces EMT by enhancing IL-6/STAT3/SNAI1 signaling, and accelerates HCC progression while also attenuated the effect of 5-FU on HCCs.","['Wang, Cong', 'Dou, Changwei', 'Wang, Yufeng', 'Liu, Zhikui', 'Roberts, Lewis', 'Zheng, Xin']","['Wang C', 'Dou C', 'Wang Y', 'Liu Z', 'Roberts L', 'Zheng X']",,"[""Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China."", ""Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, Shaanxi 710061, China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Int J Biol Sci,International journal of biological sciences,101235568,"['0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (TLX3 protein, human)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Chromatin Immunoprecipitation', 'Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition/drug effects/genetics', 'Fluorouracil/*therapeutic use', 'HeLa Cells', 'Homeodomain Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunoprecipitation', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'Proteomics/methods', 'RNA Interference', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/genetics/*metabolism', 'Wound Healing/drug effects/genetics']",PMC6643223,['NOTNLM'],"['*EMT', '*HCC', '*SNAI1', '*STAT3', '*TLX3']",2019/07/31 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]']","['10.7150/ijbs.33844 [doi]', 'ijbsv15p1696 [pii]']",epublish,Int J Biol Sci. 2019 Jun 5;15(8):1696-1711. doi: 10.7150/ijbs.33844. eCollection 2019.,,20190605,,,['Competing Interests: The authors have declared that no competing interest exists.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identification of new prognostic genomic markers and incorporation of minimal residual diseases' assessment into therapeutic protocols have improved risk stratification and treatment strategies. The use of pediatric-inspired regimens for adolescent and young adults, and the advent of tyrosine kinase inhibitors and novel targeted therapies, including monoclonal antibodies and chimeric antigen receptor T cells, have redefined the therapeutic paradigm of ALL, and significantly improved the outcomes.

Its US Food and Drug Administration approval was based on results from long-term follow-up of the pivotal Phase II PACE trial, which demonstrated deep and durable molecular responses in the treated patients. Despite the remarkable responses, ponatinib has been associated with high frequency of severe vascular events, which led to its withdrawal from the market in 2013. Following analysis of the risk factors of patients who developed vascular side effects, ponatinib was reintroduced in the market 1 year later with specific dose-reduction recommendations and carrying a black box warning. Thus, careful patient selection with identification of patients whose potential benefit from ponatinib exceeds the potential risks associated with its use is crucial. Ongoing and future studies are focusing on earlier detection of mutations, strategies to minimize side effects, and potential expansion of the treatment indications.

They are rare (<15%) but are associated with a poor prognosis due to rapid organ dysfunction. To date, responses to high-dose chemotherapy, cladribine, and imatinib were revealed to be suboptimal with a median survival time of 24 months. Midostaurin is a potent multikinase inhibitor including the most frequent KIT D816V mutation (>80%). We herein present a review of the most recent data of the use of midostaurin in AdSM. First, a multicenter Phase II study (CPKC412D2213) revealed an unprecedented overall response rate (ORR) of 69% regardless of KIT mutational status, with 38% of major response (MR) among 26 AdSM patients treated with midostaurin alone 200 mg daily. Second, a sponsor-initiated, multicenter, single-arm open Phase II study (CPKC412D2201) confirmed a high and durable ORR of 60% including 45% of MR among 89 AdSM patients. Finally, a French compassionate use program managed by the French Reference Centre for Mastocytosis allowed the treatment of almost a hundred AdSM patients to date in France since the CPKC412D2201 study closure. The outcome of the first 28 treated patients under cover of this on-going procedure revealed an ORR of 71% including 57% of MR. Most importantly, survival analysis revealed in comparison to a historical control cohort of AdSM patients who did not receive midostaurin a twofold lower risk of death (p=0.02) in midostaurin-treated patients. Side effects revealed were acceptable and manageable (mostly digestive). Midostaurin appears to be an effective and safe treatment of AdSM. However, its effect on the course of the AHNMD is less clear. For the future, combined therapy (hypomethylating agents, cladribine, mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors, chemotherapy, and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation) may further improve long-term survival, particularly that of MCL and AdSM patients with AHNMD.","['Chandesris, Marie Olivia', 'Damaj, Gandhi', 'Lortholary, Olivier', 'Hermine, Olivier']","['Chandesris MO', 'Damaj G', 'Lortholary O', 'Hermine O']",,"['French Reference Center for Mastocytosis (CEREMAST), ohermine@gmail.com.', ""Department of Hematology, Necker Children's Hospital, APHP, ohermine@gmail.com."", 'Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris Descartes University, Imagine Institute, Paris, ohermine@gmail.com.', 'French Reference Center for Mastocytosis (CEREMAST), ohermine@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital, University of Basse Normandy, School of Medicine, Caen.', 'French Reference Center for Mastocytosis (CEREMAST), ohermine@gmail.com.', 'Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris Descartes University, Imagine Institute, Paris, ohermine@gmail.com.', ""Infectious Diseases Department, Necker Children's Hospital, APHP."", 'French Reference Center for Mastocytosis (CEREMAST), ohermine@gmail.com.', ""Department of Hematology, Necker Children's Hospital, APHP, ohermine@gmail.com."", 'Sorbonne Paris Cite, Paris Descartes University, Imagine Institute, Paris, ohermine@gmail.com.', 'INSERM U1163 and CNRS ERL 8654, Imagine Institute, Paris, France, ohermine@gmail.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Blood Lymphat Cancer,Blood and lymphatic cancer : targets and therapy,101596730,,,,,PMC6467340,['NOTNLM'],"['aggressive systemic mastocytosis', 'mast cell leukemia', 'midostaurin', 'tyrosine kinase inhibitor']",2017/05/03 00:00,2017/05/03 00:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2017/05/03 00:00 [pubmed]', '2017/05/03 00:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/BLCTT.S87186 [doi]', 'blctt-7-025 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Lymphat Cancer. 2017 May 3;7:25-35. doi: 10.2147/BLCTT.S87186. eCollection 2017.,,20170503,,,"['Disclosure Olivier Hermine declares research grants from Novartis, Celgene,', 'Hybrigenics, and Inatherys and is a founder, stockholder, and consultant and', 'received research grant from AB science.

This review summarizes the pathophysiology of PV, the challenges associated with traditional treatment options, and the scientific rationale and supportive clinical evidence for targeted therapy with ruxolitinib. Accumulating evidence indicates that activating mutations in JAK2 drive the PV disease state. Traditional PV treatment strategies, including aspirin, phlebotomy, and cytoreduc-tive agents such as hydroxyurea, provide clinical benefits for some but not all patients and may not adequately treat PV-related symptoms. Furthermore, traditional treatment approaches are associated with potential side effects that may limit their usage and lead some patients to discon-tinue the treatment. Ruxolitinib is an orally available small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is a potent and selective inhibitor of JAK1/JAK2. Ruxolitinib is approved in the US for patients with PV with an inadequate response or intolerance to hydroxyurea and in Europe for adults with PV who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. In the Phase III RESPONSE registration trial, ruxolitinib was superior to the best available therapy in patients with PV who were resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea in controlling hematocrit levels, reducing spleen volume, and improving PV-related symptoms and quality-of-life measures. The most common nonhematologic adverse events in ruxolitinib-treated patients were headache, diarrhea, pruritus, and fatigue in the RESPONSE trial; hematologic adverse events were primarily grade 1 or 2. In the Phase IIIb nonregistration RELIEF trial, there were nonsignificant trends toward an improved symptom control in patients with PV on a stable hydroxyurea dose who were generally well controlled but reported disease-associated symptoms and switched to ruxolitinib vs those who continued hydroxyurea therapy. Updated treatment guidelines will be important for educating physicians about the role of ruxolitinib in the treatment of patients with PV.","['Vaddi, Kris', 'Verstovsek, Srdan', 'Kiladjian, Jean-Jacques']","['Vaddi K', 'Verstovsek S', 'Kiladjian JJ']",,"['Drug Discovery, Incyte Corporation, Wilmington, DE, kvaddi@incyte.com.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Clinical Investigations Center, Hopital Saint-Louis et Universite Paris Diderot, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",New Zealand,Blood Lymphat Cancer,Blood and lymphatic cancer : targets and therapy,101596730,,,,,PMC6467337,['NOTNLM'],"['Janus kinase inhibitor', 'myeloproliferative disorder', 'polycythemia vera']",2016/05/12 00:00,2016/05/12 00:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2016/05/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '2016/05/12 00:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/BLCTT.S101185 [doi]', 'blctt-6-007 [pii]']",epublish,Blood Lymphat Cancer. 2016 May 12;6:7-19. doi: 10.2147/BLCTT.S101185. eCollection 2016.,,20160512,,,"['Disclosure KV is an employee of Incyte Corporation.

However, the accurate expression pattern, biological function and potential molecular mechanism of DLEU1 in glioma are not yet known. The present study investigated the role of DLEU in the development and progression of glioma, as well as the potential mechanism played by DLEU1 in glioma. Materials and methods: The levels of DLEUI in glioma tissues and cell lines were examined using quantitative real-time PCR. The potential effects of DLEU1 on the proliferation, mobility, invasion and apoptosis of glioma cells were evaluated using corresponding in vitro experiments. The association between DLEU1 and microRNA (miR)-421 was also determined using luciferase reporter activity and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. Results: The results revealed that DLEU1 was significantly upregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. Increased DLEU1 was positively associated with the high-grade carcinoma (III-IV). Functional studies revealed that knockdown of DLEU1 expression by siRNA led to decreased proliferation, migration and invasion and increased apoptosis in human glioma cells. Furthermore, luciferase reporter activity and RIP assays confirmed that DLEUI could act as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-421 that functioned as a tumor suppressor in glioma. Moreover, inhibition miR-421 partially restored the effect of DLEU1 knockdown on the glioma cells. DLEU1 could regulate myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D) expression, a known target of miR-421 in glioma cells. Conclusion: Taken together, these findings suggested that DLEU1 regulated MEF2D expression to promote glioma progression by sponging miR-421 and that DLEU1 might be a potential therapeutic target for glioma.","['Feng, Li', 'He, Mingyuan', 'Rao, Min', 'Diao, Jiandong', 'Zhu, Yonggang']","['Feng L', 'He M', 'Rao M', 'Diao J', 'Zhu Y']",,"[""Department of Radiotherapy, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Radiotherapy, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Gastroenterology, The First Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130021, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Oncology and Hematology, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Radiotherapy, China-Japan Union Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun 130033, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Retracted Publication']",New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,['Onco Targets Ther. 2021 Sep 09;14:4735-4736.

When it is over expressed it may lead to cancer development by three major ways; by inhibiting apoptosis, by promoting cell proliferation and also through promoting genomic instability. Expression in normal tissues is nearly undetectable. Recent improvements in the development of novel inhibitors of PIMs have been reviewed. Significant progress in the design of PIMs inhibitors, in which it displays selectivity versus other kinases, has been achieved within the last years. However, the development of isoform-selective PIM inhibitors is still an open task. As Pim-1 possesses oncogenic functions and is over expressed in various kinds of cancer diseases, its inhibition provides a new option in cancer therapy. A PubMed literature search was performed to review the currently available data on Pim-1 expression, regulation, and targets; its implication in different types of cancer and its impact on prognosis is described. Consequently, designing new inhibitors of PIMs is now a very active area of research in academic and industrial laboratories.","['Arrouchi, Housna', 'Lakhlili, Wiame', 'Ibrahimi, Azeddine']","['Arrouchi H', 'Lakhlili W', 'Ibrahimi A']",,"['Laboratory of Biotechnology (MedBiotech),Rabat Medical and Pharmacy School,Mohammed V University in Rabat, Rabat,Morocco.', 'Laboratory of Biotechnology (MedBiotech),Rabat Medical and Pharmacy School,Mohammed V University in Rabat, Rabat,Morocco.', 'Laboratory of Biotechnology (MedBiotech),Rabat Medical and Pharmacy School,Mohammed V University in Rabat, Rabat,Morocco.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Singapore,Bioinformation,Bioinformation,101258255,,,,,PMC6651028,['NOTNLM'],"['Pim-1 kinase', 'Small molecule inhibitors', 'Tumor']",2019/07/31 06:00,2019/07/31 06:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2018/12/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/01/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.6026/97320630015040 [doi]', '97320630015040 [pii]']",epublish,Bioinformation. 2019 Feb 3;15(1):40-45. doi: 10.6026/97320630015040. eCollection 2019.,,20190203,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and Methods: Sixty caregivers of patients with ALL were assessed on Family Burden Interview Schedule (FBI), Caregiver Strain Index, multidimensional aspect of perceived social support scale, Cognitive-Behavioral Avoidance Scale, ways of coping checklist, and General Health Questionnaire. Results: Caregivers of patients with ALL reported high caregiver burden (FBI objective burden score - 21.77; subjective burden score - 1.83). Among the domains of FBI, the highest burden was seen in the form of financial burden closely followed by disruption of family leisure. Caregivers of male patients and those belonging to higher socioeconomic status reported higher level of objective burden. Caregiver burden was higher among caregivers who reported lower perceived social support, who more often used avoidance and escape as coping and less often used planful problem solving. Higher caregiver burden is associated with higher psychological morbidity. Conclusion: Caregivers of patients with ALL experience high level of caregiver burden and it is associated with lower social support and more often use maladaptive coping strategies.","['Kumari, Rina', 'Kohli, Adarsh', 'Malhotra, Pankaj', 'Grover, Sandeep', 'Khadwal, Alka']","['Kumari R', 'Kohli A', 'Malhotra P', 'Grover S', 'Khadwal A']",,"['Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Psychiatry, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.', 'Department of Hematology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh, India.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,Ind Psychiatry J,Industrial psychiatry journal,101547239,,,,,PMC6592200,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'burden', 'caregivers', 'correlates']",2019/07/31 06:00,2019/07/31 06:01,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/31 06:01 [medline]']","['10.4103/ipj.ipj_75_18 [doi]', 'IPJ-27-249 [pii]']",ppublish,Ind Psychiatry J. 2018 Jul-Dec;27(2):249-258. doi: 10.4103/ipj.ipj_75_18.,,,,,['There are no conflicts of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pleural effusion is a frequent side effect in patients during dasatinib treatment. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare and life-threatening adverse event of dasatinib. The relationship between dasatinib and autoimmune disorders is unclear, but there are reports of possible mechanisms that have triggered autoimmunity by dasatinib. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old male was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia and initiated imatinib mesylate as a treatment. Imatinib was changed to dasatinib as the patient was unresponsive in the first year of treatment. In the fourth year of dasatinib when chronic myeloid leukemia was in both hematological and cytogenetical remission, the patient presented with bilateral massive exudative pleural effusion. Echocardiography was consistent with pericardial effusion with right ventricle enlargement and normal left-side cardiac function. Pulmonary arterial hypertension was diagnosed with high systolic pulmonary arterial pressure. When he had fever and arthralgia, further investigation showed positivity of anti-nuclear antibodies (1/160 titer) and anti-RNP/Sm, which have high specificity for the diagnosis of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). MANAGEMENT AND OUTCOME: Dasatinib was discontinued and nilotinib was initiated. As the pleural effusion persisted despite diuretics and methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil was initiated as a steroid-sparing immune-suppressive agent. The lupus-like symptoms disappeared, and antibodies became undetectable after dasatinib discontinuation. Pericardial effusion improved and pleural effusion did not relapse. DISCUSSION: Screening for auto-antibodies may be recommended for patients with a history or symptoms of autoimmune disease before starting dasatinib. All patients who develop pleural effusion while on dasatinib treatment should be investigated for antibodies for lupus.","['Maral, Senem', 'Bakanay, Sule Mine', 'Kucuksahin, Orhan', 'Dilek, Imdat']","['Maral S', 'Bakanay SM', 'Kucuksahin O', 'Dilek I']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4766-1861'],"['Department of Hematology, Diskapi Yildirim Beyazit Research and Training Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Ataturk Research and Training Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Rheumatology, Ataturk Research and Training Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.', 'Department of Hematology, Ataturk Research and Training Hospital, Ankara, Turkey.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Oncol Pharm Pract,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,9511372,"['0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)', 'RBZ1571X5H (Dasatinib)']",IM,,"['Dasatinib/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Echocardiography', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*chemically induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pericardial Effusion/chemically induced', 'Pleural Effusion/chemically induced', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/administration & dosage']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Dasatinib', 'lupus', 'pleural effusion', 'pulmonary arterial hypertension']",2019/07/31 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1078155219863469 [doi]'],ppublish,J Oncol Pharm Pract. 2020 Apr;26(3):738-741. doi: 10.1177/1078155219863469.

CD34~+CD38~- leukemia stem cells(CD34~+CD38~-LSCs) was isolated by magnetic cell sorting(MACS) and divided into two groups. The control group cells were routinely cultured, 40 mumol.L~(-1) ginsenoside Rg_1 was added to the control group for co-culture in Rg_1 group. The effect of Rg_l to induce CD34~+CD38~-LSCs senescence were evaluated by senescence-associated beta-Galactosidase(SA-beta-Gal) staining, cell cycle assay, CCK-8 and Colony-Assay. The expression of senescence associated SIRT1, TSC_2 mRNA and protein was examined by Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR(FQ-PCR) and Western blot. The results showed that the CD34~+CD38~-LSCs could effectively be isolated by MACS, and the purity of CD34~+CD38~-LSCs is up to(95.86+/-3.04)%. Compared with the control group, the percentage of positive cells expressed SA-beta-Gal in the Rg_1 group is increased, the senescence morphological changes were observed in the CD34~+CD38~-LSCs in the Rg_1 group. The proliferation inhibition rate and the number of cells entered G_0/G_1 phase in the Rg_1 group were increased, but the colony-formed ability was decreased, Rg_1 could significantly inhibit the proliferation and self-renewal ability of CD34~+CD38~-LSCs. The expression of SIRT1 and TSC_2 mRNA and protein were down regulated in the Rg_1 group compared with the control group. Our research implied that Rg_1 may induce the senescence of CD34~+CD38~-LSCs and SIRT1/TSC_2 signal axis plays a significant role in this process.","['Tang, Yan-Long', 'Zhou, Yue', 'Zhang, Cheng-Gui', 'Liu, Heng', 'Wang, Ya-Ping', 'Li, Yuan', 'Han, Yan-Jun', 'Wang, Cui-Li']","['Tang YL', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhang CG', 'Liu H', 'Wang YP', 'Li Y', 'Han YJ', 'Wang CL']",,"['the First Affiliated Hospital of Dali University Dali 671000, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Dali University, Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Entomological Biopharmaceutical R&D Dali 671000, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Dali University, Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Entomological Biopharmaceutical R&D Dali 671000, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Dali University, Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Entomological Biopharmaceutical R&D Dali 671000, China.', 'Laboratory of Stem Cell and Tissue Engineering, Department of Histology and Embryology, Chongqing Medical University Chongqing 400016, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Dali University, Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Entomological Biopharmaceutical R&D Dali 671000, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Dali University, Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Entomological Biopharmaceutical R&D Dali 671000, China.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Dali University, Yunnan Provincial Key Laboratory of Entomological Biopharmaceutical R&D Dali 671000, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi,Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica,8913656,"['0 (Ginsenosides)', '0 (TSC2 protein, human)', '0 (Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (SIRT1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (Sirtuin 1)', 'PJ788634QY (ginsenoside Rg1)']",IM,,"['Cellular Senescence/*drug effects', 'Ginsenosides/*pharmacology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', '*Signal Transduction', 'Sirtuin 1/*metabolism', 'Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 Protein/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CD34~+CD38~-LSCs', 'SIRT1', 'TSC_2', 'ginsenoside Rg_1', 'senescence']",2019/07/31 06:00,2019/09/17 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/17 06:00 [medline]']",['10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190218.002 [doi]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Zhong Yao Za Zhi. 2019 Jun;44(11):2348-2352. doi: 10.19540/j.cnki.cjcmm.20190218.002.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Within a target cell, retinoids regulate gene expression by activating the retinoid acid receptors (RAR) and retinoid x receptors (RXR), which are ligand-dependent transcription factors. Besides its therapeutic use in dermatological disorders, all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is successfully utilized to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) patients. The use of ATRA in APL patients is the first example of clinically useful differentiation therapy. Therapeutic strategies aiming at cancer cell differentiation have great potential for solid tumors, including breast cancer. The few clinical studies conducted with ATRA in breast cancer are rather disappointing. However, these studies did not take into account the heterogeneity of the disease and were conducted on unselected cohorts of patients.We recently showed that ATRA treatment of breast cancer cells induces autophagy, a highly conserved process aiming at degrading and recycling superfluous or harmful cellular components. In addition, autophagy inhibition significantly increases the therapeutic activity of ATRA. This finding is of fundamental importance, since autophagy has a dual role in cancer. Whereas autophagy may be a protective mechanism during the initial phases of cancer development, it may support cancer cell survival in already established tumors. Furthermore, autophagy can lower or enhance therapeutic efficiency, depending on the tumor type and the anticancer agent considered. Therefore, it is important to investigate the role of autophagy in the context of specific tumors and therapeutic approaches. Accurate autophagy studies are challenging given the dynamic nature of the process and the difficulty of measuring the rate of autophagosome degradation (autophagic flux). In this chapter, we provide protocols for a careful assessment of the autophagic flux in ATRA treated 2D and 3D breast cancer cultures.","['Parejo, Sarah', 'Tschan, Mario P', 'Muraro, Manuele G', 'Garattini, Enrico', 'Spagnoli, Giulio C', 'Schlafli, Anna M']","['Parejo S', 'Tschan MP', 'Muraro MG', 'Garattini E', 'Spagnoli GC', 'Schlafli AM']",,"['Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Graduate School for Cellular and Biomedical Sciences, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri IRCCS, Milan, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine, University of Basel and University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'National Research Council, Institute of Translational Pharmacology, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Experimental Pathology, Institute of Pathology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. anna.schlaefli@pathology.unibe.ch.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Methods Mol Biol,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",9214969,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Autophagy/*drug effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Separation', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ATRA', '*Autophagic flux', '*Autophagy', '*Bioreactor', '*Breast cancer', '*Immunofluorescence', '*Retinoids', '*Western blot', '*mCherry-eGFP-LC3B']",2019/07/31 06:00,2020/03/31 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/31 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-1-4939-9585-1_17 [doi]'],ppublish,Methods Mol Biol. 2019;2019:237-256. doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-9585-1_17.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In essence, leukemic cells fail to differentiate and are stalled at a particular step of hematopoietic maturation and are unable to complete their development into functional blood cells with a finite life cycle. They are thus said to possess a ""differentiation block."" Pharmacological override of this block is one attractive avenue of therapy, termed ""differentiation therapy."" The most successful example of this therapeutic strategy is the use of the physiologic retinoid all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). In this chapter, we will outline the methods used to characterize the mechanisms mobilized by retinoid signaling and will use the activation of a key regulator of autophagy, ATG7, as an example of the functional characterization of a retinoid regulated gene during differentiation. We will discuss how lentiviral delivery of shRNA constructs into cultured APL cells, such as NB4, can be used to functionally deplete key proteins. We will also describe how the effect of protein knockdown on ATRA-induced differentiation and autophagy can be assessed using quantitative PCR, Western blotting, and flow cytometry.","['Orfali, Nina', 'Jeyapalan, Jennie N', 'Woodcock, Corinne L', ""O'Donovan, Tracey R"", 'Benjamin, Dalyia', 'Cahill, Mary', 'McKenna, Sharon', 'Gudas, Lorraine J', 'Mongan, Nigel P']","['Orfali N', 'Jeyapalan JN', 'Woodcock CL', ""O'Donovan TR"", 'Benjamin D', 'Cahill M', 'McKenna S', 'Gudas LJ', 'Mongan NP']",,"['Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cork Cancer Research Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine and Science, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK.', 'Cork Cancer Research Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Cork Cancer Research Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Cork Cancer Research Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Haematology, Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland.', 'Cork Cancer Research Centre, University College Cork, Cork, Ireland.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA.

We investigated the association between serum ferritin levels at diagnosis and the prognoses of Japanese MDS patients with bone marrow blasts < 5% and peripheral blood blasts < 2%. Three hundred and ninety patients with cytopenia were registered prospectively in the multicenter database, among whom 107 patients with MDS (72 males and 35 females, with a median age of 70 years) met the eligibility criteria. The median serum ferritin level at diagnosis was 204 ng/mL; we divided the cohort into low (n = 56) and high (n = 51) ferritin groups using a cutoff of 210 ng/mL. Kaplan-Meier analyses revealed that the 3-year overall survival (OS) of the high ferritin group was significantly shorter than that of the low ferritin group (66% and 79%, respectively). The cumulative incidences of leukemic progression were similar between the groups. On multivariate analysis, age, blast percentage, cytogenetic abnormalities, and serum ferritin levels at diagnosis were independently associated with OS in our patients. Thus, modest elevations of ferritin levels at diagnosis may influence the prognoses of patients with MDS who have low blast counts.","['Kawabata, Hiroshi', 'Usuki, Kensuke', 'Shindo-Ueda, Maki', 'Kanda, Junya', 'Tohyama, Kaoru', 'Matsuda, Akira', 'Araseki, Kayano', 'Hata, Tomoko', 'Suzuki, Takahiro', 'Kayano, Hidekazu', 'Shimbo, Kei', 'Chiba, Shigeru', 'Ishikawa, Takayuki', 'Arima, Nobuyoshi', 'Nohgawa, Masaharu', 'Miyazaki, Yasushi', 'Kurokawa, Mineo', 'Arai, Shunya', 'Mitani, Kinuko', 'Takaori-Kondo, Akifumi']","['Kawabata H', 'Usuki K', 'Shindo-Ueda M', 'Kanda J', 'Tohyama K', 'Matsuda A', 'Araseki K', 'Hata T', 'Suzuki T', 'Kayano H', 'Shimbo K', 'Chiba S', 'Ishikawa T', 'Arima N', 'Nohgawa M', 'Miyazaki Y', 'Kurokawa M', 'Arai S', 'Mitani K', 'Takaori-Kondo A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1918-8635'],"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan. hkawabat@kanazawa-med.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology and Immunology, Kanazawa Medical University, 1-1 Daigaku, Uchinada, Ishikawa-ken, 920-0293, Japan. hkawabat@kanazawa-med.ac.jp.', 'Department of Hematology, NTT Medical Center Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Kawasaki Medical School, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Hemato-Oncology, International Medical Center, Saitama Medical University, Hidaka, Saitama, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Saitama Medical University, Moroyama, Saitama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusha Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kitasato University School of Medicine, Sagamihara, Kanagawa, Japan.', 'School of Medical Technology, Faculty of Health and Medical Care, Saitama Medical University, Hidaka, Saitama, Japan.', 'Clinical Laboratory Center, Dokkyo Medical University Hospital, Mibu, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Medical Research Institute Kitano Hospital, Osaka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Japanese Red Cross Wakayama Medical Center, Wakayama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Atomic Bomb Disease and Hibakusha Medicine Unit, Atomic Bomb Disease Institute, Nagasaki University, Nagasaki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Tokyo Metropolitan Police Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Dokkyo Medical University School of Medicine, Mibu, Tochigi, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,['9007-73-2 (Ferritins)'],IM,,"['Aged', 'Blast Crisis/pathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Ferritins/*blood', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Male', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/diagnosis/*mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Ferritin', 'Iron overload', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Prognosis']",2019/07/31 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/04/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02710-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02710-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Nov;110(5):533-542. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02710-1.

In this article, we will provide an overview over the role PI3-kinase signalling, one of the most important dysregulated pathways in cancer, and its successful inhibition in lymphoma. RECENT FINDINGS: PI3-kinase inhibitors have shown remarkable activity in an increasing subset of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The first drug to be approved was idelalisib for patients with relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma and CLL/SLL as monotherapy, or in combination with rituximab, respectively. After an initial setback related to increased toxicity including deaths observed in several upfront studies, there has been a resurgence in interest in this pathway following the promising efficacy of second-generation PI3K inhibitors including in patients with T cell lymphomas. PI3K inhibition continues to be an invaluable tool in the therapy of patients with lymphoid malignancies if managed cautiously. Preclinical models are helpful in predicting possible side effects and identifying new lymphoma subtypes that may be susceptible to this class of agents. The future will likely involve rationally designed combinatorial approaches to deepen the response rate and prevent the emergence of resistance.","['von Keudell, Gottfried', 'Moskowitz, Alison J']","['von Keudell G', 'Moskowitz AJ']",,"['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Lymphoma Service, New York, NY, USA.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, Lymphoma Service, New York, NY, USA. moskowia@mskcc.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/*metabolism', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/etiology/*metabolism', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy/methods', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/*metabolism', 'Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell receptor', '*CLL', '*Follicular lymphoma', '*Lymphoma', '*PI3-kinase', '*T cell lymphoma', '*Tumor microenvironment']",2019/07/31 06:00,2020/07/31 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s11899-019-00540-w [doi]', '10.1007/s11899-019-00540-w [pii]']",ppublish,Curr Hematol Malig Rep. 2019 Oct;14(5):405-413. doi: 10.1007/s11899-019-00540-w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Indeed, elotuzumab, an anti-SLAMF7 antibody, is used for the treatment of MM in combination with immunomodulatory drugs. SLAMF7 is cleaved via unknown mechanisms and detected as a soluble form (sSLAMF7) exclusively in the serum of MM patients; however, little is known about the role of sSLAMF7 in MM biology. In this study, we found that sSLAMF7 enhanced the growth of MM cells via homophilic interaction with surface SLAMF7 and subsequent activation of the SHP-2 and ERK signaling pathways. Elotuzumab suppressed sSLAMF7-induced MM cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Promoter analyses identified IKZF1 (Ikaros) as a pivotal transcriptional activator of the SLAMF7 gene. Pharmacological targeting of Ikaros by lenalidomide and its analog pomalidomide downregulated SLAMF7 expression and ameliorated the response of MM cells to sSLAMF7. Elotuzumab blocked the growth-promoting function of sSLAMF7 when combined with lenalidomide in a murine xenograft model. Neutralization of sSLAMF7 is a novel antimyeloma mechanism of elotuzumab, which is enhanced by immunomodulatory drugs via downregulation of surface SLAMF7 expression on MM cells. These findings may provide important information for the optimal use of elotuzumab in MM treatment.","['Kikuchi, Jiro', 'Hori, Mitsuo', 'Iha, Hidekatsu', 'Toyama-Sorimachi, Noriko', 'Hagiwara, Shotaro', 'Kuroda, Yoshiaki', 'Koyama, Daisuke', 'Izumi, Tohru', 'Yasui, Hiroshi', 'Suzuki, Atsushi', 'Furukawa, Yusuke']","['Kikuchi J', 'Hori M', 'Iha H', 'Toyama-Sorimachi N', 'Hagiwara S', 'Kuroda Y', 'Koyama D', 'Izumi T', 'Yasui H', 'Suzuki A', 'Furukawa Y']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0999-5636', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0905-6855', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7249-6418']","['Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Ibaraki Prefectural Central Hospital, Kasama, Ibaraki, 309-1793, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Oita University Faculty of Medicine, Yufu, Oita, 879-5593, Japan.', 'Department of Molecular Immunology and Inflammation, Research Institute, National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8655, Japan.', ""Department of Hematology, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Shinjuku, Tokyo, 162-8666, Japan."", 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan.', 'Division of Hematology, Tochigi Cancer Center, Utsunomiya, Tochigi, 320-0834, Japan.', 'The Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Minato, Tokyo, 108-8639, Japan.', 'Oncology Division, Bristol-Myers Squibb K.K., Shinjuku, Tokyo, 163-1327, Japan.', 'Division of Stem Cell Regulation, Center for Molecular Medicine, Jichi Medical University, Shimotsuke, Tochigi, 329-0498, Japan. furuyu@jichi.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized)', '0 (SLAMF7 protein, human)', '0 (Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family)', '1351PE5UGS (elotuzumab)', '4Z8R6ORS6L (Thalidomide)', 'D2UX06XLB5 (pomalidomide)', 'F0P408N6V4 (Lenalidomide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized/pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/physiology', 'Humans', 'Lenalidomide/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Multiple Myeloma/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family/*metabolism', 'Thalidomide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,2019/07/31 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2018/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0525-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0525-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jan;34(1):180-195. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0525-6.

CD44 is the most important HA receptor, and both have been associated with poor prognosis in cancer. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase (Breakpoint Cluster Region - Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog1, BCR-ABL). It is mainly treated with BCR-ABL inhibitors, such as imatinib. However, the selection of resistant cells leads to treatment failure. The aim of this work was to determine the capacity of HA (high molecular weight) to counteract the effect of imatinib in human CML cell lines (K562 and Kv562). We demonstrated that imatinib decreased HA levels and the surface expression of CD44 in both cell lines. Furthermore, HA abrogated the anti-proliferative and pro-senescent effect of Imatinib without modifying the imatinib-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the inhibition of HA synthesis with 4-methylumbelliferone enhanced the anti-proliferative effect of imatinib. These results suggest that Imatinib-induced senescence would depend on the reduction in HA levels, describing, for the first time, the role of HA in the development of resistance to imatinib. These findings show that low levels of HA are crucial for an effective therapy with imatinib in CML.","['Lompardia, Silvina', 'Diaz, Mariangeles', 'Pibuel, Matias', 'Papademetrio, Daniela', 'Poodts, Daniela', 'Mihalez, Cintia', 'Alvarez, Elida', 'Hajos, Silvia']","['Lompardia S', 'Diaz M', 'Pibuel M', 'Papademetrio D', 'Poodts D', 'Mihalez C', 'Alvarez E', 'Hajos S']",,"['Universidad de Buenos Aires.

Intrinsic apoptosis signaling is regulated by different proapoptotic and antiapoptotic molecules: proapoptotic BCL-2 homology domain 3 (BH3) proteins activate prodeath molecules leading to cellular death, while antiapoptotic molecules including B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) prevent activation of prodeath proteins and counter-regulate apoptosis induction. Inhibition of these antiapoptotic regulators has become a promising strategy for anticancer treatment, but variable anticancer activities in different malignancies indicate the need for upfront identification of responsive patients. Here, we investigated the activity of the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN, ABT-199) in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia and found heterogeneous sensitivities in BCP-ALL cell lines and in a series of patient-derived primografts. To identify parameters of sensitivity and resistance, we evaluated genetic aberrations, gene-expression profiles, expression levels of apoptosis regulators, and functional apoptosis parameters analyzed by mitochondrial profiling using recombinant BH3-like peptides. Importantly, ex vivo VEN sensitivity was most accurately associated with functional BCL-2 dependence detected by BH3 profiling. Modeling clinical application of VEN in a preclinical trial in a set of individual ALL primografts, we identified that leukemia-free survival of VEN treated mice was precisely determined by functional BCL-2 dependence. Moreover, the predictive value of ex vivo measured functional BCL-2 dependence for preclinical in vivo VEN response was confirmed in an independent set of primograft ALL including T- and high risk-ALL. Thus, integrative analysis of the apoptosis signaling indicating mitochondrial addiction to BCL-2 accurately predicts antileukemia activity of VEN, robustly identifies VEN-responsive patients, and provides information for stratification and clinical guidance in future clinical applications of VEN in patients with ALL.","['Seyfried, Felix', 'Demir, Salih', 'Horl, Rebecca Louise', 'Stirnweiss, Felix Uli', 'Ryan, Jeremy', 'Scheffold, Annika', 'Villalobos-Ortiz, Mariana', 'Boldrin, Elena', 'Zinngrebe, Julia', 'Enzenmuller, Stefanie', 'Jenni, Silvia', 'Tsai, Yi-Chien', 'Bornhauser, Beat', 'Furstberger, Axel', 'Kraus, Johann Michael', 'Kestler, Hans Armin', 'Bourquin, Jean-Pierre', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Letai, Anthony', 'Debatin, Klaus-Michael', 'Meyer, Luder Hinrich']","['Seyfried F', 'Demir S', 'Horl RL', 'Stirnweiss FU', 'Ryan J', 'Scheffold A', 'Villalobos-Ortiz M', 'Boldrin E', 'Zinngrebe J', 'Enzenmuller S', 'Jenni S', 'Tsai YC', 'Bornhauser B', 'Furstberger A', 'Kraus JM', 'Kestler HA', 'Bourquin JP', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Letai A', 'Debatin KM', 'Meyer LH']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3327-1283'],"['Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'International Graduate School of Molecular Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'International Graduate School of Molecular Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'International Graduate School of Molecular Medicine, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Systems Biology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', ""Department of Oncology and Children's Research Center, University Children's Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland."", 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Ulm University Medical Center, Ulm, Germany. lueder-hinrich.meyer@uniklinik-ulm.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Death Dis,Cell death & disease,101524092,"['0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'B-Lymphocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'BH3 Interacting Domain Death Agonist Protein/genetics', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Sulfonamides/*pharmacology']",PMC6662703,,,2019/07/31 06:00,2020/07/31 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/31 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41419-019-1801-0 [doi]', '10.1038/s41419-019-1801-0 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Death Dis. 2019 Jul 29;10(8):571. doi: 10.1038/s41419-019-1801-0.,,20190729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recently, recurrent mutations in NT5C2 were identified as a common genomic lesion unique in relapsed ALL and were linked to acquired thiopurine resistance. However, molecular mechanisms by which NT5C2 regulates thiopurine cytotoxicity were incompletely understood. To this end, we sought to comprehensively characterize the biochemical and cellular effects of NT5C2 mutations. Compared with wild-type NT5C2, mutant proteins showed elevated 5'-nucleotidase activity with a stark preference of thiopurine metabolites over endogenous purine nucleotides, suggesting neomorphic effects specific to thiopurine metabolism. Expression of mutant NT5C2 mutations also significantly reduced thiopurine uptake in vitro with concomitant increase in efflux of 6-mercaptopurine (MP) metabolites, plausibly via indirect effects on drug transporter pathways. Finally, intracellular metabolomic profiling revealed significant shifts in nucleotide homeostasis induced by mutant NT5C2 at baseline; MP treatment also resulted in global changes in metabolomic profiles with completely divergent effects in cells with mutant versus wild-type NT5C2. Collectively, our data indicated that NT5C2 mutations alter thiopurine metabolism and cellular disposition, but also influence endogenous nucleotide homeostasis and thiopurine-induced metabolomic response. These complex mechanisms contributed to NT5C2-mediated drug resistance in ALL and pointed to potential opportunities for therapeutic targeting in relapsed ALL.","['Moriyama, Takaya', 'Liu, Shuguang', 'Li, Jing', 'Meyer, Julia', 'Zhao, Xujie', 'Yang, Wentao', 'Shao, Youming', 'Heath, Richard', 'Hnizda, Ales', 'Carroll, William L', 'Yang, Jun J']","['Moriyama T', 'Liu S', 'Li J', 'Meyer J', 'Zhao X', 'Yang W', 'Shao Y', 'Heath R', 'Hnizda A', 'Carroll WL', 'Yang JJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0369-4744'],"[""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee. takaya.moriyama@stjude.org jun.yang@stjude.org."", ""Hematology Oncology Center, Beijing Children's Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."", 'Department of Oncology, Pharmacology Core, Karmanos Cancer Institute, Wayne State University School of Medicine, Detroit, Michigan.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Protein Production Center, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", ""Protein Production Center, St. Jude Children's Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee."", 'Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic.', 'New York University Cancer Institute, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pediatrics, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, New York.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee. takaya.moriyama@stjude.org jun.yang@stjude.org."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cancer Ther,Molecular cancer therapeutics,101132535,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', ""EC 3.1.3.5 (5'-Nucleotidase)"", 'EC 3.1.3.5 (NT5C2 protein, human)']",IM,,"[""5'-Nucleotidase/*metabolism"", 'Cell Line, Tumor', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Mercaptopurine/chemistry/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Metabolomics', 'Models, Biological', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/*enzymology/pathology']",PMC6774896,,,2019/07/31 06:00,2020/06/10 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2018/09/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['1535-7163.MCT-18-1112 [pii]', '10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-1112 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cancer Ther. 2019 Oct;18(10):1887-1895. doi: 10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-18-1112.

We therefore evaluated this question within the Childhood Leukemia International Consortium. METHODS: We pooled 11 case-control studies including 9723 childhood leukaemia cases and 17 099 controls. Parental occupational ELF-MF exposure was estimated by linking jobs to an ELF-MF job-exposure matrix (JEM). Logistic regression models were used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs in pooled analyses and meta-analyses. RESULTS: ORs from pooled analyses for paternal ELF-MF exposure >0.2 microtesla (microT) at conception were 1.04 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.13) for ALL and 1.06 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.29) for AML, compared with </=0.2 microT. Corresponding ORs for maternal ELF-MF exposure during pregnancy were 1.00 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.12) for ALL and 0.85 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.16) for AML.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Multiple myeloma lines were exposed to varying THZ1 concentrations alone or with carfilzomib or ABT-199, after which apoptosis was monitored by flow cytometry, protein expression by Western blot analysis, mRNA by RT-PCR. Analogous studies were performed in cells ectopically expressing c-MYC, MCL-1, or BCL-XL, or CRISPER-Cas CDK7 sgRNA knockout. Primary multiple myeloma cells were exposed to THZ1 +/- carfilzomib or ABT-199. In vivo effects of THZ1 were examined in a systemic U266 xenograft model. RESULTS: THZ1 markedly diminished multiple myeloma cell proliferation and survival despite bortezomib or stromal cell resistance in association with G2-M arrest, inactivation of CTD RNA Pol II, dephosphorylation of CDKs 7 as well as 1, 2, and 9, and MCL-1, BCL-xL, and c-MYC mRNA or protein downregulation. Ectopic MCL-1, c-MYC, or BCL-XL expression significantly protected cells from THZ1 lethality. Both THZ1 and CRISPR-Cas CDK7 knockout sharply diminished multiple myeloma cell proliferation and significantly increased carfilzomib and ABT-199 lethality. Parallel effects and interactions were observed in primary CD138(+) (N = 22) or primitive multiple myeloma cells (CD138(-)/CD19(+)/CD20(+)/CD27(+); N = 16). THZ1 administration [10 mg/kg i.p. twice daily (BID), 5 days/week] significantly improved survival in a systemic multiple myeloma xenograft model with minimal toxicity and induced similar events observed in vitro, for example, MCL-1 and c-MYC downregulation. CONCLUSIONS: THZ1 potently reduces multiple myeloma cell proliferation through transcriptional downregulation of MCL-1, BCL-XL, and c-MYC in vitro and in vivo. It warrants further attention as a therapeutic agent in multiple myeloma.","['Zhang, Yu', 'Zhou, Liang', 'Bandyopadhyay, Dipankar', 'Sharma, Kanika', 'Allen, Alexander Joseph', 'Kmieciak, Maciej', 'Grant, Steven']","['Zhang Y', 'Zhou L', 'Bandyopadhyay D', 'Sharma K', 'Allen AJ', 'Kmieciak M', 'Grant S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-4452-9320'],"['Division of Hematology/Oncology and Palliative Care, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology and Palliative Care, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Massey Cancer Center, School of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology and Palliative Care, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology and Palliative Care, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia.', 'Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, Virginia.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology and Palliative Care, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, Virginia. stgrant@vcu.edu.', 'Massey Cancer Center, Richmond, Virginia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (BCL2L1 protein, human)', '0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MYC protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Phenylenediamines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (THZ1 compound)', '0 (bcl-X Protein)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects/genetics', 'Bortezomib/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects/genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockout Techniques', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Phenylenediamines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'bcl-X Protein/genetics']",PMC6801078,,,2019/07/31 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2018/11/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-18-3788 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3788 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Oct 15;25(20):6195-6205. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-18-3788.

Recent studies have reported that chemoresistant cells have an increased oxidative state in hematologic malignancies. In this study, we demonstrated that chemoresistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells had a lower level of mitochondrial and cytosolic ROS in response to cytarabine (AraC) and overexpressed myeloperoxidase (MPO), a heme protein that converts hydrogen peroxide to hypochlorous acid (HOCl), compared with sensitive AML cells. High MPO-expressing AML cells were less sensitive to AraC in vitro and in vivo. They also produced higher levels of HOCl and exhibited an increased rate of mitochondrial oxygen consumption when compared with low MPO-expressing AML cells. Targeting MPO expression or enzyme activity sensitized AML cells to AraC treatment by triggering oxidative damage and sustaining oxidative stress, particularly in high MPO-expressing AML cells. This sensitization stemmed from mitochondrial superoxide accumulation, which impaired oxidative phosphorylation and cellular energetic balance, driving apoptotic death and selective eradication of chemoresistant AML cells in vitro and in vivo. Altogether, this study uncovers a noncanonical function of MPO enzyme in maintaining redox balance and mitochondrial energetic metabolism, therefore affecting downstream pathways involved in AML chemoresistance. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings demonstrate the role of myeloperoxidase in the regulation of ROS levels and sensitivity of AML cells to cytarabine, an essential chemotherapeutic backbone in the therapy of AML.","['Hosseini, Mohsen', 'Rezvani, Hamid Reza', 'Aroua, Nesrine', 'Bosc, Claudie', 'Farge, Thomas', 'Saland, Estelle', 'Guyonnet-Duperat, Veronique', 'Zaghdoudi, Sonia', 'Jarrou, Latifa',

RESULTS: 265 nurses from 21 countries responded, the majority being Staff Nurses (37.7%), with >5 years experience in haematology (77.3%) and educated to degree level or above (66.0%). The top 5 educational priorities were disease specific information for lymphoma, disease specific information for leukaemia, management of long-term side effects, understanding the immune system and new treatments in haematology. Demographic variables such as length of experience and patient group cared for influenced some educational priorities. Attending educational conferences was the preferred learning method.

METHODS: Explorative semi-structured individual interviews were carried out in patients with AL (n=18) four to sixteen weeks post diagnosis. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative interview data. RESULTS: Identified themes were 1) Jolted by the diagnosis, and subtheme Loss of personal autonomy; 2) Restoring normality in everyday life, and subtheme Facing a new social identity; and 3) A lifeline of hope. Being newly diagnosed with AL was experienced as traumatic, which negatively affected personal autonomy and everyday life. There was a pressing need to restore a sense of normality in everyday life while managing a new social identity as a cancer patient. Social support from family, friends and other patients were invaluable and experienced as an important lifeline. CONCLUSION: Receiving a life threatening diagnose and undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment had a negative impact on everyday life which required re-establishing daily life activities. This increased the need for social support which had a distinct role in facilitating the patients' coping strategy. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: It is important to support and strengthen the patient's social network from the time of diagnosis. Future studies should examine the feasibility and benefit of experienced-based social support from peers (former patients) to patients with AL.","['Norskov, Kristina Holmegaard', 'Overgaard, Dorthe', 'Lomborg, Kirsten', 'Kjeldsen, Lars', 'Jarden, Mary']","['Norskov KH', 'Overgaard D', 'Lomborg K', 'Kjeldsen L', 'Jarden M']",,"['Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet, Blegdamsvej 9, 2100, Copenhagen O, Copenhagen University Hospital, Denmark.

METHODS: Evaluation experiments of effects of HDAC1 on drug resistance of AML cells were performed with AML cell transfected with constructs overexpressing HDAC1 or multi-drug resistance AML cells transfected with siRNA for HDAC1 through observing cell viability, percentage of apoptotic cell, doxorubicin-releasing index and multidrug resistance associated protein 1 (MRP1) expression. Neddylation or ubiquitination of HDAC1 was determined by immunoprecipitation or Ni2(+) pull down assay followed by western blot. The role of HDAC1 was in vivo confirmed by xenograft in mice. RESULTS: HDAC1 was significantly upregulated in refractory AML patients, and in drug-resistant AML cells (HL-60/ADM and K562/A02). Intracellular HDAC1 expression promoted doxorubicin resistance of HL-60, K562, and primary bone marrow cells (BMCs) of remission AML patients as shown by increasing cell viability and doxorubicin-releasing index, inhibiting cell apoptosis. Moreover, HDAC1 protein level in AML cells was regulated by the Nedd8-mediated neddylation and ubiquitination, which further promoted HDAC1 degradation. In vivo, HDAC1 overexpression significantly increased doxorubicin resistance; while HDACs inhibitor Panobinostat markedly improved the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on tumor growth. Furthermore, HDAC1 silencing by Panobinostat and/or lentivirus mediated RNA interference against HDAC1 effectively reduced doxorubicin resistance, resulting in the inhibition of tumor growth in AML bearing mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that HDAC1 contributed to the multidrug resistance of AML and its function turnover was regulated, at least in part, by post-translational modifications, including neddylation and ubiquitination.","['Lai, Qiu-Yu', 'He, Ying-Zhi', 'Peng, Xiong-Wen', 'Zhou, Xuan', 'Liang, Dan', 'Wang, Liang']","['Lai QY', 'He YZ', 'Peng XW', 'Zhou X', 'Liang D', 'Wang L']",,"[""Department of Hematology, ZhuJiang Hospital of Southern Medical Univeristy, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, 510280, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, ZhuJiang Hospital of Southern Medical Univeristy, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, 510280, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Hematologic Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, Guangzhou, China.', ""Department of Hematology, ZhuJiang Hospital of Southern Medical Univeristy, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, 510280, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, ZhuJiang Hospital of Southern Medical Univeristy, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, 510280, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, ZhuJiang Hospital of Southern Medical Univeristy, No. 253 GongyeDadaoZhong, 510280, Guangzhou, Guangdong, People's Republic of China. wangliangzjyy@126.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,"['0 (NEDD8 Protein)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacology', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Enzyme Induction/drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/*biosynthesis/deficiency/genetics/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Space/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'NEDD8 Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Ubiquitination/drug effects', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays', 'Young Adult']",PMC6664585,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myelogenous leukemia', '*Drug resistance', '*HDAC1', '*Neddylation', '*Ubiquitination']",2019/07/31 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/07/31 06:00'],"['2019/02/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/31 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12964-019-0393-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s12964-019-0393-8 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2019 Jul 29;17(1):86. doi: 10.1186/s12964-019-0393-8.,,20190729,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying oncogenic mechanisms and the clinical significance of MYC expression in the acute myeloid leukemia with myelodysplasia related changes (AML-MRC) remain to be answered. A total of 135 patients were retrospectively identified using Total Cancer Care (TCC) Moffitt Cancer Center (MCC) databases. Diagnosis of AML-MRC was based on the 2016 WHO classification utilizing bone marrow (BM) evaluation. MYC protein expression level was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining using paraffin-embedded BM trephine biopsy samples obtained at the time of diagnosis or relapse. Concurrent somatic mutations were assessed using targeted next generation sequencing that include 54 genes. A total of 38% (n=51) and 62% (n=84) patients had high and low MYC expression, respectively. The most common somatic mutation in our cohort was TP53 followed by DNMT3A, and ASXL1. The median OS was significantly longer in low MYC patients (median OS 42.3 vs. 17.05 months, p=0.0109). Multivariate analysis including MYC expression level, transplantation status, gender and age demonstrated high MYC expression (HR 1.77, 95% CI 1.004-3.104, p=0.045) to be an independent poor prognostic factor. Further studies are needed to identify the underlying mechanism of MYC driven oncogenesis in AML-MRC.

The present study explored the expression and potential role of TRIM13 in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). We found that TRIM13 mRNA and protein expression was reduced in NSCLC tissues and cell lines in comparison to paired non-cancerous tissues and a human normal bronchial epithelial cell line, respectively. Overexpression of TRIM13 in NCI-H1975 and SPC-A-1 cells hampered cell proliferation. Additionally, TRIM13 overexpression increased the levels of cleaved caspase-3. TRIM13-induced NSCLC cell apoptosis was attenuated by a caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO, suggesting that TRIM13 induced cell apoptosis partially through a caspase-3-dependent pathway. Moreover, it has been reported that TRIM13 can regulate nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity. Our data showed that TRIM13 overexpression inactivated NF-kappaB as indicated by the increased cytosolic NF-kappaB and decreased nuclear NF-kappaB. Exposure to an NF-kappaB inhibitor PDTC significantly blocked the impact of TRIM13 knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis, indicating the functions of TRIM13 in NSCLC cells were mediated by the NF-kappaB pathway. Finally, we demonstrated that TRIM13 overexpression suppressed tumor growth and induced cell apoptosis in vivo by using a xenograft mouse model. Collectively, our results indicate that TRIM13 behaves as a tumor suppressor in NSCLC through regulating NF-kappaB pathway. Our findings may offer a promising therapeutic target for NSCLC.","['Xu, Ling', 'Wu, Qi', 'Zhou, Xifa', 'Wu, Qiyong', 'Fang, Mingming']","['Xu L', 'Wu Q', 'Zhou X', 'Wu Q', 'Fang M']",,"[""Department of Radiotherapy, The Affiliated Changzhou No.2 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, China."", 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Heze Medical College, Heze, China.', 'Department of Radiotherapy, Changzhou Tumor Hospital, Soochow University, Changzhou, China.', ""Department of Thoracic and Cardiac Surgery, The Affiliated Changzhou No. 2 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, China.

Induction of pro-inflammatory mediators in hepatocytes exposed to free fatty acids represents a hallmark event during NASH pathogenesis. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a prototypical pro-inflammatory mediator. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism by which megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) mediates palmitate (PA) induced CRP transcription in hepatocytes. We report that over-expression of MKL1, but not MKL2, activated the CRP promoter whereas depletion or inhibition of MKL1 repressed the CRP promoter. MKL1 potentiated the induction of the CRP promoter activity by PA treatment. Importantly, MKL1 knockdown by siRNA or pharmaceutical inhibition by CCG-1423 attenuated the induction of endogenous CRP expression in hepatocytes. Similarly, primary hepatocytes isolated from wild type (WT) mice produced more CRP than those isolated from MKL1 deficient (KO) mice when stimulated with PA. Mechanistically, the sequence-specific transcription factor CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein (C/EBPbeta) interacted with MKL1 and recruited MKL1 to activate CRP transcription. Reciprocally, MKL1 modulated C/EBPbeta activity by recruiting the chromatin remodeling protein BRG1 to the CRP promoter to alter histone modifications.

METHODS: We analyzed RNA-sequencing profiles of whole bone marrow samples from 52 de novo AML patients who completed the ""7 + 3"" regimen and stratified patients into CR (n = 35) and non-CR (n = 17) groups. RESULTS: A systematic gene set analysis revealed significant associations between chemoresistance and mTOR (P < .001), myc (P < .001), mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (P < .001), and stemness (P = .002). These functions were independent with regard to gene contents and activity scores. An integration of these four functions showed a prediction of chemoresistance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.815) superior to that of each function alone. Moreover, our proposed seven-gene scoring system significantly correlated with the four-function model (r = .97; P < .001) to predict chemoresistance to the ""7 + 3"" regimen. On multivariate analysis, a seven-gene score of >/=-0.027 (hazard ratio: 11.18; 95% confidence interval: 2.06-60.65; P = .005) was an independent risk factor for induction failure. CONCLUSIONS: Myc, OXPHOS, mTOR, and stemness were responsive for chemoresistance in AML. Treatments other than the ""7 + 3"" regimen need to be considered for de novo AML patients predicted to be refractory to the ""7 + 3"" regimen.","['Chiu, Yu-Chiao', 'Hsiao, Tzu-Hung', 'Tsai, Jia-Rong', 'Wang, Li-Ju', 'Ho, Tzu-Chieh', 'Hsu, Shih-Lan', 'Teng, Chieh-Lin Jerry']","['Chiu YC', 'Hsiao TH', 'Tsai JR', 'Wang LJ', 'Ho TC', 'Hsu SL', 'Teng CJ']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9744-0368'],"['Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."", 'Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', ""Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."", 'Department of Biomedical Engineering, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Department of Medical Research, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Division of Hematology/Medical Oncology, Department of Medicine, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Department of Life Science, Tunghai University, Taichung, Taiwan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Chung Shan Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Bone Marrow Cells/metabolism', '*Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Statistical', 'Prognosis', 'ROC Curve', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemosensitivity', 'induction chemotherapy', 'prediction model', 'resistance functions']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/02/12 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/17 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/ejh.13301 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 2019 Oct;103(4):417-425. doi: 10.1111/ejh.13301.

METHODS: The bone marrow mononuclear cell samples from 10 AML patients and 10 age and gender matched controls were obtained and subjected to next-generation RNA sequencing. Then, the top 5 upregulated and top 5 downregulated lncRNAs in AML patients compared with controls were selected for further quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) validation in 40 AML patients and 40 age and gender matched controls. The effect of candidate lncRNA RP11-342M1.7 on proliferation and apoptosis in AML cells was further investigated. RESULTS: RNA sequencing observed 216 upregulated and 412 downregulated lncRNAs in AML patients compared with controls. Enrichment analyses exhibited that these differentially expressed lncRNAs were involved in neoplastic signaling pathways such as cAMP and MAPK signaling pathways. In further qPCR validation, lncRNA RP11-342M1.7 and lncRNA CDCA4P3 were upregulated, while lncRNA CES1P1, lncRNA AC008753.6 and lncRNA RP11-573G6.10 were downregulated in AML patients compared with controls. Multivariate logistic regression analysis disclosed that lncRNA RP11-342M1.7, lncRNA CES1P1 and lncRNA AC008753.6 were independent predictive factors for AML risk, and most importantly, the combination of these three lncRNAs was of remarkably good predictive value for AML risk (AUC: 0.901; 95% CI: 0.835-0.966). Besides, lncRNA RP11-342M1.7 was correlated with higher CR while lncRNA AC008753.6 and lncRNA CTD-2562J15.6 were correlated with lower CR. LncRNA RP11-342M1.7 knockdown suppressed cell proliferation by promoting cell apoptosis in AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals the comprehensive lncRNAs expression profiles in AML, and proposes candidate lncRNAs that are potential biomarkers for AML risk.","['Wang, Yong']",['Wang Y'],,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cancer Biomark,Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers,101256509,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)']",IM,,"['Biomarkers/*metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/*metabolism', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA/*methods', 'Transfection']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML risk', 'RNA sequencing', 'expression profiles', 'long non-coding RNA', 'predictive value']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/03/24 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']","['CBM190215 [pii]', '10.3233/CBM-190215 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Biomark. 2019;26(1):93-108. doi: 10.3233/CBM-190215.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, AKI has rarely been recorded in Evans syndrome without systemic autoimmune disease and malignant tumors of the blood and lymphatic system. Herein, we report the case of a patient who exhibited Evans syndrome presenting with AKI. A 73-year-old woman presented with diarrhea, anuria, low platelet count, and developed a progressive increase of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, as well as anemia with a positive direct Coombs test. We excluded hemolytic uremic syndrome, ITP, and leukemia. Treatment with antibiotics, rehydration therapy, and hemodialysis resulted in partial remission; thus, we diagnosed the patient with Evans syndrome presenting with AKI. The patient was successfully treated by the addition of steroid treatment. When AKI presents with hemolysis and thrombocytopenia, physicians should consider Evans syndrome, which can be appropriately treated when detected early.","['Lin, Hanfei', 'Wu, Kefei', 'Zhang, Weidai', 'Lin, Guili', 'Cai, Chudan']","['Lin H', 'Wu K', 'Zhang W', 'Lin G', 'Cai C']",,"['Department of Nephrology Medicine, The first Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', 'Department of Nephrology Medicine, The first Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', 'Department of Nephrology Medicine, The first Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', 'Department of Nephrology Medicine, The first Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.', 'Department of Nephrology Medicine, The first Affiliated Hospital of Shantou University Medical College, Shantou, China.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Steroids)', 'Evans Syndrome']",IM,,"['Acute Kidney Injury/*etiology/therapy', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Hemolytic, Autoimmune/complications/*diagnosis', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Coombs Test', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Renal Dialysis', 'Steroids/therapeutic use', 'Thrombocytopenia/complications/*diagnosis']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute kidney injury', '*Evans syndrome']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/09/23 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2018/06/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/16 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['S1029-2977-22(06)336-0 [pii]'],epublish,Arch Iran Med. 2019 Jun 1;22(6):336-339.,"['(c) 2019 The Author(s).

Currently, limited data are available on the incidence, prevalence, and mortality of these diseases in many regions, including developing countries. Herein, we are reporting national and sub-national estimates on deaths due to childhood cancers between 2000 and 2015 in Iran. METHODS: Cancer mortality rates were estimated using the national death registration system's data after addressing its incompleteness and misclassification, using demographic (complete birth history and summary birth history) and statistical analysis (spatiotemporal, Gaussian process regression, and generalized linear mixed models). We included data from cemeteries of two cities (Tehran and Isfahan) that were not included in the death registration system. We used census data and household expenditure and income surveys for data on population and other covariates used in the modeling. RESULTS: The overall age-standardized death rate (ASDR) of childhood cancers have decreased by 69.52% (80.67-49.71) in Iran (equal to an annual percent change of -3.63 [-4.53- -2.24]), declining from 12.24 (95% UI: 10.52-14.49) in 2000 to 3.73 (2.8-5.29) deaths per 100000 in 2015. This decrement was equal to an annual percent change of 4.35% over these years. Leukemia, brain, and nervous system malignancies accounted for about 66% of all cancer-related mortalities among children and adolescents in 2015, which had a 10% increase compared to 2000. Moreover, trends at the sub-national level showed that the highest and lowest ASDR of childhood cancers ranged from 2.12 to 4.99 across provinces of Iran in 2015. CONCLUSION: Although the overall mortalities have decreased, there is still inequality in the distribution of the recorded deaths. This inequality should be addressed with the improvement of the quality of care and better access to pediatric hospitals and oncologists in these areas.","['Rezaei, Nazila', 'Pishgar, Farhad', 'Yoosefi, Moein', 'Sheidaei, Ali', 'Saeedi Moghaddam, Sahar', 'Mansouri, Anita', 'Tahernia, Leila', 'Naderimagham, Shohreh', 'Modirian, Mitra', 'Pazhuheian, Forough', 'Rezaei, Negar', 'Namazi Shabestari, Alireza', 'Kompani, Farzad', 'Farzadfar, Farshad']","['Rezaei N', 'Pishgar F', 'Yoosefi M', 'Sheidaei A', 'Saeedi Moghaddam S', 'Mansouri A', 'Tahernia L', 'Naderimagham S', 'Modirian M', 'Pazhuheian F', 'Rezaei N', 'Namazi Shabestari A', 'Kompani F', 'Farzadfar F']",,"['Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Faculty of Paramedical Sciences, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Pediatrics Center of Excellence, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."", 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinical Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Geriatric Medicine, School of Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Children's Medical Center, Pediatrics Center of Excellence, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."", 'Non-Communicable Diseases Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Population Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.', 'Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Center, Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinical Sciences Institute, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Arch Iran Med,Archives of Iranian medicine,100889644,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/classification/*mortality', 'Registries', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Child', '*Epidemiology', '*Iran', '*Mortality']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/09/23 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2018/10/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/23 06:00 [medline]']",['S1029-2977-22(06)293-0 [pii]'],epublish,Arch Iran Med. 2019 Jun 1;22(6):293-300.,"['(c) 2019 The Author(s).

Characterizing mutation accumulation can improve understanding of the etiology of age-associated diseases. Presented here is a method to catalogue somatic mutations in individual HSPCs, which is based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of clonal primary cell cultures. Mutations that are present in the original cell are shared by all cells in the clonal culture, whereas mutations acquired in vitro after cell sorting are present in a subset of cells. Therefore, this method allows for accurate detection of somatic mutations present in the genomes of individual HSPCs, which accumulate during life. These catalogues of somatic mutations can provide valuable insights into mutational processes active in the hematopoietic tissue and how these processes contribute to leukemogenesis. In addition, by assessing somatic mutations that are shared between multiple HSPCs of the same individual, clonal lineage relationships and population dynamics of blood populations can be determined. As this approach relies on in vitro expansion of single cells, the method is limited to hematopoietic cells with sufficient replicative potential.","['Huber, Axel Rosendahl', 'Manders, Freek', 'Oka, Rurika', 'van Boxtel, Ruben']","['Huber AR', 'Manders F', 'Oka R', 'van Boxtel R']",,"['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology; R.vanBoxtel@prinsesmaximacentrum.nl.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Video-Audio Media']",United States,J Vis Exp,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,101313252,,IM,,"['Blood/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Mutation']",,,,2019/07/30 06:00,2020/06/13 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/13 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3791/59846 [doi]'],epublish,J Vis Exp. 2019 Jul 11;(149). doi: 10.3791/59846.,,20190711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As CAR T-cell utilization evolves however, novel challenges are generated. These include determining how to optimally integrate CAR T cells into standard of care and overcoming mechanisms of resistance to CAR T-cell therapy, such as evolutionary stress induced on cancer cells leading to immunophenotypic changes that allow leukemia to evade this targeted therapy. Compounding these challenges are the limited ability to determine differences between various CAR T-cell constructs, understanding the generalizability of trial outcomes from multiple sites utilizing unique CAR manufacturing strategies, and comparing distinct criteria for toxicity grading while defining optimal management. Additionally, as understanding of CAR behavior in humans has developed, strategies have appropriately evolved to proactively mitigate toxicities. These challenges offer complimentary insights and guide next steps to enhance the efficacy of this novel therapeutic modality. With a focus on B-cell malignancies as the paradigm for effective CAR T-cell therapy, this review describes advances in the field as well as current challenges and future directions.","['Jacoby, Elad', 'Shahani, Shilpa A', 'Shah, Nirali N']","['Jacoby E', 'Shahani SA', 'Shah NN']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1411-8942', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8474-9080']","[""Division of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and BMT, The Edmond and Lily Safra Children's Hospital, Sheba Medical Center and Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel."", 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/diagnosis/*immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/diagnosis/*immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR T-cell therapy', '*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*adoptive cell therapy', '*diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', '*immunotherapy', '*multiple myeloma']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/03/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12774 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2019 Jul;290(1):39-59. doi: 10.1111/imr.12774.,['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

This personalized ""living therapy"" is highly effective against a number of malignancies, but this efficacy is tempered by side effects relatively unique to immunotherapies, including CAR-T. The overwhelming release of cytokines and chemokines by activated CAR-T and other secondarily activated immune effector cells can lead to cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which can have clinical and pathophysiology similarities to systemic inflammatory response syndrome and macrophage activating syndrome/hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis. Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 receptor antibody, was recently FDA approved for treatment of CRS after CAR-T based on its ability to mitigate CRS in many patients. Unfortunately, some patients are refractory and additional therapies are needed. Patients treated with CAR-T can also develop neurotoxicity and, as the biology is poorly understood, current therapeutic interventions are limited to supportive care. Nevertheless, a number of recent studies have shed new light on the pathophysiology of CAR-T-related neurotoxicity, which will hopefully lead to effective treatments. In this review we discuss some of the mechanistic contributions intrinsic to the CAR-T construct, the tumor being treated, and the individual patient that impact the development and severity of CRS and neurotoxicity. As CAR-T and cellular therapy have redefined the concept of personalized medicine, so too will personalization be necessary in managing the unique side effects of these therapies.","['Oved, Joseph H', 'Barrett, David M', 'Teachey, David T']","['Oved JH', 'Barrett DM', 'Teachey DT']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7373-8987'],"[""Divisions of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Divisions of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania."", ""Divisions of Hematology and Oncology, Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Brain Diseases/etiology', '*Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Cytokine Release Syndrome/etiology', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/methods', 'Neoplasms/immunology/metabolism/therapy', 'Neurotoxicity Syndromes/etiology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism']",PMC7041800,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR-T', '*CRES', '*cell therapy', '*cytokine release syndrome', '*immunotherapy']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12768 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2019 Jul;290(1):114-126. doi: 10.1111/imr.12768.,['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Higher doses were subsequently made possible through the advent of steady-state apheresis, allowing the collection of PBMC numbers equivalent to an entire adult blood volume, and increased purity made feasible through magnetic CD3-depletion and/or CD56-selection methods. Still, these approaches rarely achieved clinical dosing above a single infusion of 10(8) NK cells/kg, except with substantial donor-recipient size mismatch (eg, parents donating cells to children). To address this shortcoming, leukemia cell lines with NK cell-like function or ex vivo expansion approaches centered on the homeostatic cytokine IL-15 were developed. Here, we describe the development of an ex vivo expansion system based on a feeder cell expressing membrane-bound IL-21 that enables log-phase growth of primary NK cells for many weeks without inducing senescence, and describe the biology, correlative science, and translation to clinical trials for patients with leukemia, brain tumors, and solid tumors.","['Lee, Dean A']",['Lee DA'],['ORCID: 0000-0001-6693-5392'],"[""Department of Hematology, Oncology, and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", 'Department of Pediatrics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Immunol Rev,Immunological reviews,7702118,"['0 (Interleukins)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'MKM3CA6LT1 (interleukin-21)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Culture Techniques', '*Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/adverse effects/methods', 'Clinical Studies as Topic', 'Cryopreservation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Feeder Cells', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive/adverse effects/methods', 'Interleukins/metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Natural/cytology/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Models, Animal', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology/metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*IL-21', '*adoptive immunotherapy', '*feeder cells', '*natural killer cells']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imr.12793 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Rev. 2019 Jul;290(1):85-99. doi: 10.1111/imr.12793.,['(c) 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Pantothenate kinase (PANK) is a regulatory enzyme that controls coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis. It has four isoforms encoded by PANK1-4, respectively. Whether the expression of the PANK family has prognostic significance in AML remains unclear. Methods: We screened The Cancer Genome Atlas database for AML patients with complete PANK1-4 expression data. Eighty-four AML patients met the criteria and were included in this study. Clinical characteristics at diagnosis, including peripheral blood (PB) white blood cell counts (WBC), blast percentages in PB and bone marrow (BM), French-American-British (FAB) subtypes and the frequencies of common genetic mutations were described. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were constructed for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS), using a limited backward elimination procedure. Results: Patients with high PANK2 expression had significantly longer event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) than patients with low PANK2 expression (P=0.007, P=0.016, respectively), whereas patients with high PANK4 expression had shorter EFS and OS than patients with low PANK4 expression (P=0.022, P=0.015, respectively). Multivariate analysis confirmed that high PANK4 expression was an independent risk factor for EFS and OS (both P<0.05). Conclusions: Our study suggested that high PANK2 expression might have favorable effects on AML, while high PANK4 expression was indicative of poor prognosis.","['Liu, Yan', 'Cheng, Zhiheng', 'Li, Qihui', 'Pang, Yifan', 'Cui, Longzhen', 'Qian, Tingting', 'Quan, Liang', 'Dai, Yifeng', 'Jiao, Yang', 'Zhang, Zhihui', 'Ye, Xu', 'Shi, Jinlong', 'Fu, Lin']","['Liu Y', 'Cheng Z', 'Li Q', 'Pang Y', 'Cui L', 'Qian T', 'Quan L', 'Dai Y', 'Jiao Y', 'Zhang Z', 'Ye X', 'Shi J', 'Fu L']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng 475000, China.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng 475000, China.', 'Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology and Lymphoma Research Center, Peking University, Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Medicine, William Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI 48073, USA.', 'Translational Medicine Center, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng 475000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Immunoendocrinology, Division of Medical Biology, Department of Pathology and Medical Biology, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands.', 'Life Sciences Institute and Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310058, China.', 'Department of Stomatology, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing 100191, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Department of Medical Big Data, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Translational Medicine Center, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 510260, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Huaihe Hospital of Henan University, Kaifeng 475000, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,,PMC6614324,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'heterogeneity', 'pantothenate kinase (PANK)', 'prognosis']",2019/07/30 06:00,2019/07/30 06:01,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm.2019.05.28 [doi]', 'atm-07-12-261 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2019 Jun;7(12):261. doi: 10.21037/atm.2019.05.28.,,,,,['Conflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: In experiment 1, HL60 cells were divided into the blank control group, the blank transfection group, the scrambled oligonucleotide (SODN) group and the ASODN group. MiR-19a ASODN and SODN were independently transferred into HL60 cells. The miR-19a expression was detected by real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) after 48-h and 72-h transfection; CCK8 assay was used to detect the proliferation inhibition rate at 48 and 72 h; Hoechst 33258 staining was performed to examine apoptotic cells at 48 h; the apoptosis rate was detected by flow cytometry after AnnexinV/PI staining at 48 and 72 h; the protein expression of E2F1 and Bim was detected by Western blotting at 48 h. In experiment 2, cells were divided into the Ara-C group, the SODN + Ara-C group and the ASODN + Ara-C group. The cell proliferation inhibition rate at 48 and 72 h and apoptosis rate at 72 h were assessed as mentioned above. Results: MiR-19a expression in the miR-19a ASODN group was lower than in the SODN group and the blank control group (P<0.05). MiR-19a ASODN significantly inhibited the growth of HL60 cells (P<0.05) and increased their apoptosis, and the apoptosis rate peaked at 48 h. The protein expression of E2F1 and Bim in the ASODN group was higher than in the blank control group, blank transfection group and SODN group. In addition, Ara-C further inhibited the growth and induced the apoptosis of miR-19a ASODN-transfected cells (P<0.05) in a time dependent manner. The growth inhibition rate and apoptosis rate in the ASODN + Ara-C group were higher than the sum of those in both Ara-C group and ASODN group. Conclusions: miRNA-19a ASODN can inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis of HL60 cells and may exert synergistic effects with Ara-C on HL60 cells.","['Bao, Shijie', 'He, Dongmei', 'Zeng, Jinrong', 'Zhang, Yanrong', 'Chen, Shengting']","['Bao S', 'He D', 'Zeng J', 'Zhang Y', 'Chen S']",,"['Shenzhen Hospital, Southern Medical University, Shenzhen 518110, China.', 'Departmemt of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510290, China.', 'Institute of Hematology, School of Medicine, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510290, China.', 'Departmemt of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510290, China.', 'Departmemt of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510290, China.', 'Departmemt of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510290, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,,PMC6614310,['NOTNLM'],"['Ara-C', 'HL60 cells', 'MicroRNA19a (miR-19a)', 'antisense oligonucleotide (ASODN)', 'apoptosis']",2019/07/30 06:00,2019/07/30 06:01,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/30 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm.2019.05.32 [doi]', 'atm-07-12-260 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2019 Jun;7(12):260. doi: 10.21037/atm.2019.05.32.,,,,,['Conflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Similarly, we wanted to analyze if the recipient ALC interacts with alemtuzumab dosing to predict outcomes. We retrospectively compared 364 patients, 124 patients receiving ATG (anti-thymocyte globulin) for GVHD prophylaxis, and undergoing unrelated first allogeneic transplant for myeloid and lymphoid malignancies (group 1) to 240 patients receiving alemtuzumab (group 2), in similar time period. There was no difference in survival or acute and chronic GVHD between 60 and 100 mg of alemtuzumab dosing. Unlike ATG (where the pre-transplant recipient ALC interacted with ATG dose on day of its administration (day 1) to predict OS and DFS (p = 0.05), within alemtuzumab group, the recipient ALC on second day of alemtuzumab administration (day 2) and its interaction with alemtuzumab dose strongly predicted OS, DFS and relapse (p = 0.05, HR-1.81, 1.1-3.3; p = 0.002, HR-2.41, CI, 1.3-4.2; and p = 0.003, HR-2.78, CI, 1.4-5.2), respectively.

Research suggests an association between HCV infection and the subsequent development of non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). HCV is also a well-known etiologic factor in the development of type II cryoglobulinemic vasculitis while type I cryoglobulinemic vasculitis results from monoclonal immunoglobulin secondary to malignancy.

We have recently reported that the immune receptor Tim-3 and its natural ligand galectin-9 are involved in the immune escape of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. These cells use the neuronal receptor latrophilin 1 (LPHN1) and its ligand fibronectin leucine rich transmembrane protein 3 (FLRT3, and possibly other ligands) to trigger the pathway. We hypothesized that the Tim-3-galectin-9 pathway may be involved in the immune escape of cancer cells of different origins. We found that studied breast tumors expressed significantly higher levels of both galectin-9 and Tim-3 compared to healthy breast tissues of the same patients and that these proteins were co-localized. Increased levels of LPHN2 and expressions of LPHN3 as well as FLRT3 were also detected in breast tumor cells. Activation of this pathway facilitated the translocation of galectin-9 onto the tumor cell surface, however no secretion of galectin-9 by tumor cells was observed. Surface-based galectin-9 was able to protect breast carcinoma cells against cytotoxic T cell-induced death. Furthermore, we found that cell lines from brain, colorectal, kidney, blood/mast cell, liver, prostate, lung, and skin cancers expressed detectable amounts of both Tim-3 and galectin-9 proteins. The majority of cell lines expressed one of the LPHN isoforms and FLRT3. We conclude that the Tim-3-galectin-9 pathway is operated by a wide range of human cancer cells and is possibly involved in prevention of anti-tumor immunity.","['Yasinska, Inna M', 'Sakhnevych, Svetlana S', 'Pavlova, Ludmila', 'Teo Hansen Selno, Anette', 'Teuscher Abeleira, Ana Maria', 'Benlaouer, Ouafa', 'Goncalves Silva, Isabel', 'Mosimann, Marianne', 'Varani, Luca', 'Bardelli, Marco', 'Hussain, Rohanah', 'Siligardi, Giuliano', 'Cholewa, Dietmar', 'Berger, Steffen M', 'Gibbs, Bernhard F', 'Ushkaryov, Yuri A', 'Fasler-Kan, Elizaveta', 'Klenova, Elena', 'Sumbayev, Vadim V']","['Yasinska IM', 'Sakhnevych SS', 'Pavlova L', 'Teo Hansen Selno A', 'Teuscher Abeleira AM', 'Benlaouer O', 'Goncalves Silva I', 'Mosimann M', 'Varani L', 'Bardelli M', 'Hussain R', 'Siligardi G', 'Cholewa D', 'Berger SM', 'Gibbs BF', 'Ushkaryov YA', 'Fasler-Kan E', 'Klenova E', 'Sumbayev VV']",,"['Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Biomedical Research, Children's Hospital, Inselspital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."", 'Zentrum Fur Medizinische Bildung, Biomedizinische Analytik HF, Bern, Switzerland.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Biomedical Research, Children's Hospital, Inselspital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."", 'Zentrum Fur Medizinische Bildung, Biomedizinische Analytik HF, Bern, Switzerland.', ""Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universita' della Svizzera italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland."", ""Institute for Research in Biomedicine, Universita' della Svizzera italiana, Bellinzona, Switzerland."", 'Beamline B23, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, United Kingdom.', 'Beamline B23, Diamond Light Source, Didcot, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Biomedical Research, Children's Hospital, Inselspital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."", ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Biomedical Research, Children's Hospital, Inselspital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."", 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Experimental Allergology and Immunodermatology, University of Oldenburg, Oldenburg, Germany.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.', ""Department of Pediatric Surgery, Department of Biomedical Research, Children's Hospital, Inselspital, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland."", 'Department of Biomedicine, University Hospital Basel and University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland.', 'School of Biological Sciences, University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom.', 'Medway School of Pharmacy, Universities of Kent and Greenwich, Chatham Maritime, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Galectins)', '0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (LGALS9 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled)']",IM,,"['Breast Neoplasms/*metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Galectins/*metabolism', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'MCF-7 Cells', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism', 'Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/physiology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/metabolism']",PMC6637653,['NOTNLM'],"['*TIM-3', '*breast cancer', '*galectin-9', '*immune evasion', '*immune surveillance']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01594 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jul 11;10:1594. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01594. eCollection 2019.,,20190711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the archetypical autoimmune disease, affecting multiple organs, and tissues. Studying SLE creates knowledge relevant not just for autoimmunity, but the immune system in general. Murine models and patient studies have provided increasing evidence for the innate immune toll like receptor-7 (TLR7) in disease initiation and progression. Here, we demonstrated that the kinase activity of the TLR7-downstream signaling molecule, interleukin-1 receptor associated kinase 4 (IRAK4), is essential for mild and severe autoimmune traits of the Sle1 and Sle1-TLR7 transgenic (Sle1Tg7) murine models, respectively. Elimination of IRAK4 signaling prevented all pathological traits associated with murine lupus, including splenomegaly with leukocyte expansion, detectable circulating antinuclear antibodies and glomerulonephritis, in both Sle1 and Sle1Tg7 mice. The expansion of germinal center B cells and increased effector memory T cell phenotypes that are typical of lupus-prone strains, were also prevented with IRAK4 kinase elimination. Analysis of renal leukocyte infiltrates confirmed our earlier findings of an expanded conventional dendritic cell (cDC) within the kidneys of nephritic mice, and this was prevented with IRAK4 kinase elimination. Analysis of TLR7 at the protein level revealed that the expression in immune cells is dependent on the TLR7-transgene itself and/or autoimmune disease factors in a cell-specific manner. Increased TLR7 protein expression in renal macrophages and cDCs correlated with disease parameters such as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels and the frequency of leukocytes infiltrating the kidney. These findings suggest that controlling the level of TLR7 or downstream signaling within myeloid populations may prevent chronic inflammation and severe nephritis.","['Celhar, Teja', 'Lu, Hao Kim', 'Benso, Lia', 'Rakhilina, Larissa', 'Lee, Hui Yin', 'Tripathi, Shubhita', 'Zharkova, Olga', 'Ong, Wei Yee', 'Yasuga, Hiroko', 'Au, Bijin', 'Marlier, Damien', 'Lim, Lina Hsiu Kim', 'Thamboo, Thomas Paulraj', 'Mudgett, John S', 'Mackey, Matthew F', 'Zaller, Dennis M', 'Connolly, John E', 'Fairhurst, Anna-Marie']","['Celhar T', 'Lu HK', 'Benso L', 'Rakhilina L', 'Lee HY', 'Tripathi S', 'Zharkova O', 'Ong WY', 'Yasuga H', 'Au B', 'Marlier D', 'Lim LHK', 'Thamboo TP', 'Mudgett JS', 'Mackey MF', 'Zaller DM', 'Connolly JE', 'Fairhurst AM']",,"['Singapore Immunology Network, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Singapore Immunology Network, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, United States.', 'Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, United States.', 'Singapore Immunology Network, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Singapore Immunology Network, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Singapore Immunology Network, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Singapore Immunology Network, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Tessa Therapeutics, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Physiology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Pathology, National University Hospital, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, United States.', 'Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, United States.', 'Merck & Co., Inc., Boston, MA, United States.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Biomedical Studies, Baylor University, Waco, TX, United States.', 'Singapore Immunology Network, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, ASTAR, Singapore, Singapore.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore.', 'School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '0 (Pbx1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Irak4 protein, mouse)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear/blood', 'Cell Movement', 'Dendritic Cells/*immunology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Glomerulonephritis', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Interleukin-1 Receptor-Associated Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Kidney/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/*metabolism', 'Lupus Nephritis/genetics/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Organ Specificity', 'Pre-B-Cell Leukemia Transcription Factor 1/genetics/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6636428,['NOTNLM'],"['*IRAK4', '*SLE', '*TLR7', '*anti-nuclear antibody', '*dendritic cells', '*lupus']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/06/05 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/01/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01546 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jul 10;10:1546. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01546. eCollection 2019.,,20190710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infusion of donor lymphocytes (DLIs) can induce remission and prolong survival by exerting graft-vs.-leukemia (GVL) effects. However, sufficient tumor control cannot be established in all patients and occurrence of graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD) prevents further dose escalation. Previous data indicate that invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells promote anti-tumor immunity without exacerbating GVHD. In the present study we investigated lysis of leukemic blasts through iNKT cells from donor-derived lymphocytes for leukemia control and found that iNKT cells constitute about 0.12% of cryopreserved donor T cells. Therefore, we established a 2-week cell culture protocol allowing for a robust expansion of iNKT cells from cryopreserved DLIs (DLI-iNKTs) that can be used for further preclinical and clinical applications. Such DLI-iNKTs efficiently lysed leukemia cell lines and primary patient AML blasts ex vivo in a dose- and CD1d-dependent manner. Furthermore, expression of CD1d on target cells was required to release proinflammatory cytokines and proapoptotic effector molecules. Our results suggest that iNKT cells from donor-derived lymphocytes are involved in anti-tumor immunity after allo-HCT and therefore may reduce the risk of relapse and improve progression-free and overall survival.","['Jahnke, Simona', 'Schmid, Hannes', 'Secker, Kathy-Ann', 'Einhaus, Jakob', 'Duerr-Stoerzer, Silke', 'Keppeler, Hildegard', 'Schober-Melms, Irmtraud', 'Baur, Rebecca', 'Schumm, Michael', 'Handgretinger, Rupert', 'Bethge, Wolfgang', 'Kanz, Lothar', 'Schneidawind, Corina', 'Schneidawind, Dominik']","['Jahnke S', 'Schmid H', 'Secker KA', 'Einhaus J', 'Duerr-Stoerzer S', 'Keppeler H', 'Schober-Melms I', 'Baur R', 'Schumm M', 'Handgretinger R', 'Bethge W', 'Kanz L', 'Schneidawind C', 'Schneidawind D']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, Erlangen, Germany.', ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's University Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany."", ""Department of Hematology and Oncology, Children's University Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany."", 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (CD1D protein, human)']",IM,,"['Antigens, CD1d/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/methods', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/immunology', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Transfusion/methods', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Tissue Donors', 'Transplantation, Homologous/methods']",PMC6629940,['NOTNLM'],"['*DLI', '*GVHD', '*GVL', '*adoptive immunotherapy', '*hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*iNKT cells']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/03/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01542 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jul 9;10:1542. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01542. eCollection 2019.,,20190709,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Once transplanted, allogeneic cells have to support myeloid repopulation and immunological reconstitution, but also need to become tolerant to the host via central or peripheral mechanisms to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Peripheral tolerance after allogeneic HSCT may be achieved by several mechanisms, though blocking alloreactivity to the host human leukocyte antigens while preserving immune responses to pathogens and tumor antigens remains a challenge. Recently uncovered evidence on the mechanisms of post-HSCT immune reconstitution and tolerance in transplanted patients has allowed for the development of novel cell-based therapeutic approaches. These therapies are aimed at inducing long-term peripheral tolerance and reducing the risk of graft-vs-host disease (GvHD), while sparing the graft-vs-leukemia (GvL) effect. Thus, ensuring effective long term remission in hematologic malignancies. Today, haploidentical stem cell transplants have become a widely used treatment for patients with hematological malignancies. A myriad of ex vivo and in vivo T-cell depletion strategies have been adopted, with the goal of preventing GvHD while preserving GvL in the context of immunogenetic disparity. alphabeta T-cell/CD19 B-cell depletion techniques, in particular, has gained significant momentum, because of the high rate of leukemia-free survival and the low risk of severe GvHD. Despite progress, better treatments are still needed in a portion of patients to further reduce the incidence of relapse and achieve long-term tolerance. Current post-HSCT cell therapy approaches designed to induce tolerance and minimizing GvHD occurrence include the use of (i) gammadelta T cells, (ii) regulatory Type 1 T (Tr1) cells, and (iii) engineered FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells. Future protocols may include post-HSCT infusion of allogeneic effector or regulatory T cells engineered with a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). In the present review, we describe the most recent advances in graft engineering and post-HSCT adoptive immunotherapy.","['Bertaina, Alice', 'Roncarolo, Maria Grazia']","['Bertaina A', 'Roncarolo MG']",,"['Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.', 'Division of Stem Cell Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.', 'Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,IM,,"['Allografts/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Graft vs Host Disease', 'Graft vs Leukemia Effect/*immunology', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tissue Engineering', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC6635579,['NOTNLM'],"['*CAR (chimeric antigen receptor) T cells', '*Treg - regulatory T cells', '*gamma delta (gammadelta) T cells', '*haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', '*immune tolerance']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/06/05 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/01/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/05 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01342 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jul 10;10:1342. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01342. eCollection 2019.,,20190710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surgical treatment for IPA is remains challenging and controversial due to the potentially high risk of mortality and morbidity. Methods: We discuss 4 leukemia patients who underwent surgery for IPA in our hospital who were successfully treated with curative lobectomy or wedge resection. All patients had uneventful postoperative courses, and all resumed long-term follow-up for their leukemia. Results: All patients have suffered at least once of hemoptysis with radiological findings of lung nodules appearing as ovoid soft-tissue opacities in the lung parenchyma and had undergone antifungal agent treatment for at least 2 weeks. The symptoms and infection sites were not better. Lobectomy was performed in 3 cases and wedge resection in 1 case. Two of the cases suffered Aspergillus infection, 1 suffered Trichoderma and 1 suffered Candida albicans. Median hospital stay after surgery was 17.25 days. There was only 1 patient who had prolonged air leak (n=1; 25%) with empyema. There were no mortalities during the perioperative period or within 30 days of surgery, all patients survived without recurrence and resumed anti-leukemia treatment as soon as possible.

Long-term treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors means that patients have to be clinically managed and monitored over extended periods of time, thus a patient-centered, medically integrated, and multidisciplinary oncology healthcare team is required to support patients through their journey. Pharmacists work with patients, physicians, and the wider support team to select the optimum therapy plan for a given patient. These decisions are based on risk factors, comorbidities, concomitant medications, and personal circumstances and pharmacists advise on the efficacy and safety of different treatment options. Additionally, pharmacists are a key point-of-contact and resource for monitoring patient response to treatment, identifying and managing adverse events and drug-drug interactions, any subsequent therapy plan modifications, and, potentially, treatment-free remission. Pharmacists also assist with patient education, medication adherence, and financial discussions with patients throughout the long course of the disease. This review provides an overview of BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors, discusses the role of the medically integrated pharmacy team, and suggests strategies that pharmacists can use in patient management and clinical decision-making to optimize the treatment of CP CML.","['Reff, Michael J', 'Shillingburg, Alexandra', 'Shah, Bhavesh', 'Elder, Christopher', 'Prescott, Hillary', 'Kennerly-Shah, Julie']","['Reff MJ', 'Shillingburg A', 'Shah B', 'Elder C', 'Prescott H', 'Kennerly-Shah J']",,"['National Community Oncology Dispensing Association, Inc., Cazenovia, NY, USA.', 'Clinical Pharmacy Services and PGY2 Oncology Pharmacy Residency, Levine Cancer Institute, Charlotte, NC, USA.', 'Specialty and Hematology-Oncology Pharmacy Services, Boston Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA.', 'The Lloyd L.

The leukemia-induced mice were fed daily with the extract (100 or 200 mg/kg BW) and compared to ATRA (All-trans-retinoic-acid; 5 mg/kg BW). After 4 weeks' treatment, the extract (standardized to epicatechin and scopoletin), arrested Jurkat cell-cycle at the G0/G1 phase and activated the caspase-3 and caspase-8 (death-receptor extrinsic pathways). The extract dose-dependently reduced the blood and bone marrow myeloblasts levels of leukemia-induced mice; upregulated cancer suppressor genes CSF3, SOCS1, PTEN and TRP53; increased anti-inflammatory IL10 and IL4; downregulated anti-apoptotic or proliferation genes; decreased the pro-inflammatory NF-kappabeta; suppressed pro-angiogenesis VEGFA mRNA expressions, and restored the homeostatic immune or leukocytes levels. The extract directly ameliorated leukemia via cancer cells apoptosis, suppressed inflammation and angiogenesis; and mitigated bone marrow myeloblasts imbalance, without any observable toxicity on the animals. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The scopoletin (coumarin) and epicatechin (flavonoid)-rich Morinda citrifolia (Noni) leaves may be used as functional food ingredient, vegetables, or dietary supplements to treat and suppress leukemia progression by directly killing the cancer cells and preventing new cancer cells development and bone marrow myeloblast imbalance in the bone marrow, without being toxic to normal cells. The M. citrifolia leaf extract suppressed inflammation, and potential metastasis by inhibiting new cancer-related blood vessel formation.","['Ahmadi, Negin', 'Mohamed, Suhaila', 'Sulaiman Rahman, Heshu', 'Rosli, Rozita']","['Ahmadi N', 'Mohamed S', 'Sulaiman Rahman H', 'Rosli R']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2954-3821'],"['Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia.', 'Petroleum Industry Health Organization, Masjedsoleiman, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia.', 'College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Sulaimani, Sulaymaniyah, Republic of Iraq.', 'Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Food Biochem,Journal of food biochemistry,7706045,"['0 (Angiogenesis Inhibitors)', '0 (Anti-Inflammatory Agents)', '0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)', '130068-27-8 (Interleukin-10)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '8R1V1STN48 (Catechin)', 'KLF1HS0SXJ (Scopoletin)']",IM,,"['Angiogenesis Inhibitors/*administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Catechin/*administration & dosage', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-10/genetics/immunology', 'Interleukin-4/genetics/immunology', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/genetics/immunology/physiopathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Morinda/*chemistry', 'Scopoletin/*administration & dosage']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*anti-angiogenesis', '*anti-inflammatory', '*apoptosis', '*epicatechin', '*mRNA expressions', '*scopoletin']",2019/07/30 06:00,2020/08/28 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2018/12/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/28 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/jfbc.12868 [doi]'],ppublish,J Food Biochem. 2019 Jul;43(7):e12868. doi: 10.1111/jfbc.12868.

And the enzymatic properties, antitumor activity and the ability to prevent acrylamide formation in fried foods of srnASNase were evaluated. SrnASNase had high specific activity (531.37 U/mg) toward L-asparagine under optimum conditions (pH 8.0 and 40 degrees C), no activity toward L-glutamine and D-glutamine, but trace activity toward D-asparagine. It was stable in the pH range of 7.0-9.0 and up to 40 degrees C. The Km and Vmax of srnASNase were 0.36 mM and 51.64 mM/min, respectively. Further, in vitro anti-proliferative activity on human cancer cells assay showed that srnASNase was superior to commercial asparaginase in solution by controlling the tumor cell growth with time. In addition, srnASNase showed more effective acrylamide mitigation than commercial asparaginase in fried foods. These results indicate that srnASNase is a potential candidate for applications in the food processing and pharmaceutical industry. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: L-asparaginase (L-asparagine amidohydrolase; EC 3.5.1.1) is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the amide group of the side-chain of L-asparagine into aspartic acid and ammonia. It has long been used as a primary component in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (All) and other related blood cancers. Apart from its clinical usage, L-asparaginase has attracted more attention in the food processing industries as a promising acrylamide-mitigating agent in recent years.

To elucidate features of leukemic tumors that render them resistant to agents effective against marrow leukemia, we analyzed a series of AML breast tumors by histology, immunohistochemistry, and RNA sequencing. Striking histologic similarities to solid cancers were found: a single-filing architectural pattern virtually identical to that of invasive lobular breast carcinoma and dense desmoplastic keloid-like fibrosis similar to colon, gallbladder, and pancreas carcinomas. Sequencing found 2157 genes significantly downregulated in AML breast tumors compared to normal breast. Comparison to triple-negative breast cancer found 859 genes similarly downregulated. At least 30 of these genes have been associated with poor prognosis in breast cancers. Five were reported in AML marrow studies to correlate with poor prognosis. The findings of this pilot study suggest the seed-and-soil interaction recognized in solid cancer growth may help explain how leukemic cells, in some patients, adopt solid tumor behavior in non-marrow sites. Transformed cells that metastasize from tumor to marrow can impart chemoresistance and be an unrecognized cause of treatment failure and death. Further studies comparing leukemic tumor to simultaneous marrow could potentially identify biomarkers that predict extramedullary resistance and lead to new therapeutic targets. Recognizing the potential for leukemia to adopt solid tumor phenotype, and implementation of body scanning and ablative tumor treatment, could decrease the persistently high rates of marrow resistance and treatment failure.","['Cunningham, Isabel', 'Hamele-Bena, Diane', 'Guo, Yan', 'Shiomi, Takayuki', 'Papp, Audrey C', 'Chakravarti, Bandana', 'Yang, Jianqi', 'Shyr, Yu', 'Fisher, Rory A']","['Cunningham I', 'Hamele-Bena D', 'Guo Y', 'Shiomi T', 'Papp AC', 'Chakravarti B', 'Yang J', 'Shyr Y', 'Fisher RA']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0882-4501'],"['Division of Hematology Oncology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York.', 'Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York.', 'Bioinformatics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, New Mexico.', 'Department of Pathology, International University of Health and Welfare, Chiba, Japan.', 'Center for Pharmacogenomics, Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.', 'Department of Biostatistics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee.', 'Department of Pharmacology, University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor', 'Breast/chemistry/*pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/chemistry/pathology', 'Carcinoma/pathology', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Regulatory Networks', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology/therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Sarcoma, Myeloid/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms/pathology']",,,,2019/07/30 06:00,2020/03/27 06:00,['2019/07/30 06:00'],"['2019/05/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/30 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25594 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Nov;94(11):1200-1207. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25594.

These recommendations aim at updating the use of BCR-ABL1 mutation testing with respect to new available therapeutic options and at repositioning different testing methods at the era of next generation sequencing (NGS). They have been written by a panel of experts from the French Study Group on CML (Fi-LMC), after a critical review of relevant publications. TKD mutation testing is recommended in case of treatment failure but not in case of optimal response. For patients in warning situation, mutation testing must be discussed depending on the type of TKI used, lasting of the treatment, kinetic evolution of BCR-ABL1 transcripts along time and necessity for switching treatment. The kind and the frequency of TKD mutations occasioning resistance mainly depend on the TKI in use and disease phase. Because of its better sensitivity, NGS methods are recommended for mutation testing rather than Sanger's.

Notably, recent work suggested that these differences in glucocorticoid sensitivity might, at least in part, be mediated by hyperactivation of specific oncogenic pathways such as RAS/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT and IL7R/JAK/STAT. In this review, we elaborate on putative associations between aberrant signaling, therapy resistance, incidence of relapse and clinical outcome in human T-ALL. Furthermore, we emphasize that this potential association with clinical parameters might also be mediated by the tumor microenvironment as a result of increased sensitivity of leukemic T-cells towards cytokine induced signaling pathway activation. With this in mind, we provide an overview of small molecule inhibitors that might have clinical potential for the treatment of human T-ALL in the near future as a result of their ability to overcome steroid resistance thereby potentially increasing survival rates in this aggressive hematological neoplasm.","['De Smedt, Renate', 'Morscio, Julie', 'Goossens, Steven', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter']","['De Smedt R', 'Morscio J', 'Goossens S', 'Van Vlierberghe P']",,"['Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium; Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Cancer Research Institute Ghent (CRIG), Ghent, Belgium.

As the thioredoxin (Trx) system, one of the major cellular antioxidant networks, has been implicated in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we investigated the therapeutic potential of Trx inhibition in ALL. Here, we show that the Trx inhibitor PX-12 reduced cell viability and induced cell death in a dose- and time-dependent manner in different ALL cell lines. This antileukemic activity was accompanied by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and enhanced PRDX3 dimerization. Pre-treatment with the thiol-containing ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC), but not with non-thiol-containing scavengers alpha-tocopherol (alpha-Toc) or Mn(III)tetrakis(4-benzoic acid) porphyrin chloride (MnTBAP), significantly rescued PX-12-induced cell death. Furthermore, PX-12 triggered activation of BAK. Importantly, knockdown of BAK reduced PX-12-stimulated ROS production and cell death. Similarly, silencing of NOXA provided significant protection from PX-12-mediated cell death. The relevance of mitochondria-mediated, caspase-dependent apoptosis was further supported by data showing that PX-12 triggered cleavage of caspase-3 and that addition of the broad-range caspase inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone (zVAD.fmk) potently blocked cell death upon PX-12 treatment. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of PX-12-induced cell death in ALL and further highlights the therapeutic potential of redox-active compounds in ALL.","['Ehrenfeld, Vanessa', 'Fulda, Simone']","['Ehrenfeld V', 'Fulda S']",,"['Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe University, Komturstr. 3a, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Institute for Experimental Cancer Research in Pediatrics, Goethe University, Komturstr. 3a, D-60528 Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Partner Site Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Biol Chem,Biological chemistry,9700112,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Disulfides)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '8PQ9CZ8BTJ (1-methylpropyl-2-imidazolyl disulfide)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Disulfides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/*pharmacology', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*ALL', '*PX-12', '*apoptosis', '*mitochondria', '*reactive oxygen species', '*thioredoxin system']",2019/07/29 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2019/07/29 06:00'],"['2019/02/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1515/hsz-2019-0160 [doi]', '/j/bchm.ahead-of-print/hsz-2019-0160/hsz-2019-0160.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Biol Chem. 2020 Feb 25;401(2):273-283. doi: 10.1515/hsz-2019-0160.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this capability has often been compromised by significant sequencing, PCR and DNA preparation error rates. Here, we describe FERMI (Fast Extremely Rare Mutation Identification) - a novel method designed to eliminate the majority of these sequencing and library-preparation errors in order to significantly improve rare somatic mutation detection. This method leverages barcoded targeting probes to capture and sequence DNA of interest with single copy resolution. The variant calls from the barcoded sequencing data are then further filtered in a position-dependent fashion against an adaptive, context-aware null model in order to distinguish true variants. As a proof of principle, we employ FERMI to probe bone marrow biopsies from leukemia patients, and show that rare mutations and clonal evolution can be tracked throughout cancer treatment, including during historically intractable periods like minimum residual disease. Importantly, FERMI is able to accurately detect nascent clonal expansions within leukemias in a manner that may facilitate the early detection and characterization of cancer relapse.","['Liggett, L Alexander', 'Sharma, Anchal', 'De, Subhajyoti', 'DeGregori, James']","['Liggett LA', 'Sharma A', 'De S', 'DeGregori J']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute, New Brunswick, NJ 08901.', 'Rutgers Cancer Institute, New Brunswick, NJ 08901.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045 james.degregori@ucdenver.edu.', 'Linda Crnic Institute for Down Syndrome, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.', 'Integrated Department of Immunology.', 'Department of Pediatrics.', 'Department of Medicine, Section of Hematology, University of Colorado School of Medicine, Aurora, CO 80045.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,G3 (Bethesda),"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",101566598,"['EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,,"['Algorithms', 'Biopsy', 'Bone Marrow', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*methods', 'False Positive Reactions', 'Gene Library', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Sensitivity and Specificity', 'Single Molecule Imaging/methods']",PMC6723130,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*Genetics', '*Sequencing']",2019/07/29 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/07/29 06:00'],"['2019/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/29 06:00 [entrez]']","['g3.119.400438 [pii]', '10.1534/g3.119.400438 [doi]']",epublish,G3 (Bethesda). 2019 Sep 4;9(9):2977-2987. doi: 10.1534/g3.119.400438.,['Copyright (c) 2019 Liggett et al.'],20190904,,"['R01 CA180175/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'F31 CA196231/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA072720/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001082/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30 CA046934/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM129066/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although Genipin has anti-tumor effects in various cancers, its effect and mechanism in gastric cancer remain unclear. Here, we investigated the relationship between the anticancer effect of Genipin and signal transducer and activator of transcription (Stat3)/myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in human gastric cancers. METHODS: MTT assays were performed to determine the cell viability of gastric cancer and gastric epithelial cell lines (AGS, MKN45, SNU638, MKN74, HFE-145). A TUNEL assay and Western blotting were carried out to investigate apoptosis. Stat3 activity was measured by proteome profiler phospho kinase array, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. Mitochondria function was monitored with an XF24 analyzer and by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy using fluorescent probes for general mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). RESULTS: Genipin induced apoptosis in gastric cancer cells, including AGS and MKN45 cells. Genipin also reduced Mcl-1 mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we found that phosphorylation of Stat3 is regulated by Genipin. Additionally, the protein level of phospho Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) was decreased by Genipin treatment, indicating that the Stat3/JAK2/Mcl-1 pathway is suppressed by Genipin treatment in gastric cancer cells. Mcl-1 is closely related to mitochondrial function. These findings suggest that Genipin contributes to the collapse of mitochondrial functions like MMP. CONCLUSIONS: Genipin induced apoptosis by suppressing the Stat3/Mcl-1 pathway and led to mitochondrial dysfunction. Our results reveal a novel mechanism for the anti-cancer effect of Genipin in gastric cancer.","['Jo, Min Jee', 'Jeong, Soyeon', 'Yun, Hye Kyeong', 'Kim, Dae Yeong', 'Kim, Bo Ram', 'Kim, Jung Lim', 'Na, Yoo Jin', 'Park, Seong Hye', 'Jeong, Yoon A', 'Kim, Bu Gyeom', 'Ashktorab, Hassan', 'Smoot, Duane T', 'Heo, Jun Young', 'Han, Jeongsu', 'Lee, Dae-Hee', 'Oh, Sang Cheul']","['Jo MJ', 'Jeong S', 'Yun HK', 'Kim DY', 'Kim BR', 'Kim JL', 'Na YJ', 'Park SH', 'Jeong YA', 'Kim BG', 'Ashktorab H', 'Smoot DT', 'Heo JY', 'Han J', 'Lee DH', 'Oh SC']",,"['Graduate School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology/Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, 148, Gurodong-gil, Guro-gu, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology/Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, 148, Gurodong-gil, Guro-gu, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology/Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, 148, Gurodong-gil, Guro-gu, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Medicine, Howard University, Washington, DC, 20060, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Meharry Medical Center, Nashville, TN, 37208, USA.', 'Department of Medical Science, School of Medicine, Chung-nam National University, Munhwa-dong, Jung-gu, Daejeon, 301-747, Republic of Korea.', 'Department of Medical Science, School of Medicine, Chung-nam National University, Munhwa-dong, Jung-gu, Daejeon, 301-747, Republic of Korea.', 'Division of Oncology/Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, 148, Gurodong-gil, Guro-gu, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea. neogene@korea.ac.kr.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea. neogene@korea.ac.kr.', 'Division of Oncology/Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Korea University Guro Hospital, 148, Gurodong-gil, Guro-gu, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea. sachoh@korea.ac.kr.', 'Graduate School of Medicine, College of Medicine, Korea University, Seoul, 08308, Republic of Korea. sachoh@korea.ac.kr.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Iridoids)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '0 (STAT3 protein, human)', 'A3V2NE52YG (genipin)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Down-Regulation', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Humans', 'Iridoids/*pharmacology', 'Janus Kinase 2/metabolism', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*metabolism', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation/drug effects', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*metabolism/pathology', 'Transfection']",PMC6661087,['NOTNLM'],"['Apoptosis', 'Gastric cancer', 'Genipin', 'Mcl-1', 'Mitochondrial dysfunction', 'Stat3']",2019/07/29 06:00,2020/01/01 06:00,['2019/07/29 06:00'],"['2018/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/29 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/29 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5957-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5957-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Jul 27;19(1):739. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5957-x.,,20190727,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serum samples were collected from 40 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and analyzed with LC-MS/MS and ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) methods. RESULTS: The linearity range and correlation coefficient were 12.2-12,500ng/mL and 0.9987 for LC-MS/MS method, respectively. Limit of quantitation was determined as 24.4ng/mL. The retention times of imatinib and N-desmethyl imatinib were 1.66 and 1.60min, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the results of both methods. DISCUSSION: This LC-MS/MS method is cost-effective and has adavantages such as using low serum volumes, requiring simple pretreatment steps (only protein precipitation) and reduced turnaround times for analysis.","['Onmaz, Duygu Eryavuz', 'Abusoglu, Sedat', 'Unlu, Ali', 'Basturk, Abdulkadir', 'Dagli, Mehmet', 'Bagci, Metin', 'Tok, Oguzhan', 'Abusoglu, Gulsum']","['Onmaz DE', 'Abusoglu S', 'Unlu A', 'Basturk A', 'Dagli M', 'Bagci M', 'Tok O', 'Abusoglu G']",,"['Department of Biochemistry, Selcuk University Faculty of Medicine, Konya, Turkey.

We examined the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in IL-10 -1082G/A (rs1800896) in Sudanese acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and to assess the association between polymorphisms in IL-10 -1082G/A (rs1800896) and the hematological profile in Sudanese patients with AML. Methods: A total of 30 patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 30 control subjects were enrolled in this study. Blood samples were collected from all patients in EDTA containing tubes. Genomic DNA was extracted from all blood samples using salting out method. The genotypic variants of IL-10 (-1082G/A) polymorphism were detected by allele specific-PCR. Results: We found that (36.7%) of patients have homogenous GG genotype, (43.3%) have heterogeneous GA genotype and (20.0%) have AA genotype. GA genotype was significantly associated with higher risk of AML compared with the homozygous Genotypes (GG and AA), there is no association between IL-10 (-1082G/A) polymorphism and AML sub-type, gender, age group, mean of hematological parameters. Conclusion: Our study concluded that GA genotype of IL-10 -1082G/A (rs1800896) polymorphism is a risk factor for AML and G allele is insignificantly higher than A allele in AML patient.

These cases are referred to as ""cryptic"" or ""masked"" translocations. Additionally, fewer than 5% of APL cases have another partner gene fused to the RARA gene. The TBL1XR1-RARA fusion gene has recently been reported as a novel RARA-associated fusion gene. We report a case with TBL1XR1-RARA and a masked translocation that was not detected by conventional tests for RARA-associated translocations. Three-year-old girl was diagnosed with APL based morphological findings, although conventional tests for RARA-associated chimeric genes were negative. She received all-trans retinoic acid treatment, but that was not effective. She achieved a complete remission (CR) by conventional multidrug chemotherapy, but had extramedullary relapse 2 years after onset. She underwent cord blood transplantation (CBT) in her second CR and is currently alive. To investigate the underlying pathogenesis of this unique case, we performed whole-genome sequencing and found a cryptic insertion of RARA gene into the TBL1XR1 gene. The transcript of the chimeric gene, TBL1XR1-RARA, was confirmed as an in-frame fusion by RT-PCR. In conclusion, we found using next-generation sequencing (NGS) a TBL1XR1-RARA fusion in a child with variant APL without the classic karyotype. Cryptic insertion could also occur in cases other than APL with PML-RARA. Variant APL has many variants and NGS analysis should therefore be considered for APL variant cases, even for those without RARA translocation detected by conventional analysis.","['Osumi, Tomoo', 'Watanabe, Akihiro', 'Okamura, Kohji', 'Nakabayashi, Kazuhiko', 'Yoshida, Masanori', 'Tsujimoto, Shin-Ichi', 'Uchiyama, Meri', 'Takahashi, Hiroyuki', 'Tomizawa, Daisuke', 'Hata, Kenichiro', 'Kiyokawa, Nobutaka', 'Kato, Motohiro']","['Osumi T', 'Watanabe A', 'Okamura K', 'Nakabayashi K', 'Yoshida M', 'Tsujimoto SI', 'Uchiyama M', 'Takahashi H', 'Tomizawa D', 'Hata K', 'Kiyokawa N', 'Kato M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5536-6788', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1520-7007', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5145-1774']","['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, Research Institute, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Niigata Cancer Center Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Systems BioMedicine, Research Institute, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Maternal-Fetal Biology, Research Institute, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, Research Institute, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, Research Institute, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, Research Institute, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Toho University Omori Medical Center, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan."", 'Department of Maternal-Fetal Biology, Research Institute, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, Research Institute, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Research, Research Institute, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.', ""Children's Cancer Center, National Center for Child Health and Development, Tokyo, Japan.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (TBL1XR1 protein, human)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)']",IM,,"['Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gene Fusion/genetics', 'Humans', 'INDEL Mutation/genetics', 'Karyotype', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/genetics', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/*genetics/metabolism', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*genetics/metabolism', 'Translocation, Genetic/genetics', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*TBL1XR1/RARA', '*acute promyelocytic leukemia', '*children', '*cryptic insertion']",2019/07/28 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/07/28 06:00'],"['2019/05/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22791 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Nov;58(11):820-823. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22791.

Past studies have suggested additional cooperative mutations are required for leukemogenesis in FLT3-ITD+ AML. Using RNA sequencing and a next-generation targeted gene panel, we broadly characterize the co-occurring genomic alterations in pediatric cytogenetically normal (CN) FLT3-ITD+ AML to gain a deeper understanding of the clonal patterns and heterogeneity at diagnosis and relapse. We show that chimeric transcripts were present in 21 of 34 (62%) of de novo samples, 2 (6%) of these samples included a rare reoccurring fusion partner BCL11B. At diagnosis, the median number of mutations other than FLT3 per patient was 1 (range 0-3), which involved 8 gene pathways; WT1 and NPM1 mutations were frequently observed (35% and 24%, respectively). Fusion transcripts and high variant allele frequency (VAF) mutants, which included WT1, NPM1, SMARCA2, RAD21, and TYK2, were retained from diagnosis to relapse. We did observe reduction in VAF of simple or single mutation clones, but VAFs were preserved or expanded in more complex clones with multiple mutations. Our data provide the first insight into the genomic complexity of pediatric CN FLT3-ITD+ AML and could help stratify future targeted treatment strategies.","['Buelow, Daelynn R', 'Pounds, Stanley B', 'Wang, Yong-Dong', 'Shi, Lei', 'Li, Yongjin', 'Finkelstein, David', 'Shurtleff, Sheila', 'Neale, Geoffrey', 'Inaba, Hiroto', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Palumbo, Reid', 'Garrison, Dominique', 'Orwick, Shelley J', 'Blachly, James S', 'Kroll, Karl', 'Byrd, John C', 'Gruber, Tanja A', 'Rubnitz, Jeffrey E', 'Baker, Sharyn D']","['Buelow DR', 'Pounds SB', 'Wang YD', 'Shi L', 'Li Y', 'Finkelstein D', 'Shurtleff S', 'Neale G', 'Inaba H', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Palumbo R', 'Garrison D', 'Orwick SJ', 'Blachly JS', 'Kroll K', 'Byrd JC', 'Gruber TA', 'Rubnitz JE', 'Baker SD']",,"['Division of Pharmaceutics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Biostatistics, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Computational Biology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Pathology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Hartwell Center, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Division of Pharmaceutics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee, USA."", 'Division of Pharmaceutics, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.', 'Division of Hematology, Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Transl Sci,Clinical and translational science,101474067,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Gene Duplication', '*Genetic Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*genetics', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Precision Medicine', 'Prognosis', 'Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/genetics', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",PMC6853146,,,2019/07/28 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2019/07/28 06:00'],"['2019/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cts.12669 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Transl Sci. 2019 Nov;12(6):641-647. doi: 10.1111/cts.12669.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed characteristics and outcome of 253 CP-CML patients who had at least one mutation analysis performed using direct sequencing. Of them, 187 patients were early CP (ECP) and 66 were late CP late chronic phase (LCP) and 88% were treated with Imatinib as first-line TKI. RESULTS: Overall, 80 (32%) patients harbored BCR-ABL KD mutations. A BCR-ABL KD mutation was identified in 57% of patients, who progressed to accelerated or blastic phases (AP-BP), and 47%, 29%, 35%, 16% and 26% in patients in CP-CML at the time of mutation analysis who lost a complete hematologic response, failed to achieve or loss of a prior complete cytogenetic and major molecular response, respectively. Overall survival and cumulative incidence of CML-related death were significantly correlated with the disease phase whatever the absence or presence of a mutation was and for the latter the mutation subgroup (T315I vs P-loop vs non-T315I non-P-loop) (P<.001). Considering patients who were in CP at the time of mutation analysis, LCP mutated patients had a significantly worse outcome than ECP-mutated patients despite a lower incidence of T315I and P-loop mutations (P<.001). With a median follow-up from mutation analysis to last follow-up of 5 years, T315I and P-loop mutations were not associated with a worse outcome in ECP patients (P = .817).

This review summarizes updates regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic relevance of key mutations in AML. RECENT FINDINGS: Molecular mutations in genes including NPM1, CEBPA, FLT3, IDH1/2, TP53, RUNX1, and ASXL1 provide important prognostic and/or therapeutic information in AML, including best treatment strategies, transplant recommendations, and significance of MRD detection. Mutational analysis has led to the recognition of new entities including hereditary leukemia syndromes and clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). FLT3 and IDH1/2 mutations are the focus of targeted therapies in the treatment of AML. Advances in the molecular characterization of AML have provided an improved understanding of leukemogenesis and AML risk stratification, improved disease monitoring techniques, optimized therapeutic strategies, and have led to the development of novel molecular-targeted therapeutics. Ongoing genomic advances will continue to improve upon the outcome of patients with AML.","['DiNardo, Courtney', 'Lachowiez, Curtis']","['DiNardo C', 'Lachowiez C']",,"['Department of Leukemia, UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA. cdinardo@mdanderson.org.', 'Division of Cancer Medicine, MD Anderson Cancer Center, 1515 Holcombe Blvd, Houston, TX, 77030, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Hematol Malig Rep,Current hematologic malignancy reports,101262565,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', 'EC 1.1.1.41 (Isocitrate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.42.

However, several aspects of clonal selection still remain unclear. In this paper, we present a multi-compartmental continuously structured population model of selection dynamics in acute leukemias, which consists of a system of coupled integro-differential equations. Our model can be analysed in a more efficient way than classical models formulated in terms of ordinary differential equations. Exploiting the analytical tractability of this model, we investigate how clonal selection is shaped by the self-renewal fraction and the proliferation rate of leukemic cells at different maturation stages. We integrate analytical results with numerical solutions of a calibrated version of the model based on real patient data. In summary, our mathematical results formalise the biological notion that clonal selection is driven by the self-renewal fraction of leukemic stem cells and the clones that possess the highest value of this parameter are ultimately selected. Moreover, we demonstrate that the self-renewal fraction and the proliferation rate of non-stem cells do not have a substantial impact on clonal selection. Taken together, our results indicate that interclonal variability in the self-renewal fraction of leukemic stem cells provides the necessary substrate for clonal selection to act upon.","['Lorenzi, Tommaso', 'Marciniak-Czochra, Anna', 'Stiehl, Thomas']","['Lorenzi T', 'Marciniak-Czochra A', 'Stiehl T']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5831-6505'],"['School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of St Andrews, North Haugh, St Andrews, Fife, KY16 9SS, UK.', 'Institute of Applied Mathematics, BIOQUANT and IWR, Heidelberg University, Im Neuenheimer Feld 205, 69120, Heidelberg, Germany.

Using K562 cells engineered to have high or low CIP2A expression, we show that high CIP2A levels significantly bias cellular energy production towards oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) rather than glycolysis. Mass spectrometric analysis of CIP2A interactors and isobaric tagging for relative and absolute protein quantitation (ITRAQ) experiments identified many associated proteins, several of which co-vary with CIP2A level. Many of these CIP2A associating and co-varying proteins are involved in energy metabolism including OXPHOS, or in 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling, and manipulating AMPK activity mimics the effects of low/high CIP2A on OXPHOS. These effects are dependent on the availability of nutrients, driven by metabolic changes caused by CIP2A. CIP2A level did not affect starvation-induced AMPK phosphorylation of Unc-51 autophagy activating kinase 1 (ULK-1) at Ser555, but autophagy activity correlated with an increase in AMPK activity, to suggest that some AMPK processes are uncoupled by CIP2A, likely via its inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). The data demonstrate that AMPK mediates this novel CIP2A effect on energy generation in malignant cells.","['Austin, James A', 'Jenkins, Rosalind E', 'Austin, Gemma M', 'Glenn, Mark A', 'Dunn, Karen', 'Scott, Laura', 'Lucas, Claire M', 'Clark, Richard E']","['Austin JA', 'Jenkins RE', 'Austin GM', 'Glenn MA', 'Dunn K', 'Scott L', 'Lucas CM', 'Clark RE']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5384-5221'],"['Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K. JAustin@Liverpool.ac.uk.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Pharmacology, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Life Sciences, Chester Medical School, University of Chester, Chester, U.K.', 'Department of Molecular and Clinical Cancer Medicine, Institute of Translational Medicine, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (CIP2A protein, human)', '0 (Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ULK1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.31 (AMP-Activated Protein Kinases)']",IM,,"['AMP-Activated Protein Kinases/genetics/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Autoantigens/genetics/*metabolism', 'Autophagy-Related Protein-1 Homolog/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'K562 Cells', 'Membrane Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/antagonists & inhibitors/genetics/*metabolism', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/enzymology/genetics/pathology', '*Oxidative Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Smegmamorpha']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AMPK', '*CIP2A', '*PP2A', '*leukaemia', '*metabolic regulation', '*oxidative phosphorylation']",2019/07/28 06:00,2020/03/19 06:00,['2019/07/28 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/19 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']","['BCJ20190121 [pii]', '10.1042/BCJ20190121 [doi]']",epublish,Biochem J. 2019 Aug 15;476(15):2255-2269. doi: 10.1042/BCJ20190121.,"['(c) 2019 The Author(s).

CD30 is expressed on the surface of neoplastic mast cells (MC) in more than 50% of patients with advSM. Brentuximab vedotin (BV) is a CD30-directed antibody-drug conjugate with preclinical evidence supporting both an antineoplastic effect and an attenuation of immunoglobulin E-associated mediator release. These observations are the basis for this phase 2 trial of BV monotherapy (1.8 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks up to 8 cycles) in patients with CD30-positive advSM. The primary objective was to determine the efficacy of BV according to International Working Group-Myeloproliferative Neoplasms Research and Treatment-European Competence Network on Mastocytosis (IWG-MRT-ECNM) response criteria. Secondary objectives included evaluation of safety, changes in bone marrow (BM) MC burden, serum tryptase level, flow cytometric quantification of MC surface expression of CD30, and self-reported symptom burden. The trial enrolled 10 patients with a diagnosis of CD30(+) advSM (aggressive SM, SM with an associated hematologic neoplasm [SM-AHN], or mast cell leukemia [MCL]) with 1 or more signs of SM-related organ damage. According to IWG-MRT-ECNM criteria, none of the patients demonstrated better than stable disease with BV. In addition, there were no significant reductions in BM MC burden, serum tryptase levels, or MC surface expression of CD30. Self-reported symptom scores showed no durable improvement with BV treatment. We conclude that BV is not active as a single agent in CD30(+) advSM. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT01807598.","['Gotlib, Jason', 'Baird, John H', 'George, Tracy I', 'Langford, Cheryl', 'Reyes, Isabel', 'Abuel, Justin', 'Perkins, Cecelia', 'Schroeder, Kurt', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Verstovsek, Srdan']","['Gotlib J', 'Baird JH', 'George TI', 'Langford C', 'Reyes I', 'Abuel J', 'Perkins C', 'Schroeder K', 'Bose P', 'Verstovsek S']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8291-6546', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5478-7847']","['Division of Hematology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM; and.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford, CA.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Ki-1 Antigen)', '7XL5ISS668 (Brentuximab Vedotin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Brentuximab Vedotin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Ki-1 Antigen/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Male', 'Mastocytosis, Systemic/diagnosis/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6693006,,,2019/07/28 06:00,2020/08/01 06:00,['2019/07/28 06:00'],"['2019/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/01 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019000152 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000152 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Aug 13;3(15):2264-2271. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000152.,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,['ClinicalTrials.gov/NCT01807598'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report the first genome-wide association study of DS-ALL, comprising a meta-analysis of 4 independent studies, with 542 DS-ALL cases and 1192 DS controls. We identified 4 susceptibility loci at genome-wide significance: rs58923657 near IKZF1 (odds ratio [OR], 2.02; Pmeta = 5.32 x 10-15), rs3731249 in CDKN2A (OR, 3.63; Pmeta = 3.91 x 10-10), rs7090445 in ARID5B (OR, 1.60; Pmeta = 8.44 x 10-9), and rs3781093 in GATA3 (OR, 1.73; Pmeta = 2.89 x 10-8). We performed DS-ALL vs non-DS ALL case-case analyses, comparing risk allele frequencies at these and other established susceptibility loci (BMI1, PIP4K2A, and CEBPE) and found significant association with DS status for CDKN2A (OR, 1.58; Pmeta = 4.1 x 10-4). This association was maintained in separate regression models, both adjusting for and stratifying on CRLF2 overexpression and other molecular subgroups, indicating an increased penetrance of CDKN2A risk alleles in children with DS. Finally, we investigated functional significance of the IKZF1 risk locus, and demonstrated mapping to a B-cell super-enhancer, and risk allele association with decreased enhancer activity and differential protein binding. IKZF1 knockdown resulted in significantly higher proliferation in DS than non-DS lymphoblastoid cell lines. Our findings demonstrate a higher penetrance of the CDKN2A risk locus in DS and serve as a basis for further biological insights into DS-ALL etiology.","['Brown, Austin L', 'de Smith, Adam J', 'Gant, Vincent U', 'Yang, Wenjian', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Walsh, Kyle M', 'Chernus, Jonathan M', 'Kallsen, Noah A', 'Peyton, Shanna A', 'Davies, Gareth E', 'Ehli, Erik A', 'Winick, Naomi', 'Heerema, Nyla A', 'Carroll, Andrew J', 'Borowitz, Michael J', 'Wood, Brent L', 'Carroll, William L', 'Raetz, Elizabeth A', 'Feingold, Eleanor', 'Devidas, Meenakshi', 'Barcellos, Lisa F', 'Hansen, Helen M', 'Morimoto, Libby', 'Kang, Alice Y', 'Smirnov, Ivan', 'Healy, Jasmine', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Taub, Jeffrey W', 'Birch, Jillian M', 'Thompson, Pamela', 'Spector, Logan G', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S', 'DeWan, Andrew T', 'Mullighan, Charles G', 'Hunger, Stephen P', 'Pui, Ching-Hon', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Zwick, Michael E', 'Metayer, Catherine', 'Ma, Xiaomei', 'Mueller, Beth A', 'Sherman, Stephanie L', 'Wiemels, Joseph L', 'Relling, Mary V', 'Yang, Jun J', 'Lupo, Philip J', 'Rabin, Karen R']","['Brown AL', 'de Smith AJ', 'Gant VU', 'Yang W', 'Scheurer ME', 'Walsh KM', 'Chernus JM', 'Kallsen NA', 'Peyton SA', 'Davies GE', 'Ehli EA', 'Winick N', 'Heerema NA', 'Carroll AJ', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Wood BL', 'Carroll WL', 'Raetz EA', 'Feingold E', 'Devidas M', 'Barcellos LF', 'Hansen HM', 'Morimoto L', 'Kang AY', 'Smirnov I', 'Healy J', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sinnett D', 'Taub JW', 'Birch JM', 'Thompson P', 'Spector LG', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS', 'DeWan AT', 'Mullighan CG', 'Hunger SP', 'Pui CH', 'Loh ML', 'Zwick ME', 'Metayer C', 'Ma X', 'Mueller BA', 'Sherman SL', 'Wiemels JL', 'Relling MV', 'Yang JJ', 'Lupo PJ', 'Rabin KR']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA.', 'Center for Genetic Epidemiology, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', ""Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Neuro-epidemiology, Department of Neurosurgery, Duke University, Durham, NC.', 'Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA.', 'Avera Institute for Human Genetics, Sioux Falls, SD.', 'Avera Institute for Human Genetics, Sioux Falls, SD.', 'Avera Institute for Human Genetics, Sioux Falls, SD.', 'Avera Institute for Human Genetics, Sioux Falls, SD.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL.', 'Department of Pathology and.', 'Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD;

Only anecdotal comments have thus far supported the notion that research data may be altered by Corynebacterium bovis, an opportunistic cutaneous pathogen of immunodeficient mice. C. bovis disseminated by asymptomatic and clinically affected mice with hyperkeratotic dermatitis, resulting in resilient facility contamination and infectious recurrence. Herein we report that, compared with C. bovis PCR-negative counterparts, C. bovis PCR-positive NSGS mice developed periocular and facial hyperkeratosis and alopecia and had reduced metrics indicative of ineffective human CMML engraftment, including less thrombocytopenia, less splenomegaly, fewer CMML infiltrates in histopathologic sections of murine organs, and fewer human CD45+ cells in samples from murine spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood that were analyzed by flow cytometry. All CMML model metrics of engraftment were significantly reduced in the C. bovis PCR-positive cohort compared with the - negative cohort. In addition, a survey of comprehensive cancer center practices revealed that most murine facilities do not routinely test for C. bovis or broadly decontaminate the facility or its equipment after a C. bovis outbreak, thus increasing the likelihood of recurrence of invalidated studies. Our findings document that CMML engraftment of NSGS mice is diminished-and the integrity of murine research data jeopardized-by C. bovis infection of immunodeficient mice. In addition, our results indicate that C. bovis should be excluded from and not tolerated in murine facilities housing immunodeficient strains.","['Vedder, Alexis R', 'Miedel, Emily L', 'Ragland, Natalie H', 'Balasis, Maria E', 'Letson, Christopher T', 'Engelman, Robert W', 'Padron, Eric']","['Vedder AR', 'Miedel EL', 'Ragland NH', 'Balasis ME', 'Letson CT', 'Engelman RW', 'Padron E']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Comp Med,Comparative medicine,100900466,['Corynebacterium bovis'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Corynebacterium/*isolation & purification/pathogenicity', 'Corynebacterium Infections/*complications/diagnosis/immunology', 'Equipment Contamination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/*complications/immunology', 'Mice', 'Opportunistic Infections/complications/diagnosis/immunology', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",PMC6733163,,,2019/07/28 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2019/07/28 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.30802/AALAS-CM-18-000138 [doi]'],ppublish,Comp Med. 2019 Aug 1;69(4):276-282. doi: 10.30802/AALAS-CM-18-000138.

METHODS: Western blotting for caspase-3 and Hoechst 33225 staining was used to measure the expression level of apoptosis-related proteins under drug treatment. RESULTS: Our results showed that enhanced expression of cyclin E1 after transfection compromised apoptosis in HCC cells induced by regorafenib or sorafenib. Conversely, down-regulation of cyclin E1 gene expression or inhibition of cyclin E1 by the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors dinaciclib (DIN) or flavopiridol sensitized HCC cells to regorafenib and sorafenib by inducing apoptosis. The expression of Mcl-1, which is modulated by STAT3, plays a key role in regulating the therapeutic effects of CDK inhibitors. Xenograft experiments conducted to test the efficacy of regorafenib combined with DIN showed dramatic tumor inhibitory effects due to induction of apoptosis. Our results suggested that the level of cyclin E1 expression in HCCs may be used as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to assess the antitumor effects of regorafenib or sorafenib. CONCLUSIONS: Combining regorafenib and CDK inhibitors may enhance the clinical efficiency of the treatment of HCCs.","['Xu, Jianliang', 'Huang, Fei', 'Yao, Zhicheng', 'Jia, Changchang', 'Xiong, Zhiyong', 'Liang, Hao', 'Lin, Nan', 'Deng, Meihai']","['Xu J', 'Huang F', 'Yao Z', 'Jia C', 'Xiong Z', 'Liang H', 'Lin N', 'Deng M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2172-6081'],"['Hepatobilliary Surgery Department, The Third affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, No. 600, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Anesthesiology Department, The third affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'General surgery, The Third affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, No. 600, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, 510630, Guangdong, China. yaozhch2@mail.sysu.edu.cn.', 'Cell & Gene therapy center, The Third affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen Uuniversity, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'General surgery, The Third affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, No. 600, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, 510630, Guangdong, China.', 'General surgery, The Third affiliated hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, No. 600, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, 510630, Guangdong, China.', 'Hepatobilliary Surgery Department, The Third affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, No. 600, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China.', 'Hepatobilliary Surgery Department, The Third affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, No. 600, Tianhe District, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China. dengmh@mail.sysu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Commun Signal,Cell communication and signaling : CCS,101170464,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (CCNE1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclic N-Oxides)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyridines)', '0 (Pyridinium Compounds)', '0 (STAT3 Transcription Factor)', '24T2A1DOYB (regorafenib)', '45AD6X575G (alvocidib)', '4V8ECV0NBQ (dinaciclib)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclic N-Oxides', 'Cyclin E/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Drug Synergism', 'Flavonoids/pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Indolizines', 'Liver Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/genetics', 'Oncogene Proteins/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phenylurea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Piperidines/pharmacology', 'Prognosis', 'Pyridines/*pharmacology', 'Pyridinium Compounds/pharmacology', 'STAT3 Transcription Factor/metabolism', 'Sorafenib/pharmacology', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6660968,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cyclin E1', '*Hepatocellular carcinoma', '*Mcl-1', '*Regorafenib']",2019/07/28 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/07/28 06:00'],"['2019/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/15 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12964-019-0398-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s12964-019-0398-3 [pii]']",epublish,Cell Commun Signal. 2019 Jul 26;17(1):85. doi: 10.1186/s12964-019-0398-3.,,20190726,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the ABL kinase (such as imatinib) has dramatically improved survival of CML and Ph+ ALL patients. However, primary and acquired resistance to TKIs remains a clinical challenge. Ph+ leukemia patients who achieve a complete cytogenetic (CCR) or deep molecular response (MR) (>/=4.5log reduction in BCR-ABL1 transcripts) represent long-term survivors. Thus, the fast and early eradication of leukemic cells predicts MR and is the prime clinical goal for these patients. We show here that the first-in-class inhibitor of the Nedd8-activating enzyme (NAE1) MLN4924 effectively induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in Ph+ leukemia cells, and sensitized leukemic cells for ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and hydroxyurea (HU). We demonstrate that MLN4924 induced DNA damage in Ph+ leukemia cells by provoking the activation of an intra S-phase checkpoint, which was enhanced by imatinib co-treatment. The combination of MLN4924 and imatinib furthermore triggered a dramatic shift in the expression of MCL1 and NOXA. Our data offers a clear rationale to explore the clinical activity of MLN4924 (alone and in combination with ABL TKI) in Ph+ leukemia patients.","['Bahjat, Mahnoush', 'de Wilde, Guus', 'van Dam, Tijmen', 'Maas, Chiel', 'Bloedjes, Timon', 'Bende, Richard J', 'van Noesel, Carel J M', 'Luijks, Dieuwertje M', 'Eldering, Eric', 'Kersten, Marie Jose', 'Guikema, Jeroen E J']","['Bahjat M', 'de Wilde G', 'van Dam T', 'Maas C', 'Bloedjes T', 'Bende RJ', 'van Noesel CJM', 'Luijks DM', 'Eldering E', 'Kersten MJ', 'Guikema JEJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0928-9977', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5173-3138', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7907-7390', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6894-3441']","['Department of Pathology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Experimental Immunology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Amsterdam University Centers, location AMC, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pathology, Amsterdam University Medical Centers, location AMC, University of Amsterdam , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.', 'Lymphoma and Myeloma Center Amsterdam (LYMMCARE) , Amsterdam , The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell Cycle,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",101137841,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (Cyclopentanes)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 6.2.1.45 (Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (NAE protein, human)', 'S3AZD8D215 (pevonedistat)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclopentanes/*pharmacology', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'S Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Ubiquitin-Activating Enzymes/*antagonists & inhibitors']",PMC6738521,['NOTNLM'],"['*DNA damage', '*Neddylation', '*Ph+ leukemia']",2019/07/28 06:00,2020/09/02 06:00,['2019/07/28 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384101.2019.1646068 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Cycle. 2019 Sep;18(18):2307-2322. doi: 10.1080/15384101.2019.1646068.

Nanoscale drug carriers are required to be investigated for delivery of actives at cellular level for treatment of various cancer types. Solid lipid nanoparticles (CLX-SLN), nanostructured lipid carriers (CLX-NLC) and a nanoemulsion (CLX-NE) of celecoxib (CLX), a selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, were formulated for use in remedy of breast cancer and acute promyelocytic leukemia. The hot high pressure homogenization technique was employed to product formulations. Scanning electron micrographs were utilized for morphological characterization of formulations. Laser diffraction (LD), photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used for examination of their physical stability by storing them at various temperatures. Drug release profiles of formulations were obtained. Their activity on cancer cells was investigated in the cell culture experiments. Stable formulations having homogenous size distribution were obtained below 200nm with high drug payloads between 93.76% and 96.66%. Nanoparticles were ascertained to contribute controlled drug release. CLX-SLN induced the highest decrease in numbers of human breast cancer and human acute promyelocytic leukemia cells through the activation of the cell death cascades especially apoptosis in comparison to CLX-NLC, CLX-NE and the pure CLX application (p<0.05). Nanoformulations of CLX optimized in this study were found to have various advantages expected from sophisticated drug delivery systems in order to achieve higher CLX efficiency at cellular level.

Importantly, intensive therapy tended to improve the survival of e/s-AML patients without increasing the risk of early death, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) could rescue the prognosis of s-AML, which should be recommended for the treatment of fit patients.","['Wang, Shi-Yang', 'Cheng, Wen-Yan', 'Mao, Yuan-Fei', 'Zhu, Yong-Mei', 'Liu, Fu-Jia', 'Ma, Ting-Ting', 'Shen, Yang']","['Wang SY', 'Cheng WY', 'Mao YF', 'Zhu YM', 'Liu FJ', 'Ma TT', 'Shen Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9649-7407'],"['Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Shanghai Institute of Hematology, Department of Hematology, Ruijin Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6899678,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'elderly', 'genetic', 'prognosis', 'secondary']",2019/07/28 06:00,2019/11/20 06:00,['2019/07/27 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2656 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2019 Oct;37(4):456-463. doi: 10.1002/hon.2656.

It is unclear whether the elevated risk would be maintained when compared with unaffected controls. METHODS: Cancer outcomes were compared among 257 LRRK2-PD patients, 712 IPD patients, and 218 controls recruited from 7 LRRK2 consortium centers using mixed-effects logistic regression. Data were then pooled with a previous study to examine cancer risk between 401 LRRK2-PD and 1946 IPD patients. RESULTS: Although cancer prevalence was similar among LRRK2-PD patients (32.3%), IPD patients (27.5%), and controls (27.5%; P = 0.33), LRRK2-PD had increased risks of leukemia (odds ratio [OR] = 4.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-10.61) and skin cancer (OR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.09-2.37). In the pooled analysis, LRRK2-PD patients had also elevated risks of leukemia (OR = 9.84; 95% CI, 2.15-44.94) and colon cancer (OR = 2.34; 95% CI, 1.15-4.74) when compared with IPD patients. CONCLUSIONS: The increased risks of leukemia as well as skin and colon cancers among LRRK2-PD patients suggest that LRRK2 mutations heighten risks of certain cancers.

There are few similar cases reported, and there are no evidence-based medicine guidelines for the treatment. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 52-year-old man was diagnosed with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease in November 2011, and received a stent placement in the left anterior descending coronary artery 1 year later. One day after the surgery, his laboratory tests showed pancytopenia. DIAGNOSES: Based on precise diagnosis of leukemia, namely cell morphology, immunology, cytogenetics, and molecular biological typing, the patient was diagnosed with AML-M2. INTERVENTIONS: The patient received idarubicin with cytarabine in 1st cycles, and single cytarabine regimen was used in 2nd and 3rd cycles for the accumulative toxicity of idarubicin in postinduction chemotherapy. Meanwhile, staged-treatment strategy was implemented by using antiplatelet drugs during different chemotherapy phases, and personalized pharmaceutical care on the basis of the recognition of potential adverse effects of chemotherapy regimen. OUTCOMES: Until now, the disease-free survival in the patient has been over 6 years, and he is still followed up in clinic. LESSONS: Although leukemia accompanied with coronary heart disease, even after receiving the coronary stenting therapy is rarely seen in clinic, the treatment with antiplatelet drugs for post chemotherapy patients with coronary disease is necessary. Clinical pharmacists are supposed to be more proficient in developing personalized drug treatment strategies, especially maintaining the balance between the effect and the risk in difficult and complex cases.","['Wang, Jie', 'Chen, Rong', 'Lin, Xiaoqi', 'Wang, Yubo', 'Wang, Jian-Hua', 'Wu, Yun']","['Wang J', 'Chen R', 'Lin X', 'Wang Y', 'Wang JH', 'Wu Y']",,"['Department of Pharmacy.', 'Department of Hematology.', 'Department of Pharmacy.', 'Department of Pharmacy.', 'Department of Pharmacy.', ""Department of General Medicine, First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University, Urumqi, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,['0 (Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Coronary Disease/*complications/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Percutaneous Coronary Intervention/*methods', 'Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors/administration & dosage', 'Thromboembolism/prevention & control']",PMC6709177,,,2019/07/28 06:00,2019/08/14 06:00,['2019/07/27 06:00'],"['2019/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000016586 [doi]', '00005792-201907260-00072 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Jul;98(30):e16586. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000016586.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this phenomenon is also observed with immune checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumours. It is still poorly understood and its incidence is underestimated. TFR has been associated with morbidity, therefore, early recognition and management of patients with TFR is critical. An exhaustive literature research between 1985 and 2016 was performed using PubMed; American Society of Clinical Oncology and American Society of Hematology abstracts reporting TFR or pseudoprogression were identified. The incidence of TFR in CLL ranged from 28 to 58%. Tumour response in patients treated beyond progression was reported in 9.7% with ipilimumab, 10% with nivolumab, 6.7 and 12% with pembrolizumab, and in renal cell carcinoma 69% with nivolumab. Rare life-threatening or fatal cases were reported; symptoms were usually mild. Studies showed that treating patients beyond progression yielded tumour responses, considering TFR as predictive of response. Treatment with immunomodulatory agents is associated with TFR, often misinterpreted as progression. Therefore, the identification of appropriate clinical benefit criteria and the use of immune-related response criteria in prospective trials for a better understanding are compulsory.","['Taleb B, Amina']",['Taleb B A'],,"['Oncology Department, Groupe Hospitalier Sud Ile-de-France, Melun, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Anticancer Drugs,Anti-cancer drugs,9100823,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology']",PMC6749970,,,2019/07/28 06:00,2020/09/17 06:00,['2019/07/27 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/CAD.0000000000000814 [doi]'],ppublish,Anticancer Drugs. 2019 Oct;30(9):953-958. doi: 10.1097/CAD.0000000000000814.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bovine leukemia virus (BLV) infects cattle worldwide, imposing an economic impact on the dairy cattle industry. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the molecular epidemiology of BLV in Iran.Methodology. Blood samples taken from 280 cows aged over 2 years old from 13 provinces of Iran were used for leukocyte count and blocking ELISA. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes of BLV-infected samples and fetal lamb kidney cells to perform PCR of partial env, rex and tax genes and long-terminal-repeat region. The PCR products were sequenced, the phylogenetic tree of each gene was constructed, and nucleotide and amino acid sequence pair distances were calculated.Results. The frequency of BLV infection was 32.8 % among animals and was 80 % among provinces. In BLV seropositive animals, the rate of persistent lymphocytosis was 36.9 %. The constructed phylogenetic trees showed the presence of two BLV genotypes (1 and 4) in Iranian strains. As previous studies, our results showed that the env gene was more variable than previously thought, the Rex protein could withstand more amino acid changes compared to the Tax protein, and no significant differences were observed in average changes of the nucleotide of these genes between clinical stages.Conclusions. Our data indicates an increase in the frequency of this infection in Iran. This is the first study report of the presence of BLV genotype 4 in Iranian farms. These findings may have an important role in the control and prevention of BLV infection in Iran and other countries.","['Kazemimanesh, Monireh', 'Madadgar, Omid', 'Steinbach, Falko', 'Choudhury, Bhudipa', 'Azadmanesh, Kayhan']","['Kazemimanesh M', 'Madadgar O', 'Steinbach F', 'Choudhury B', 'Azadmanesh K']",,"['Department of Molecular Virology, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran.', 'Virology Department, Animal and Plant Health Agency, Addlestone, UK.', 'OIE Reference Laboratory for EBL, Department of Virology, Animal and Plant Health Agency, Weybridge, UK.', 'Department of Molecular Virology, Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Iran.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Enzootic Bovine Leukosis/epidemiology/*virology', 'Female', 'Genome, Viral', 'Genotype', 'Iran/epidemiology', 'Leukemia Virus, Bovine/genetics/*isolation & purification', '*Molecular Epidemiology', 'Phylogeny']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bovine Leukemia Virus', '*Iran', '*Molecular Epidemiology', '*Phylogeny']",2019/07/28 06:00,2020/04/14 06:00,['2019/07/27 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1099/jgv.0.001303 [doi]'],ppublish,J Gen Virol. 2019 Sep;100(9):1315-1327. doi: 10.1099/jgv.0.001303.

Patients treated for Ewing sarcoma are at substantial risk of SMN, with a broad range of reported secondary cancers.","['Caruso, Jennifer', 'Shulman, David S', 'DuBois, Steven G']","['Caruso J', 'Shulman DS', 'DuBois SG']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5994-2604', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0882-738X']","['Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts.', ""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts."", ""Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Systematic Review']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', '*Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Carcinoma/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Melanoma/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Second Primary/epidemiology/*etiology/therapy', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Risk', 'Sarcoma/epidemiology/etiology/therapy', '*Sarcoma, Ewing/drug therapy/radiotherapy/surgery', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Ewing sarcoma', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*myelodysplastic syndrome', '*osteosarcoma', '*second malignancy', '*systematic review']",2019/07/28 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,['2019/07/27 06:00'],"['2019/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27938 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Nov;66(11):e27938. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27938.

In contrast to other leukemias where therapy is used to reduce leukemic burden prior to transplant, many patients with JMML proceed directly to HCT with active disease. The objective of this study was to elucidate whether pre-HCT therapy has an effect on the molecular burden of disease and how this affects outcome post-HCT. PROCEDURE: Twenty-one patients with JMML who received pre-HCT therapy and were transplanted at UCSF were analyzed in this study. The mutant allele frequency of the driver mutation was assessed before and after pre-HCT therapy, using custom amplicon next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: Of the 21 patients, seven patients (33%) responded to therapy with a significant reduction in their mutant allele frequency and were classified as molecular responders. Six of these patients received moderate-intensity chemotherapy, one patient received only azacitidine. The 5-year progression-free survival after HCT of molecular responders was 100% versus 61% for nonresponders (P = .12). Survival of molecular nonresponders was not improved by use of high-intensity conditioning, but patients were salvaged if they experienced severe graft versus host disease. There were no baseline clinical characteristics that were associated with response to pre-HCT therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the myelodysplastic nature of JMML, patients treated with pre-HCT therapy can achieve molecular remissions. These patients experienced a trend toward improved outcomes post-HCT. Importantly, molecular testing can be helpful to distinguish between responders and nonresponders and should become an integral part of clinical care.","['Hecht, Anna', 'Meyer, Julia', 'Chehab, Farid F', 'White, Kristie L', 'Magruder, Kevin', 'Dvorak, Christopher C', 'Loh, Mignon L', 'Stieglitz, Elliot']","['Hecht A', 'Meyer J', 'Chehab FF', 'White KL', 'Magruder K', 'Dvorak CC', 'Loh ML', 'Stieglitz E']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4789-4553', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6146-3952', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7032-4623']","[""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, California.', 'Department of Pathology, University of California, San Francisco, California.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, California.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, California.', ""Department of Pediatrics, Benioff Children's Hospital, University of California, San Francisco, California."", 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",IM,,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'DNA, Neoplasm/blood', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Monitoring', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Genes, Neoplasm', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/therapy', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile/blood/*drug therapy/genetics/therapy', 'Male', '*Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Progression-Free Survival', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', '*Sequence Analysis, DNA', 'Splenectomy', 'Transplantation Conditioning', 'Tumor Burden/*drug effects']",PMC6754267,['NOTNLM'],"['*JMML', '*chemotherapy', '*molecular response', '*outcome', '*stem cell transplantation']",2019/07/28 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,['2019/07/27 06:00'],"['2019/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27948 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Nov;66(11):e27948. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27948.

In the absence of chemotherapeutic agents, no significant differences in activities of the studied enzymes in cells of the initial strain and strains resistant to cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and rubomycin were observed. Compounds to which resistance was developed did not significantly affect activity of enzymes in cells of drug-resistant strains, while the use of compounds that were not resistance inductors was accompanied by a significant decrease in enzyme activity in cells resistant to cisplatin and rubomycin. In cells of strains resistant to cisplatin and cyclophosphamide, the content of reduced glutathione significantly differed from that in the initial strain. In addition, the concentration of reduced glutathione in cells of cyclophosphamide-resistant strain considerably decreased upon addition of the drug producing a therapeutic effect. Our findings suggest that the mechanism of resistance of in vivo derived cyclophosphamide resistant cell strain is related to increased level of reduced glutathione and activity of its metabolism.","['Balakina, A A', 'Raevskaya, T A', 'Pavlov, V S', 'Mumyatova, V A', 'Goncharova, S A', ""Terent'ev, A A""]","['Balakina AA', 'Raevskaya TA', 'Pavlov VS', 'Mumyatova VA', 'Goncharova SA', ""Terent'ev AA""]",,"['Institute of Problems Chemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Chernogolovka, Moscow Region, Russia. balakina@icp.ac.ru.', 'Scientific And Educational Center ""Medical Chemistry"", Moscow Regional State University, Mytishchi, Moscow Region, Russia. balakina@icp.ac.ru.', 'Institute of Problems Chemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Chernogolovka, Moscow Region, Russia.', 'Institute of Problems Chemical Physics, Russian Academy of Sciences, Chernogolovka, Moscow Region, Russia.', 'M.

These standards provide dose-based guidance for decision making (e.g., on sheltering or relocation) via generic criteria in terms of effective dose in the range from 20 mSv per year, during transition from emergency to existing exposure situation, to 100 mSv, acute or annual, in the urgent phase of a nuclear accident. The purpose of this paper was to examine how such dose reference levels directly translate into radiation-related risks of the main stochastic detrimental health effects (cancer). Methodologies, provided by the World Health Organization after the Fukushima accident, for calculating the lifetime and 20 year cancer risks and for attributing relevant organ doses from effective doses, have been applied here for this purpose with new software, designed to be available for use immediately after a nuclear accident. A new feature in this software is a comprehensive accounting for uncertainty via simulation technique, so that the risks may now be presented with realistic confidence intervals. The types of cancer risks considered here are time-integrated over lifetime and the first 20 years after exposure for all solid cancers and either the most radiation-sensitive types of cancer, i.e., leukaemia and female breast cancer, or the most radiation-relevant type of cancer occurring early in life, i.e., thyroid. It is demonstrated here how reference dose levels translate differently into specific cancer risk levels (with varying confidence interval sizes), depending on age at exposure, gender, time-frame at-risk and type of cancer considered. This demonstration applies German population data and considers external exposures. Further work is required to comprehensively extend this methodology to internal exposures that are likely to be important in the early stages of a nuclear accident. A discussion is provided here on the potential for such risk-based information to be used by decision makers, in the urgent and transition phases of nuclear emergencies, to identify protective measures (e.g., sheltering, evacuation) in a differential way (i.e., for particularly susceptible sub-groups of a population).","['Walsh, Linda', 'Ulanowski, Alexander', 'Kaiser, Jan Christian', 'Woda, Clemens', 'Raskob, Wolfgang']","['Walsh L', 'Ulanowski A', 'Kaiser JC', 'Woda C', 'Raskob W']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7399-9191'],"['Department of Physics, Science Faculty, University of Zurich, Winterthurerstrasse 190, 8057, Zurich, Switzerland. linda.walsh@uzh.ch.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'IAEA Laboratories, International Atomic Energy Agency, 2444, Seibersdorf, Austria.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Institute of Radiation Medicine, Helmholtz Zentrum Munchen - German Research Center for Environmental Health, Ingolstadter Landstrasse 1, 85764, Neuherberg, Germany.', 'Institute for Nuclear and Energy Technologies, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Hermann-von-Helmholtz Platz 1, 76344, Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Radiat Environ Biophys,Radiation and environmental biophysics,0415677,,IM,,"['*Emergencies', 'Humans', 'International Agencies', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Monitoring', 'Radiation Protection/*methods', 'Risk Factors']",PMC6768908,['NOTNLM'],"['*Health risk assessment', '*Lifetime risk', '*Nuclear accidents', '*Radiation protection', '*Radiological emergency response']",2019/07/28 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/07/27 06:00'],"['2018/12/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00411-019-00809-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00411-019-00809-x [pii]']",ppublish,Radiat Environ Biophys. 2019 Nov;58(4):539-552. doi: 10.1007/s00411-019-00809-x.

Recent advances in chemotherapy have made ALL a curable hematological malignancy. In children, there is 25% chance of disease relapse, typically in the central nervous system. While in adults, there is a higher chance of relapse. ALL may affect B-cell or T-cell lineages. Different genetic alterations characterize the two ALL forms. Deregulated Notch, either Notch1 or Notch3, and CXCR4 receptor signaling are involved in ALL disease development and progression. By analyzing their relevant roles in the pathogenesis of the two ALL forms, new molecular mechanisms able to modulate cancer cell invasion may be visualized. Notably, the partnership between Notch and CXCR4 may have considerable implications in understanding the complexity of T- and B-ALL. These two receptor pathways intersect other critical signals in the proliferative, differentiation, and metabolic programs of lymphocyte transformation. Also, the identification of the crosstalks in leukemia-stroma interaction within the tumor microenvironment may unveil new targetable mechanisms in disease relapse. Further studies are required to identify new challenges and opportunities to develop more selective and safer therapeutic strategies in ALL progression, possibly contributing to improve conventional hematological cancer therapy.","['Tsaouli, Georgia', 'Ferretti, Elisabetta', 'Bellavia, Diana', 'Vacca, Alessandra', 'Felli, Maria Pia']","['Tsaouli G', 'Ferretti E', 'Bellavia D', 'Vacca A', 'Felli MP']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7265-6429', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5728-2537', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0006-5379', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5765-2611']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena 291, 00161 Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Molecular Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena 291, 00161 Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Roma, Italy.', 'Department of Experimental Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Viale Regina Elena 324, 00161 Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Egypt,J Immunol Res,Journal of immunology research,101627166,"['0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (CXCR4 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (NOTCH1 protein, human)', '0 (NOTCH3 protein, human)', '0 (Receptor, Notch1)', '0 (Receptor, Notch3)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Central Nervous System/metabolism/pathology', 'Chemokine CXCL12/metabolism', 'Child', 'Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Precursor T-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Receptor, Notch1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptor, Notch3/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, CXCR4/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Tumor Microenvironment/immunology']",PMC6620846,,,2019/07/28 06:00,2019/12/21 06:00,['2019/07/27 06:00'],"['2018/11/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/5601396 [doi]'],epublish,J Immunol Res. 2019 Jun 27;2019:5601396. doi: 10.1155/2019/5601396. eCollection 2019.,,20190627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, a small minority of Ph+ ALL patients express variant BCR-ABL1 transcript types, usually due to splicing of alternative BCR or ABL1 exons. Whether patients expressing these rare, variant BCR-ABL1 transcripts have a distinct phenotype or response to therapy is not known due to the limited number of reported cases. Here, we report the presenting features of Ph+ ALL in a young adult with a variant e13a3 BCR-ABL1 fusion. Molecular monitoring reflected the disease response from diagnosis through allogeneic stem cell transplantation which resulted in undetectable e13a3 BCR-ABL1 transcripts. This case highlights the value of molecular monitoring in Ph+ ALL patients with variant BCR-ABL1 transcripts and the requirement for standardization of such assays.","['Crampe, Mireille', 'Kearney, Laura', ""O'Brien, David"", 'Bacon, C Larry', ""O'Shea, Derville"", 'Langabeer, Stephen E']","['Crampe M', 'Kearney L', ""O'Brien D"", 'Bacon CL', ""O'Shea D"", 'Langabeer SE']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0588-7427', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6119-158X']","[""Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", ""Department of Haematology, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland."", 'Department of Haematology, Cork University Hospital, Cork, Ireland.', ""Cancer Molecular Diagnostics, St. James's Hospital, Dublin 8, Ireland.""]",['eng'],['Case Reports'],United States,Case Rep Hematol,Case reports in hematology,101576456,,,,,PMC6620857,,,2019/07/28 06:00,2019/07/28 06:01,['2019/07/27 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/27 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/28 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/9635070 [doi]'],epublish,Case Rep Hematol. 2019 Jun 27;2019:9635070. doi: 10.1155/2019/9635070. eCollection 2019.,,20190627,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The recognition of CHIP as a nontraditional risk factor challenges specialists in hematology/oncology and cardiovascular medicine alike. Should we screen for CHIP? If so, in whom? How should we assess cardiovascular risk in people with CHIP? How should we manage the excess cardiovascular risk in the absence of an evidence base?

Rapid data acquisition and improved detection limits of direct infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) are paving the way for applications of metabolomics in preclinical screening, opening new opportunities in drug discovery and personalized medicine. Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture systems, which mimic the in vivo cell microenvironment, are well recognized as tissue and organ substitutes. Here, we investigated cell viability and induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in stromal cells cultured in various 3D systems as well as the standard monolayer culture to evaluate which system provides the most favorable growing conditions. The selected 3D system was then tested for use in 3D co-culture of leukemia and stromal cells for DIMS-based high-throughput/high-content metabolic drug screens. The NanobioMatrix-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (NBM-PCL) scaffold resulted in the lowest ROS production, supported rapid cell proliferation, and was suitable for the 96- and 384-well plate formats. Doxorubicin treatment in leukemia co-cultured with stromal cells induced some unique metabolic responses that drastically differed from those observed in leukemia cells alone. The DIMS results also showed that the drug-induced metabolic modulations in both normal and cancer cells were weakened by co-culturing even at high treatment doses, thereby demonstrating the value of the 3D co-culture high-content metabolic drug screen. In conclusion, we optimized a high sample throughput method for 3D co-culture with a DIMS-based high-content metabolic drug screen and drug development.","['Lu, Xiyuan', 'Lodi, Alessia', 'Konopleva, Marina', 'Tiziani, Stefano']","['Lu X', 'Lodi A', 'Konopleva M', 'Tiziani S']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7230-0307'],"['1 Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.', '2 Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.', '1 Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.', '2 Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.', '3 Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '1 Department of Nutritional Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.', '2 Department of Pediatrics, Dell Medical School, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,SLAS Discov,SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,101697563,,IM,,"['*Cell Culture Techniques', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', '*Coculture Techniques', '*High-Throughput Screening Assays', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Metabolome', '*Metabolomics/methods', 'Microscopy, Confocal', 'Stromal Cells/drug effects/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*co-culture', '*direct-infusion mass spectrometry', '*metabolomics', '*three-dimensional culture']",2019/07/28 06:00,2020/05/14 06:00,['2019/07/27 06:00'],"['2019/07/28 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/14 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/27 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/2472555219860446 [doi]'],ppublish,SLAS Discov. 2019 Sep;24(8):817-828. doi: 10.1177/2472555219860446.

No studies have assessed the long-term post-deployment health of this US cohort. Based on the health concerns raised in studies of military personnel from other countries, this study focused on mortality due to Leukemia, respiratory disease, respiratory cancer, and heart disease. METHODS: This study compared the post-war cause-specific mortality of 53,320 veterans who deployed to Bosnia/Kosovo between 1996-2002 to that of 117,267 veterans who also served in the military between 1996-2002, but were not deployed to Bosnia/Kosovo. Expressed as standardized mortality ratios (SMR)s the cause-specific mortality for both deployed and non-deployed were compared separately to that of the US general population. Cause-specific mortality risks among Bosnia/Kosovo veterans relative to that of non-deployed veterans were assessed using Hazard Ratios (HR)s generated by Cox proportional-hazards models. RESULTS: The overall mortality of both deployed and non-deployed veterans was almost half that of the US population, SMR=0.59, 95%, C.I., 0.55-0.62 and SMR=0.66, 95%, C.I., 0.64-0.68, respectively. Neither group of veterans had any excess of disease related mortality compared to that of the US population. Compared to non-deployed, deployed veterans did not experience any increased risks for any of the diseases of a priori interest. CONCLUSION: It does not appear that US military deployed to Bosnia/Kosovo have any increased risks of disease related mortality. However, this study would not have been able to detect increased risk of cancers with latency periods that exceeded the 18 years of follow-up available in this study.","['Bullman, Tim', 'Schneiderman, Aaron']","['Bullman T', 'Schneiderman A']",,"['Post Deployment Health Services, US Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Ave, Washington DC, 20420, United States.

Aquagenic pruritus (AP) is not only PV symptom, but is also present in ET. The presence of pruritus in PV is associated with a lower risk of arterial thrombosis. AIMS: To date, no equivalent study has been done to analyse the impact of AP for ET patients. MATERIALS & METHODS: We used the data from our cohort of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms seen in our institution (OBENE database, NCT02897297). We collect information at diagnosis, presence or not of AP and all types of complications during their follow-up. To avoid masked PV, all JAK2 positive cases were tested isotopic red mass cell if appropriate. RESULTS: Among 396 ET patients, presence of AP was found in 42 (10.6%). ET patients with AP were more proliferative, more symptomatic at diagnosis and more difficult to treat. Furthermore, they presented increased risk of thromboses (30.9 versus 17%, P = .03; OR = 2.2 [1.01;4.66]) and phenotypic evolutions (33.3 versus 13.3%, P = .0007; OR = 3.2 [1.44;6.77]), during follow-up. DISCUSSION: Aquagenic pruritus is classically associated to PV. But we confirmed here that AP is also present in ET and characterizes patients with higher risk of morbidity (thrombotic events and phenotypic evolutions). CONCLUSIONS: The systematic determination of the presence of AP in ET patients should permit us to better identify these high-risk patients for better management and follow-up.","['Le Gall-Ianotto, Christelle', 'Le Calloch, Ronan', 'Couturier, Marie-Anne', 'Chauveau, Aurelie', 'Lippert, Eric', 'Carre, Jean-Luc', 'Misery, Laurent', 'Ianotto, Jean-Christophe']","['Le Gall-Ianotto C', 'Le Calloch R', 'Couturier MA', 'Chauveau A', 'Lippert E', 'Carre JL', 'Misery L', 'Ianotto JC']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0158-2850'],"['Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Interactions Neurons-Keratinocytes, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Department of Internal Medicine-Hematology, Hospital of Cornouaille, Quimper, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'France Intergroup of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (FIM), France.', 'Laboratory of Hematology, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'France Intergroup of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (FIM), France.', 'Laboratory of Interactions Neurons-Keratinocytes, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Biochemistry, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Department of Dermatology, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Laboratory of Interactions Neurons-Keratinocytes, University of Brest, Brest, France.', 'Department of Clinical Hematology, University Hospital of Brest, Brest, France.', 'France Intergroup of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (FIM), France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Thromb Haemost,Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,101170508,['059QF0KO0R (Water)'],IM,,"['Aged', 'Databases, Factual', 'Disease Progression', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Pruritus/blood/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/blood/*complications/diagnosis', 'Thrombosis/blood/diagnosis/*etiology', 'Time Factors', 'Water/*adverse effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*JAK2 mutation', '*aquagenic pruritus', '*essential thrombocythemia', '*phenotypic evolution', '*thrombosis']",2019/07/26 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2019/07/26 06:00'],"['2019/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/22 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/jth.14588 [doi]'],ppublish,J Thromb Haemost. 2019 Nov;17(11):1950-1955. doi: 10.1111/jth.14588.

Based on targeted-capture sequencing, we retrospectively analyzed the correlation between EMMs and prognosis in 83 IR-AML patients treated with decitabine in combination with cytarabine, aclarubicin hydrochloride and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (DCAG, n = 35) or ""7 + 3"" induction regimens (n = 48). In the multivariate analyses, EMM (+) patients did not show any statistically significant difference in remission rates from EMM (-) patients in the DCAG group (p > 0.05), but achieved inferior complete remission (CR; p = 0.03) and overall remission rates (ORR; p = 0.04) after the first course of standard induction regimens (p < 0.05). In the EMM (-) cohort, the DCAG group showed the tendency of adverse total CR (p = 0.06). Besides, DCAG group with EMMs achieved the best survival outcome independent of baseline characteristics, whereas it was opposite in EMM (+) patients receiving standard induction regimens (p < 0.05). Additionally, in the EMM (+) cohort, the survival rate of isolated DCAG group was statistically similar to that of the combination of standard chemotherapies and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) (p > 0.40), whereas patients who received only standard regimens had the worst survival rate (0.0%, p < 0.01). It can be concluded that the EMMs might be regarded as the potentially predictive biomarkers of better response to DCAG in IR-AML patients.","['Xu, Qingyu', 'Li, Yan', 'Jing, Yu', 'Lv, Na', 'Wang, Lili', 'Li, Yonghui', 'Yu, Li']","['Xu Q', 'Li Y', 'Jing Y', 'Lv N', 'Wang L', 'Li Y', 'Yu L']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2281-4454', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6782-7473']","['Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology and BMT center, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Hematology-Oncology, International Cancer Center, Shenzhen University General Hospital, Shenzhen University Health Science Center, Shenzhen, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'CAG protocol']",IM,,"['Aclarubicin/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*genetics', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'DNA Methylation/drug effects', 'Decitabine/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Epigenesis, Genetic/*genetics', 'Female', 'Genes, Modifier/*genetics', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction/methods', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute myeloid leukemia with intermediate-risk karyotypes', '*epigenetic modifier gene mutations', '*hypomethylating agents', '*prognosis']",2019/07/26 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/07/26 06:00'],"['2019/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32593 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2020 Mar 1;146(5):1457-1467. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32593.

This blood malignancy is often related to the onset of internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the native sequence of the protein. The ITDs occur mainly in the juxtamembrane domain of the protein and alter the normal activity of the enzyme. In this work, we have studied the native form of FLT3 and six mutants by molecular dynamics simulations. The catalytic activity of FLT3 is exerted by the tyrosine kinase domain (KD) and regulated by the juxtamembrane (JM) domain. Analysis of the dynamics of these two domains have shown that the introduction of ITDs in the JM domain alters both structural and dynamic parameters. The presence of ITDs allowed the protein to span a larger portion of the conformational space, particularly in the JM domain and the activation loop. The FLT3 mutants were found to adopt more stable configurations than the native enzyme. This was due to the different arrangements assumed by the JM domain. Larger fluctuations of the activation loop were found in four of the six mutants. In the native FLT3, the key residue Tyr572 is involved in a strong and stable interaction with an ion pair. This interaction, which is thought to keep the JM in place hence regulating the activity of the enzyme, was found to break in all FLT3 mutants.","['Todde, Guido', 'Friedman, Ran']","['Todde G', 'Friedman R']",,"['Department of Chemistry ad Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Linnaeus University, 391 82 Kalmar, Sweden. guido.todde@lnu.se ran.friedman@lnu.se.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Phys Chem Chem Phys,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,100888160,"['EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Cell Membrane/*chemistry', 'Humans', '*Molecular Dynamics Simulation', 'Mutation', 'Protein Domains', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*chemistry/genetics']",,,,2019/07/26 06:00,2019/10/23 06:00,['2019/07/26 06:00'],"['2019/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c9cp02938a [doi]'],ppublish,Phys Chem Chem Phys. 2019 Aug 28;21(34):18467-18476. doi: 10.1039/c9cp02938a.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence of the risks associated with diagnostic x-ray examinations, the most frequent examination in pediatric radiology, in which the radiation dose is up to 750 times lower compared to CT examinations, is less clear. This study presents results of the second follow-up for the risk of childhood cancer in a cohort of children (<15 years) with diagnostic x-ray exposure at a large German hospital during 1976-2003 followed for additional 10 years until 2016. With a latency period of 6 months, 92 998 children contributed 794 549 person-years. The median effective dose was 7 muSv. Hundred incident cancer cases were identified: 35 leukemia, 13 lymphomas, 12 CNS tumors, 15 blastomas, 15 sarcomas and 10 other solid tumors, consisting of six germ cells tumors, three thyroid cancers and one adrenocortical carcinoma. For all cancer cases combined the standardised incidence ratio (SIR) was 1.14 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93-1.39), for leukemia 1.15 (95% CI 0.63-1.61), for lymphomas 1.03 (95% CI 0.55-1.76), for CNS tumors 0.65 (95% CI 0.34-1.14), for blastomas 1.77 (95% CI 0.91-2.91), for sarcomas 1.28 (95% CI 0.71-2.11) and for other solid tumors 2.38 (95% CI 1.14-4.38). Dose-response analysis using Poisson regression revealed no significant trend for dose groups. Results did not differ substantially with a latency period of 2 years for all cancer entities and 5 years for solid tumors in sensitivity analyses. Overall, the null results of the first follow-up were confirmed. Although an association between radiation exposure and a risk for certain solid tumors like thyroid cancer is known, the significantly increased SIR in the group of other solid tumors must be critically interpreted in the context of the small number of cases and the very low doses of radiation exposure in this group.","['Baaken, Dan', 'Hammer, Gael P', 'Seidenbusch, Michael C', 'Schneider, Karl', 'Spix, Claudia', 'Blettner, Maria', 'Pokora, Roman', 'Lorenz, Eva']","['Baaken D', 'Hammer GP', 'Seidenbusch MC', 'Schneider K', 'Spix C', 'Blettner M', 'Pokora R', 'Lorenz E']",,"['Institute for Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (IMBEI), Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Radiol Prot,Journal of radiological protection : official journal of the Society for Radiological Protection,8809257,,IM,,,,,,2019/07/26 06:00,2019/07/26 06:00,['2019/07/26 06:00'],"['2019/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1088/1361-6498/ab3506 [doi]'],aheadofprint,J Radiol Prot. 2019 Jul 25;39(4):1074-1091. doi: 10.1088/1361-6498/ab3506.,,20190725,"['J Radiol Prot. 2020 Sep;40(3):922-923.

Clinical indicators such as alanine aminotransferase, HEV RNA titer, and anti-HEV antibodies in the serum were investigated from the beginning of the infection until 1 year after the termination of HEV infection. HEV RNA had propagated over 6 months and then cleared spontaneously after the completion of chemotherapy. Anti-HEV antibodies appeared in the serum just before the clearance of HEV RNA. Interestingly, HEV RNA was detected in the patient's urine, spinal fluid, and saliva. The HEV RNA titers in those samples were much lower than in the serum and feces.

Despite worldwide distribution of the virus, 21 nations have eradicated BLV from their dairy cattle and are currently considered 'BLV-free.' In contrast, the US has attempted no industry-wide BLV control programs and has experienced an increase in BLV prevalence among dairy cows to about 40%. This raises concerns about production efficiency, herd health, and sustainability. In a pilot field trial with three Midwestern-US dairy herds, a test-and-cull approach using ELISA screening of milk samples was successful in reducing BLV prevalence in two herds. In the third herd, BLV prevalence increased following the introduction of infected heifers that were raised at an out-of-state calf raising facility. This trial demonstrated that a test-and-cull approach to BLV control can be successful in US dairy herds with low BLV prevalence, but ongoing surveillance is necessary to prevent reintroduction of the virus.","['Ruggiero, Vickie J', 'Bartlett, Paul C']","['Ruggiero VJ', 'Bartlett PC']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3600-2027'],"['Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48823, USA.', 'Department of Large Animal Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine, Michigan State University, East Lansing 48823, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Vet Med Int,Veterinary medicine international,101524203,,,,,PMC6614971,,,2019/07/26 06:00,2019/07/26 06:01,['2019/07/26 06:00'],"['2019/04/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/26 06:01 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/3202184 [doi]'],epublish,Vet Med Int. 2019 Jun 25;2019:3202184. doi: 10.1155/2019/3202184. eCollection 2019.,,20190625,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After becoming a systemic candidiasis it is difficult to diagnose, control and treat in individuals with hematological malignancies. The aim of this study was to diagnose candidiasis in the oral mucosa of patients with leukemias and lymphomas in a timely manner in order to prevent their progression to systemic candidiasis. Materials and Methods: In this cross sectional study, 50 clinical samples were collected from the mouth of patients with hematological malignancies undergoing chemotherapy from the oncology units of teaching hospitals in Kerman, Iran. Patients were from Kerman, Sistan-Baluchestan and Hormozgan in south-eastern Iran. Sampling was restricted to patients with diagnosed acute lymphoid leukemia (ALL); acute myeloid leukemia (AML); chronic lymphoid leukemia (CLL); chronic myeloid leukemia (CML); Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Presumptive species identification of fungi was performed using conventional methods like colony characteristics on CHROMagar Candida medium, germ tube production, and assessing the morphology fungi on corn meal agar. Confirmation of presumptive candida isolates was performed using PCR-RFLP. Results: From a total of 50, 14 patients (28%) had positive oral candidiasis. Candida albicans (57.14%) was the most common species followed by Candida glabrata (14.28%), Candida parapsilosis (14.28%), Candida krusei (7.14%) and Candida kefyr (7.14%). Candida albicans had the highest rate of oral infection in ALL (35.71%) and then NHL (28.57%) patients. Conclusion: The results indicate that oral candidiasis is a prevalent fungal infection in the patients with hematologic malignancies with C. albicans being the main etiological agent. However, other species of Candida cause similar infections in these patients.","['Hamzehee, Sara', 'Kalantar-Neyestanaki, Davood', 'Mohammadi, Mohammad Ali', 'Nasibi, Saeed', 'Mousavi, Seyed Amin Ayatollahi']","['Hamzehee S', 'Kalantar-Neyestanaki D', 'Mohammadi MA', 'Nasibi S', 'Mousavi SAA']",,"['Student Research Committee, Department of Parasitology and Mycology, School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Microbiology and Virology, School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Research Center for Hydatid Disease in Iran, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Research Center for Hydatid Disease in Iran, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.', 'Department of Medical Mycology and Parasitology, School of Medicine, Kerman University of Medical Sciences, Kerman, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Iran J Microbiol,Iranian journal of microbiology,101518404,,,,,PMC6635309,['NOTNLM'],"['Candida spp.', 'Hematologic malignancies', 'Lymphomas', 'Oral candidiasis']",2019/07/26 06:00,2019/07/26 06:01,['2019/07/26 06:00'],"['2019/07/26 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/26 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Iran J Microbiol. 2019 Apr;11(2):114-119.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Materials and Methods: A total of 95 patients with suspected or proven malignancy (50 patients) were admitted to the adult haematology ward at Taleghani Hospital in Tehran. Blood samples were inoculated into the bottles of Bact/Alert blood culture system and sent to Payvand's clinical and special laboratory immediately and then incubated at 35 +/- 2 degrees C. Culture from positive bottles were plated on appropriate media and incubated at 37 degrees C and 30 degrees C for bacterial and fungal isolation, respectively. A bacterial suspension with turbidity equal to 0.5 McFarland (1.5 x 10(8) CFU/mL) was prepared and used for the Vitec2 system (biomerioux). Statistical analysis using independent Fisher's exact test was conducted and a p-value of < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: Among 50 patients with approved malignancy, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) and Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) were the most common underlying diseases.

Combination regimens incorporating a PI and immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) have been associated with deep responses and extended survival in patients with newly diagnosed MM (NDMM). Carfilzomib-based combinations with immunomodulators are being extensively studied in the frontline setting. The objective of this review was to describe efficacy and safety data for carfilzomib-based, PI/immunomodulatory combinations in NDMM. Information sources were articles indexed in PubMed and abstracts from key hematology/oncology congresses published between January 2012 and December 2018. PubMed and congresses were searched for prospective clinical studies assessing the combination of carfilzomib with an IMiD for NDMM treatment. Retrospective and preclinical reports, case reports/series, reviews, and clinical studies not evaluating carfilzomib-immunomodulator combinations in NDMM were excluded based on review of titles and abstracts. A total of nine articles and 72 abstracts were deemed relevant and included in the review. A total of six distinct carfilzomib-based, PI/immunomodulator combination regimens have been evaluated in 12 clinical trials. Overall, treatment with these regimens has resulted in deep responses, including high rates of negativity for minimal residual disease. These deep responses have translated to long progression-free survival and overall survival rates. Efficacy results for these regimens have generally been consistent across subgroups defined by age, transplant eligibility, and cytogenetic risk. The safety profile of carfilzomib in NDMM is consistent with that observed in the relapsed-refractory MM setting. Clinical studies have found that carfilzomib-based combinations with immunomodulators are highly active with a favorable safety profile in NDMM. The carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone (KRd) drug backbone is a promising foundation for treatment strategies aimed at achieving long-term, deep responses (functional cures) in the frontline setting. Several ongoing studies are evaluating KRd, with or without anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies.","['Landgren, Ola', 'Sonneveld, Pieter', 'Jakubowiak, Andrzej', 'Mohty, Mohamad', 'Iskander, Karim S', 'Mezzi, Khalid', 'Siegel, David S']","['Landgren O', 'Sonneveld P', 'Jakubowiak A', 'Mohty M', 'Iskander KS', 'Mezzi K', 'Siegel DS']",,"['Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA. landgrec@mskcc.org.', 'Erasmus MC Cancer Institute, Rotterdam, Netherlands.', 'University of Chicago Medicine, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Saint-Antoine Hospital, Sorbonne University, INSERM UMRs 938, Paris, France.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, USA.', 'John Theurer Cancer Center, Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunologic Factors)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '72X6E3J5AR (carfilzomib)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Oligopeptides/*therapeutic use', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/therapeutic use']",PMC6756042,,,2019/07/26 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/07/26 06:00'],"['2019/02/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/26 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0517-6 [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0517-6 [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2019 Sep;33(9):2127-2143. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0517-6.

We have recently demonstrated that a novel microRNA (miR), miR-128, represses retrotransposon long interspaced element 1 (L1) by a dual mechanism, namely, by directly targeting the coding region of the L1 RNA and by repressing a required nuclear import factor (TNPO1). We have further determined that miR-128 represses the expression of all three TNPO proteins (transportins TNPO1, TNPO2, and TNPO3). Here, we establish that miR-128 also influences HIV-1 replication by repressing TNPO3, a factor that regulates HIV-1 nuclear import and viral; replication of TNPO3 is well established to regulate HIV-1 nuclear import and viral replication. Here, we report that type I interferon (IFN)-inducible miR-128 directly targets two sites in the TNPO3 mRNA, significantly downregulating TNPO3 mRNA and protein expression levels. Challenging miR-modulated Jurkat cells or primary CD4(+) T-cells with wild-type (WT), replication-competent HIV-1 demonstrated that miR-128 reduces viral replication and delays spreading of infection. Manipulation of miR-128 levels in HIV-1 target cell lines and in primary CD4(+) T-cells by overexpression or knockdown showed that reduction of TNPO3 levels by miR-128 significantly affects HIV-1 replication but not murine leukemia virus (MLV) infection and that miR-128 modulation of HIV-1 replication is reduced with TNPO3-independent HIV-1 virus, suggesting that miR-128-indued TNPO3 repression contributes to the inhibition of HIV-1 replication. Finally, we determine that anti-miR-128 partly neutralizes the IFN-mediated block of HIV-1. Thus, we have established a novel role of miR-128 in antiviral defense in human cells, namely inhibiting HIV-1 replication by altering the cellular milieu through targeting factors that include TNPO3.IMPORTANCE HIV-1 is the causative agent of AIDS. During HIV-1 infection, type I interferons (IFNs) are induced, and their effectors limit HIV-1 replication at multiple steps in its life cycle. However, the cellular targets of INFs are still largely unknown. In this study, we identified the interferon-inducible microRNA (miR) miR-128, a novel antiviral mediator that suppresses the expression of the host gene TNPO3, which is known to modulate HIV-1 replication. Notably, we observe that anti-miR-128 partly neutralizes the IFN-mediated block of HIV-1. Elucidation of the mechanisms through which miR-128 impairs HIV-1 replication may provide novel candidates for the development of therapeutic interventions.","['Bochnakian, Aurore', 'Zhen, Anjie', 'Zisoulis, Dimitrios G', 'Idica, Adam', 'KewalRamani, Vineet N', 'Neel, Nicholas', 'Daugaard, Iben', 'Hamdorf, Matthias', 'Kitchen, Scott', 'Lee, KyeongEun', 'Pedersen, Irene Munk']","['Bochnakian A', 'Zhen A', 'Zisoulis DG', 'Idica A', 'KewalRamani VN', 'Neel N', 'Daugaard I', 'Hamdorf M', 'Kitchen S', 'Lee K', 'Pedersen IM']",,"['Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Francisco J.

In this first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, phase 1 study, patients in part 1 (3 + 3 dose escalation) had relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies and received zanubrutinib 40, 80, 160, or 320 mg once daily or 160 mg twice daily. Part 2 (expansion) consisted of disease-specific cohorts, including treatment-naive or relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL). The primary end points were safety and tolerability, and definition of the maximum tolerated dose (part 1). Additional end points included pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and preliminary efficacy. Reported herein are results from 144 patients enrolled in the dose-finding and CLL/SLL cohorts. No dose-limiting toxicities occurred in dose escalation. Median BTK occupancy in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was >95% at all doses. Sustained complete (>95%) BTK occupancy in lymph node biopsy specimens was more frequent with 160 mg twice daily than 320 mg once daily (89% vs 50%; P = .0342). Consequently, 160 mg twice daily was selected for further investigation. With median follow-up of 13.7 months (range, 0.4-30.5 months), 89 CLL/SLL patients (94.7%) remain on study. Most toxicities were grade 1/2; neutropenia was the only grade 3/4 toxicity observed in >2 patients. One patient experienced a grade 3 subcutaneous hemorrhage. Among 78 efficacy-evaluable CLL/SLL patients, the overall response rate was 96.2% (95% confidence interval, 89.2-99.2). Estimated progression-free survival at 12 months was 100%. Zanubrutinib demonstrated encouraging activity in CLL/SLL patients, with a low incidence of major toxicities.

Moreover, patients with PD-L1 (-) tumors can respond favorably to anti-PD-L1 mAb therapy for unclear reasons. Here, we show that some tumors can induce PD-L1 on NK cells via AKT signaling, resulting in enhanced NK-cell function and preventing cell exhaustion. Anti-PD-L1 mAb directly acts on PD-L1(+) NK cells against PD-L1 (-) tumors via a p38 pathway. Combination therapy with anti-PD-L1 mAb and NK cell-activating cytokines significantly improves the therapeutic efficacy of human NK cells against PD-L1 (-) human leukemia when compared with monotherapy. Our discovery of a PD-1-independent mechanism of antitumor efficacy via the activation of PD-L1(+) NK cells with anti-PD-L1 mAb offers new insights into NK-cell activation and provides a potential explanation as to why some patients lacking PD-L1 expression on tumor cells still respond to anti-PD-L1 mAb therapy. SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting PD-L1 expressed on PD-L1(+) tumors with anti-PD-L1 mAb successfully overcomes T-cell exhaustion to control cancer, yet patients with PD-L1 (-) tumors can respond to anti-PD-L1 mAb.

At the same time, the incidences of infection and hospitalization were compared. Methods: A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted in patients with newly diagnosed AML who met the enrollment criteria from August 2014 to December 2017. The patients were randomly divided into two groups according to a 1:1 ratio: PEG-rhG-CSF group and rhG-CSF group. The time of neutrophil or leukocyte recovery, infection rate and hospitalization interval were compared between the two groups. Results: 60 patients with newly diagnosed AML were enrolled: 30 patients in the PEG-rhG-CSF group and 30 patients in the rhG-CSF group. There were no significant differences in age, chemotherapy regimen, pre-chemotherapy ANC, WBC, and induction efficacy between the two groups (P>0.05) . The median time (range) of ANC or WBC recovery in patients with PEG-rhG-CSF and rhG-CSF were 19 (14-35) d and 19 (15-26) d, respectively, with no statistical difference (P=0.566) . The incidences of infection in the PEG-rhG-CSF group and the rhG-CSF group were 90.0%and 93.3%, respectively, and there was no statistical difference (P=1.000) . The median days of hospitalization (range) was 20.5 (17-49) days and 21 (19-43) days, respectively, with no statistical difference (P=0.530) .

Methods: 165 cases of MDS who underwent allo-HSCT from Jan. 2010 to Mar. 2018 were analyzed retrospectively, focusing on the overall survival (OS) , disease free survival (DFS) , relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM) and their related risk factors. Results: Of all the 165 cases, 105 were male and 60 were female. The 3-year OS and DFS rate were 72.5% (95%CI 64.9%-80.1%) and 67.4% (95%CI 59.17%-75.63%) , respectively.

Methods: Next-generation sequencing technology was used to detect mutations in GATA2 and other myeloid malignancy genes in 129 children with primary MDS from Jan. 2007 to Jan. 2018. The relationship between genotypes and phenotypes was analyzed. Results: Germline GATA2 mutations accounted for 8.5% (11/129) of all primary MDS cases, and 14.0% (11/50) of MDS with excess blasts (MDS-EB) and acute myeloid leukaemia with myelodysplasia-related changes (AML-MRC) . Compared with GATA2 wild-type patients, GATA2 mutated patients were older at diagnosis[8 (1-16) years old vs 6 years old (range: 1 month old-18 years old) , P=0.035]and higher risk of monosomy 7 (72.7%vs 5.2%, P<0.001) and classified into MDS-EB and AML-MRC compared with refractory cytopenia of childhood (RCC) (63.6%vs 36.4%, P=0.111) . The multivariate analysis showed SETBP1 mutation (P=0.041, OR=9.003, 95%CI 1.098-73.787) and isolated monosomy 7 (P=0.002, OR=24.835, 95%CI 3.305-186.620) were significantly associated with germline mutated GATA2.

Methods: Consecutive adult AML who received MUD-HSCT in our center from January 2008 to April 2017 were studied retrospectively, comparing with patients undergoing matched sibling donor (MSD) -HSCT in the same period. The rates of overall survival (OS) , disease free survival (DFS) , relapse, non-relapse mortality (NRM) , engraftment, acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD and cGVHD) were analyzed. Results: A total of 247 consecutive cases were enrolled, including 46 patients with MUD-HSCT and 201 with MSD-HSCT. All the patients experienced neutrophil engraftment except for one patient who died early in the MSD group, but the median day of engraftment was longer in the MUD group (15.0 vs 14.0, P=0.017) . The accumulative engraftment rate of platelet was comparable between the two groups (93.5%vs 98.0%, P=0.128) . The accumulative incidences of aGVHD (50.0%vs 46.3%, P=0.421) and cGVHD (37.8%vs 43.0%, P=0.581) were not statistically different between the two groups. Compared with the MSD group, the accumulative NRM rate at+36 months after transplantation was significantly higher in the MUD group (22.0%vs 10.4%, P=0.049) , while the relapse rate was not statistical difference (20.5 vs 28.3%, P=0.189) . Both the 3-year OS (61.6%vs 63.3%, P=0.867) and DFS (57.5%vs 61.6%, P=0.760) were comparable between the two groups. Four independent risk factors were confirmed by the multivariate analysis: patient age >/=45 years old, CR2 or NR before transplantation, a history of extramedullary infiltration and the occurrence of grade - aGVHD. No statistical differences were demonstrated in the survival rate between MUD-and MSD-HSCT in different subgroups. Conclusions: The outcomes, such as GVHD, relapse, OS and DFS, were comparable between MUD-and MSD-HSCT for adult AML, but higher incidence of NRM and longer time to neutrophil engraftment in the MUD group.

Therapies based on activating the immune system can result in beneficial responses in patients with metastatic disease. Treatment with antibodies targeting the immunological checkpoint axis PD-1 / PD-L1 can result in the induction of anti-tumor T cell activation leading to meaningful long-lasting clinical responses. Still, many patients acquire resistance or develop dose-limiting toxicities to these therapies. Analysis of tumors from patients who progress on anti-PD-1 treatment reveal defective interferon-signaling and antigen presentation, resulting in immune escape from T cell-mediated attack. Natural killer (NK) cells are innate lymphocytes that can kill tumor cells without prior sensitization to antigens and can be activated to kill tumor cells that have an impaired antigen processing and presentation machinery. Thus, NK cells may serve as useful effectors against tumor cells that have become resistant to classical immune checkpoint therapy. Various approaches to activate NK cells are being increasingly explored in clinical trials against cancer. While clinical benefit has been demonstrated in patients with acute myeloid leukemia receiving haploidentical NK cells, responses in patients with solid tumors are so far less encouraging. Several hurdles need to be overcome to provide meaningful clinical responses in patients with solid tumors. Here we review the recent developments to augment NK cell responses against solid tumors with regards to cytokine therapy, adoptive infusion of NK cells, NK cell engagers, and NK cell immune checkpoints.","['Chen, Ziqing', 'Yang, Ying', 'Liu, Lisa L', 'Lundqvist, Andreas']","['Chen Z', 'Yang Y', 'Liu LL', 'Lundqvist A']",,"['Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, S-17164 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, S-17164 Stockholm, Sweden.', 'Department of Oncology-Pathology, Karolinska Institutet, S-17164 Stockholm, Sweden.

For chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a heterogeneous disease of B-lymphocytes maturing under constitutive B cell receptor (BCR) stimulation, the functional role of diverse clonal mutations remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that alterations in BCR signaling dynamics underlie the progression of B cells toward malignancy. We reveal emergent dynamic features-bimodality, hypersensitivity, and hysteresis-in the BCR signaling pathway of primary CLL B cells. These signaling abnormalities in CLL quantitatively derive from BCR clustering and constitutive signaling with positive feedback reinforcement, as demonstrated through single-cell analysis of phospho-responses, computational modeling, and super-resolution imaging. Such dysregulated signaling segregates CLL patients by disease severity and clinical presentation.

MF is characterized by an increased risk of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and a shortened life expectancy. METHODS: Because natural histories of PMF and SMF are different, we studied by targeted next generation sequencing the differences in the molecular landscape of 86 PMF and 59 SMF and compared their prognosis impact. RESULTS: PMF had more ASXL1 (47.7%) and SRSF2 (14%) gene mutations than SMF (respectively 27.1% and 3.4%, P = .04). Poorer survival was associated with RNA splicing mutations (especially SRSF2) and TP53 in PMF (P = .0003), and with ASXL1 and TP53 mutations in SMF (P < .0001). These mutations of poor prognosis were associated with biological features of scoring systems (DIPSS and MYSEC-PM score). Mutations in TP53/SRSF2 in PMF or TP53/ASXL1 in SMF were more frequent as the risk of these scores increased. This allowed for a better stratification of MF patients, especially within the DIPSS intermediate-1 risk group (DIPSS) or the MYSEC-PM high risk group. AML transformation occurred faster in SMF than in PMF and patients who transformed to AML were more SRSF2-mutated and less CALR-mutated at MF sampling. CONCLUSIONS: PMF and SMF have different but not specific molecular profiles and different prognosis depending on the molecular profile. This may be due to differences in disease history. Combining mutations and existing scores should improve prognosis assessment.","['Courtier, Frederic', 'Garnier, Severine', 'Carbuccia, Nadine', 'Guille, Arnaud', 'Adelaide, Jose', 'Chaffanet, Max', 'Hirsch, Pierre', 'Paz, Damien Luque', 'Slama, Bohrane', 'Vey, Norbert', 'Ugo, Valerie', 'Delhommeau, Francois', 'Rey, Jerome', 'Birnbaum, Daniel', 'Murati, Anne']","['Courtier F', 'Garnier S', 'Carbuccia N', 'Guille A', 'Adelaide J', 'Chaffanet M', 'Hirsch P', 'Paz DL', 'Slama B', 'Vey N', 'Ugo V', 'Delhommeau F', 'Rey J', 'Birnbaum D', 'Murati A']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6182-8616'],"['Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Predictive, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), Marseille, France."", 'Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Predictive, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), Marseille, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Predictive, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), Marseille, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Predictive, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), Marseille, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Predictive, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), Marseille, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Predictive, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), Marseille, France."", 'Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine CRSA, APHP, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Sorbonne Universite, Inserm, Paris, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU d'Angers, Angers, France."", ""Centre Hospitalier General d'Avignon, Service d'Onco-Hematologie, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, Marseille, France.', 'Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, IPC, Marseille, France."", ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU d'Angers, Angers, France."", 'Centre de Recherche Saint-Antoine CRSA, APHP, Hopital Saint-Antoine, Sorbonne Universite, Inserm, Paris, France.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Hematologie, IPC, Marseille, France."", 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Predictive, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), Marseille, France."", 'Aix-Marseille Universite, Marseille, France.', 'Centre de Recherche en Cancerologie de Marseille (CRCM), Inserm, Marseille, France.', ""Departement d'Oncologie Predictive, Institut Paoli-Calmettes (IPC), Marseille, France."", 'Departement de BioPathologie, IPC, Marseille, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,,IM,,,,['NOTNLM'],"['clinical parameters', 'genomic markers', 'next generation sequencing', 'primary and secondary myelofibrosis', 'prognosis impact']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/07 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22789 [doi]'],aheadofprint,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Jul 24. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22789.,"['(c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']",20190724,,"['INCa BCB 2013/French Cancer Institute', 'LF 2013/05/Association Laurette Fugain', 'Inserm, Institut Paoli-Calmettes']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SUMMARY ANSWER: DXM incubation prior to retransplantation of ovarian tissue does not prevent reintroduction of leukemic cells. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Retransplantation of cryopreserved ovarian cortex from patients diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) involves a risk of reintroducing malignant cells. DXM treatment is effective at inducing leukemic cell death in vitro. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was an experimental study where ovarian cortex fragments from patients with ALL were randomly allocated to incubation with or without DXM (n = 11/group) and grafted to 22 immunodeficient mice for 6 months. In a parallel experiment, 22 immunodeficient mice were injected i.p. with varying amounts of RCH-ACV ALL cells (human leukemia cell line) and maintained for 4 months. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Cryopreserved ovarian fragments from patients with ALL were exposed in vitro to 0.4 muM DXM or basal media (control) prior to xenograft into ovariectomized severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice (experiment 1). After 6 months of monitoring, leukemia cell contamination was assessed in ovarian grafts and mouse organs by histology, PCR (presence of mouse mtDNA and absence of p53 were together considered a negative result for the presence of human cells) and detection of immunoglobulin monoclonality and specific ALL markers if present in the patient.In experiment 2, a series of 22 immunodeficient female mice was injected with specific doses of the leukemia cell line RCH-ACV (103 - 5 x 106, n = 4/group) to assess the engraftment competence of the SCID model. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: ALL metastatic cells were detected, by PCR, in five DXM-treated and one control human ovarian tissue graft as well as in a control mouse liver, although malignant cell infiltration was not detected by histology in any sample after 6 months. In total, minimal residual disease was present in three DXM-treated and three control mice.RCH-ACV cells were detected in liver and spleen samples after the injection of as little as 103 cells, although only animals receiving 5 x 106 cells developed clinical signs of disease and metastases. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: This is an experimental study where the malignant potential of leukemic cells contained in human ovarian tissues has been assessed in immunodeficient mice. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These results indicate that DXM incubation prior to retransplantation of ovarian tissue does not prevent reintroduction of leukemic cells. Therefore, caution should be taken in retransplanting ovarian tissue from patients with leukemia until safer systems are developed, as leukemic cells present in ovarian grafts were able to survive, proliferate and migrate after cryopreservation and xenograft.

The Cancer and Leukemia Group B 49907 trial focused on women age 65 years and older. We previously reported the primary analysis after a median follow-up of 2.4 years. Standard adjuvant chemotherapy showed significant improvements in recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival compared with capecitabine. We now update results at a median follow-up of 11.4 years. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients age 65 years or older with early breast cancer were randomly assigned to either standard adjuvant chemotherapy (physician's choice of either cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil or cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin) or capecitabine. An adaptive Bayesian design was used to determine sample size and test noninferiority of capecitabine. The primary end point was RFS. RESULTS: The design stopped accrual with 633 patients at its first sample size assessment. RFS remains significantly longer for patients treated with standard chemotherapy. At 10 years, in patients treated with standard chemotherapy versus capecitabine, the RFS rates were 56% and 50%, respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; P = .03); breast cancer-specific survival rates were 88% and 82%, respectively (HR, 0.62; P = .03); and overall survival rates were 62% and 56%, respectively (HR, 0.84; P = .16). With longer follow-up, standard chemotherapy remains superior to capecitabine among hormone receptor-negative patients (HR, 0.66; P = .02), but not among hormone receptor-positive patients (HR, 0.89; P = .43). Overall, 43.9% of patients have died (13.1% from breast cancer, 16.4% from causes other than breast cancer, and 14.1% from unknown causes). Second nonbreast cancers occurred in 14.1% of patients. CONCLUSION: With longer follow-up, RFS remains superior for standard adjuvant chemotherapy versus capecitabine, especially in patients with hormone receptor-negative disease. Competing risks in this older population dilute overall survival benefits.","['Muss, Hyman B', 'Polley, Mei-Yin C', 'Berry, Donald A', 'Liu, Heshan', 'Cirrincione, Constance T', 'Theodoulou, Maria', 'Mauer, Ann M', 'Kornblith, Alice B', 'Partridge, Ann H', 'Dressler, Lynn G', 'Cohen, Harvey J', 'Kartcheske, Patricia A', 'Perez, Edith A', 'Wolff, Antonio C', 'Gralow, Julie R', 'Burstein, Harold J', 'Mahmood, Ahmad A', 'Sutton, Linda M', 'Magrinat, Gustav', 'Parker, Barbara A', 'Hart, Ronald D', 'Grenier, Debjani', 'Hurria, Arti', 'Jatoi, Aminah', 'Norton, Larry', 'Hudis, Clifford A', 'Winer, Eric P', 'Carey, Lisa']","['Muss HB', 'Polley MC', 'Berry DA', 'Liu H', 'Cirrincione CT', 'Theodoulou M', 'Mauer AM', 'Kornblith AB', 'Partridge AH', 'Dressler LG', 'Cohen HJ', 'Kartcheske PA', 'Perez EA', 'Wolff AC', 'Gralow JR', 'Burstein HJ', 'Mahmood AA', 'Sutton LM', 'Magrinat G', 'Parker BA', 'Hart RD', 'Grenier D', 'Hurria A', 'Jatoi A', 'Norton L', 'Hudis CA', 'Winer EP', 'Carey L']",,"['University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Alliance Statistics and Data Center, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, Chicago, IL.', 'Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare, Boston, MA.', 'Advocate Illinois Masonic Medical Center, Chicago, IL.', 'University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC.', 'Robert H Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL.', 'Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL.', 'Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD.', 'University of Washington Seattle Cancer Alliance, Seattle, WA.', 'Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare, Boston, MA.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC.', 'Duke Cancer Institute, Duke University, Durham, NC.', 'Cone Health Cancer Center, Greensboro, NC.', 'Moores Cancer Center, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Harold Alfond Center for Cancer Care, Augusta, ME.', 'St Boniface General Hospital, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center, Duarte, CA.', 'Deceased.', 'Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'Dana-Farber/Partners CancerCare, Boston, MA.', 'University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center, Chapel Hill, NC.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '6804DJ8Z9U (Capecitabine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Capecitabine/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Chemotherapy, Adjuvant', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Survival Rate', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6900836,,,2019/07/25 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.00647 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Sep 10;37(26):2338-2348. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.00647.

Our study aims at reporting phenotype evolution and health issues in adulthood. METHODS: 34 patients (16 males), aged 18-58 years (mean 28.5) with BWS were enrolled. RESULTS: 26 patients were molecularly confirmed, 5 tested negative, and 3 were not tested. Final tall stature was present in 44%. Four patients developed Wilms' Tumor (2, 3, 5, and 10 years, respectively); one hepatoblastoma (22 years); one acute lymphoblastic leukemia (21 years); one adrenal adenoma and testicular Sertoli cell tumor (22 and 24 years, respectively); and three benign tumors (hepatic haemangioma, uterine myoma, and mammary fibroepithelioma). Surgery for BWS-related features was required in 85%. Despite surgical correction several patients presented morbidity and sequelae of BWS pediatric issues: pronunciation/swallow difficulties (n = 9) due to macroglossia, painful scoliosis (n = 4) consistent with lateralized overgrowth, recurrent urolithiasis (n = 4), azoospermia (n = 4) likely consequent to cryptorchidism, severe intellectual disability (n = 2) likely related to neonatal asphyxia and diabetes mellitus (n = 1) due to subtotal pancreatectomy for intractable hyperinsulinism. Four patients (two males) had healthy children (three physiologically conceived and one through assisted reproductive technology). CONCLUSIONS: Adult health conditions in BWS are mostly consequent to pediatric issues, underlying the preventive role of follow-up strategies in childhood. Malignancy rate observed in early adulthood in this small cohort matches that observed in the first decade of life, cumulatively raising tumor rate in BWS to 20% during the observation period. Further studies are warranted in this direction.","['Gazzin, Andrea', 'Carli, Diana', 'Sirchia, Fabio', 'Molinatto, Cristina', 'Cardaropoli, Simona', 'Palumbo, Giuseppe', 'Zampino, Giuseppe', 'Ferrero, Giovanni Battista', 'Mussa, Alessandro']","['Gazzin A', 'Carli D', 'Sirchia F', 'Molinatto C', 'Cardaropoli S', 'Palumbo G', 'Zampino G', 'Ferrero GB', 'Mussa A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5230-2831', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5690-6504', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2795-6013']","['Department of Public Health and Pediatrics, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Public Health and Pediatrics, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Institute for Maternal Child Health IRCCS ""Burlo Garofolo"", Trieste, Italy.', 'Department of Public Health and Pediatrics, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Public Health and Pediatrics, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Haematology, Bambino Gesu Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Woman and Child Health, Center for Rare Diseases and Birth Defects, Institute of Pediatrics, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Public Health and Pediatrics, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.', 'Department of Public Health and Pediatrics, University of Torino, Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Med Genet A,American journal of medical genetics.

Reportedly, disaggregation of aggregated FcepsilonRI immediately terminated degranulation, and formation of co-ligated FcepsilonRI and low affinity IgG receptor FcgammaRIIB blocked degranulation by inhibitory signal via SH2-containing inositol 5'-phosphatase 1 (SHIP1) phosphorylation. However, their molecular mechanisms to inhibit mast cell activation have been unclear in detail. Herein, we found that addition of excess monomeric hapten (TNP-alanine) to multivalent antigen (TNP-OVA)-activated rat basophilic leukemia cells and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells induced immediate and transient Syk dephosphorylation, which was previously phosphorylated by TNP-OVA addition. Syk dephosphorylation correlated to rapidly decreased intracellular Ca(2+) concentrations ([Ca(2+) ]i ), terminated degranulation, and suppressed cytokine production through inhibition of Akt and ERK phosphorylation. Addition of hapten-specific IgG monoclonal antibody (anti-TNP IgG1) to activated mast cells induced translocation of SHIP1 to the plasma membrane and its phosphorylation, indicating that co-ligation of FcepsilonRI and FcgammaRIIB after FcepsilonRI aggregation can lead to SHIP1 activation. SHIP1 phosphorylation led to gradually decreased [Ca(2+) ]i , weak inhibition of degranulation, and strong inhibition of cytokine production. Our findings clearly show the inhibitory mechanism of cell function in activated mast cells by operating Fc receptor crosslinking.","['Suzuki, Ruriko', 'Inoh, Yoshikazu', 'Yokawa, Satoru', 'Suzuki, Ryo', 'Furuno, Tadahide', 'Hirashima, Naohide']","['Suzuki R', 'Inoh Y', 'Yokawa S', 'Suzuki R', 'Furuno T', 'Hirashima N']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-3652-5250'],"['Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'School of Pharmacy, Aichi Gakuin University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'School of Pharmacy, Aichi Gakuin University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Institute of Medical, Pharmaceutical and Health Sciences, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'School of Pharmacy, Aichi Gakuin University, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Nagoya City University, Nagoya, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived)', '0 (Fcgr2b protein, mouse)', '0 (Fcgr2b protein, rat)', '0 (Haptens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '0 (Receptors, IgG)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Inpp5d protein, mouse)', 'EC 3.1.3.86 (Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal, Murine-Derived/*immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Haptens/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*immunology', 'Immunologic Capping/immunology', 'Mast Cells/cytology/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-Trisphosphate 5-Phosphatases/immunology', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/immunology', 'Receptors, IgG/immunology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*SHIP1', '*degranulation', '*hapten', '*mast cell', '*phosphorylation']",2019/07/25 06:00,2020/05/28 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2018/10/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/eji.201847973 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 2019 Dec;49(12):2172-2183. doi: 10.1002/eji.201847973.

Objective: To evaluate the association of biomarkers in serum with the response to ICB therapy in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal tract cancer. Design, Setting, and Participants: Cohort study in which patients with metastatic gastrointestinal tract cancer treated with ICB were enrolled at the Department of Gastrointestinal Oncology, Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute, Beijing, China, from August 1, 2015, to July 31, 2017, with the last follow-up date on January 1, 2018. Serum samples were collected at baseline and during the first visit to the clinic after starting treatment. Data analysis was conducted from January 16, 2018, to September 1, 2018. Exposures: A total of 59 factors, including cytokines/chemokines, growth factors, and soluble checkpoint-related proteins in serum, were examined by multiplexed bead immunoassays. Main Outcomes and Measures: Tree-based estimators were used to evaluate the importance of serum protein levels to ICB treatment response. Progression-free survival and overall survival analyses were conducted with the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Results: In total, 56 patients were examined. All patients with HPD (5 [8.9%]) had significantly lower mean (SD) levels of serum monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 than patients without HPD at baseline (53.4 [17.3] pg/mL vs 106.4 [48.4] pg/mL; P = .02). All patients with HPD were also identified by lower leukemia inhibitory factor levels (<13.28 pg/mL) and higher cluster of differentiation 152 levels (>/=31.81 pg/mL). Among the remaining 51 patients, responders with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) or colorectal cancer (CRC) showed larger decreases in interleukin 1 receptor antagonist levels than nonresponders (ESCC: -55.02% [95% CI, -86.52% to -23.51%] vs 43.44% [95% CI, 11.93% to 74.96%]; P < .001; CRC: -35.82% [95% CI, -67.38% to -4.26%] vs 59.14% [95% CI, -72.34% to 190.6%]; P = .04). Responders with gastric cancer (GC) had larger increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels than nonresponders (44.77% [95% CI, 10.76% to 78.79%] vs -26.2% [95% CI, -58.53% to 6.12%]; P = .003). Furthermore, early decreases in serum interleukin 1 receptor antagonist in patients with metastatic ESCC and CRC were associated with longer progression-free survival (ESCC: not reached vs 2.1 months; hazard ratio, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.95; P = .04; CRC: not reached vs 2.1 months; hazard ratio, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.38; P < .001). Early increases in brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in patients with metastatic GC were associated with longer progression-free survival (not reached vs 4.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.84; P = .03). Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, baseline serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, leukemia inhibitory factor, and cluster of differentiation 152 were associated with hyperprogressive metastatic gastrointestinal cancer among patients receiving ICB. An early decrease in serum interleukin 1 receptor antagonist levels in patients with metastatic ESCC or CRC and an early increase in serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels in patients with metastatic GC were better able to identify who would respond to ICB compared with microsatellite stability status or programmed cell death ligand 1 expression.","['Lu, Zhihao', 'Zou, Jianling', 'Hu,

Aim: The aim was to determine the prevalence of HTLV antibodies as well as the socio-demographic and risk factors associated with HTLV among women attending postnatal clinics in Zaria. Methodology: A total of 190 samples were collected within the months of January and June 2017 and qualitative determination of antibodies for HTLV in serum was performed by an antigen sandwich enzyme immunoassay method. Results: The study established an HTLV infection prevalence of 3.2% (6/190). Higher prevalence was observed among women from polygamous families [6.2% (4/64)], the self-employed [6.5% (4/62)], those in age group of 15-25 years [6.2% (5/72)] and women with only primary education [5.9% (2/32)] although the associations were not statistically significant. Similarly, there was no significant association between HTLV infection and history of family cancer (P = .629), intravenous drug use (P = .682), sharing of sharp objects (P = .596,) and history of X-ray exposure (P = .366), except for history of previous blood transfusion which shows significant association (P = .010). Conclusion: The study established a prevalence an HTLV of 3.2% that HTLV in Zaria therefore routinely screened is necessary.","['Hananiya, H S', 'Ella, E E', 'Aminu, M', 'Anyanwu, N C J']","['Hananiya HS', 'Ella EE', 'Aminu M', 'Anyanwu NCJ']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4168-5694', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1280-7605']","['Department of Microbiology, Ahmadu Bello University , Zaria , Nigeria.', 'Department of Microbiology, Ahmadu Bello University , Zaria , Nigeria.', 'Department of Microbiology, Ahmadu Bello University , Zaria , Nigeria.', 'Department of Microbiology, Ahmadu Bello University , Zaria , Nigeria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Immunoassay Immunochem,Journal of immunoassay & immunochemistry,100963688,['0 (HTLV-I Antibodies)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Female', 'HTLV-I Antibodies/blood/*immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/blood/epidemiology/*immunology', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*immunology/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Nigeria/epidemiology', '*Postnatal Care', 'Risk Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/virology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Human T-cell lymphotrophic virus', 'prevalence', 'risk factors', 'women']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15321819.2019.1636817 [doi]'],ppublish,J Immunoassay Immunochem. 2019;40(5):485-494. doi: 10.1080/15321819.2019.1636817.

Here, we report the discovery of selective small molecule inhibitors of Mcl-1 that inhibit cellular activity. Fragment screening identified thienopyrimidine amino acids as promising but nonselective hits that were optimized using nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray-derived structural information. The introduction of hindered rotation along a biaryl axis has conferred high selectivity to the compounds, and cellular activity was brought on scale by offsetting the negative charge of the anchoring carboxylate group. The obtained compounds described here exhibit nanomolar binding affinity and mechanism-based cellular efficacy, caspase induction, and growth inhibition. These early research efforts illustrate drug discovery optimization from thienopyrimidine hits to a lead compound, the chemical series leading to the identification of our more advanced compounds S63845 and S64315.","['Szlavik, Zoltan', 'Ondi, Levente', 'Csekei, Marton', 'Paczal, Attila', 'Szabo, Zoltan B', 'Radics, Gabor', 'Murray, James', 'Davidson, James', 'Chen, Ijen', 'Davis, Ben', 'Hubbard, Roderick E', 'Pedder, Christopher', 'Dokurno, Pawel', 'Surgenor, Allan', 'Smith, Julia', 'Robertson, Alan', 'LeToumelin-Braizat, Gaetane', 'Cauquil, Nicolas', 'Zarka, Marion', 'Demarles, Didier', 'Perron-Sierra, Francoise', 'Claperon, Audrey', 'Colland, Frederic', 'Geneste, Olivier', 'Kotschy, Andras']","['Szlavik Z', 'Ondi L', 'Csekei M', 'Paczal A', 'Szabo ZB', 'Radics G', 'Murray J', 'Davidson J', 'Chen I', 'Davis B', 'Hubbard RE', 'Pedder C', 'Dokurno P', 'Surgenor A', 'Smith J', 'Robertson A', 'LeToumelin-Braizat G', 'Cauquil N', 'Zarka M', 'Demarles D', 'Perron-Sierra F', 'Claperon A', 'Colland F', 'Geneste O', 'Kotschy A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1007-8218', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8865-3193', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7332-8889', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9869-1430', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7675-3864']","['Servier Research Institute of Medicinal Chemistry , Zahony u. 7. , H-1031 Budapest , Hungary.', 'Servier Research Institute of Medicinal Chemistry , Zahony u. 7. , H-1031 Budapest , Hungary.', 'Servier Research Institute of Medicinal Chemistry , Zahony u. 7. , H-1031 Budapest , Hungary.', 'Servier Research Institute of Medicinal Chemistry , Zahony u. 7. , H-1031 Budapest , Hungary.', 'Servier Research Institute of Medicinal Chemistry , Zahony u. 7. , H-1031 Budapest , Hungary.', 'Servier Research Institute of Medicinal Chemistry , Zahony u. 7. , H-1031 Budapest , Hungary.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd. , Granta Park , Cambridge CB21 6GB , U.K.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd. , Granta Park , Cambridge CB21 6GB , U.K.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd. , Granta Park , Cambridge CB21 6GB , U.K.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd. , Granta Park , Cambridge CB21 6GB , U.K.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd. , Granta Park , Cambridge CB21 6GB , U.K.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd. , Granta Park , Cambridge CB21 6GB , U.K.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd. , Granta Park , Cambridge CB21 6GB , U.K.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd. , Granta Park , Cambridge CB21 6GB , U.K.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd. , Granta Park , Cambridge CB21 6GB , U.K.', 'Vernalis (R&D) Ltd. , Granta Park , Cambridge CB21 6GB , U.K.', 'Institute de Recherche Servier , 125 Chemin de Ronde , 78290 Croissy-sur-Seine , France.', 'Institute de Recherche Servier , 125 Chemin de Ronde , 78290 Croissy-sur-Seine , France.', 'Institute de Recherche Servier , 125 Chemin de Ronde , 78290 Croissy-sur-Seine , France.', 'Technologie Servier , 27 Rue Eugene Vignat , 45000 Orleans , France.', 'Servier Research Institute of Medicinal Chemistry , Zahony u. 7. , H-1031 Budapest , Hungary.', 'Institute de Recherche Servier , 125 Chemin de Ronde , 78290 Croissy-sur-Seine , France.', 'Institute de Recherche Servier , 125 Chemin de Ronde , 78290 Croissy-sur-Seine , France.', 'Institute de Recherche Servier , 125 Chemin de Ronde , 78290 Croissy-sur-Seine , France.', 'Servier Research Institute of Medicinal Chemistry , Zahony u. 7. , H-1031 Budapest , Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (S63845)', '0 (Thiophenes)']",IM,,"['Cell Survival/drug effects/*physiology', 'Drug Discovery/*methods', 'HCT116 Cells', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Protein Structure, Tertiary', 'Pyrimidines/*chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thiophenes/*chemistry/*metabolism/pharmacology']",,,,2019/07/25 06:00,2020/06/11 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00134 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 2019 Aug 8;62(15):6913-6924. doi: 10.1021/acs.jmedchem.9b00134.

Achieving greater success with therapeutic antibodies requires careful characterization of the potential target molecules on AML. One potential target is CD300f, which is an immunoregulatory molecule expressed predominantly on myeloid lineage cells. To confirm the value of CD300f as a leukemic target, we showed that CD300f antibodies bind to AML from 85% of patient samples. While one CD300f monoclonal antibody (mAb) reportedly did not bind healthy hematopoietic stem cells, transcriptomic analysis found that CD300f transcripts are expressed by healthy HSPC. Several CD300f protein isoforms exist as a result of alternative splicing. Importantly for antibody targeting, the extracellular region of CD300f can be present with or without the exon 4-encoded sequence. This results in CD300f isoforms that are differentially bound by CD300f-specific antibodies. Furthermore, binding of one mAb, DCR-2, to CD300f exposes a structural epitope recognized by a second CD300f mAb, UP-D2. Detailed analysis of publicly available transcriptomic data indicated that CD34(+) HSPC expressed fewer CD300f transcripts that lacked exon 4 compared to AML with monocytic differentiation. Analysis of a small cohort of AML cells revealed that the UP-D2 conformational binding site could be induced in cells from AML patients with monocytic differentiation but not those from other AML or HSPC. This provides the opportunity to develop an antibody-based strategy to target AMLs with monocytic differentiation but not healthy CD34(+) HSPCs. This would be a major step forward in developing effective anti-AML therapeutic antibodies with reduced hematologic toxicity.","['Abadir, Edward', 'Gasiorowski, Robin E', 'Lai, Kaitao', 'Kupresanin, Fiona', 'Romano, Adelina', 'Silveira, Pablo A', 'Lo, Tsun-Ho', 'Fromm, Phillip D', 'Kennerson, Marina L', 'Iland, Harry J', 'Ho, P Joy', 'Hogarth, P Mark', 'Bradstock, Kenneth', 'Hart, Derek N J', 'Clark, Georgina J']","['Abadir E', 'Gasiorowski RE', 'Lai K', 'Kupresanin F', 'Romano A', 'Silveira PA', 'Lo TH', 'Fromm PD', 'Kennerson ML', 'Iland HJ', 'Ho PJ', 'Hogarth PM', 'Bradstock K', 'Hart DNJ', 'Clark GJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7894-232X'],"['Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Concord Repatriation General Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Australia.', 'ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Northcott Neuroscience Laboratory, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Australia.', 'Northcott Neuroscience Laboratory, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Molecular Medicine Laboratory, Concord Repatriation General Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'Immune Therapies, Burnet Institute, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Australia.', 'Institute of Haematology, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'Dendritic Cell Research, ANZAC Research Institute, Sydney, Australia.', 'Sydney Medical School, University of Sydney, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Oncol,Molecular oncology,101308230,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (CD300LF protein, human)', '0 (Epitopes)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Epitopes/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Monocytes/drug effects/immunology', 'Receptors, Immunologic/antagonists & inhibitors/*immunology']",PMC6763785,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD300f', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*antibody epitopes', '*cell surface targeting', '*isoform expression', '*monoclonal antibodies']",2019/07/25 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/06/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/09 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1878-0261.12549 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Oncol. 2019 Oct;13(10):2107-2120. doi: 10.1002/1878-0261.12549.

Similar to other types of hematopoietic malignancies, LSCs in CML are believed to be a rare cell population responsible for leukemia initiation, disease progression, and drug resistance. Therefore, a full understanding of the biology of LSCs will help to develop novel therapeutic strategies for effective treatment of CML to possibly reach a cure.

In this chapter, we will focus on the mutations of epigenetic factors in AML, their functional roles and mechanisms in normal hematopoiesis and leukemia genesis, especially in LSC, and potential treatment opportunities specifically for AML with epigenetic dysregulations.","['Xu, Jing', 'Hang, Xiaohang', 'Wu, Baohong', 'Chen, Chong', 'Liu, Yu']","['Xu J', 'Hang X', 'Wu B', 'Chen C', 'Liu Y']",,"['Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, Sichuan, China. yuliuscu@scu.edu.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', '*Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Epigenetic Repression', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/physiopathology', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Epigenetic changes', 'Leukemia stem cell']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-13-7342-8_8 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2019;1143:173-189. doi: 10.1007/978-981-13-7342-8_8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, the collection of knowledge about all these underlined mechanisms would present a preponderance for later studies. In this chapter, the universal DNA damage response (DDR) mechanisms were firstly introduced, and then DDR of HSCs were presented focusing on the DNA double-strand breaks in the quiescent state of HSCs, which poses a big advantage in promoting its transformation into preleukemic HSCs. Lastly, the DDR of LSCs were summarized based on the major outcomes triggered by different pathways in specific leukemia, upon which some aspects for future investigations were envisioned under our currently limited scope of knowledge.","['Zhang, Wenjun', 'Wang, Guangming', 'Liang, Aibin']","['Zhang W', 'Wang G', 'Liang A']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China. lab7182@tongji.edu.cn.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,,IM,,"['Cell Division', '*DNA Damage', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA damage', 'Hematopoietic stem cell', 'Leukemia stem cell']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-13-7342-8_7 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2019;1143:147-171. doi: 10.1007/978-981-13-7342-8_7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These conditions include the action of a number of molecular and cellular players, as well as critical levels of nutrients, oxygen and glucose in particular, involved in energy production. These factors are likely to act also in leukemias, due to the strict analogy between the hierarchical structure of normal hematopoietic cell populations and that of leukemia cell populations. This led to propose that leukemic growth is fostered by cells endowed with stem cell properties, the leukemia stem cells (LSC), a concept readily extended to comprise the cancer stem cells (CSC) of solid tumors. Two alternative routes have been proposed for CSC generation, that is, the oncogenic staminalization (acquisition of self-renewal) of a normal progenitor cell (the ""CSC in normal progenitor cell"" model) and the oncogenic transformation of a normal (self-renewing) stem cell (the ""CSC in normal stem cell"" model). The latter mechanism, in the hematological context, makes LSC derive from HSC, suggesting that LSC share SCN homing with HSC. This chapter is focused on the availability of oxygen and glucose in the regulation of LSC maintenance within the SCN. In this respect, the most critical aspect in view of the outcome of therapy is the long-term maintenance of the LSC subset capable to sustain minimal residual disease and the related risk of relapse of disease.","['Dello Sbarba, Persio', 'Cheloni, Giulia']","['Dello Sbarba P', 'Cheloni G']",,"['Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy. persio@unifi.it.', 'Department of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences, Universita degli Studi di Firenze, Florence, Italy.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Department of Medicine and Pathology, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",IM,,"['*Cell Hypoxia', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', '*Leukemia', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Oxygen/metabolism', 'Stem Cell Niche']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Hypoxia', 'Leukemia stem cell maintenance', 'Oxygen', 'Stem cell niche']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-13-7342-8_6 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2019;1143:129-145. doi: 10.1007/978-981-13-7342-8_6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a result, the clinical relevance of LSCs remains less than clear due to controversies caused largely by technical limitations in efficiently identifying LSCs. This has impeded our ability to fully address the features of genetic heterogeneity and metabolic/epigenetic plasticity of pre-LSCs and LSCs. With the development and use of humanized immunocompromised mice, we are able to more precisely analyze LSCs for their functions and interaction with the bone marrow niche. In addition, some promising targets in LSCs have recently been identified, including Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) and BCL-2, which are highly expressed in AML cells. It is hopeful that new anti-LSC compounds will be tested fully in clinical trials for their efficacy in treating human leukemias.","['Joshi, Kanak', 'Zhang, Lei', 'Breslin S J, Peter', 'Zhang, Jiwang']","['Joshi K', 'Zhang L', 'Breslin S J P', 'Zhang J']",,"['Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Department of Biology, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA.', 'Oncology Institute, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. jzhang@luc.edu.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, Loyola University Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA. jzhang@luc.edu.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (Hedgehog Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/physiopathology', 'Disease Progression', 'Hedgehog Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/physiopathology', 'Mice', '*Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Humanized immunocompromised mice', 'Leukemia stem cell']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-13-7342-8_5 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2019;1143:95-128. doi: 10.1007/978-981-13-7342-8_5.,,,,['R01 HL133560/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This epigenetic mark is deposited by the m(6)A methyltransferase complex (i.e., the METTL3/METTL14/WTAP complex and other cofactor proteins) and erased by m(6)A demethylases such as FTO and ALKBH5. Specific recognition of these m(6)A-modified mRNAs by m(6)A-binding proteins (i.e., m(6)A readers) determines the fate of target mRNAs through affecting splicing, nuclear export, RNA stability, and/or translation. During the past few years, m(6)A modification has been demonstrated to play a critical role in many major normal bioprocesses including self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells, tissue development, circadian rhythm, heat shock or DNA damage response, and sex determination. Thus, it is not surprising that dysregulation of the m(6)A machinery is also closely associated with pathogenesis and drug response of both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. In this chapter, we summarize and discuss recent findings regarding the biological functions and underlying mechanisms of m(6)A modification and the associated machinery in normal hematopoiesis and the initiation, progression, and drug response of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a major subtype of leukemia usually associated with unfavorable prognosis.","['Weng, Hengyou', 'Huang, Huilin', 'Chen, Jianjun']","['Weng H', 'Huang H', 'Chen J']",,"['Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA.', 'The Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA.', 'The Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA.', 'Department of Systems Biology, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA. jianchen@coh.org.', 'The Gehr Family Center for Leukemia Research, Beckman Research Institute of City of Hope, Monrovia, CA, USA. jianchen@coh.org.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Exp Med Biol,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,0121103,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (Methyltransferases)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,,"['*Adenosine/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', '*Hematopoiesis/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/physiopathology', '*Methyltransferases/metabolism', '*RNA, Messenger/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Normal hematopoiesis', 'm6A demethylases', 'm6A modification']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-981-13-7342-8_4 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Exp Med Biol. 2019;1143:75-93. doi: 10.1007/978-981-13-7342-8_4.,,,,"['R01 CA214965/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA243386/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R56 DK120282/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Maprang seed extracts possessed a high polyphenolic content and exhibited antioxidant properties against DPPH , ABTS (+), and ferric reduction. Additionally, 18-compounds were charaterized by RP-HPLC-DAD with two being recognized as gallic acid and ellagic acid and 16-unknown gallotannins. The HPLC fingerprint was composed of 4 major compounds. The extract showed active growth inhibition against leukemia, lung cancer cell lines and for 15 strains of bacteria. It is known to be particularly effective in drug resistant cells. Our results indicated that maprang seeds are a new natural source of nutrition, minerals and phytochemicals that may be applicable for use as a food supplement and as an effective drug in the treatment of certain diseases.","['Dechsupa, Nathupakorn', 'Kantapan, Jiraporn', 'Tungjai, Montree', 'Intorasoot, Sorasak']","['Dechsupa N', 'Kantapan J', 'Tungjai M', 'Intorasoot S']",,"['Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, 110 Intawaroros Rd., Sripoom, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, 110 Intawaroros Rd., Sripoom, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Radiologic Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, 110 Intawaroros Rd., Sripoom, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.', 'Department of Medical Technology, Faculty of Associated Medical Sciences, Chiang Mai University, 110 Intawaroros Rd., Sripoom, Chiang Mai, 50200, Thailand.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Heliyon,Heliyon,101672560,,,,,PMC6625972,['NOTNLM'],"['Anticancer', 'Antimicrobial', 'Antioxidant', 'Bouea macrophylla Griffith', 'Food science', 'HPLC', 'Maprang', 'Natural product chemistry']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/07/25 06:01,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2018/10/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02052 [doi]', 'S2405-8440(19)35712-3 [pii]', 'e02052 [pii]']",epublish,Heliyon. 2019 Jul 11;5(7):e02052. doi: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02052. eCollection 2019 Jul.,,20190711,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Methods: We conducted a retrospective case-control study of post-RVI IPA (2006-2016). Cases were patients who underwent LHSCT and had RVI due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (INF), or parainfluenza virus (PIV) followed by culture-documented IPA within 6 weeks. Controls had IPA only. Results: We identified 54 cases and 142 controls. Among cases, 29 (54%) had PIV infection, 14 (26%) had INF infection, and 11 (20%) had RSV infection. The median time to IPA after RVI was 7 days. A greater percentage of cases (37 [69%]) than controls (52 [37%]) underwent allogeneic HSCT (P < .0001). Cases were more likely to be nonneutropenic (33 [61%] vs 56 [39%]; P = .009) and in hematologic remission (27 [50%] vs 39 [27%]; P = .003) before IPA. Cases were more likely to have monocytopenia (45 [83%] vs 99 [70%]; P = .05) and less likely to have severe neutropenia (21 [39%] vs 86 [61%]; P = .007) at IPA diagnosis. Prior use of an Aspergillus-active triazole was more common in cases (27 of 28 [96%] vs 50 of 74 [68%]; P = .0017). Median time to empirical antifungal therapy initiation was 2 days in both groups. Crude 42-day mortality rates did not differ between cases (22%) and controls (27%), but the 42-day mortality rate was higher among cases with IPA after RSV infection (45%) than among those with IPA following INF or PIV infection (13%; P = .05). Conclusions: IPA had comparable outcomes when it followed RVI in patients who underwent LHSCT, and post-RVI IPA occurred more frequently in patients with prior allogeneic HSCT and was associated with leukemia relapse and neutropenia.","['Magira, Eleni E', 'Chemaly, Roy F', 'Jiang, Ying', 'Tarrand, Jeffrey', 'Kontoyiannis, Dimitrios P']","['Magira EE', 'Chemaly RF', 'Jiang Y', 'Tarrand J', 'Kontoyiannis DP']",,"['Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control and Employee Health.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control and Employee Health.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control and Employee Health.', 'Department of Microbiology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston.', 'Department of Infectious Disease, Infection Control and Employee Health.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Open Forum Infect Dis,Open forum infectious diseases,101637045,,,,,PMC6639596,['NOTNLM'],"['Aspergillus', 'hematologic malignancy', 'influenza', 'parainfluenza', 'respiratory syncytial virus']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/07/25 06:01,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1093/ofid/ofz247 [doi]', 'ofz247 [pii]']",epublish,Open Forum Infect Dis. 2019 Jul 19;6(7):ofz247. doi: 10.1093/ofid/ofz247. eCollection 2019 Jul.,,20190719,,['P30 CA016672/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,['Open Forum Infect Dis. 2019 Nov 25;6(11):ofz458.

We have revisited a cohort of pediatric T-ALL, in order to test if immunophenotypes associated with molecular alterations would predict the patient's outcome. Genetic mutations, translocations and copy number alterations were identified through Sanger sequencing, RT-PCR, FISH and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). We defined 8 immunophenotypic T-ALL subtypes through multiparametric flow cytometry: early T-cell precursor (ETP, n = 27), immature (n = 38), early cortical (n = 15), cortical (n = 50), late cortical (n = 53), CD4/CD8 double negative mature (n = 31), double positive mature (n = 35) and simple positive mature (n = 31) T-ALL. Deletions (del) or amplifications (amp) in at least one gene were observed in 87% of cases. The most frequent gene alterations were CDKN2A/B (del) (71.4%), NOTCH1 (mut) (47.6%) and FBXW7 (mut) (17%). ETP-ALL had frequent FLT3 (mut) (22.2%) and SUZ12 (del) (16.7%) (p < 0.001), while CDKN2A/B (del) were rarely found in this subtype (p < 0.001). The early cortical T-ALL subtype had high frequencies of NOTCH1 (mut) and IL7R (mut) (71%, 28.6%, respectively), whereas, mature T-ALL with double positive CD4/CD8 had the highest frequencies of STIL-TAL1 (36.7%), LEF1 (del) (27.3%) and CASP8AP2 (del) (22.7%). The co-existence of two groups of T-ALL with NOTCH1 (mut) /IL7R (mut), and with TLX3/SUZ12 (del) /NF1 (del)/IL7R (mut), were characterized with statistical significance (p < 0.05) but only STIL-TAL1 (pOS 47.5%) and NOTCH1 (WT)/FBXW7 (WT) (pOS 55.3%) are predictors of poor T-ALL outcomes. In conclusion, we have observed that 8 T-ALL subgroups are characterized by distinct molecular profiles. The mutations in NOTCH1/FBXW7 and STIL-TAL1 rearrangement had a prognostic impact, independent of immunophenotype.","['Noronha, Elda Pereira', 'Marques, Luisa Vieira Codeco', 'Andrade, Francianne Gomes', 'Thuler, Luiz Claudio Santos', 'Terra-Granado, Eugenia', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira, Maria S']","['Noronha EP', 'Marques LVC', 'Andrade FG', 'Thuler LCS', 'Terra-Granado E', 'Pombo-de-Oliveira MS']",,"['Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Clinical Research Division, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.', 'Pediatric Hematology-Oncology Program, Research Center, Instituto Nacional de Cancer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,,PMC6503680,['NOTNLM'],"['*T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*childhood', '*early T-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*immunophenotypic subtypes', '*molecular alterations', '*overall survival']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/07/25 06:01,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/01/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00316 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Apr 30;9:316. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00316. eCollection 2019.,,20190430,,,,,,,,['Brazilian Collaborative Study Group of Acute Leukemia'],['Front Oncol. 2021 Feb 05;10:640629.

In the proposed method, a novel combination of both typical and new features is introduced for classification of CML cells. Next, an effective decision tree classifier is proposed to classify CML cells into eight groups. The proposed method was evaluated on 1730 CML cell images containing 714 cells of non-cancerous bone marrow aspiration and 1016 cells of cancerous peripheral blood smears. The performance of the proposed classification method was compared to manual labels made by two experts. The average values of accuracy, specificity and sensitivity were 99.0 %, 99.4 % and 98.3 %, respectively for all groups of CML. In addition, Cohen's kappa coefficient demonstrated high conformity, 0.99, between joint diagnostic results of two experts and the obtained results of the proposed approach. According to the obtained results, the suggested method has a high capability to classify effective cells of CML and can be applied as a simple, affordable and reliable computer-aided diagnosis tool to help pathologists to diagnose CML.","['Ghane, Narjes', 'Vard, Alireza', 'Talebi, Ardeshir', 'Nematollahy, Pardis']","['Ghane N', 'Vard A', 'Talebi A', 'Nematollahy P']",,"['Department of Bioelectrics and Biomedical Engineering, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine and Student Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Bioelectrics and Biomedical Engineering, School of Advanced Technologies in Medicine and Medical Image and Signal Processing Research Center, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,EXCLI J,EXCLI journal,101299402,,,,,PMC6635720,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML)', 'blood cancer', 'classification', 'decision tree classifier', 'microscopic image processing']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/07/25 06:01,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.17179/excli2019-1292 [doi]', '2019-1292 [pii]', 'Doc382 [pii]']",epublish,EXCLI J. 2019 Jun 14;18:382-404. doi: 10.17179/excli2019-1292. eCollection 2019.,,20190614,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sciatic nerve conditioning injury (SNCI) has been shown to restore sensory function after spinal cord dorsal column injury (SDCL); however, the underlying mechanism of this recovery remains unclear. We performed a microarray assay to determine the associated miRNAs that might regulate the process of SNCI promoting SDCL repair. In total, 13 miRNAs were identified according to our inclusion criteria, and RT-qPCR was used to verify the microarray results. Among the 13 miRNAs, the miR-155-5p levels were decreased at 9 h, 3 d, 7 d, 14 d, 28 d, 2 m and 3 m timepoints in the SDCL group, while the SNCI group had a smaller decrease. Thus, miR-155-5p was chosen for further study after a literature review and an analysis with the TargetScan online tool. Specifically, miR-155-5p targets PKI-alpha, and the expression pattern of PKI-alpha was opposite that of miR-155-5p in both the SDCL and SNCI groups. Interestingly, miR-155-5p could promote dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neuron axon growth via the cAMP/PKA pathway and in a TNF-alpha, IL-1beta or MAG inhibitory microenvironment in vitro. Furthermore, miR-155-5p could regulate the cAMP/PKA pathway and promote sensory conduction function recovery post dorsal column injury as detected by NF-200 immunohistochemistry, somatosensory-evoked potentials, BBB scale and tape removal test. Collectively, our results demonstrated that miR-155-5p participates in the molecular mechanism by which SNCI promotes the repair of SDCL and that upregulated miR-155-5p can repair SDCL by enhancing DRG neuron axon growth via the cAMP/PKA pathway. These findings suggest a novel treatment target for spinal cord injury.","['Wang, Tianyi', 'Li, Bo', 'Wang, Zhijie', 'Yuan, Xin', 'Chen, Chuanjie', 'Zhang, Yanjun', 'Xia, Ziwei', 'Wang, Xin', 'Yu, Mei', 'Tao, Wen', 'Zhang, Liang', 'Wang, Xu', 'Zhang, Zheng', 'Guo, Xiaoling', 'Ning, Guangzhi', 'Feng, Shiqing', 'Chen, Xueming']","['Wang T', 'Li B', 'Wang Z', 'Yuan X', 'Chen C', 'Zhang Y', 'Xia Z', 'Wang X', 'Yu M', 'Tao W', 'Zhang L', 'Wang X', 'Zhang Z', 'Guo X', 'Ning G', 'Feng S', 'Chen X']",,"[""Department of Orthopedics, The 981st Hospital of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, Chengde 067000, Hebei Province, P.R.

A p53-independent HDM2 expression has been reported on the membrane of cancer cells but not on that of normal cells. Herein, we first showed that membrane HDM2 (mHDM2) is exclusively expressed on human and mouse AML blasts, including leukemia stem cell (LSC)-enriched subpopulations, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Higher mHDM2 levels in AML blasts were associated with leukemia-initiating capacity, quiescence, and chemoresistance. We also showed that a synthetic peptide PNC-27 binds to mHDM2 and enhances the interaction of mHDM2 and E-cadherin on the cell membrane; in turn, E-cadherin ubiquitination and degradation lead to membrane damage and cell death of AML blasts by necrobiosis. PNC-27 treatment in vivo resulted in a significant killing of both AML ""bulk"" blasts and LSCs, as demonstrated respectively in primary and secondary transplant experiments, using both human and murine AML models. Notably, PNC-27 spares normal HSC activity, as demonstrated in primary and secondary BM transplant experiments of wild-type mice. We concluded that mHDM2 represents a novel and unique therapeutic target, and targeting mHDM2 using PNC-27 selectively kills AML cells, including LSCs, with minimal off-target hematopoietic toxicity.","['Wang, Huafeng', 'Zhao, Dandan', 'Nguyen, Le Xuan', 'Wu, Herman', 'Li, Ling', 'Dong, Dan', 'Troadec, Estelle', 'Zhu, Yinghui', 'Hoang, Dinh Hoa', 'Stein, Anthony S', 'Al Malki, Monzr',

Pathogenic genetic variants encoding cohesion complex subunits and interacting proteins (e.g., NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3, HDAC8, and RAD21) are the major causes of CdLS. However, there are many clinically diagnosed cases of CdLS without pathogenic variants in these genes. To identify further genetic causes of CdLS, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 57 CdLS families, systematically evaluating both single nucleotides variants (SNVs) and copy number variations (CNVs). We identified pathogenic genetic changes in 36 out of 57 (63.2 %) families, including 32 SNVs and four CNVs. Two known CdLS genes, NIPBL and SMC1A, were mutated in 23 and two cases, respectively. Among the remaining 32 individuals, four genes (ANKRD11, EP300, KMT2A, and SETD5) each harbored a pathogenic variant in a single individual. These variants are known to be involved in CdLS-like. Furthermore, pathogenic CNVs were detected in NIPBL, MED13L, and EHMT1, along with pathogenic SNVs in ZMYND11, MED13L, and PHIP. These three latter genes were involved in diseases other than CdLS and CdLS-like. Systematic clinical evaluation of all patients using a recently proposed clinical scoring system showed that ZMYND11, MED13L, and PHIP abnormality may cause CdLS or CdLS-like.","['Aoi, Hiromi',

At the same time, the barriers for advancing clinical research are impacting how quickly drug development efforts are conducted. For example, we know now that under a microscope, patients with the same type of cancer and histology might look the same; however, the reality is that most cancers are driven by genomic, transcriptional, and epigenetic changes that make each patient unique. Additionally, the immunologic reaction to different tumor types is distinct among patients. The challenge for researchers developing new therapies today is vastly different than it was in the era of cytotoxics. Today, we must identify a sufficient number of patients harboring a rare mutation or other characteristic and match this to the right therapeutic option. This summary provides a guide to help inform the scientific cancer community about the benefits and challenges of conducting umbrella or basket trials (master trials), and to create a roadmap to help make this new and evolving form of clinical trial design as effective as possible.","['Burd, Amy', 'Schilsky, Richard L', 'Byrd, John C', 'Levine, Ross L', 'Papadimitrakopoulou, Vassiliki A', 'Herbst, Roy S', 'Redman, Mary W', 'Druker, Brian J', 'Gandara, David R']","['Burd A', 'Schilsky RL', 'Byrd JC', 'Levine RL', 'Papadimitrakopoulou VA', 'Herbst RS', 'Redman MW', 'Druker BJ', 'Gandara DR']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-8331-8206', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1784-048X']","['The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY.', 'American Society of Clinical Oncology, Alexandria, VA.', 'The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Rye Brook, NY.', 'The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, Columbus, OH.', 'Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', 'The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Yale Cancer Center, New Haven, CT.', 'Smilow Cancer Hospital, New Haven, CT.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.', 'Knight Cancer Institute, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR; and.', 'UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Center, Sacramento, CA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,,IM,,"['Clinical Decision-Making', '*Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Disease Management', 'Humans', '*Medical Oncology/methods/standards', 'Neoplasms/etiology/*therapy', 'Precision Medicine/methods', 'Research Design']",PMC6650731,,,2019/07/25 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019031229 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019031229 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Jul 23;3(14):2237-2243. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019031229.,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,"['R35 CA197734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001863/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous in vivo short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening evidence revealed mitochondrial-processing peptidase (PMPC) as a leading gene contributing to tumor cell resistance against sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor used to treat advanced HCC. Here, we investigated the contributory role of the beta subunit of PMPC (PMPCB) in sorafenib resistance. Silencing PMPCB increased HCC tumor cell susceptibility to sorafenib therapy, decreased liver tumor burden, and improved survival of tumor-bearing mice receiving sorafenib. Moreover, sorafenib + PMPCB shRNA combination therapy led to attenuated liver tumor burden and improved survival outcome for tumor-bearing mice, and it reduced colony formation in murine and human HCC cell lines in vitro. Additionally, PMPCB silencing enhanced PINK1-Parkin signaling and downregulated the anti-apoptotic protein MCL-1 in sorafenib-treated HCC cells, which is indicative of a healthier pro-apoptotic phenotype. Higher pre-treatment MCL-1 expression was associated with inferior survival outcomes in sorafenib-treated HCC patients. Elevated MCL-1 expression was present in sorafenib-resistant murine HCC cells, while MCL-1 knockdown sensitized these cells to sorafenib. In conclusion, our findings advocate combination regimens employing sorafenib with PMPCB knockdown or MCL-1 knockdown to circumvent sorafenib resistance in HCC patients.","['Zheng, Jian-Feng', 'He, Shaozhong', 'Zeng, Zongyue', 'Gu, Xinqi', 'Cai, Lei', 'Qi, Guangying']","['Zheng JF', 'He S', 'Zeng Z', 'Gu X', 'Cai L', 'Qi G']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Baoan Central Hospital of Shenzhen, The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518102, Guangdong, P.R.

The objective of this study was to investigate the putative association of KIRs, HLA class I ligands, and KIR/ligand combinations with rates of development of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Materials and Methods: The KIR/HLA I genotypes of 82 patients with leukemia (ALL, n=52; AML, n=17; and CML, n=13) were determined by PCR-SSP method and compared with genotypes of healthy controls (n=126). Results: KIR genotype frequency differed significantly between myelogenous leukemia patients and healthy controls for KIR2DL5A (17.6% vs. 47.7%, p=0.02), KIR3DS1 (17.6% vs. 47.6%, p=0.02), and KIR2DS4*001 (36.6% vs. 20.2%, p=0.017). The incidence of homozygous HLA-BBw4 (31.0% vs. 12.5%, p=0.042) and HLA-Bw4Thr80 Thr80 (13.0% vs. 1.2%, p=0.01) was significantly elevated in myeloid leukemia patients compared to healthy controls. KIR/HLA class I ligand profile KIR3DS1(+)/L (-) was decreased and KIR3DL2(+)/HLA-A3/11(-) was increased among myeloid leukemia cases compared to controls. Conclusion: These data suggest that the activity of NK cells as determined by inherited KIR/HLA class I ligand polymorphisms influences the susceptibility to myelogenous leukemia, but not to lymphoblastic leukemia. Additionally, the KIR genotype characterized by the absence of the inhibitory KIR2DL2 and the activating KIR2DS2 and KIR2DS3 (ID2) was found at a lower frequency in patients compared to controls, which confirmed the need for complex analysis based on all possible KIR/HLA class I ligand polymorphism combinations.","['Varbanova, Viktoria Plamenova', 'Mihailova, Snejina', 'Naumova, Elissaveta', 'Mihaylova, Anastasiya Petrova']","['Varbanova VP', 'Mihailova S', 'Naumova E', 'Mihaylova AP']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2990-4313', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6546-4872', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3889-8955', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2332-2120']","['Military Medical Academy, Multiprofile Hospital for Active Treatment, Clinic of Hematology, Sofia, Bulgaria', 'University Hospital Alexandrovska - Clinic of Clinical Immunology and Stem Cell Bank, Medical University, Sofia, Bulgaria', 'University Hospital Alexandrovska - Clinic of Clinical Immunology and Stem Cell Bank, Medical University, Sofia, Bulgaria', 'University Hospital Alexandrovska - Clinic of Clinical Immunology and Stem Cell Bank, Medical University, Sofia, Bulgaria']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Turkey,Turk J Haematol,Turkish journal of haematology : official journal of Turkish Society of Haematology,9606065,"['0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)']",,,"['Case-Control Studies', 'Female', 'Genes, MHC Class I/*genetics', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genotype', 'Healthy Volunteers', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/pathology', 'Ligands', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics']",PMC6863033,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chronic myeloid leukemia', '*Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*Acute myeloblastic leukemia']",2019/07/25 06:00,2020/05/01 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/01 06:00 [medline]']",['10.4274/tjh.galenos.2019.2019.0079 [doi]'],ppublish,Turk J Haematol. 2019 Nov 18;36(4):238-246. doi: 10.4274/tjh.galenos.2019.2019.0079.

The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) pathway has been reported to be involved in cancer, and more recently in leukaemia development and progression. In the present study, we analyse whether acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) cells can affect the differentiation of dendritic cells and macrophages and the involvement of BMP pathway in the process. We show that ALL cells produce BMP4 and that conditioned media from ALL cells promote the generation of dendritic cells with immunosuppressive features and skew M1-like macrophage polarization towards a less pro-inflammatory phenotype. Likewise, BMP4 overexpression in ALL cells potentiates their ability to induce immunosuppressive dendritic cells and favours the generation of M2-like macrophages with pro-tumoral features. These results suggest that BMP4 is in part responsible for the alterations in dendritic cell and macrophage differentiation produced by ALL cells.","['Valencia, Jaris', 'M Fernandez-Sevilla, Lidia', 'Fraile-Ramos, Alberto', 'Sacedon, Rosa', 'Jimenez, Eva', 'Vicente, Angeles', 'Varas, Alberto']","['Valencia J', 'M Fernandez-Sevilla L', 'Fraile-Ramos A', 'Sacedon R', 'Jimenez E', 'Vicente A', 'Varas A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-0701-5454', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9456-5541']","['Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, 28040 Madrid, Spain.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, 28040 Madrid, Spain. avicente@ucm.es.', 'Department of Cell Biology, Faculty of Medicine, Complutense University, 28040 Madrid, Spain. avaras@ucm.es.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Cells,Cells,101600052,"['0 (BMP4 protein, human)', '0 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4)']",IM,,"['Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Dendritic Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Activation', 'Macrophages/*pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', '*Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC6679123,['NOTNLM'],"['*BMP4', '*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*dendritic cells', '*macrophages', '*tumour immune microenvironment']",2019/07/25 06:00,2020/02/25 06:00,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/05/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [medline]']","['cells8070722 [pii]', '10.3390/cells8070722 [doi]']",epublish,Cells. 2019 Jul 14;8(7). pii: cells8070722. doi: 10.3390/cells8070722.,,20190714,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This panel of mutations makes it possible to combine some of these new treatments with conventional chemotherapy.

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are upstream to the transcription factor NFkappaB and part of the innate immune system. They are differentially expressed on AML blasts, and during normal hematopoiesis they initiate myeloid differentiation. In this study, we investigated the response upon TLR stimulation in an AML cohort (n = 83) by measuring the increase of NFkappaB-mediated cytokine secretion. We observed that TLR4 is readily induced in most patients, while TLR1/2 response was more restricted. General response to TLR stimulation correlated with presence of nucleophosmin gene mutations, increased mRNA expression of proteins, which are part of the TLR signaling pathway and reduced expression of transcription-related proteins. Furthermore, signaling via TLR1/2 appeared to be linked with prolonged patient survival. In conclusion, response upon TLR stimulation, and especially TLR1/2 induction, seems to be part of a more favorable phenotype, which also is characterized by higher basal cytokine secretion and a more mature blast population.","['Brenner, Annette K', 'Bruserud, Oystein']","['Brenner AK', 'Bruserud O']",,"['Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway.', 'Department of Medicine, Haukeland University Hospital, 5021 Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@helse-bergen.no.', 'Section for Hematology, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, 5020 Bergen, Norway. oystein.bruserud@helse-bergen.no.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Cancers (Basel),Cancers,101526829,,,,,PMC6678780,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'cytokine', 'epigenetic modification', 'survival', 'toll-like receptors']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/07/25 06:01,['2019/07/25 06:00'],"['2019/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['cancers11070973 [pii]', '10.3390/cancers11070973 [doi]']",epublish,Cancers (Basel). 2019 Jul 11;11(7). pii: cancers11070973. doi: 10.3390/cancers11070973.,,20190711,,"['911788/Helse Vest', '182609, 188802, 189028/Kreftforeningen']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We computed hazard ratio (HR) and 95% CI of ALL in relation to the presence of maternal diabetes through Cox proportional regression models. RESULTS: We observed 145 cases of ALL, with a higher incidence in children born to women with pregestational diabetes compared to the others (12.4 vs 4.6). Adjusted hazard ratio of ALL was 2.6 (CI, 0.6-10.5) for maternal diabetes. DISCUSSION: We estimated higher risks of ALL in the offspring of women with pregestational diabetes.

To investigate the prognostic significance of TL and its correlation with cytogenetic aberrations and somatic mutations, we analyzed TL measurements at the cellular level by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in patients with CLL in Korea. The present study enrolled 110 patients (41 females and 69 males) diagnosed with CLL according to the World Health Organization criteria (2001-2017). TLs of bone marrow nucleated cells at the single-cell level were measured by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization (Q-FISH) in 71 patients. The correlations of TL with clinical characteristics, cytogenetic aberrations, genetic mutations, and overall survival were assessed. The median value of mean TL in CLL patients (T/C ratio 7.46 (range 1.19-18.14) was significantly shorter than that in the normal controls (T/C ratio 15.28 (range 8.59-24.93) (p < 0.001). Shorter TLs were associated with complex karyotypes (p = 0.030), del(11q22) (p = 0.023), presence of deletion and/or mutation in ATM and/or TP53 (p = 0.019), and SH2B3 mutation (p = 0.015). A shorter TL was correlated with lower hemoglobin levels and adverse survival (mean TL < 9.35, p = 0.021). When the proportion of cells with extremely short TLs (< 7.61) was greater than 90%, CLL patients showed poor survival (p = 0.002). Complex karyotypes, TP53 mutation, and the number of mutated genes were determined to be significant adverse variables by multivariable Cox analysis (p = 0.011, p = 0.002, and p = 0.002, respectively). TL was attrited in CLL, and attrited telomeres were correlated with adverse survival and other well-known adverse prognostic factors. We infer that TL is an independent adverse prognostic predictor in Korean CLL.","['Song, Da Young', 'Kim, Jung-Ah', 'Jeong, Dajeong', 'Yun, Jiwon', 'Kim, Sung-Min', 'Lim, Kyumin', 'Park, Si Nae', 'Im, Kyongok', 'Choi, Sungbin', 'Yoon, Sung-Soo', 'Lee, Dong Soon']","['Song DY', 'Kim JA', 'Jeong D', 'Yun J', 'Kim SM', 'Lim K', 'Park SN', 'Im K', 'Choi S', 'Yoon SS', 'Lee DS']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2836-8862'],"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Chung-Ang University Hospital, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.', 'Cancer Research Institute, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (SH2B3 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (ATM protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins)']",IM,,"['Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing/genetics', 'Aged', 'Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins/genetics', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Republic of Korea', '*Telomere Homeostasis', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics']",PMC6650075,,,2019/07/25 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2018/11/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0220177 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-33276 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jul 23;14(7):e0220177. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0220177. eCollection 2019.,,20190723,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, there are no efficient methods to prevent relapse after allo-HSCT. Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells have achieved favorable outcomes in the treatment of refractory/relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) because of their strong anti-leukemia activity. However, it is unclear whether the CAR-T cells constructed using viral systems can be used as preventive infusions to prevent relapse after haploidentical HSCT. PATIENT CONCERNS: Two patients with ALL with high risk received haploidentical HSCT. DIAGNOSES: Two patients were diagnosed with ALL with high risk. INTERVENTIONS: Patients received preventive infusion of donor-derived CAR-T cells constructed using viral systems on day 60 after haploidentical HSCT. OUTCOMES: The CAR-T cells were continually detected, and no graft versus host disease developed. The two patients survived with disease-free for 1 year and 6 months, respectively. LESSONS: Preventive infusion of donor-derived CAR-T cells after haploidentical HSCT may be safe and that immunosuppressors may not affect the proliferation of CAR-T cells.","['Zhang, Cheng', 'Ma, Ying-Ying', 'Liu, Jun', 'Liu, Yao', 'Gao, Lei', 'Gao, Li', 'Kong, Pei-Yan', 'Xiong, Qing-Hui', 'Mei, Wei-Ling', 'Liu, Jia', 'Jiang, Peng-Fei', 'Ye, Xun', 'Zhong, Jiang F', 'Cao, Wei', 'Han, De-Ping', 'Zhang, Xi']","['Zhang C', 'Ma YY', 'Liu J', 'Liu Y', 'Gao L', 'Gao L', 'Kong PY', 'Xiong QH', 'Mei WL', 'Liu J', 'Jiang PF', 'Ye X', 'Zhong JF', 'Cao W', 'Han DP', 'Zhang X']",,"['Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University; State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Chongqing.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University; State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Chongqing.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University; State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Chongqing.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University; State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Chongqing.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University; State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Chongqing.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University; State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Chongqing.', 'Department of Hematology, Xinqiao Hospital, Army Medical University; State Key Laboratory of Trauma, Burns and Combined Injury, Chongqing.', 'Improvinglife Biotechnology Co.

Most commonly, B-LBL presents as bony lesions, but in rare cases, the disease manifests cutaneously. We present a case of simultaneous cutaneous and systemic presentation of B-LBL in an otherwise healthy 28-year-old man in which the lymphoblastic infiltrate stained positive for CD79a, Tdt, CD10, and CD20.

We explore the roles of various cell types in orchestrating anti-leukemic immunity, as well as those contributing to the unique immune suppressive state of myeloid diseases. We discuss specific approaches to engage the immune system, while noting the challenges of the AML antigen landscape and the barriers to immune modulation. We review the potential for immunomodulatory agents in combination with cellular therapies, donor lymphocyte infusion, and following SCT. Finally, to address the challenge of minimal residual disease (MRD) following chemotherapy, we propose combination epigenetic and immunotherapy for the eradication of MRD.","['Knorr, David A', 'Goldberg, Aaron D', 'Stein, Eytan M', 'Tallman, Martin S']","['Knorr DA', 'Goldberg AD', 'Stein EM', 'Tallman MS']",,"['Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Genetics and Immunology, Rockefeller University, New York, NY, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,,IM,,"['Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy/*methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Neoplasm, Residual/*prevention & control', 'Prognosis']",PMC6928392,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*Immunotherapy', '*T cells', '*antibodies', '*checkpoint blockade', '*neoantigen', '*vaccines']",2019/07/25 06:00,2020/09/20 06:00,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1639167 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Dec;60(14):3350-3362. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1639167.

Objective: Macrophage alternative activation, TGF-beta1 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) are intensively involved in pulmonary fibrosis. Recent studies demonstrated that Apo A-I resolved established pulmonary fibrotic nodules, and D-4F inhibited TGF-beta1 induced EMT in alveolar cells. Therefore, this study evaluated the effects of D-4F on IL-4 induced macrophage alternative activation and TGF-beta1 expression. Materials and methods: THP-1 cells were simulated with PMA (100 ng/mL) for 48 h and treated with medium control, IL-4 (20 ng/mL) alone, or IL-4 (20 ng/mL) in the presence of D-4F (1, 5, and 10 mug/mL) for 24 and 48 h. Flow cytometry, RT-PCR and ELISA evaluations were performed to investigate the subsequent effects of D-4F. Results: Compared to stimulation with IL-4 alone, 1, 5, and 10 mug/mL of D-4F reduced alternative activation by 45.38%, 59.98%, and 60.10%, increased TNF-alpha mRNA levels by 8%, 11%, and 16% and decreased TGF-beta1 mRNA levels by 21%, 37%, and 39%, respectively (all p </= 0.05). In addition, TNF-alpha protein levels increased from 388 pg/mL (IL-4 alone) to 429, 475, and 487 pg/mL (1, 5, and 10 mug/mL D-4F), while TGF-beta1 protein levels dropped from 27.01 pg/mL (IL-4 alone) to 19.15, 12.27, and 10.47 pg/mL (1, 5, and 10 mug/mL D-4F). Conclusion: D-4F suppressed IL-4 induced macrophage alternative activation and pro-fibrotic TGF-beta1 expression.","['Song, Xuejiao', 'Shi, Ying', 'You, Jia', 'Wang, Zhengshu', 'Xie, Linshen', 'Zhang, Chaoxiong', 'Xiong, Jingyuan']","['Song X', 'Shi Y', 'You J', 'Wang Z', 'Xie L', 'Zhang C', 'Xiong J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9354-862X'],"['a West China School of Public Health and Healthy Food Evaluation Center, Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'a West China School of Public Health and Healthy Food Evaluation Center, Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'a West China School of Public Health and Healthy Food Evaluation Center, Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'a West China School of Public Health and Healthy Food Evaluation Center, Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'b Research Center for Occupational Respiratory Diseases, West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'b Research Center for Occupational Respiratory Diseases, West China Fourth Hospital, Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'a West China School of Public Health and Healthy Food Evaluation Center, Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Pharm Biol,Pharmaceutical biology,9812552,"['0 (APOA1 protein, human)', '0 (Apolipoprotein A-I)', '0 (D-4F peptide)', '0 (TGFB1 protein, human)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta1)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",IM,,"['Apolipoprotein A-I/*pharmacology', 'Epithelial Cells', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Pulmonary Fibrosis', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta1/*metabolism']",PMC6691790,['NOTNLM'],"['Apo A-I mimetic', 'M2 macrophage', 'THP-1', 'monocyte-derived macrophages', 'pulmonary fibrosis']",2019/07/25 06:00,2020/03/18 06:00,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/13880209.2019.1640747 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharm Biol. 2019 Dec;57(1):470-476. doi: 10.1080/13880209.2019.1640747.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The assessment of the quality of life (QoL) by the patient is the important indicator of the effects of treatment by the means of physical, psychical and social functioning. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the QoL of children treated for ALL and the stress levels of their parents. Additionally, the impact of the most common symptoms on perceived QoL was analysed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with ALL (mean age 9.03) were enrolled in the study. The questionnaire of Paediatric Quality of Life (PedsQL) and the medical records as the source of the socio-clinical data were applied in this study. RESULTS: In QoL assessment, the social functioning reached the highest score (67.57 +/- 21.33), and physical functioning - the lowest score (51.1 +/- 25.59). The analysis of the symptoms showed that the most intensive were stress (7.19 +/- 2.71), fatigue and weakness (5.19 +/- 2.76). In Spearman's rank correlation analysis the depressed mood, fatigue and weakness were significant negative predictors influencing QoL in all the domains of PedsQoL. In the linear regression analysis only the depressed mood was the significant independent determinant of the decreased QoL in the majority of the domains of PedsQoL, respectively: the general QoL (beta = -0.314; p = 0.002); psychosocial functioning (beta = -3.44; p < 0.01); role functioning (beta = -3.18; p = 0.004); social functioning (beta = -3.5; p = 0.007) and emotional functioning (beta = -3.012; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life of children with ALL is decreased and of the lowest value in the range of physical health. The factors negatively influencing the QoL are depressed mood, fatigue and weakness. The significant independent determinant of the decreased QoL is children's depressed mood.","['Jankowska-Polanska, Beata', 'Sliwinski, Maciej', 'Swiatoniowska, Natalia', 'Butrym, Aleksandra', 'Mazur, Grzegorz']","['Jankowska-Polanska B', 'Sliwinski M', 'Swiatoniowska N', 'Butrym A', 'Mazur G']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1120-3535', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4211-9205']","['Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Clinical Nursing, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Student Scientific Societies of Clinical Nursing, Public Health Department, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Clinical Nursing, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department and Clinic of Internal and Occupational Diseases and Hypertension, Wroclaw Medical University, Wroclaw, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Sweden,Scand J Caring Sci,Scandinavian journal of caring sciences,8804206,,,,"['Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Emotions', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*physiopathology/psychology', '*Quality of Life', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'United States']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', 'children', 'quality of life']",2019/07/25 06:00,2021/05/04 06:00,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/06/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/scs.12739 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Caring Sci. 2020 Jun;34(2):380-389. doi: 10.1111/scs.12739.

While single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP-A) has demonstrated the ability to detect chromosomal defects with greater sensitivity than conventional karyotype, widespread adoption is limited by the unknown additional prognostic impact of SNP-A analysis. Here, we investigate the significance of additional SNP-A abnormalities in the setting of MDS and demonstrate differences in survival of patients with additional abnormalities, even those initially characterized as relatively lower risk either by cytogenetic score or IPSS-R. Our findings identify specific abnormalities, particularly KMT2A partial tandem duplication, that are invisible to conventional karyotype and potentially contribute to the poor prognosis of MDS patients. Furthermore, these results demonstrate the added value of SNP-A analysis in identifying patients who may benefit from more aggressive therapy, particularly those who would otherwise be classified into lower risk categories.","['Choi, Sarah M', 'Van Norman, Steven B', 'Bixby, Dale L', 'Shao, Lina']","['Choi SM', 'Van Norman SB', 'Bixby DL', 'Shao L']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-7028-7313'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Chromosomes Cancer,"Genes, chromosomes & cancer",9007329,"['0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Cytogenetic Analysis/*methods', 'Female', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Karyotype', 'Karyotyping', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*genetics/metabolism', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide/genetics', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*MDS', '*SNP array', '*SNP-A', '*cytogenomic array', '*myelodysplastic syndrome']",2019/07/25 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/17 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/gcc.22783 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2019 Nov;58(11):756-774. doi: 10.1002/gcc.22783.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of the medical records of patients with probable or definite PML was carried out. Clinical variables, complementary studies (cerebrospinal fluid, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain) and prognostic variables were analysed. Non-parametric statistical tests were used to compare HIV-positive and HIV non-positive populations. RESULTS: Fourteen patients with definite and one probable diagnosis of PML were included. Nine patients had PML associated with HIV; five had other immunosuppressive conditions (two, chronic lymphatic leukaemia; one, multiple sclerosis; one, neuromyelitis optica; and one, neurosarcoidosis); and one, no obvious immunosuppressive condition. The population with HIV presented heterogeneous dirty-appearing white matter lesions more frequently (77.7% versus 16.67%; p = 0.0247) in the cerebral MRI. No other significant differences were identified in the remaining variables analysed. CONCLUSION: HIV/AIDS is the pathology most frequently associated with PML. With the use of immunomodulator drugs its appearance is reported in a variety of other diseases. Heterogeneous dirty-appearing white matter lesions were significantly more common in HIV patients.","['Camporro, J', 'Bruno, V', 'Cammarota, A', 'Del Castillo, M', 'Alessandro, L']","['Camporro J', 'Bruno V', 'Cammarota A', 'Del Castillo M', 'Alessandro L']",,"['Instituto de Investigaciones Neurologicas Dr. Raul Carrea (FLENI), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Neurologicas Dr. Raul Carrea (FLENI), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Neurologicas Dr. Raul Carrea (FLENI), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Neurologicas Dr. Raul Carrea (FLENI), Buenos Aires, Argentina.', 'Instituto de Investigaciones Neurologicas Dr. Raul Carrea (FLENI), Buenos Aires, Argentina.']",['spa'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Spain,Rev Neurol,Revista de neurologia,7706841,['0 (Immunologic Factors)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/virology', 'Female', 'HIV Infections/*complications', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Immunologic Factors/therapeutic use', 'JC Virus/physiology', 'Leukoencephalopathy, Progressive Multifocal/*complications/diagnostic imaging/pathology/virology', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuroimaging', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Virus Activation', 'White Matter/diagnostic imaging/pathology']",,,,2019/07/25 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.33588/rn.6904.2019040 [doi]', 'rn2019040 [pii]']",ppublish,Rev Neurol. 2019 Aug 16;69(4):152-158. doi: 10.33588/rn.6904.2019040.,,,,,,,,,Espectro clinico de la leucoencefalopatia multifocal progresiva: diferencias y similitudes en pacientes con y sin virus de la inmunodeficiencia humana.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. We hypothesized that UGT2B17 impacts intracellular levels of hormone-like signaling molecules involved in the regulation of gene expression in leukemic cells. We initially confirmed in a third cohort of 291 CLL patients that those with high UGT2B17 displayed poor prognosis (hazard ratio of 2.31, P = 0.015). Consistent with the unfavorable prognostic significance of elevated UGT2B17 expression in CLL patients, high UGT2B17 expression was associated with enhanced proliferation of MEC1 and JVM2 malignant B-cell models. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that high UGT2B17 was linked to a significant alteration of genes related to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and to its precursor arachidonic acid, both in cell models and a cohort of 448 CLL patients. In functional assays, PGE2 emerged as a negative regulator of apoptosis in CLL patients and proliferation in cells models, whereas its effect was partially abrogated by high UGT2B17 expression in MEC1 and JVM2 cells. Enzymatic assays and mass-spectrometry analyses established that the UGT2B17 enzyme inactivates PGE2 by its conjugation to glucuronic acid (GlcA) leading to the formation of two glucuronide (G) derivatives. High UGT2B17 expression was further associated with a proficient inactivation of PGE2 to PGE2-G in CLL patient cells and cell models. We conclude that UGT2B17-dependent PGE2 glucuronidation impairs anti-oncogenic PGE2 effects in leukemic cells, thereby partially contributing to disease progression in high UGT2B17 CLL patients.","['Allain, Eric P', 'Rouleau, Michele', 'Le, Trang', 'Vanura, Katrina', 'Villeneuve, Lyne', 'Caron, Patrick', 'Turcotte, Veronique', 'Levesque, Eric', 'Guillemette, Chantal']","['Allain EP', 'Rouleau M', 'Le T', 'Vanura K', 'Villeneuve L', 'Caron P', 'Turcotte V', 'Levesque E', 'Guillemette C']",,"['Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec (CHU de Quebec) Research Center - Universite Laval, Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec (CHU de Quebec) Research Center - Universite Laval, Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Division of Hematology and Hemostaseology, Department of Medicine I, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec (CHU de Quebec) Research Center - Universite Laval, Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec (CHU de Quebec) Research Center - Universite Laval, Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec (CHU de Quebec) Research Center - Universite Laval, Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Division of Hemato-Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, CHU de Quebec Research Centre - Universite Laval, Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Pharmacogenomics Laboratory, Faculty of Pharmacy, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec (CHU de Quebec) Research Center - Universite Laval, Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada.', 'Canada Research Chair in Pharmacogenomics, Quebec City, QC, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,,PMC6621974,['NOTNLM'],"['CLL', 'PGE2', 'UGT2B17', 'glucuronidation', 'prostaglandins']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/07/25 06:01,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00606 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Jul 4;9:606. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00606. eCollection 2019.,,20190704,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, since the majority of patients will need to remain on treatment indefinitely, physicians in care of CML patients need be familiar with the indications and toxicities of all approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). In clinical practice, there are five TKI (imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib) that are available in different scenarios and have distinct safety profiles. Decisions regarding first line treatment must be based on CML risk, comorbidities, and patients expectations. Despite the excellent outcome, half of the patients will eventually fail (due to intolerance or resistance) to first line treatment, with many of them requiring a third or even further lines of therapy. When selecting for such patients, it is essential to distinguish between failure and intolerance to previous TKIs.

Several gene mutations such as in NPM1 (nucleophosmin 1) are involved in the pathogenesis and progression of AML. The aim of this study was to identify genes whose expression is associated with driver mutations and survival outcome. Genotype data (somatic mutations) and gene expression data including RNA-seq, microarray, and qPCR data were used for the analysis. Multiple datasets were utilized as training sets (GSE6891, TCGA, and GSE1159). A new clinical sample cohort (Semmelweis set) was established for in vitro validation. Wilcoxon analysis was used to identify genes with expression alterations between the mutant and wild type samples. Cox regression analysis was performed to examine the association between gene expression and survival outcome. Data analysis was performed in the R statistical environment. Eighty-five genes were identified with significantly altered expression when comparing NPM1 mutant and wild type patient groups in the GSE6891 set. Additional training sets were used as a filter to condense the six most significant genes associated with NPM1 mutations. Then, the expression changes of these six genes were confirmed in the Semmelweis set: HOXA5 (P=3.06E-12, FC=8.3), HOXA10 (P=2.44E-09, FC=3.3), HOXB5 (P=1.86E-13, FC=37), MEIS1 (P=9.82E-10, FC=4.4), PBX3 (P=1.03E-13, FC=5.4) and ITM2A (P=0.004, FC=0.4). Cox regression analysis showed that higher expression of these genes - with the exception of ITM2A - was associated with worse overall survival. Higher expression of the HOX genes was identified in tumors harboring NPM1 gene mutations by computationally linking genotype and gene expression. In vitro validation of these genes supports their potential therapeutic application in AML.","['Nagy, Adam', 'Osz, Agnes', 'Budczies, Jan', 'Krizsan, Szilvia', 'Szombath, Gergely', 'Demeter, Judit', 'Bodor, Csaba', 'Gyorffy, Balazs']","['Nagy A', 'Osz A', 'Budczies J', 'Krizsan S', 'Szombath G', 'Demeter J', 'Bodor C', 'Gyorffy B']",,"['MTA TTK Lendulet Cancer Biomarker Research Group, Hungarian Academy of Sciences Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Institute of Enzymology, Magyar Tudosok korutja 2, 1117 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Semmelweis University 2nd Dept. of Pediatrics, Tuzolto utca 7-9, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA TTK Lendulet Cancer Biomarker Research Group, Hungarian Academy of Sciences Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Institute of Enzymology, Magyar Tudosok korutja 2, 1117 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Semmelweis University 2nd Dept. of Pediatrics, Tuzolto utca 7-9, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Institute of Pathology, University Hospital Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology, and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '3rd Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', '1st Department of Internal Medicine, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA-SE Lendulet Molecular Oncohematology Research Group, 1st Department of Pathology, and Experimental Cancer Research, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary.', 'MTA TTK Lendulet Cancer Biomarker Research Group, Hungarian Academy of Sciences Research Centre for Natural Sciences, Institute of Enzymology, Magyar Tudosok korutja 2, 1117 Budapest, Hungary.', 'Semmelweis University 2nd Dept. of Pediatrics, Tuzolto utca 7-9, 1094 Budapest, Hungary.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Egypt,J Adv Res,Journal of advanced research,101546952,,,,,PMC6614546,['NOTNLM'],"['AML, acute myeloid leukemia', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Clinical samples', 'FAB classification, French-American-British classification', 'FC, fold change', 'Gene expression', 'HOX genes', 'HOX, homeobox', 'HR, hazard ratio', 'ITD, internal tandem duplication', 'MEIS, myeloid ecotropic viral integration site', 'Mutation', 'NCBI GEO, National Center for Biotechnology Gene expression Omnibus', 'OS, overall survival', 'PBX, pre-B-cell leukemia homeobox', 'Survival', 'TCGA, The Cancer Genome Atlas', 'WHO, World Health Organization', 'qPCR, quantitative polymerase chain reaction']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/07/25 06:01,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/27 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.jare.2019.05.006 [doi]', 'S2090-1232(19)30108-0 [pii]']",epublish,J Adv Res. 2019 Jun 11;20:105-116. doi: 10.1016/j.jare.2019.05.006. eCollection 2019 Nov.,,20190611,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is further responsible for leukemic clonal evolution. In this study, significant RAG1 increase is observed in the subsets of B-ALL patients, and high expression of RAG1 is observed to be correlated with high proliferation markers. IKZF1-encoded protein, IKAROS, directly binds to the RAG1 promoter and regulates RAG1 expression in leukemic cells. CK2 inhibitor by increasing IKAROS activity significantly suppresses RAG1 expression in ALL in an IKAROS-dependent manner. Patients with IKZF1 deletion have significantly higher expression of RAG1 compared to that without IKZF1 deletion. CK2 inhibitor treatment also results in an increase in IKZF1 binding to the RAG1 promoter and suppression of RAG1 expression in primary ALL cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that RAG1 high expression is associated with high proliferation markers in B-ALL. Our data for the first time proved that RAG1 expression is directly suppressed by IKAROS.

An obligate by-product of many of these reactions is the excised signal circle (ESC), generated by excision of the DNA from between the gene segments. Initially, the ESC was believed to be inert and formed to protect the genome from reactive broken DNA ends but more recent work suggests that the ESC poses a substantial threat to genome stability. Crucially, the recombinase re-binds to the ESC, which can result in it being re-integrated back into the genome, to cause potentially oncogenic insertion events. In addition, very recently, the ESC/recombinase complex was found to catalyze breaks at recombination signal sequences (RSSs) throughout the genome, via a ""cut-and-run"" mechanism. Remarkably, the ESC/recombinase complex triggers these breaks at key leukemia driver genes, implying that this reaction could be a significant cause of lymphocyte genome instability. Here, we explore these alternate pathways and discuss their relative dangers to lymphocyte genome stability.","['Smith, Alastair L', 'Scott, James N F', 'Boyes, Joan']","['Smith AL', 'Scott JNF', 'Boyes J']",,"['School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.', 'School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,,IM,,"['Animals', 'Genome, Human/*immunology', 'Genomic Instability/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'V(D)J Recombination/*immunology']",PMC6620893,['NOTNLM'],"['*RAG proteins', '*V(D)J recombination', '*double strand breaks', '*genome instability', '*leukemia']",2019/07/25 06:00,2020/10/23 06:00,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/04/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/23 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01572 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jul 4;10:1572. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01572. eCollection 2019.,,20190704,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein, we investigate the effects of abnormal miR-29c expression and analyze its clinical significance in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. In addition, decitabine (DAC) has made great progress in the treatment of AML in recent years, but DAC resistance is still common phenomenon and the mechanism of resistance is still unclear. We further analyze the influences of miR-29c to leukemic cells treated with DAC. Methods: Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) was carried out to detect miR-29c transcript level in 102 de novo AML patients and 25 normal controls. miR-29c/shRNA-29c were respectively transfected into K562 cells and HEL cells. Cell viability after transfection was detected by cell counting Kit-8 assays. Flow cytometry was used to detect apoptosis. Results: MiR-29c was significantly down-regulated in AML (P < 0.001). Low miR-29c expression was frequently observed in patients with poor karyotype and high risk (P = 0.006 and 0.013, respectively). Patients with low miR-29c expression had a markedly shorter overall survival (OS) than those with high miR-29c expression (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the independent prognostic value of low miR-29c expression in both the whole cohort as well as the cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) subset. Over-expression of miR-29c in K562 treated with DAC inhibited growth, while silencing of miR-29c in HEL promoted growth and inhibited apoptosis. MiR-29c overexpression decreased the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DAC in K562, while miR-29c silencing increased the IC50 of DAC in HEL. The demethylation of the miR-29c promoter was associated with its up-regulated expression. Although miR-29c demethylation was also observed in DAC-resistant K562 (K562/DAC), miR-29c expression was down-regulated. MiR-29c transfection also promoted apoptosis and decreased the IC50 of DAC in K562/DAC cells. Conclusions: Our results suggest that miR-29c down-regulation may act as an independent prognostic biomarker in AML patients, and miR-29c over-expression can increase the sensitivity of both non-resistant and resistant of leukemic cells to DAC.","['Tang, Li-Juan', 'Sun, Guo-Kang', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Wu, De-Hong', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Ma, Bei-Bei', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Chen, Qin', 'Yao, Dong-Ming', 'Qian, Jun', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Lin, Jiang']","['Tang LJ', 'Sun GK', 'Zhang TJ', 'Wu DH', 'Zhou JD', 'Ma BB', 'Xu ZJ', 'Wen XM', 'Chen Q', 'Yao DM', 'Qian J', 'Ma JC', 'Lin J']",,"[""1Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2"", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""1Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2"", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""1Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2"", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, The Third People's Hospital of Kunshan City, 615 Zizhu Rd, Kunshan, 215300 People's Republic of China."", ""1Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2"", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""1Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2"", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""1Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2"", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""1Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2"", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""1Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2"", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""1Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2"", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu People's Republic of China."", ""2Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2"", ""1Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2"", ""1Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University, 8 Dianli Rd., Zhenjiang, 212002 People's Republic of China.grid.452247.2""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Cell Int,Cancer cell international,101139795,,,,,PMC6617691,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Decitabine', 'MiR-29c expression', 'Prognostic']",2019/07/25 06:00,2019/07/25 06:01,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12935-019-0894-y [doi]', '894 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Cell Int. 2019 Jul 10;19:177. doi: 10.1186/s12935-019-0894-y. eCollection 2019.,,20190710,,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to develop a population-pharmacokinetic model of durvalumab in patients with various hematologic malignancies and to investigate the effects of demographic and disease factors on the pharmacokinetics in this population. METHODS: A total of 1812 concentrations from 267 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or Hodgkin lymphoma were included in the analysis. RESULTS: The pharmacokinetics of durvalumab was adequately described by a two-compartment model with first-order elimination. A decrease in durvalumab clearance over time was mainly explained by incorporation of time-dependent changes in albumin (in all patients) and immunoglobulin G (in patients with multiple myeloma) into the model. For multiple myeloma, patients with immunoglobulin G >/= 20 g/L showed a 30% lower area under the concentration-time curve at cycle 1 compared with patients with immunoglobulin G < 20 g/L. The impact of any baseline covariates on durvalumab pharmacokinetics did not appear to be clinically relevant. The pharmacokinetics of durvalumab in hematologic malignancies was generally consistent with previously reported pharmacokinetics in solid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the same dosing regimen (1500 mg every 4 weeks) for both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies from the perspective of adequate exposure. Additionally, total immunoglobulin G level could be a critical covariate for the pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies in patients with multiple myeloma.","['Ogasawara, Ken', 'Newhall, Kathryn', 'Maxwell, Stephen E', ""Dell'Aringa, Justine"", 'Komashko, Vitalina', 'Kilavuz, Nurgul', 'Delarue, Richard', 'Czuczman, Myron', 'Sternas, Lars', 'Rose, Shelonitda', 'Beach, C L', 'Novick, Steven', 'Zhou, Simon', 'Palmisano, Maria', 'Li, Yan']","['Ogasawara K', 'Newhall K', 'Maxwell SE', ""Dell'Aringa J"", 'Komashko V', 'Kilavuz N', 'Delarue R', 'Czuczman M', 'Sternas L', 'Rose S', 'Beach CL', 'Novick S', 'Zhou S', 'Palmisano M', 'Li Y']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4264-8927', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7609-2683']","['Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Boudry, Switzerland.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Kansas City, KS, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA.', 'Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA. yali@celgene.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Albumins)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '28X28X9OKV (durvalumab)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Albumins/drug effects/metabolism', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Area Under Curve', 'Female', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/ethnology/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin G/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy/immunology/metabolism', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/drug therapy/metabolism']",PMC7007418,,,2019/07/25 06:00,2021/05/26 06:00,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40262-019-00804-x [doi]', '10.1007/s40262-019-00804-x [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2020 Feb;59(2):217-227. doi: 10.1007/s40262-019-00804-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Patients enrolled in a CLL treatment clinical trial (N = 106) participated at baseline following informed consent and prior to treatment initiation. Risk factors with empirical support (personal or family psychiatric history, recurrent, advanced or progressive disease, low socioeconomic status, gender, medical comorbidities, and single marital status) and additional risk factors (cancer-specific stress, social contacts, negative life events, absolute lymphocyte counts, treatment group, and fatigue) were measured at baseline to predict depression and anxiety symptoms at 12 months. RESULTS: Data show 14% (n = 15) and 12% (n = 13) of patients experienced moderate-severe depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses found medical comorbidities predicted 12-month anxiety symptoms (p < 0.05). Also, negative life events predicted depression and anxiety symptoms and fatigue predicted depression symptoms (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Empirically supported risk factors associated with depression and anxiety symptoms are limited in predicting future depression and anxiety symptoms beyond initial screening in patients with CLL. In addition to levels of depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, negative life events, higher levels of fatigue, and greater medical comorbidities were associated with future depression or anxiety symptoms in patients with CLL.","['Robbertz, Abigail S', 'Weiss, David M', 'Awan, Farrukh T', 'Byrd, John C', 'Rogers, Kerry A', 'Woyach, Jennifer A']","['Robbertz AS', 'Weiss DM', 'Awan FT', 'Byrd JC', 'Rogers KA', 'Woyach JA']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1074-7787'],"['Department of Psychology, The Ohio State University, 1835 Neil Avenue, Columbus, OH, 43210, USA.

These novel small molecules mimic BH3-only proteins by antagonizing the pro-survival function of anti-apoptotic proteins, thereby inducing apoptosis in cancer cells. To qualify as an authentic BH3 mimetic, a compound must function directly on the mitochondria of a cell of known anti-apoptotic dependence, must directly and selectively inhibit the anti-apoptotic protein with high-affinity binding, and must induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) and apoptosis in a BAX/BAK-dependent manner. While many BH3 mimetics have entered clinical trials, the lack of a reliable validation assay to directly test the mitochondrial activity of new BH3 mimetic candidates has resulted in many misleading reports of agents touted as BH3 mimetics despite their off-target mechanisms of action. BH3 profiling probes the activity of a compound at the mitochondrial level by measuring cytochrome c release as a surrogate marker for MOMP. We propose a comprehensive biochemical toolkit consisting of BH3 profiling in parallel with high-throughput Annexin V/Hoechst viability testing to validate BH3 mimetic candidates. We tested our toolkit on eighteen different putative BH3 mimetics using a set of standardized cell lines of known anti-apoptotic dependence. Included in this set of cell lines is an apoptosis refractory BAX/BAK DKO control line to detect compounds that function independently of the BCL-2 family. Taken together, this rapid, efficient means of testing will prove advantageous as the demand for BH3 mimetics increases, particularly in the quest to identify and develop more potent MCL-1 inhibitors for use in the clinic.

Here, we describe an optimized and efficient pipeline for the generation of novel conditional overexpression mouse models in which putative oncogenes, along with an eGFP/Luciferase dual reporter, are expressed from the endogenous ROSA26 (R26) promoter. The efficiency of this approach was demonstrated by the generation and validation of novel R26 knock-in (KI) mice that allow conditional overexpression of Jarid2, Runx2, MN1 and a dominant negative allele of ETV6. As proof of concept, we confirm that MN1 overexpression in the hematopoietic lineage is sufficient to drive myeloid leukemia. In addition, we show that T-cell specific activation of MN1 in combination with loss of Pten increases tumour penetrance and stimulates the formation of Lyl1(+) murine T-cell lymphoblastic leukemias or lymphomas (T-ALL/T-LBL). Finally, we demonstrate that these luciferase-positive murine AML and T-ALL/T-LBL cells are transplantable into immunocompromised mice allowing preclinical evaluation of novel anti-leukemic drugs in vivo.","['Pieters, Tim', ""T'Sas, Sara"", 'Demoen, Lisa', 'Almeida, Andre', 'Haenebalcke, Lieven', 'Matthijssens, Filip', 'Lemeire, Kelly', ""D'Hont, Jinke"", 'Van Rockeghem, Frederique', 'Hochepied, Tino', 'Lintermans, Beatrice', 'Reunes, Lindy', 'Lammens, Tim', 'Berx, Geert', 'Haigh, Jody J', 'Goossens, Steven', 'Van Vlierberghe, Pieter']","['Pieters T', ""T'Sas S"", 'Demoen L', 'Almeida A', 'Haenebalcke L', 'Matthijssens F', 'Lemeire K', ""D'Hont J"", 'Van Rockeghem F', 'Hochepied T', 'Lintermans B', 'Reunes L', 'Lammens T', 'Berx G', 'Haigh JJ', 'Goossens S', 'Van Vlierberghe P']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5770-2458', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-9063-7205']","['Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'VIB Inflammation Research Center, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'VIB Inflammation Research Center, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'VIB Inflammation Research Center, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'VIB Inflammation Research Center, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'VIB Inflammation Research Center, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'VIB Inflammation Research Center, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'VIB Inflammation Research Center, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'VIB Inflammation Research Center, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Department of Biomedical Molecular Biology, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Cancer Research Institute Ghent, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Mammalian Functional Genetics Group, Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Monash University, Melbourne, VIC, Australia.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology, Cancer Care Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium.

Crossmatch compatibility is not routinely done for platelet transfusions, and transfusion of ABO non-identical platelets has been adapted as an acceptable clinical practice. Acute intravascular hemolysis due to ABO non-identical platelets is a rare but clinically significant entity. Our case report reinforces the importance of a vigilant clinical approach in case of ABO non-identical platelet transfusions. CASE REPORT We report the case of 61-year-old woman with blood group A, with chemotherapy-induced asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, who developed acute intravascular hemolysis following transfusion of group O single-donor platelets (SDPs). The patient was transfused 1 unit of single-donor platelets for bleeding prophylaxis, as her platelet count dropped to less than 10x10(9)/L due to chemotherapy that she was receiving for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Immediately after transfusion, the patient noticed cherry-colored urine; and within 12 h of transfusion, her hemoglobin dropped by more than 2.5 g/dL. A post-transfusion immunohematology work-up showed positive DAT and high titers of anti-A1 isohemagglutinins in the platelet donor, supporting the diagnosis of acute intravascular hemolysis due to ABO non-identical platelets. CONCLUSIONS The possibility of acute intravascular hemolysis should be kept in mind in cases of transfusion of group O single donor platelets to non-group O recipients. ABO non-identical platelets, even with low isohemagglutinin titers, can cause significant adverse effects, particularly in newborns, children, and immunosuppressed and transfusion-dependent patients; therefore, a cautious clinical approach is recommended.","['Moinuddin, Imran A', 'Millward, Peter', 'Fletcher, Craig H']","['Moinuddin IA', 'Millward P', 'Fletcher CH']",,"['Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, USA.', 'Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Beaumont Hospital, Royal Oak, MI, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)'],IM,,"['*ABO Blood-Group System', '*Blood Group Incompatibility', 'Female', '*Hemolysis', 'Humans', 'Immunocompromised Host', 'Middle Aged', '*Platelet Transfusion', 'Thrombocytopenia/therapy']",PMC6668583,,,2019/07/25 06:00,2020/01/30 06:00,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/30 06:00 [medline]']","['915521 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.915521 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2019 Jul 23;20:1075-1079. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.915521.,,20190723,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumors must learn to evade effectors and employ a wide variety of mechanisms to do so. Bispecific Abs (BsAbs) are an emerging cancer immunotherapy approach seeking to re-engage either T effectors or NK cells with malignant cells. Possessing specificity for effector cells on one end and a tumor Ag on the other, these molecules work by attracting effectors to the target cell to build an immunologic synapse and induce tumor cell killing. The BsAb blinatumomab, for example, has specificity for the T cell-activating cell surface protein CD3 and the B cell Ag CD19. The only BsAb with regulatory approval currently, blinatumomab is used in the treatment of relapsed or refractory B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Many additional BsAbs are in preclinical development, however, targeting many different tumor types. The variety of potential effector cells and cancer Ags, along with potential combination therapies, make BsAbs an active area of drug development. In this review, we discuss cancer recognition by the immune system and structural and mechanistic aspects of BsAbs. We summarize key steps in preclinical development and subsequent translation to medical practice. Future directions for BsAbs include combinations with a wide variety of both immunologic and nonimmunologic therapies. Defining their optimum clinical use is at early stages.","['Trabolsi, Asaad', 'Arumov, Artavazd', 'Schatz, Jonathan H']","['Trabolsi A', 'Arumov A', 'Schatz JH']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-2479-1797', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9520-2777', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1842-228X']","['Division of Hospital Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33137.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33137.', 'Sheila and David Fuente Graduate Program in Cancer Biology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136; and.', 'Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33137; jschatz@med.miami.edu.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, FL 33136.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (Antigens, CD19)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CD19 molecule, human)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '4FR53SIF3A (blinatumomab)']",IM,,"['Antibodies, Bispecific/*immunology/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, CD19/immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,,,2019/07/25 06:00,2020/04/14 06:00,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/05/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [medline]']","['203/3/585 [pii]', '10.4049/jimmunol.1900496 [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 2019 Aug 1;203(3):585-592. doi: 10.4049/jimmunol.1900496.,"['Copyright (c) 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.']",,,['P30 CA240139/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The discovery of novel discriminative biomarkers remains of utmost value for improving outcome predictions. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a histone methyltransferase of H3K27me3. It is frequently up-regulated in human cancers and associated with silencing of differentiation genes. We aimed herein to investigate the prevalence and prognosis impact of somatic EZH2 mutations and their potential associations with other prognostic markers FLT3, NPM1, DNMT3A and IDH2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study population was composed of 211 Tunisian patients with de novo AML and 14 healthy donors. The 11 last exons coding the set domain of EZH2 were investigated by PCR and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: EZH2 mutations were identified in 66/211 (31%) patients with a sex ratio of 1.06. The presence of EZH2 mutations was statistically significantly associated with failure consolidation therapy (p=0.004). There were no differences in the incidence of EZH2 mutations and FLT3-ITD, NPM1, DNMT3A and IDH2 mutations. When EZH2 mutations were associated with those of FLT3 or IDH2, a short duration of progression free survival was observed (p<0.05). Moreover, CD7 aberrant markers conferred a poor prognosis in EZH2 mutated patients (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Given these data we conclude that EZH2 mutations are frequent in our patients, and can be used as a prognosis marker in combination with FLT3, IDH2 mutations and CD7 marker, to stratify AML patients and to guide therapeutic decisions.","['Mechaal, Amal', 'Menif, Samia', 'Abbes, Salem', 'Safra, Ines']","['Mechaal A', 'Menif S', 'Abbes S', 'Safra I']",,"['Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Hematology, Pasteur Institute of Tunis, University of Tunis El Manar, Tunis, Tunisia.

We revealed that the immune response of CAR T cells with specificity for carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was more efficacious against CEA(+) cancer cells when simultaneously incubated with an anti-CD30 immunotoxin or anti-CD30 CAR T cells, although the targeted cancer cells lack CD30. The same effect was achieved when the anti-CD30 single-chain variable fragment (scFv) was integrated into the extracellular domain of the anti-CEA CAR. Improvement in T cell activation was due to interfering with the T cell CD30-CD30L interaction by the antagonistic anti-CD30 scFv HRS3; an agonistic anti-CD30 scFv or targeting the high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor was not effective. T cells with the anti-CD30/CEA CAR showed superior immunity against established CEA(+) CD30(-) tumors in a mouse model. The concept is broadly applicable since anti-CD30/TAG72 CAR T cells also showed improved elimination of TAG72(+) CD30(-) cancer cells. Taken together, targeting CD30 on CAR T cells by the HRS3 scFv within the anti-tumor CAR improves the redirected immune response against solid tumors.","['Hombach, Andreas A', 'Rappl, Gunter', 'Abken, Hinrich']","['Hombach AA', 'Rappl G', 'Abken H']",,"['Center for Molecular Medicine Cologne (CMMC), University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany; Department I of Internal Medicine, University Hospital of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.

METHODS: To search for biomarkers of response, we measured genome-wide DNA methylation, mutations of 54 genes, and expression of a panel of 7 genes in pre-treatment samples from 128 patients treated at therapeutic doses in a phase I/II study. RESULTS: Response rate to guadecitabine was 17% (2 complete remission (CR), 3 CR with incomplete blood count recovery (CRi), or CR with incomplete platelets recovery (CRp)) in the phase I component and 23% (14 CR, 9 CRi/CRp) in phase II. There were no strong mutation or methylation predictors of response. Gene expression clustering defined a subset of patients (~ 20%) that had (i) high DNMT3B and low CDKN2B, CTCF, and CDA expression; (ii) enrichment for KRAS/NRAS mutations; (iii) frequent CpG island hypermethylation; (iv) low long interspersed nuclear element 1 (LINE-1) hypomethylation after treatment; and (v) resistance to guadecitabine in both phase I (response rate 0% vs. 33%, p = 0.07) and phase II components of the study (response rate 5% vs. 30%, p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis identified peripheral blood (PB) blasts and hemoglobin as predictors of response and cytogenetics, gene expression, RAS mutations, and hemoglobin as predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: A subset of patients (~ 20%) with r/r AML is unlikely to benefit from guadecitabine as a single agent. In the remaining 80%, guadecitabine is a viable option with a median survival of 8 months and a 2-year survival rate of 21%.

While acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells manifest low levels of expression of autophagy genes associated with reduced autophagy activity, the introduction of all-trans retinoid acid (ATRA)-a differentiating agent currently used in clinical settings-restores autophagy in these cells. ATRA-induced autophagy is involved in granulocytes differentiation through a mechanism that involves among others the degradation of the PML-RARalpha oncoprotein. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) is another anti-cancer agent that promotes autophagy-dependent clearance of promyelocytic leukemia retinoic acid receptor alpha gene (PML-RARalpha) in APL cells. Hence, enhancing autophagy may have therapeutic benefits in maturation-resistant APL cells. However, the role of autophagy in response to APL therapy is not so simple, because some autophagy proteins have been shown to play a pro-survival role upon ATRA and ATO treatment, and both agents can activate ETosis, a type of cell death mediated by the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (ETs). This review highlights recent findings on the impact of autophagy on the mechanisms of action of ATRA and ATO in APL cells. We also discuss the potential role of autophagy in the development of resistance to treatment, and of differentiation syndrome in APL.","['Moosavi, Mohammad Amin', 'Djavaheri-Mergny, Mojgan']","['Moosavi MA', 'Djavaheri-Mergny M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-9958-2220', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4893-6505']","['Department of Molecular Medicine, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran 14965/161, Iran.', 'Equipe labellisee par la Ligue contre le cancer, Universite Paris Descartes, Universite Sorbonne Paris Cite, Universite Paris Diderot, Sorbonne Universite, INSERM U1138, Centre de Recherche des Cordeliers, Paris 75006, France. mojgan.mergny@inserm.fr.', 'Metabolomics and Cell Biology Platforms, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif 94805, France. mojgan.mergny@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,['S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)'],IM,,"['Arsenic Trioxide/therapeutic use', 'Autophagy/*drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy']",PMC6678259,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'all-trans retinoid acid', 'arsenic trioxide', 'autophagy', 'cell survival', 'differentiation', 'resistance to therapy']",2019/07/25 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/07/24 06:00'],"['2019/06/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/24 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20143559 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20143559 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jul 20;20(14). pii: ijms20143559. doi: 10.3390/ijms20143559.,,20190720,,"['1/National Institute of Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology', '1/Ligue Contre le Cancer', '1/Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To achieve this goal, integrative resources and tools are needed that allow comparison of results across datasets and data types. We propose an intuitive approach for data-driven stratifications of molecular profiles and benchmark our methodology using the dimensionality reduction algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) with multi-study and multi-platform data on hematological malignancies. Our approach enables assessing the contribution of biological versus technical variation to sample clustering, direct incorporation of additional datasets to the same low dimensional representation, comparison of molecular disease subtypes identified from separate t-SNE representations, and characterization of the obtained clusters based on pathway databases and additional data. In this manner, we performed an integrative analysis across multi-omics acute myeloid leukemia studies. Our approach indicated new molecular subtypes with differential survival and drug responsiveness among samples lacking fusion genes, including a novel myelodysplastic syndrome-like cluster and a cluster characterized with CEBPA mutations and differential activity of the S-adenosylmethionine-dependent DNA methylation pathway. In summary, integration across multiple studies can help to identify novel molecular disease subtypes and generate insight into disease biology.","['Mehtonen, Juha', 'Polonen, Petri', 'Hayrynen, Sergei', 'Dufva, Olli', 'Lin, Jake', 'Liuksiala, Thomas', 'Granberg, Kirsi', 'Lohi, Olli', 'Hautamaki, Ville', 'Nykter, Matti', 'Heinaniemi, Merja']","['Mehtonen J', 'Polonen P', 'Hayrynen S', 'Dufva O', 'Lin J', 'Liuksiala T', 'Granberg K', 'Lohi O', 'Hautamaki V', 'Nykter M', 'Heinaniemi M']",,"['Institute of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.', 'Hematology Research Unit Helsinki, University of Helsinki and Department of Hematology, Helsinki University Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center, Helsinki, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, Tampere University and Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.', 'Tampere Center for Child Health Research, Tampere University and Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland.', 'School of Computing, University of Eastern Finland, Joensuu, Finland.', 'Faculty of Medicine and Health Technology, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland.', 'Institute of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,,IM,,"['Algorithms', '*Cluster Analysis', 'Computational Biology/*methods', 'Data Mining/*methods', 'Databases, Genetic', '*Datasets as Topic', 'Gene Expression Profiling/*methods', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Genes, Neoplasm', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/*genetics', 'Mutation', '*Phenotype', 'Sample Size']",PMC6648337,,,2019/07/23 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/07/23 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']","['5477460 [pii]', '10.1093/nar/gkz281 [doi]']",ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 2019 Jul 26;47(13):e76. doi: 10.1093/nar/gkz281.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

While some have attempted to empirically document the psychosocial burden of adolescents and young adults (AYAs), there is a paucity of research exploring this phenomenon from the perspective of AYAs themselves. The purpose of this study is to better understand the lived experiences of young adult cancer survivors and the psychosocial impacts that cancer has had on their lives. Methods: We used qualitative focus group methodologies to elicit positive and negative psychosocial impacts of the cancer experience in a young adult cancer sample. Results: We conducted three separate focus groups (n = 16). The average age of participants was 33 and majority were female (75%), Caucasian (50%), and married (44%). The most common cancer diagnoses were breast (38%), colon (13%), and acute myeloid leukemia (13%). Participants reported experiencing multiple emotional and social impacts such as stress, sadness, and fear; identity changes; utilizing different coping strategies; challenges discussing cancer; feeling pressure to be better; feeling abandoned, misunderstood, or invisible; and experiencing role reversals with family members. Conclusions: Participants reported experiencing several emotional and social impacts of cancer on their lives, both negative and positive. Our findings are important for oncology clinical practice and survivorship research activities with young adults, especially given the presence of these impacts over the long term.","['Victorson, David', 'Garcia, Sofia F', 'Sanford, Stacy', 'Snyder, Mallory A', 'Lampert, Sara', 'Salsman, John M']","['Victorson D', 'Garcia SF', 'Sanford S', 'Snyder MA', 'Lampert S', 'Salsman JM']",,"['Department of Medical Social Sciences, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois.', 'Robert H.

The human placenta is a unique organ that grows and matures during pregnancy until 40 weeks of gestation. However, the role of senescence in placental villi, particularly in the two types of trophoblast, has not yet been elucidated in detail. Therefore, we herein investigated the expression of cell senescence-related markers in trophoblast. METHODS: Seventy normal placental tissues were used. The expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal), cell senescence-related markers (p16, p21, and promyelocytic leukemia; PML), and a growth marker (MCM2) was immunohistochemically examined. The expression of these markers in BeWo cells before and after cell fusion using forskolin was also investigated. RESULTS: The expression of MCM2 is detected in cytotrophoblast (CT). The expression of SA-beta-gal in CT is strong in the first and second trimesters, but weaker in the third trimester. Syncytiotrophoblast (ST) are negative in the first and second trimesters, but become positive in the third trimester. The immunohistochemical expression of p16, p21, and PML is stronger in CT than in ST throughout pregnancy. Furthermore, the expression of these markers in ST significantly increases as pregnancy advances. The expression of SA-beta-gal, PML, and p21 in BeWo cells is stronger after than before cell fusion. CONCLUSIONS: The proliferation and senescence of CT occurred in early to mid-pregnancy in association with syncytial fusion, while senescence was observed in ST in late pregnancy. This coordinated trophoblastic senescence may be essential for maintaining placental function.","['Higuchi, Shotaro', 'Miyamoto, Tsutomu', 'Kobara, Hisanori', 'Yamada, Satoshi', 'Asaka, Ryoichi', 'Kikuchi, Norihiko', 'Kashima, Hiroyasu', 'Ohira, Satoshi', 'Shiozawa, Tanri']","['Higuchi S', 'Miyamoto T', 'Kobara H', 'Yamada S', 'Asaka R', 'Kikuchi N', 'Kashima H', 'Ohira S', 'Shiozawa T']",,"['Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shinshu University School of Medicine, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, 390-8621, Japan.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shinshu University School of Medicine, 3-1-1 Asahi, Matsumoto, 390-8621, Japan.

T-prolymphocytic leukemia is a T cell type monomorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder which accounts for only 2% of all mature lymphocytic leukemias in adults over the age of 30. CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old man of Chinese ethnicity presented to our hematology unit with headache, lethargy, and exertional dyspnea for the past 1 month. He underwent an uneventful cadaveric renal transplant 20 years ago for chronic glomerulonephritis-induced end-stage renal disease. He had been on long-term immunosuppressants since then consisting of orally administered prednisolone 10 mg daily and orally administered cyclosporine A 50 mg twice daily. On examination, he was pale with a palpable liver and spleen. He had a functioning renal graft. Marrow flow cytometry confirmed T-prolymphocytic leukemia with lymphocytes expressing CD2, CD3, CD7, CD52, and TCL-1. His human T-cell lymphotropic virus and Epstein-Barr virus serology and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were negative. He was treated with one cycle of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone chemotherapy to which he failed to respond. In view of his renal allograft, he was not suitable for alemtuzumab due to the risk of nephrotoxicity. He was given orally administered venetoclax but he died on day 17 due to severe auto tumor lysis syndrome. CONCLUSION: The place of immunophenotyping in the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder is of significant importance. More research needs to be carried out to further comprehend the pathophysiology and treatment modalities for this disorder.","['Kasinathan, Ganesh', 'Kori, Ahlam Naila', 'Azmie, Norasyikin Mohamad']","['Kasinathan G', 'Kori AN', 'Azmie NM']",,"['Haematology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital, 25100, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia. ganeshkasinathan11@hotmail.com.', 'Haematology Unit, Department of Internal Medicine, Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital, 25100, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia.', 'Haematopathology Unit, Department of Pathology, Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital, Kuantan, Pahang, Malaysia.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,J Med Case Rep,Journal of medical case reports,101293382,,IM,,"['Diagnostic Errors', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping/methods', 'Kidney Transplantation/*adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/diagnosis', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",PMC6643311,['NOTNLM'],"['Prolymphocytic leukemia', 'Renal transplant', 'Tumor lysis', 'Venetoclax']",2019/07/23 06:00,2020/01/21 06:00,['2019/07/23 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/23 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/21 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13256-019-2164-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13256-019-2164-y [pii]']",epublish,J Med Case Rep. 2019 Jul 22;13(1):223. doi: 10.1186/s13256-019-2164-y.,,20190722,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We assessed performance among survivors and their healthy peers on a dual task paradigm measuring visual working memory (VWM) and visual attention independently and the dynamic relationship between the two. Assessing specific subsets within cognitive domains allows for understanding the distinct nature of cognitive impairments. Method: Participants were 34 survivors of ALL who have been off-treatment and disease free for 7.5 years; and 20 healthy controls, all between the ages of 10 and 18 years. We utilized behavioral single- and dual-task paradigms. In the dual tasks, participants maintained several items in VWM while performing a visual attention task (Eriksen Flanker Task) that required processing of a target stimulus while inhibiting the processing of distractor stimuli. The single tasks involved performing only the VWM task or only the visual attention task. Results: Results revealed survivors of ALL performed significantly worse than their healthy peers on the single visual attention task but not the single VWM task. Of particular interest, group differences were obtained on the dual VWM and visual attention tasks, such that the VWM and attention tasks reciprocally interfered with each other only among survivors and not their healthy peers. Conclusions: Our results highlight a core deficit in visual attention that is exacerbated by VWM demands among survivors of ALL. The implementation of tasks from cognitive neuroscience paradigms may be sensitive to cognitive impairments experienced by cancer survivors. Assessment and intervention practices among survivors of pediatric ALL are discussed.","['Trevino, Melissa', 'Breitmeyer, Bruno G', 'Ris, M Douglas', 'Fletcher, Jack M', 'Kamdar, Kala', 'Okcu, M Fatih', 'Parke, Elyse M', 'Raghubar, Kimberly P']","['Trevino M', 'Breitmeyer BG', 'Ris MD', 'Fletcher JM', 'Kamdar K', 'Okcu MF', 'Parke EM', 'Raghubar KP']",,"['Department of Psychology, University of Houston , Houston , TX , USA.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Houston , Houston , TX , USA.', 'Center for Neuro-engineering & Cognitive Science, University of Houston , Houston , TX , USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Psychology, Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX , USA.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Houston , Houston , TX , USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX , USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Hematology-Oncology, Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX , USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Psychology, Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX , USA.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Section of Psychology, Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX , USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Exp Neuropsychol,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,8502170,,IM,,"['Adolescent', '*Attention', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', 'Cognitive Dysfunction', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', '*Memory, Short-Term', 'Neuropsychological Tests', 'Photic Stimulation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology', 'Psychomotor Performance']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Survivors', '*cognitive outcome', '*leukemia', '*visual attention', '*visual working memory']",2019/07/23 06:00,2020/07/17 06:00,['2019/07/23 06:00'],"['2019/07/23 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/17 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/23 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/13803395.2019.1643453 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Exp Neuropsychol. 2019 Nov;41(9):974-986. doi: 10.1080/13803395.2019.1643453.

B cell receptor inhibitors that target either bruton tyrosine kinase (ibrutinib) or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (idelalisib and duvelisib) and BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax have become the mainstay of treatment. RECENT FINDINGS: Newer generations of monoclonal antibodies targeting CD20 (obinutuzumab and ofatumumab) are commonly used with novel drugs or chemotherapy agents and result in improved efficacy. At the same time, chemoimmunotherapy remains a reasonable option for selected patients. Therefore, with variety of reasonable options, choice of treatment in first-line or relapsed setting has become more challenging. Better understanding of the molecular and cytogenetics data for each patient is critical to improve management of patients with CLL. Herein, we review our approach to diagnosis and treatment of CLL in the era of novel therapeutic agents.","['Yeung, Cecilia C S', 'Shadman, Mazyar']","['Yeung CCS', 'Shadman M']",,"['Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, G71910, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA. cyeung@fredhutch.org.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. cyeung@fredhutch.org.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA, USA. cyeung@fredhutch.org.', 'Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, 1100 Fairview Ave N, G71910, Seattle, WA, 98109, USA.', 'Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Curr Oncol Rep,Current oncology reports,100888967,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,,"['Abnormal Karyotype', 'Algorithms', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*B cell lymphoma, PLL, CLL', '*FCR, BTK, BCL2, PI3Kdelta', '*FISH', '*Karyotype', '*Microarray', '*Prognosis', '*Targeted mutation testing by NGS']",2019/07/22 06:00,2020/09/01 06:00,['2019/07/22 06:00'],"['2019/07/22 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/01 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1007/s11912-019-0819-x [doi]', '10.1007/s11912-019-0819-x [pii]']",epublish,Curr Oncol Rep. 2019 Jul 20;21(8):74. doi: 10.1007/s11912-019-0819-x.,,20190720,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, patients with T-PLL have a poor prognosis, and the option of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) remains controversial in these patients. This study aimed to analyze the outcomes of allogeneic HCT among patients with T-PLL to identify the potential clinical efficacy of allogeneic HCT. We retrospectively analyzed data from 20 patients with T-PLL, including five patients with complex chromosomal abnormalities at diagnosis who received an allogeneic HCT between 2000 and 2016. The median follow-up of survivors was 51 months in allogeneic HCT from human leukemia antigen (HLA)-matched donors. All five patients with complex chromosomal abnormalities died after allogeneic HCT. Our data suggest that allogeneic HCT from an HLA-matched donor can be considered for patients with T-PLL without complex chromosomal abnormalities. New treatment strategies of allogeneic HCT are required to improve the safety and efficacy of allografting in patients with T-PLL and complex chromosomal abnormalities. Potential approaches that identify patients with T-PLL and complex chromosomal abnormalities for allogeneic HCT with better disease control may allow identification of individuals who are suitable for allogeneic HCT.","['Yamasaki, Satoshi', 'Nitta, Hideaki', 'Kondo, Eisei', 'Uchida, Naoyuki', 'Miyazaki, Takuya', 'Ishiyama, Ken', 'Kiyota, Miki', 'Matsuoka, Hiroshi', 'Ichinohe, Tatsuo', 'Fukuda, Takahiro', 'Atsuta, Yoshiko', 'Suzumiya, Junji', 'Suzuki, Ritsuro']","['Yamasaki S', 'Nitta H', 'Kondo E', 'Uchida N', 'Miyazaki T', 'Ishiyama K', 'Kiyota M', 'Matsuoka H', 'Ichinohe T', 'Fukuda T', 'Atsuta Y', 'Suzumiya J', 'Suzuki R']",,"['Department of Hematology and Clinical Research Institute, National Hospital Organization Kyushu Medical Center, -8-1 Jigyohama, Chuo-ku, Fukuoka, 810-8563, Japan. yamas009@gmail.com.', 'Department of Hematology, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kawasaki Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Federation of National Public Service Personnel Mutual Aid Associations, Toranomon Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Clinical Immunology, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Yokohama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Kanazawa University Hospital, Kanazawa, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Matsushita Memorial Hospital, Moriguchi, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology and Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Research Institute for Radiation Biology and Medicine, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan.', 'Division of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation, National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Administration, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine and Japanese Data Center for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Nagoya, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.', 'Department of Oncology and Hematology, Shimane University Hospital, Izumo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,['3A189DH42V (Alemtuzumab)'],IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Alemtuzumab/*administration & dosage', 'Allografts', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', '*Leukemia, Prolymphocytic, T-Cell/genetics/mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Societies, Medical', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', 'Complex chromosomal abnormalities', 'HLA-matched donor', 'T-prolymphocytic leukemia']",2019/07/22 06:00,2019/08/28 06:00,['2019/07/22 06:00'],"['2019/06/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/22 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00277-019-03759-y [doi]', '10.1007/s00277-019-03759-y [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Hematol. 2019 Sep;98(9):2213-2220. doi: 10.1007/s00277-019-03759-y.

Here we describe the generation and characterization of a fully-human monoclonal antibody specific to CD123, a surface marker which is overexpressed in a variety of hematological disorders, including acute myeloid leukemia. The cloning and expression of the extracellular portion of CD123 as recombinant Fc fusion allowed the selection and affinity maturation of a human antibody, called H9, which specifically recognized the cognate antigen in biochemical assays and on leukemic cells. The H9 antibody and a previously-described anti-CD123 antibody (CSL362) were reformatted into full immunoglobulin human IgG1 formats, including a variant bearing S293D and I332E mutations to enhance antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The two antibodies recognized different epitopes on the surface of the N-terminal domain of CD123, as revealed by crystallography and SPOT analysis. Both H9 and CSL362 in full immunoglobulin format were able to selectively kill leukemic cells in in vitro ADCC assays, performed both with cell lines and with patient-derived AML blasts. Further, the two antibodies, when reformatted as bispecific BiTE reagents by fusion with the anti-CD3 scFv(OKT3) antibody fragment, induced selective killing of AML blasts by patient-derived, autologous T-cells in an in vitro setting, but BiTE(CSL362/OKT3) exhibited a 10-fold higher potency compared to BiTE(H9/OKT3). The availability of two classes of CD123-specific biopharmaceuticals, capable of redirecting the cytolytic activity of NK cells and T cells against AML blasts, may enable novel interventional strategies and combination opportunities for the treatment of AML.","['Hutmacher, Cornelia', 'Volta, Laura', 'Rinaldi, Francesco', 'Murer, Patrizia', 'Myburgh, Renier', 'Manz, Markus G', 'Neri, Dario']","['Hutmacher C', 'Volta L', 'Rinaldi F', 'Murer P', 'Myburgh R', 'Manz MG', 'Neri D']",,"['Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Vladimir-Prelog Weg 1-5/10, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Vladimir-Prelog Weg 1-5/10, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Vladimir-Prelog Weg 1-5/10, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Vladimir-Prelog Weg 1-5/10, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Ramistrasse 100, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital Zurich and University of Zurich, Ramistrasse 100, CH-8091 Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Chemistry and Applied Biosciences, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), Vladimir-Prelog Weg 1-5/10, CH-8093 Zurich, Switzerland.

However, there are limited data on intracranial hemorrhage in childhood acute leukemia. We aimed to determine the incidence, characteristics, and factors associated with intracranial hemorrhage in children with acute leukemia. METHODS: We reviewed a database of patients aged one month to 15 years diagnosed with acute leukemia during 2003 to 2016 at a hospital in Thailand. Characteristics of patients with intracranial hemorrhage were compared with those of patients without intracranial hemorrhage. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the associated factors. We performed survival analyses to compare survival and hazard ratios between groups. RESULTS: There were 494 children with acute leukemia (acute lymphoblastic leukemia 367, acute myelogenous leukemia 127). Median age was 4.9 years (interquartile range 3.0 to 9.2). Follow-up duration was 2.1 years. Intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 12 patients whose median age was 12.5 years (interquartile range 7.5 to 13.3). Incidence rate of intracranial hemorrhage was 6.2 (acute lymphoblastic leukemia 5.1, acute myelogenous leukemia 12.9) per 1000 person-years. Case fatality rate of intracranial hemorrhage was 75%. Patients with early intracranial hemorrhage had prolonged international normalized ratio and higher white blood cell count, whereas patients with late intracranial hemorrhage had more concurrent systemic infections. Most cases of intracranial hemorrhage were intraparenchymal with perihematomal edema. Median survival was 24 days in the intracranial hemorrhage group compared with four years in the non-intracranial hemorrhage group. Risk of death from intracranial hemorrhage was 3.2 times higher than that of the non-intracranial hemorrhage group. Age at diagnosis, initial white blood cell count, and lactate dehydrogenase were associated with increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial hemorrhage was common and often fatal in children with acute leukemia. Potential contributing factors differed by intracranial hemorrhage timing. Older age, white blood cell count, and lactate dehydrogenase were associated with high risk of intracranial hemorrhage.","['Intusoma, Utcharee', 'Nakorn, Chompunut Na', 'Chotsampancharoen, Thirachit']","['Intusoma U', 'Nakorn CN', 'Chotsampancharoen T']",,"['Division of Neurology, Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand.

The latter also includes germ cell tumor-derived PNET (gPNET). There are currently no specific markers for gPNET. This study seeks to investigate the expression of ZBTB16 in PNET and other small round blue cell tumors as well as its potential diagnostic utility. Immunohistochemical expression of the ZBTB16 was studied in a total of 27 PNETs (12 pPNETs, 8 cPNETs, 3 primary testicular gPNETs, and 4 metastatic gPNETs) and 38 small round blue cell tumors. Positive expression for ZBTB16 was seen diffusely in 9/12 (75%), moderately in 2/12 (17%) and focally in 1/12 (8%) of pPNETs, diffusely in 3/7 (43%) and moderately in 4/7 (57%) of gPNETs, and diffusely in 2/8 (25%), moderately in 2/8 (25%) and focally in 4/8 (50%) of cPNETs. Whereas, all of the 38 non-PNET small round blue cell tumors were nonreactive. The results suggest that ZBTB16 is a highly sensitive and specific biomarker for both pPNET and gPNET/cPNET. ZBTB16 effectively differentiates PNETs from other small round blue cell tumor mimics, including the two most common germ cell tumor-derived somatic malignancies - rhabdomyosarcoma and nephroblastoma. Of note, compared to the expression of ZBTB16 in pPNET/Ewing sarcoma and gPNET, the expression of ZBTB16 in cPNET was more variable, which appears consistent with the heterogeneity of cPNET. The close proximity of ZBTB16 and FLI-1 genes on chromosome 11q may explain the overexpression of ZBTB16 in PNET, especially in pPNET with t(1122) translocation.","['Xiao, Guang-Qian', 'Sherrod, Andy E', 'Hurth, Kyle M']","['Xiao GQ', 'Sherrod AE', 'Hurth KM']",,"['Department of Pathology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, 90033, United States.

It is hypothesized that HLA-B27 patients may have worse outcome in part related to their other comorbidities. OBJECTIVES: We sought to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes of CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) patients referred for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) based on their HLA-B27 status. METHODS: This retrospective population-based case series analyzed CLL/SLL patients who were HLA-typed for potential allo-HSCT in British Columbia, Canada. RESULTS: of 279 CLL/SLL patients referred for potential allo-HSCT, 34 patients were HLA-B27 positive. For HLA-B27 patients, median age at CLL diagnosis was 53.5 years (range, 27-67) and 71% were male. Seven patients had 11q deletion and nine patients had 17p deletion detected prior to first CLL therapy or at relapse. Eleven HLA-B27 patients received allo-HSCT. Two patients developed acute myeloid leukemia. One patient with ankylosing spondylitis had Richter's transformation prior to any CLL therapy. Spondyloarthritis-related disorders were diagnosed in 12 HLA-B27 patients but there was no temporal correlation with development of CLL. Overall survival (OS) and treatment-free survival (TFS) were not significantly different between HLA-B27 patients with or without spondyloarthritis-related disorders. There were no significant differences in clinical characteristics at CLL diagnosis or OS/TFS between HLA-B27 positive and negative patients referred for allo-HSCT. CONCLUSIONS: HLA-B27 positivity does not appear to influence outcome for CLL/SLL patients referred for allo-HSCT. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical significance of HLA-B27 in a general CLL population.","['Huang, Steven J', 'Chan, Jonathan', 'Bruyere, Helene', 'Allan, Lenka L', 'Gerrie, Alina S', 'Toze, Cynthia L']","['Huang SJ', 'Chan J', 'Bruyere H', 'Allan LL', 'Gerrie AS', 'Toze CL']",,"['Division of Hematology and Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada.', 'Division of Rheumatology, Department of Medicine, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Cytogenetics Laboratory, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada.', 'Division of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Immunology Laboratory, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada; British Columbia Cancer Agency, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Division of Hematology and Leukemia/BMT Program of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, Canada; British Columbia Cancer Agency, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.

There is a high unmet need to identify safer and more potent therapies for MLL-rearranged (MLL-r) leukemia that can be combined with established chemotherapeutics to decrease treatment-related toxicities. The curaxin, CBL0137, has demonstrated nongenotoxic anticancer and chemopotentiating effects in a number of preclinical cancer models and is currently in adult Phase I clinical trials for solid tumors and hematological malignancies. The aim of our study was to investigate whether CBL0137 has potential as a therapeutic and chemopotentiating compound in MLL-r leukemia through a comprehensive analysis of its efficacy in preclinical models of the disease. CBL0137 decreased the viability of a panel of MLL-r leukemia cell lines (n = 12) and xenograft cells derived from patients with MLL-r acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL, n = 3) in vitro with submicromolar IC50s. The small molecule drug was well-tolerated in vivo and significantly reduced leukemia burden in a subcutaneous MV4;11 MLL-r acute myeloid leukemia model and in patient-derived xenograft models of MLL-r ALL (n = 5). The in vivo efficacy of standard of care drugs used in remission induction for pediatric ALL was also potentiated by CBL0137. CBL0137 exerted its anticancer effect by trapping Facilitator of Chromatin Transcription (FACT) into chromatin, activating the p53 pathway and inducing an Interferon response. Our findings support further preclinical evaluation of CBL0137 as a new approach for the treatment of MLL-r leukemia.","['Somers, Klaartje', 'Kosciolek, Angelika', 'Bongers, Angelika', 'El-Ayoubi, Ali', 'Karsa, Mawar', 'Mayoh, Chelsea', 'Wadham, Carol', 'Middlemiss, Shiloh', 'Neznanov, Nickolay', 'Kees, Ursula R', 'Lock, Richard B', 'Gudkov, Andrei', 'Sutton, Rosemary', 'Gurova, Katerina', 'Haber, Michelle', 'Norris, Murray D', 'Henderson, Michelle J']","['Somers K', 'Kosciolek A', 'Bongers A', 'El-Ayoubi A', 'Karsa M', 'Mayoh C', 'Wadham C', 'Middlemiss S', 'Neznanov N', 'Kees UR', 'Lock RB', 'Gudkov A', 'Sutton R', 'Gurova K', 'Haber M', 'Norris MD', 'Henderson MJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7644-4121', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2741-3852']","[""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Department of Cell Stress Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', 'Telethon Kids Institute, University of Western Australia, Perth, WA, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', 'Department of Cell Stress Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'Department of Cell Stress Biology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia."", 'UNSW Centre for Childhood Cancer Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia.', ""Children's Cancer Institute, Lowy Cancer Research Centre, UNSW, Sydney, NSW, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CBLC137)', '0 (Carbazoles)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (High Mobility Group Proteins)', '0 (KMT2A protein, human)', '0 (SSRP1 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Transcriptional Elongation Factors)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', '149025-06-9 (Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/genetics', 'Carbazoles/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Gene Expression Profiling', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'High Mobility Group Proteins/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/diagnosis/drug therapy/genetics/mortality', 'Mice', 'Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Elongation Factors/genetics', 'Transcriptome', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics/metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*CBL0137', '*interferon', '*mixed-lineage leukemia', '*p53', '*patient-derived xenograft']",2019/07/22 06:00,2020/02/20 06:00,['2019/07/21 06:00'],"['2019/02/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/18 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32582 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2020 Apr 1;146(7):1902-1916. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32582.

Indeed, abundant evidences demonstrated that lncRNA act as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to participate in tumorigenesis. However, little is known about the underlying function of lncRNA in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway 1 (LINP1) in pediatric and adolescent acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The expression of LINP1 was examined in AML patient samples by qRT-PCR. Cell proliferation was examined by CCK-8 and Edu assays. beta-Galactosidase senescence assay, mGlucose uptake assay, lactate production assay, and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis were performed for functional analysis. We found that LINP1 was significantly overexpressed in AML patients at diagnosis, whereas downregulated after complete remission (CR). Furthermore, knockdown of LINP1 expression remarkably suppressed glucose uptake and AML cell maintenance. Mechanistically, LINP1 was found to inhibit the glucose metabolism by suppressing the expression of HNF4a. Both LINP1 and HNF4a knockdown reduced the expression levels of AMPK phosphorylation and WNT5A, indicating for the first time that LINP1 strengthened the HNF4a-AMPK/WNT5A signaling pathway involved in cell glucose metabolism modulation and AML cell survival. Taken together, our results indicated that LINP1 promotes the malignant phenotype of AML cells and stimulates glucose metabolism, which can be regarded as a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for AML.","['Shi, Jie', 'Dai, Rongqin', 'Chen, Yuqing', 'Guo, Honggang', 'Han, Yinyin', 'Zhang, Yin']","['Shi J', 'Dai R', 'Chen Y', 'Guo H', 'Han Y', 'Zhang Y']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7841-7541'],"[""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of intensive care unit, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China."", ""Department of Hematology, Henan Provincial People's Hospital, People's Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,"['0 (HNF4A protein, human)', '0 (Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4)', '0 (LINP1 non-coding RNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (WNT5A protein, human)', '0 (Wnt-5a Protein)', 'EC 2.7.4.3 (Adenylate Kinase)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']",IM,,"['Adenylate Kinase/*physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'Gene Ontology', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 4/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Purpura, Thrombocytopenic, Idiopathic/metabolism', 'RNA Interference', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics/*physiology', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Random Allocation', 'Remission Induction', 'Signal Transduction/genetics/*physiology', 'THP-1 Cells', 'Wnt-5a Protein/*physiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia (AML)', 'biomarker', 'lncRNA in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway 1 (LINP1)', 'metabolism', 'survival']",2019/07/22 06:00,2019/11/20 06:00,['2019/07/21 06:00'],"['2019/03/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/11/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/21 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2651 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 2019 Oct;37(4):474-482. doi: 10.1002/hon.2651.

The method involves extraction of EDB, IDB and VDB along with internal standard (IS; phenacetin) from mouse plasma (100 mul) using a simple protein precipitation process. The chromatographic analysis was performed on an HPLC system using a gradient mobile phase (comprising 10 mm ammonium acetate and acetonitrile in a flow-gradient) and an X-Terra Phenyl column. The UV detection wave length was set at lambdamax 265 nm. EDB, IDB, VDB and the IS eluted at 7.36, 8.60, 9.50 and 5.12 min, respectively, with a total run time of 10 min. The calibration curve was linear over a concentration range of 0.20-12.5 mug/ml for EDB and 0.50-12.5 mug/ml for IDB and VDB (r(2) = >/=0.998 for all of the analytes). Validation results met the acceptance criteria.

DESIGN: A single-site, cross-sectional survey of primary caregiver of a child with ALL was performed. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We analysed the total costs incurred on the completion of the first three-phase treatment (induction, consolidation and intensification), which requires intensive hospitalisation. Eligible patients were (1) diagnosed with ALL between 2010 and 2012 at Shanghai Children's Medical Center (SCMC), (2) aged 0-14 years at diagnosis and (3) completed the first three-phase treatment at SCMC. The data were collected between October 2014 and December 2014. OUTCOME MEASURES: We decomposed the total costs into three categories: (1) direct medical costs, which were further divided into outpatient and inpatient costs; (2) direct non-medical costs, which referred to expenses incurred in relation to the illness; and (3) indirect costs due to productivity loss. RESULTS: A total of 161 patients were included in the study. Direct medical costs accounted for about 51.7% of the overall costs, and the rest of 48.3% of the total costs were attributed to direct non-medical costs and indirect costs. Regarding families with different household registration type (rural vs urban), the total costs were significantly different between the two groups (US$36 125 vs US$25 593; p=0.021). Specifically, urban families incurred significantly larger indirect costs than rural families (US$12 343 vs US$4157; p=0.018). Although the direct non-medical costs were not significantly different, urban families spent more money on hygiene cleaning products and auxiliary treatment equipment (p=0.041) and gifts and treats (p=0.034) than rural families. CONCLUSIONS: The financial burden faced by the Chinese families with a child with ALL was tremendous, and the distributions of costs among the three categories were different between urban and rural families.","['Ren, Yijiong', 'Li, Xin']","['Ren Y', 'Li X']",,"[""Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China."", 'School of Social and Public Administration, East China University of Science and Technology, Shanghai, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ Open,BMJ open,101552874,,IM,,"['Academic Medical Centers', 'Adolescent', 'Ambulatory Care/economics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'China/epidemiology', 'Cost of Illness', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Family Leave/statistics & numerical data', 'Female', 'Hospitalization/economics', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*economics/epidemiology', 'Rural Population', 'Urban Population']",PMC6661580,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukaemia', '*child', '*china', '*direct and indirect costs', '*family']",2019/07/22 06:00,2020/08/06 06:00,['2019/07/21 06:00'],"['2019/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/06 06:00 [medline]']","['bmjopen-2019-030511 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030511 [doi]']",epublish,BMJ Open. 2019 Jul 18;9(7):e030511. doi: 10.1136/bmjopen-2019-030511.,"['(c) Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

In allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), late relapses can arise after prolonged alloreactive T-cell control, but the molecular mechanisms of immune escape remain unclear. To identify mechanisms of immune evasion, we performed a genetic analysis of serial samples from 25 patients with myeloid malignancies who relapsed >/=1 year after alloHCT. Using targeted sequencing and microarray analysis to determine HLA allele-specific copy number, we identified copy-neutral loss of heterozygosity events and focal deletions spanning class 1 HLA genes in 2 of 12 recipients of matched unrelated-donor HCT and in 1 of 4 recipients of mismatched unrelated-donor HCT. Relapsed clones, although highly related to their antecedent pretransplantation malignancies, frequently acquired additional mutations in transcription factors and mitogenic signaling genes. Previously, the study of relapse after haploidentical HCT established the paradigm of immune evasion via loss of mismatched HLA. Here, in the context of matched unrelated-donor HCT, HLA loss provides genetic evidence that allogeneic immune recognition may be mediated by minor histocompatibility antigens and suggests opportunities for novel immunologic approaches for relapse prevention.","['Jan, Max', 'Leventhal, Matthew J', 'Morgan, Elizabeth A', 'Wengrod, Jordan C', 'Nag, Anwesha', 'Drinan, Samantha D', 'Wollison, Bruce M', 'Ducar, Matthew D', 'Thorner, Aaron R', 'Leppanen, Scott', 'Baronas, Jane', 'Stevens, Jonathan', 'Lane, William J', 'Kekre, Natasha', 'Ho, Vincent T', 'Koreth, John', 'Cutler, Corey S', 'Nikiforow, Sarah', 'Alyea, Edwin P 3rd', 'Antin, Joseph H', 'Soiffer, Robert J', 'Ritz, Jerome', 'Lindsley, R Coleman', 'Ebert, Benjamin L']","['Jan M', 'Leventhal MJ', 'Morgan EA', 'Wengrod JC', 'Nag A', 'Drinan SD', 'Wollison BM', 'Ducar MD', 'Thorner AR', 'Leppanen S', 'Baronas J', 'Stevens J', 'Lane WJ', 'Kekre N', 'Ho VT', 'Koreth J', 'Cutler CS', 'Nikiforow S', 'Alyea EP 3rd', 'Antin JH', 'Soiffer RJ', 'Ritz J', 'Lindsley RC', 'Ebert BL']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5880-9337', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1097-5229', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0197-5451']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Department of Pathology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA.', 'Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Medicine, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Center for Cancer Genome Discovery, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA.', ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA."", 'Ottawa Blood Disease Centre, The Ottawa Hospital, Ottawa, ON, Canada; and.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,,"['Alleles', 'Biomarkers', '*Gene Deletion', 'HLA Antigens/*genetics', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/*pathology/therapy', 'Mutation', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Recurrence', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",PMC6650729,,,2019/07/22 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2019/07/21 06:00'],"['2019/05/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019000445 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000445 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Jul 23;3(14):2199-2204. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000445.,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,"['P50 CA206963/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL082945/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HHMI/Howard Hughes Medical Institute/United States', 'P01 CA066996/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32 CA009216/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of 511 patients who had their first immunoglobulin level determined within 3 months of diagnosis, abnormal (either increased or decreased) immunoglobulin M (IgM), IgG, and IgA values were observed in 58% of patients with CLL, 27% of patients with MBL, and 20% of patients with SLL. Immunoglobulin deviances were similar for MBL and CLL Rai stage 0 and for SLL and Rai stages I and II; for CLL, IgG and IgA abnormalities occurred with increasing frequency with advancing Rai stage. In contrast, the frequency of IgM abnormalities was similar in all patient groups. IgA abnormalities significantly correlated with high beta2-microglobulin (B2M) expression, whereas abnormal IgG and IgA levels were associated with the use of IGHV1-69, 3-21, and 3-49 subtypes. Increases in IgG or IgM were commonly associated with the presence of a CLL-type M-band, whereas oligoclonal bands were frequently observed with increased IgA levels. Although abnormal levels of IgG and IgA at diagnosis were independent predictors for future immunoglobulin replacement, only abnormal IgA levels were associated with shorter time to first treatment and overall survival. These findings indicate that both reduced and elevated levels of IgG and IgA at diagnosis are important and independent prognostic markers for infection in CLL, with IgA being more relevant as a marker of disease progression and survival.","['Ishdorj, Ganchimeg', 'Streu, Erin', 'Lambert, Pascal', 'Dhaliwal, Harbhajan S', 'Mahmud, Salaheddin M', 'Gibson, Spencer B', 'Banerji, Versha', 'Marshall, Aaron J', 'Johnston, James B']","['Ishdorj G', 'Streu E', 'Lambert P', 'Dhaliwal HS', 'Mahmud SM', 'Gibson SB', 'Banerji V', 'Marshall AJ', 'Johnston JB']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-1175-5498', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6614-083X']","['Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology.', 'Department of Nursing, and.', 'Department of Epidemiology, CancerCare Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada; and.', 'Section of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Community Health Sciences.', 'Vaccine and Drug Evaluation Centre.', 'College of Pharmacy.', 'Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Medical Genetics, and.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', 'Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology.', 'Section of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine.', 'Department of Immunology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB, Canada.', 'Research Institute in Oncology and Hematology.', 'Section of Haematology/Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Immunoglobulin A)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin A/*blood', 'Infections/*blood/*diagnosis/etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*blood/complications/diagnosis/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Time-to-Treatment']",PMC6650736,,,2019/07/22 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2019/07/21 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/21 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/22 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018026591 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018026591 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Jul 23;3(14):2188-2198. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018026591.,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We aimed to explore the activity of induction therapy for 9 months with obinutuzumab and ibrutinib, followed up with a minimal residual disease-driven therapeutic strategy for 6 additional months, in previously untreated patients. METHODS: We did a single-arm, phase 2 trial in 27 university hospitals, general hospitals, and specialist cancer centres in France. Eligible patients were at least 18 years old and previously untreated, and had immunophenotypically confirmed B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score of less than 2; a Binet stage C according to IWCLL 2008 criteria or Binet stage A and B with active disease; no 17p deletion or absence of p53 mutation; and were considered medically fit. In the first part of the study (induction phase), all participants received eight intravenous infusions of obinutuzumab 1000 mg over six 4-weekly cycles and oral ibrutinib 420 mg once per day for 9 months. In part 2, after assessment on day 1 of month 9, patients with a complete response and bone marrow minimal residual disease of less than 0.01% received only oral ibrutinib 420 mg once per day for 6 additional months. Patients with a partial response, or with a complete response and bone marrow minimal residual disease of 0.01% or more, received 6 months of four 4-weekly cycles of intravenous fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and obinutuzumab 1000 mg, alongside continuing ibrutinib 420 mg once per day. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a complete response with bone marrow minimal residual disease less than 0.01% on day 1 of month 16 assessed by intention to treat (ITT). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (number NCT02666898) and is still open for follow-up. FINDINGS: Between Oct 27, 2015, and May 16, 2017, 135 patients were enrolled. After induction treatment (day 1 of month 9), 130 patients were evaluable, of which ten (8%) achieved a complete response with bone marrow minimal residual disease of less than 0.01% and were assigned to ibrutinib, and 120 (92%) were assigned to ibrutinib plus fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and obinutuzumab. After minimal residual disease-guided treatment (day 1 of month 16), 84 (62%, 90% CI 55-69) of 135 patients (ITT population) achieved a complete response with bone marrow minimal residual disease of less than 0.01%. The most common haematological adverse event was thrombocytopenia (in 45 [34%] of 133 patients at grade 1-2 in months 1-9 and in 43 [33%] of 130 patients at grade 1-2 in months 9-15). The most common non-haematological adverse events were infusion-related reactions (in 83 [62%] patients at grade 1-2 in months 1-9) and gastrointestinal disorders (in 62 [48%] patients at grades 1 and 2 in months 9-15). 49 serious adverse events occurred, most frequently infections (ten), cardiac events (eight), and haematological events (eight). No treatment-related deaths occurred. INTERPRETATION: Obinutuzumab and ibrutinib induction therapy followed by a minimal residual disease driven strategy is safe and active in patients with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. With longer follow-up, including assessing the evolution of minimal residual disease, if response is maintained, this strategy could be an option in the first-line setting in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, although randomised evidence is needed.

In this study, we systematically investigated the effect of substitution patterns of the core anthraquinone scaffold. Through cytotoxicity evaluation in two leukemia cell lines, the structure-activity relationship of thirty-two analogs has been examined. Several analogs with comparable or improved potency over BW-AQ-101 have been identified. Western-blot assays verified the effect of the potent compounds on the MDM2-p53 axis.

METHODS: Twelve articles were included in a systematic literature review. Articles were categorized into low/medium/high risk of bias. RESULTS: As no randomized controlled trial assessing the effect of Leucovorin has been performed, the efficacy of Leucovorin to reduce oral mucositis remains unknown. Leucovorin was initiated at 24, 36 or 42h after HD-MTX at a dose of 15 or 30mg/m(2). No meta-analysis could be performed as treatment regimens differed. When comparing studies with similar HD-MTX doses, we observed lower oral mucositis rates in regimens with higher cumulative doses of Leucovorin and early initiation of Leucovorin after MTX. CONCLUSION: Even though future studies are necessary, higher cumulative Leucovorin doses and early initiation of Leucovorin after start of MTX seem to reduce oral mucositis.","['Van der Beek, J N', 'Oosterom, N', 'Pieters, R', 'de Jonge, R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink, M M', 'Heil, S G']","['Van der Beek JN', 'Oosterom N', 'Pieters R', 'de Jonge R', 'van den Heuvel-Eibrink MM', 'Heil SG']",,"['Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands; Department of Clinical Chemistry, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Department of Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Chemistry, Erasmus MC University Medical Center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

CD123 aptamers may potentially serve as tumor-homing ligands with excellent affinity and specificity for AML targeted therapy, but their complexity, laborious preparation and nuclease digestion limited pharmacological application. The aim of this study was to develop the first CD123 thioaptamer to overcome these obstacles. MAIN METHODS: Flow cytometry was utilized to assess the binding specificity, affinity and anti-nuclease ability of thioaptamer. CCK8, Annexin-V/DAPI, and colony forming assays were used to evaluate the anti-cancer ability of thioaptamer in vitro. The tumor volume, weights, survival rate, H&E staining of organs, and serum level of organ damage biomarkers of animal model were applied to investigate the anti-cancer ability of thioaptamer in vivo. Furthermore, we explored the binding mechanism between thioaptamer and CD123. KEY FINDINGS: CD123 thioaptamer SS30 was able to bind to CD123 structure with high specificity in complex nuclease environment, the dissociation constant of 39.1nM for CD123 peptide and 287.6nM for CD123(+) AML cells, while exhibiting minimal cross-reactivity to albumin. Furthermore, SS30 inhibited the proliferation and survival of AML cell lines and human AML blasts selectively in vitro (P<0.01). In addition, SS30 prolonged the survival and inhibited tumor growth in a mouse xenograft tumor model in vivo. Of note, SS30 blocked the interaction between IL-3 and CD123, and decreased expression of p-STAT5 and p-AKT. SIGNIFICANCE: The proliferation inhibition and nuclease resistance ability of SS30 made it as a more promising functional molecule for AML targeted therapy.","['Wang, Meng', 'Wu, Haibin', 'Duan, Mingyue', 'Yang, Ying', 'Wang, Guoxia', 'Che, Fengyu', 'Liu, Bailing', 'He, Wei', 'Li, Qiao', 'Zhang, Liyu']","['Wang M', 'Wu H', 'Duan M', 'Yang Y', 'Wang G', 'Che F', 'Liu B', 'He W', 'Li Q', 'Zhang L']",,"['Department of Orthopaedics, No. 946 Hospital of the PLA, YiNing, XinJiang 0086-835000, PR China.', ""Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases, Xi'an Children's Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi 0086-710003, PR China."", ""Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases, Xi'an Children's Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi 0086-710003, PR China."", ""Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases, Xi'an Children's Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi 0086-710003, PR China."", ""Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases, Xi'an Children's Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi 0086-710003, PR China."", ""Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases, Xi'an Children's Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi 0086-710003, PR China."", ""Department of Ultrasonography, Xi'an Children's Hospital, PR China."", ""Shaanxi Institute of Pediatric Diseases, Xi'an Children's Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi 0086-710003, PR China."", ""Clinical Laboratory, Xi'an Children's Hospital, Xi'an, Shaanxi 0086-710003, PR China.

This retrospective, propensity score-matched study analyzed 108 newly diagnosed AML patients with features of myelodysplasia syndrome (MDS) (aged 14-60 years) from 2014 to 2018, who received either idarubicin and cytarabine (IA) or decitabine, idarubicin and cytarabine (DAC+IA), and compared efficacy and toxicity between the two regimens. After propensity score matching, there were 54 patients in each group. The rate of complete remission (CR) was higher in the DAC+IA group than in the IA group (85.2% vs 68.5%, P = .040) after the first course, and toxicities were comparable in both groups. Multivariate analysis indicated that the combination with DAC was independent factor for CR rate after the first induction therapy (OR = 2.978, 95% CI:1.090-8.137, P = .033). Subgroup analysis showed a CR advantage for DAC+IA (vs IA) for patients of intermediate-high risk status according to National Comprehensive Cancer Network prognostic stratification. In conclusion, DAC+IA is therefore offered as a new induction choice for newly diagnosed AML patients with features of MDS, aged <60 years old, especially in intermediate-high risk status.","['Liu, Fengqi', 'Wang, Hehua', 'Liu, Junru', 'Zhou, Zhenhai', 'Zheng, Dong', 'Huang, Beihui', 'Su, Chang', 'Zou, Waiyi', 'Xu, Duorong', 'Tong, Xiuzhen', 'Li, Juan']","['Liu F', 'Wang H', 'Liu J', 'Zhou Z', 'Zheng D', 'Huang B', 'Su C', 'Zou W', 'Xu D', 'Tong X', 'Li J']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7601-2812', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2140-1845']","['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Decitabine/administration & dosage', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Propensity Score', 'Retreatment', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6718585,['NOTNLM'],"['MDS features', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'chemotherapy', 'complete remission', 'decitabine', 'induction therapy']",2019/07/20 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/07/20 06:00'],"['2018/11/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2418 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Sep;8(11):5108-5115. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2418.

Therefore, in the present study, using a mouse model of HTLV-1 infection, the long-term survival and number of infected cells in the reservoir organ were investigated in order to determine the effect of gamma-irradiation on HTLV-1-infected mice in vivo. There was no improvement in the survival period following gamma-irradiation in the gamma-irradiated group after HTLV-1 infection when compared with the HTLV-1-infected group. It was also found that the incidence of splenomegaly was >/=80% in the HTLV-1-infected and gamma-irradiated group, which was significantly higher than that in the HTLV-1-infected mice. The tissue morphology in the spleen became non-uniform because of gamma-rays. Importantly, the number of infected cells in the spleen was increased 4.1-fold in the HTLV-1-infected and gamma-irradiated mice compared with that in the HTLV-1-infected mice.

In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the morphology and function of MSCs changes in accordance with the transformation of the BMM. Moreover, the transformation of MSCs into osteoblasts is determined through the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, ultimately leading to an altered expression of the downstream adhesion molecule, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). In this study, we aimed to explore the interaction of possible pathways in AMLderived mesenchymal stem cells (AMLMSCs) cocultured with the K562 and K562ADM cell lines. AMLMSCs were cocultured with K562/K562ADM cells, and the interactions between the cells were verified by morphological detection, peroxidase staining (POX), reverse transcriptionquantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTqPCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The proliferation of K562/K562ADM cells under coculture conditions was detected by flow cytometry. The expression levels of BMP4 and CTGF were examined by RTqPCR and western blot (WB) analysis. The detection of interleukin (IL)6 and IL32 was also determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the coculture system, the K562ADM cells underwent fusiform transformation. The occurrence of this transformation was associated with an increased expression of CTGF due to the dysregulation of the BMP pathway. The AMLMSCs promoted the proliferation of the K562ADM cell, but inhibited that of the K562 cells. These findings were confirmed by changes in the expression of the soluble cytokines, IL6 and IL32. On the whole, the findings of this study demonstrate that AMLMSCs regulate the expression of CTGF through the BMP pathway. In addition, they affect cytokine production, induce spindleshaped transformation, and increase drug resistance in the K562ADM cells. Thus, the morphological transformation through the BMP pathway provides us with a novel target with which to circumvent tumor occurrence, development, drug resistance, invasion and metastasis.","['Li, Haiying', 'Li, Juan', 'Cheng, Juan', 'Chen, Xuan', 'Zhou, Lanxia', 'Li, Zhao']","['Li H', 'Li J', 'Cheng J', 'Chen X', 'Zhou L', 'Li Z']",,"['Department of Central Laboratory, The First Medical College of Lanzhou University, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou, Gansu 730000, P.R.

Previous studies have reported an association of the disease with abnormal chromosomal rearrangements, DNA copy number alterations and mutations in critical signaling factors, such as those in the Notch1 pathway; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of the disease remain unclear, limiting the development of novel therapies. In the present study, gene expression was detected by qPCR and western blot analysis. Diagnostic analysis was performed by ROC curve. Cell proliferation, invasion and migration were analyzed by cell proliferation and Transwell assays. Gene interactions were analyzed using luciferase reporter assay. In the present study, it was observed that the expression levels of microRNA3383p (miR3383p) were reduced in patient lymphoma tissues and a TLBL cell line. Upregulation of its expression inhibited the migration and proliferation of cultured TLBL cells. Bioinformatics analysis of putative target mRNAs of miR3383p identified a direct binding site in the 3'untranslated of homeobox A3 (HOXA3). The levels of HOXA3 mRNA and protein were associated with those of miR3383p, and overexpression of HOXA3 promoted the malignant phenotype of TLBL cells. The results suggested that miR3383p may suppress the development of TLBL via the downregulation of oncogenic factors, such as HOXA3. The findings indicated that further investigation into miR3383p and the HOXA3 regulatory network may aid the development of novel therapeutic tools.","['Wang, Li', 'Sui, Minghua', 'Wang, Xiuli']","['Wang L', 'Sui M', 'Wang X']",,"['Department of Hematology, The Affiliated Yantai Yuhuangding Hospital of Qingdao University, Yantai, Shandong 264000, P.R.

Their effect on proliferation of the colon carcinoma Caco-2 and the leukemia monocytic THP-1 cell lines has been studied in order to determine possible anti-tumor properties. All extracts inhibited proliferation at some of the concentrations ranging from 1 to 10 mg ml(-1). Interestingly none of the extracts inhibited the growth of confluent Caco-2 cells, showing the specificity of the antiproliferative effect for the transformed Caco-2 phenotype. All the extracts inhibited agglutination of red blood cells by galectin-3, a lectin involved in tumor growth, metastasis, and immune cell regulation that has been proposed as a mediator of the anti-tumor effects of modified pectins. In addition, activation of caspase-3 in THP-1 cells indicates that treatment with the pectin-rich extracts triggers apoptosis.

As chemotherapy has many side effects and could lead to resistance in cancer cells, plant-based medication is being considered as a new strategy in cancer treatment.

The present study investigated the effect of an aqueous extract of D. innoxia aqueous leaf-extract on human chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562 cell line) and human B lymphoblastoid cells (FS-2 cells) as the noncancerous cell line. The interaction of the D. innoxia extract with double-stranded DNA and histones was studied using multiple spectroscopic techniques. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents were determined through colorimetric analysis and the major polyphenols were quantified by HPLC-DAD analysis. The results demonstrated that the D. innoxia extract inhibited proliferation of the K562 cell line in a dose- and time-dependent manner (IC50 = 0.6 mg/ml), but had a slightly toxic effect on human B lymphoblastoid cells. The spectroscopy results suggest that the D. innoxia extract interacted with both DNA and histones in solution and that D. innoxia could be suggested as an anticancer drug.","['Chamani, Elham', 'Ebrahimi, Roshanak', 'Khorsandi, Khatereh', 'Meshkini, Azadeh', 'Zarban, Asghar', 'Sharifzadeh, Gholamreza']","['Chamani E', 'Ebrahimi R', 'Khorsandi K', 'Meshkini A', 'Zarban A', 'Sharifzadeh G']",,"['Cardiovascular Diseases Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.', 'Department of Photodynamic, Medical Laser Research Center, YARA institute, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Mashhad, Iran.', 'Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Medicine, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.', 'Social Determinants of Health Research Center, Birjand University of Medical Sciences, Birjand, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Drug Chem Toxicol,Drug and chemical toxicology,7801723,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Plant Extracts)', '0 (Polyphenols)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Datura/*chemistry', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Flavonoids/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy', 'Phenols/chemistry/isolation & purification', 'Plant Extracts/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Plant Leaves', 'Polyphenols/administration & dosage/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA', 'Datura innoxia', 'apoptosis', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'nuclear protein']",2019/07/20 06:00,2020/10/30 06:00,['2019/07/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/30 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/01480545.2019.1629588 [doi]'],ppublish,Drug Chem Toxicol. 2020 Mar;43(2):138-148. doi: 10.1080/01480545.2019.1629588.

However, in eastern countries where consanguineous marriages are common, autosomal recessive forms might be more frequent. METHOD: Two hundred and sixteen patients with severe congenital neutropenia from 28 different pediatric centers in Turkey were registered. RESULTS: The most frequently observed mutation was HAX1 mutation (n = 78, 36.1%). A heterozygous ELANE mutation was detected in 29 patients (13.4%) in our cohort. Biallelic mutations of G6PC3 (n = 9, 4.3%), CSF3R (n = 6, 2.9%), and JAGN1 (n = 2, 1%) were also observed. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor treatment was given to 174 patients (80.6%). Two patients died with infectious complications, and five patients developed myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloblastic leukemia. The mean (+/- mean standard error) follow-up period was 129.7 +/- 76.3 months, and overall survival was 96.8% (CI, 94.4-99.1%) at the age of 15 years. In Turkey, severe congenital neutropenia mostly resulted from the p W44X mutation in the HAX1 gene. CONCLUSION: In Turkey, mutation analysis should be started with HAX1, and if this is negative, ELANE and G6PC3 should be checked. Because of the very high percentage of consanguineous marriage, rare mutations should be tested in patients with a negative mutation screen.","['Yilmaz Karapinar, Deniz', 'Patiroglu, Turkan', 'Metin,

New strategies that can help CAR-T therapy achieve lasting effect are urgently warranted. This non-randomized interventional pragmatic clinical trial had a particular aim. It explored whether consolidative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) could improve the long-term prognosis of the minimal residual disease-negative complete remission (MRD(-) CR) patients after CAR-T therapy. In the first stage, 58 r/r B-ALL patients received split doses of CAR-T cells after lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and 51 (87.9%) achieved CR. In the second stage, 21/47 MRD(-) CR patients without previous allo-HSCT and contraindications or other restrictions, on their own accord, received consolidative allo-HSCT within three months after CAR-T therapy. There was no difference in overall survival (OS) between the MRD(-) CR patients who received allo-HSCT and those who did not. However, event-free survival (EFS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were significantly prolonged by allo-HSCT in the subgroups. This was with either high (>/=5%) pre-infusion bone marrow MRD assessed by flow cytometry (BM-FCM-MRD) or poor prognostic markers (P < .05). However, no difference was found in EFS and RFS for patients with pre-infusion BM-FCM-MRD <5% and without poor prognostic markers (P > .05). To conclude, CAR-T therapy bridging to allo-HSCT is a safe and effective therapeutic strategy for r/r B-ALL patients, and may prolong their EFS and RFS, especially when they have high pre-infusion BM-FCM-MRD or poor prognostic markers.","['Jiang, Huiwen', 'Li, Chenggong', 'Yin, Ping', 'Guo, Tao', 'Liu, Lin', 'Xia, Linghui', 'Wu, Yaohui', 'Zhou, Fen', 'Ai, Lisha', 'Shi, Wei', 'Lu, Xuan', 'Wang,

Prospective data on the impact of BAL on survival are still lacking. We conducted a prospective observational study on patients who performed BAL for LI among 3055 HM patients hospitalized from January to September 2018. The BAL was performed in 145 out of 434 patients who developed LI, at a median time of four days from LI detection. The median age was 60 (1-83). Most patients had an acute myeloid leukemia/myelodisplastic syndrome (81), followed by lymphoma (41), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (27), and other types of HM (36). A putative causal agent was detected in 111 cases (76%), and in 89 cases (61%) the BAL results provided guidance to antimicrobial treatment. We observed a significantly improved outcome of LI at day +30 in patients who could receive a BAL-driven antimicrobial treatment (improvement/resolution rate: 71% vs 55%; P = .04). Moreover, we observed a significantly improved outcome in 120-day overall survival (120d-OS) (78% vs 59%; P = .009) and 120-day attributable mortality (120d-AM) (11% vs 30%; P = 0.003) for patients who could receive a BAL-driven treatment. The multivariate analysis showed that BAL-driven antimicrobial treatment was significantly associated with better 120d-OS and lower 120d-AM. We did not observe any severe adverse events. In conclusion BAL allows detection of a putative agent of LI in about 75% of cases, it is feasible and well tolerated in most cases, demonstrating that a BAL-driven antimicrobial treatment allows improvement of clinical outcome and survival.","['Marchesi, Francesco', 'Cattaneo, Chiara', 'Criscuolo, Marianna', 'Delia, Mario', 'Dargenio, Michelina', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Spadea, Antonio', 'Fracchiolla, Nicola Stefano', 'Melillo, Lorella', 'Perruccio, Katia', 'Alati, Caterina', 'Russo, Domenico', 'Garzia, Mariagrazia', 'Brociner, Marco', 'Cefalo, Mariagiovanna', 'Armiento, Daniele', 'Cesaro, Simone', 'Decembrino, Nunzia', 'Mengarelli, Andrea', 'Tumbarello, Mario', 'Busca, Alessandro', 'Pagano, Livio']","['Marchesi F', 'Cattaneo C', 'Criscuolo M', 'Delia M', 'Dargenio M', 'Del Principe MI', 'Spadea A', 'Fracchiolla NS', 'Melillo L', 'Perruccio K', 'Alati C', 'Russo D', 'Garzia M', 'Brociner M', 'Cefalo M', 'Armiento D', 'Cesaro S', 'Decembrino N', 'Mengarelli A', 'Tumbarello M', 'Busca A', 'Pagano L']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-6353-2272', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5661-2338', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6486-8912', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5356-8690', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8287-928X']","['Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, ASST-Spedali Civili di Brescia, Brescia, Italy.', 'Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli - IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplantation, University of Bari, Bari, Italy.', ""Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, 'Vito Fazzi' Hospital, Lecce, Italy."", 'Hematology, Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', ""Hematology Unit, Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milan, Italy."", 'UO of Hematology, Foundation IRCSS Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza Hospital, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, University Hospital Santa Maria della Misericordia, Perugia, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Bianchi-Melacrino-Morelli Hospital, Reggio Calabria, Italy.', 'Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, University of Brescia and ASST-Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Hematology, San Camillo-Forlanini Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Foundation IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Hematology, San Eugenio Hospital, Rome, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation Unit, University Campus Bio-Medico, Rome, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Integrata, Verona, Italy.', 'Pediatric Hematology Oncology, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy.', 'Hematology and Stem Cell Transplant Unit, IRCCS Regina Elena National Cancer Institute, Rome, Italy.', 'Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli - IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Istituto di Malattie Infettive, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.', ""Stem Cell Transplant Center, AOU Citta' della Salute e Della Scienza, Turin, Italy."", 'Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli - IRCCS, Rome, Italy.', 'Istituto di Ematologia, Universita Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Observational Study']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Anti-Infective Agents)', '0 (Mannans)', '11078-30-1 (galactomannan)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anti-Infective Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Body Fluids/chemistry/*microbiology', '*Bronchoalveolar Lavage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Galactose/analogs & derivatives', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Lung/*microbiology', 'Lung Diseases, Fungal/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/microbiology', 'Male', 'Mannans/analysis', 'Middle Aged', 'Pneumonia, Bacterial/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/microbiology', 'Pneumonia, Viral/diagnosis/*drug therapy/etiology/virology', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Young Adult']",,,,2019/07/20 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/07/20 06:00'],"['2019/06/06 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/08 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25585 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Oct;94(10):1104-1112. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25585.

Patients with newly diagnosed standard-risk ALL at a single institution were retrospectively analyzed. From 2010 to 2017, 46 patients were treated using the modified Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM)-ALL-95 regimen. Hematologic and molecular complete remission (CR) rates of 91.3% and 76.1% were achieved. The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) rates for all patients in the cohort were 58.0% (95% confidence interval, 42.1-73.9%) and 66.7% (95% CI, 51.4-82.0%), respectively. No patient presented with central nervous system involvement after CR in this study. This condition could be related to four doses of high-dose methotrexate (MTX) every 3 months during the maintenance phase. Multivariate analysis revealed that minimal residual disease positive and time interval between induction IA and Protocol M of more than 70 days were independent adverse factors for EFS and OS. One or more instances of grade 4 myelosuppression occurred during induction therapy. Nonhematological side effects were mild. No toxicity-related deaths were observed in the entire cohort. The data indicated that the modified regimen is well tolerated and can produce the promising outcomes in Chinese adults with standard-risk ALL.","['Li, Chun', 'Cai, Xiuyu', 'Chen, Xiaoqin', 'Liang, Yang', 'Xia, Zhongjun', 'Wang, Hua']","['Li C', 'Cai X', 'Chen X', 'Liang Y', 'Xia Z', 'Wang H']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9751-8847'],"['Department of Hematological Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Department of VIP Region, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematological Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematological Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China.', 'Department of Hematological Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China. xiazhj@sysucc.org.cn.', 'Department of Hematological Oncology, Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Oncology in South China, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Medicine, Guangzhou, 510060, China. wanghua@sysucc.org.cn.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'ALL-BFM-95 protocol']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Asians', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Maintenance Chemotherapy', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk', 'Time Factors', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Adults', 'Modified BFM-95 regimen', 'Standard-risk']",2019/07/20 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,['2019/07/20 06:00'],"['2019/05/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/04 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/01 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02703-0 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02703-0 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Oct;110(4):458-465. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02703-0.

It is the only large biodatabase worldwide in which functional methods such as semisolid in vitro cultures complement modern molecular methods such as next generation sequencing. This provides the possibility to comprehensively study the biology of CMML. The aim of this study was to compare patient characteristics with published CMML cohorts and to validate established prognostic parameters in order to examine if this real-life database can serve as a representative and useful data source for further research. After exclusion of patients in transformation characteristics of 531 patients were compared with published CMML cohorts. Median values for age, leukocytes, hemoglobin, platelets, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and circulating blasts were within the ranges of reported CMML series. Established prognostic parameters including leukocytes, hemoglobin, blasts and adverse cytogenetics were able to discriminate patients with different outcome. Myeloproliferative (MP) as compared to myelodysplastic (MD)-CMML patients had higher values for circulating blasts, LDH, RAS-pathway mutations and for spontaneous myelomonocytic colony growth in vitro as well as more often splenomegaly. This study demonstrates that the patient cohort of the ABCMML shares clinicolaboratory characteristics with reported CMML cohorts from other countries and confirms phenotypic and genotypic differences between MP-CMML and MD-CMML. Therefore, results obtained from molecular and biological analyses using material from the national cohort will also be applicable to other CMML series and thus may have a more general significance.","['Geissler, Klaus', 'Jager, Eva', 'Barna, Agnes', 'Gurbisz, Michael', 'Marschon, Renate', 'Graf, Temeida', 'Graf, Elmir', 'Borjan, Bojana', 'Jilch, Ruth', 'Geissler, Christoph', 'Hoermann, Gregor', 'Esterbauer, Harald', 'Schwarzinger, Ilse', 'Nosslinger, Thomas', 'Pfeilstocker, Michael', 'Tuchler, Heinz', 'Reisner, Regina', 'Sliwa, Thamer', 'Keil, Felix', 'Bettelheim, Peter', 'Machherndl-Spandl, Sigrid', 'Doleschal, Bernhard', 'Zach, Otto', 'Weltermann, Ansgar', 'Heibl, Sonja', 'Thaler, Josef', 'Zebisch, Armin', 'Sill, Heinz', 'Stauder, Reinhard', 'Webersinke, Gerald', 'Petzer, Andreas', 'Kusec, Rajko', 'Ulsperger, Ernst', 'Schneeweiss, Bruno', 'Berger, Jorg', 'Ohler, Leopold', 'Germing, Ulrich', 'Sperr, Wolfgang R', 'Knobl, Paul', 'Jager, Ulrich', 'Valent, Peter']","['Geissler K', 'Jager E', 'Barna A', 'Gurbisz M', 'Marschon R', 'Graf T', 'Graf E', 'Borjan B', 'Jilch R', 'Geissler C', 'Hoermann G', 'Esterbauer H', 'Schwarzinger I', 'Nosslinger T', 'Pfeilstocker M', 'Tuchler H', 'Reisner R', 'Sliwa T', 'Keil F', 'Bettelheim P', 'Machherndl-Spandl S', 'Doleschal B', 'Zach O', 'Weltermann A', 'Heibl S', 'Thaler J', 'Zebisch A', 'Sill H', 'Stauder R', 'Webersinke G', 'Petzer A', 'Kusec R', 'Ulsperger E', 'Schneeweiss B', 'Berger J', 'Ohler L', 'Germing U', 'Sperr WR', 'Knobl P', 'Jager U', 'Valent P']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1921-7034'],"['Sigmund Freud University, Vienna, Austria. klaus.geissler@wienkav.at.', 'Department of Internal Medicine V with Hematology, Oncology and Palliative Medicine, Hospital Hietzing, Wolkersbergenstrasse 1, 1130, Vienna, Austria. klaus.geissler@wienkav.at.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Blood Transfusion Service, Blood Transfusion Service for Upper Austria, Austrian Red Cross, Linz, Austria.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I with Hematology with Stem Cell Transplantation, Hemostaseology and Medical Oncology, Ordensklinikum Linz Barmherzige Schwestern -

Infections were diagnosed in 60.8% children and 35.0% adults, including respectively 69.1% and 63.5% allo-HCT, and 33.1% and 20.8% auto-HCT patients. The incidence of bacterial infections was higher in children (36.0% vs 27.6%; p < 0.0001). Infections with Gram-negative bacteria were more frequent than Gram-positives in adults (64.6% vs 44.8%; p < 0.0001). Outcome of bacterial infections was better in children (95.5% vs 91.4%; p = 0.0011). The IFD incidence (25.3% vs 6.3%; p < 0.0001) and outcome (88.0% vs 74.9%; p < 0.0001) were higher in children. The incidence of viral infections was higher in children after allo-HCT (56.3% vs 29.3%; p < 0.0001), and auto-HCT (6.6% vs 0.8%; p < 0.0001). Outcome of viral infections was better in children (98.6% vs 92.3%; p = 0.0096). Infection-related mortality was 7.8% in children and 18.4% in adults (p < 0.0001). No child after auto-HCT died of infection. Adult age, mismatched transplants, acute leukemia, chronic GVHD, CMV reactivation, infection with Gram-negatives, and duration of infection > 21 days were risk factors for death from infection. In conclusion, pediatric patients have 2.9-fold higher incidence and 2.5-fold better outcome of infections than adults after HCT.","['Czyzewski, Krzysztof', 'Styczynski, Jan', 'Giebel, Sebastian', 'Fraczkiewicz, Jowita', 'Salamonowicz, Malgorzata', 'Zajac-Spychala, Olga', 'Zaucha-Prazmo, Agnieszka', 'Drozd-Sokolowska, Joanna', 'Waszczuk-Gajda, Anna', 'Dybko, Jaroslaw', 'Manko, Joanna', 'Zalas-Wiecek, Patrycja', 'Galazka, Przemyslaw', 'Wysocki, Mariusz', 'Kowalczyk, Jerzy', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Gozdzik, Jolanta', 'Basak, Grzegorz W', 'Kalwak, Krzysztof', 'Adamska, Monika', 'Hus, Marek', 'Piekarska, Agnieszka', 'Sadowska-Klasa, Alicja', 'Mensah-Glanowska, Patrycja', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien, Slawomira', 'Biernat, Monika', 'Wierzbowska, Agnieszka', 'Rzepecki, Piotr', 'Tomaszewska, Agnieszka', 'Halaburda, Kazimierz', 'Gil, Lidia']","['Czyzewski K', 'Styczynski J', 'Giebel S', 'Fraczkiewicz J', 'Salamonowicz M', 'Zajac-Spychala O', 'Zaucha-Prazmo A', 'Drozd-Sokolowska J', 'Waszczuk-Gajda A', 'Dybko J', 'Manko J', 'Zalas-Wiecek P', 'Galazka P', 'Wysocki M', 'Kowalczyk J', 'Wachowiak J', 'Gozdzik J', 'Basak GW', 'Kalwak K', 'Adamska M', 'Hus M', 'Piekarska A', 'Sadowska-Klasa A', 'Mensah-Glanowska P', 'Kyrcz-Krzemien S', 'Biernat M', 'Wierzbowska A', 'Rzepecki P', 'Tomaszewska A', 'Halaburda K', 'Gil L']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3158-119X'],"['Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, Collegium Medicum, Nicolaus Copernicus University Torun, ul.

Fine-needle aspiration of the subcutaneous lesion revealed large, atypical, round cells. A clonality analysis for the T-cell receptor-gamma and immunoglobulin heavy chain genes showed no clonal rearrangement. The presumed diagnosis was lymphoma and the cat was treated with prednisolone and L-asparaginase but died 78 days after initial treatment. At necropsy, an oedematous subcutaneous mass in the right axilla, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly and lymphadenopathy of the mediastinum and left axilla were observed. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse infiltration of large atypical round cells in the subcutaneous mass, liver, spleen, lymph nodes and bone marrow. Immunohistochemically, the tumour cells were strongly positive for CD56, and negative for CD3, CD20, CD79a, CD57, granzyme B and perforin. Based on these findings, the cat was diagnosed with blastic natural killer (NK) cell lymphoma/leukaemia. Relevance and novel information: Here, we report the pathological and clinical findings of NK cell lymphoma/leukaemia in a cat. The antibody for human CD56, a diagnostic marker for human NK cell neoplasms, showed cross-reactivity with feline CD56 by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analysis. The antibody could be a useful diagnostic marker for feline NK cell neoplasms.","['Hirabayashi, Miyuki', 'Chambers, James K', 'Sugawara, Mei', 'Ohmi, Aki', 'Tsujimoto, Hajime', 'Nakayama, Hiroyuki', 'Uchida, Kazuyuki']","['Hirabayashi M', 'Chambers JK', 'Sugawara M', 'Ohmi A', 'Tsujimoto H', 'Nakayama H', 'Uchida K']",,"['Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Veterinary Medical Center, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Veterinary Medical Center, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Internal Medicine, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Veterinary Medical Center, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Veterinary Pathology, Graduate School of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],England,JFMS Open Rep,JFMS open reports,101672978,,,,,PMC6628536,['NOTNLM'],"['CD56', 'NK cell lymphoma/leukaemia']",2019/07/20 06:00,2019/07/20 06:01,['2019/07/20 06:00'],"['2019/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2055116919863080 [doi]', '10.1177_2055116919863080 [pii]']",epublish,JFMS Open Rep. 2019 Jul 11;5(2):2055116919863080. doi: 10.1177/2055116919863080. eCollection 2019 Jul-Dec.,,20190711,,,"['Conflict of interest: The authors declared no potential conflicts of interest', 'with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While progress has been made in the understanding of the genetic and molecular biology of the disease, the standard of care for patients had only changed minimally over the past 40 years. Recently, rapid movement of potentially useful agents from bench to bedside has translated into new therapies either recently approved or in clinical trials. These therapies include improved chemotherapies, mutationally targeted inhibitors, pro-apoptotic agents, microenvironment targeting molecules, cell cycle checkpoint inhibitors, and epigenetic regulators. Furthermore, advances in immunotherapy employ monoclonal and bispecific antibodies, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, checkpoint inhibitors, and vaccines provide an alternative pathway for AML treatment. In this review, we discuss the recent results of completed or ongoing clinical trials with these novel therapeutic agents in AML.","['Winer, Eric S', 'Stone, Richard M']","['Winer ES', 'Stone RM']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-7526-2633'],"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Leukemia Division, Department of Medical Oncology, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Leukemia Division, Department of Medical Oncology, 450 Brookline Ave., Boston, MA 02115, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Ther Adv Hematol,Therapeutic advances in hematology,101549589,,,,,PMC6624910,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'FLT3', 'IDH1/2', 'checkpoint inhibitors', 'immunotherapy', 'pro-apoptotic inhibitors', 'targeted therapy']",2019/07/20 06:00,2019/07/20 06:01,['2019/07/20 06:00'],"['2019/02/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/20 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1177/2040620719860645 [doi]', '10.1177_2040620719860645 [pii]']",epublish,Ther Adv Hematol. 2019 Jul 10;10:2040620719860645. doi: 10.1177/2040620719860645. eCollection 2019.,,20190710,,,"['Conflict of interest statement: ESW has served on advisory boards for Shionogi,', 'Inc. and Pfizer and received research funding from Lilly.

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Using both FLT3-ITD cell lines and primary patient samples, Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry analysis were used to quantify cell death induced by midostaurin or gilteritinib, alone or in combination with venetoclax. Western blot analysis was performed to assess changes in protein expression levels of members of the JAK/STAT, MAPK/ERK, and PI3K/AKT pathways, and members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The MV4-11-derived xenograft mouse model was used to assess in vivo efficacy of the combination of gilteritinib and venetoclax. Lentiviral overexpression of Mcl-1 was used to confirm its role in cell death induced by midostaurin or gilteritinib with venetoclax. Changes of Mcl-1 transcript levels were assessed by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The combination of midostaurin or gilteritinib with venetoclax potently and synergistically induces apoptosis in FLT3-ITD AML cell lines and primary patient samples. The FLT3 inhibitors induced downregulation of Mcl-1, enhancing venetoclax activity. Phosphorylated-ERK expression is induced by venetoclax but abolished by the combination of venetoclax with midostaurin or gilteritinib. Simultaneous downregulation of Mcl-1 by midostaurin or gilteritinib and inhibition of Bcl-2 by venetoclax results in ""free"" Bim, leading to synergistic induction of apoptosis. In vivo results show that gilteritinib in combination with venetoclax has therapeutic potential.

Breast cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) are powerful tools for the study of cancer biology and drug treatment response. Specific DNA methylation patterns have been associated to different breast cancer subtypes but its association with chemoresistance remains unstudied. Aiming to elucidate docetaxel resistance mechanisms, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation in breast cancer PDX models, including luminal and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models sensitive to docetaxel, their matched models after emergence of chemoresistance and residual disease after short-term docetaxel treatment. We found that DNA methylation profiles from breast cancer PDX models maintain the subtype-specific methylation patterns of clinical samples. Two main DNA methylation clusters were found in TNBC PDX and remain stable during the emergence of docetaxel resistance; however, some genes/pathways were differentially methylated according to docetaxel response. A DNA methylation signature of resistance able to segregate TNBC based on chemotherapy response was identified. Transcriptomic profiling of selected sensitive/resistant pairs and integrative analysis with methylation data demonstrated correlation between some differentially methylated and expressed genes in docetaxel-resistant TNBC PDX models. Multiple gene expression changes were found after the emergence of docetaxel resistance in TNBC. DNA methylation and transcriptional changes identified between docetaxel-sensitive and -resistant TNBC PDX models or residual disease may have predictive value for chemotherapy response in TNBC. IMPLICATIONS: Subtype-specific DNA methylation patterns are maintained in breast cancer PDX models. While no global methylation changes were found, we uncovered differentially DNA methylated and expressed genes/pathways associated with the emergence of docetaxel resistance in TNBC.","['Gomez-Miragaya, Jorge', 'Moran, Sebastian', 'Calleja-Cervantes, Maria Erendira', 'Collado-Sole, Alejandro', 'Pare, Laia', 'Gomez, Antonio', 'Serra, Violeta', 'Dobrolecki, Lacey E', 'Lewis, Michael T', 'Diaz-Lagares, Angel', 'Eroles, Pilar', 'Prat, Aleix', 'Esteller, Manel', 'Gonzalez-Suarez, Eva']","['Gomez-Miragaya J', 'Moran S', 'Calleja-Cervantes ME', 'Collado-Sole A', 'Pare L', 'Gomez A', 'Serra V', 'Dobrolecki LE', 'Lewis MT', 'Diaz-Lagares A', 'Eroles P', 'Prat A', 'Esteller M', 'Gonzalez-Suarez E']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1801-4681', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0688-0793', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5308-981X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6620-1065', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2708-6206']","['Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Translational Genomics and Targeted Therapeutics in Solid Tumors, August Pi i Sunyer Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBAPS), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.', ""Preclinical Research Program, Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO), Barcelona, Spain."", 'Departments of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Radiology, The Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Departments of Molecular and Cellular Biology and Radiology, The Lester and Sue Smith Breast Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas.', 'Cancer Epigenetics and Biology Program (PEBC), Bellvitge Biomedical Research Institute (IDIBELL), Barcelona, Spain.', 'Cancer Epigenomics, Translational Medical Oncology (Oncomet), Health Research Institute of Santiago (IDIS), University Clinical Hospital of Santiago (CHUS/SERGAS), CIBERONC, Santiago de Compostela, Spain.', 'Biomedical Research Institute (INCLIVA), Valencia, Spain.

The CUX1 locus is also deleted in 3 of 4 MN cases with -7/del(7q). A cohort of 1480 MN patients was used to characterize clinical features and clonal hierarchy associated with CUX1 (MT) and CUX1 deletions (CUX1 (DEL)) and to analyze their functional consequences in vitro. CUX1 (MT) were present in 4% of chronic MNs. CUX1 (DEL) were preferentially found in advanced cases (6%). Most MDS and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with -7/del(7q) and up to 15% of MDS patients and 5% of AML patients diploid for the CUX1 locus exhibited downmodulated CUX1 expression. In 75% of mutant cases, CUX1 (MT) were heterozygous, whereas microdeletions and homozygous and compound-heterozygous mutations were less common. CUX (MT/DEL) were associated with worse survival compared with CUX1 (WT) Within the clonal hierarchy, 1 of 3 CUX1 (MT) served as founder events often followed by secondary BCOR and ASXL1 subclonal hits, whereas TET2 was the most common ancestral lesion, followed by subclonal CUX1 (MT) Comet assay of patients' bone marrow progenitor cells and leukemic cell lines performed in various experimental conditions revealed that frameshift mutations, hemizygous deletions, or experimental CUX1 knockdown decrease the repair of oxidized bases. These functional findings may explain why samples with either CUX1 (MT) or low CUX1 expression coincided with significantly higher numbers of somatic hits by whole-exome sequencing. Our findings implicate the DNA repair dysfunction resulting from CUX1 lesions in the pathogenesis of MNs, in which they lead to a mutator phenotype.","['Aly, Mai', 'Ramdzan, Zubaidah M', 'Nagata, Yasunobu', 'Balasubramanian, Suresh K', 'Hosono, Naoko', 'Makishima, Hideki', 'Visconte, Valeria', 'Kuzmanovic, Teodora', 'Adema, Vera', 'Nazha, Aziz', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej P', 'Kerr, Cassandra M', 'Sekeres, Mikkael A', 'Abazeed, Mohamed E', 'Nepveu, Alain', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P']","['Aly M', 'Ramdzan ZM', 'Nagata Y', 'Balasubramanian SK', 'Hosono N', 'Makishima H', 'Visconte V', 'Kuzmanovic T', 'Adema V', 'Nazha A', 'Przychodzen BP', 'Kerr CM', 'Sekeres MA', 'Abazeed ME', 'Nepveu A', 'Maciejewski JP']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6125-0850'],"['Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Clinical Hematology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt.', 'Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Research Centre, Department of Oncology, Biochemistry and Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medical Science, University of Fukui, Fukui, Japan.', 'Department of Pathology and Tumor Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; and.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Leukemia Program, Department of Hematology and Medical Oncology, Taussig Cancer Institute, and.', 'Department of Radiation Oncology, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.', 'Rosalind and Morris Goodman Cancer Research Centre, Department of Oncology, Biochemistry and Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada.', 'Department of Translational Hematology and Oncology Research, Taussig Cancer Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (CUX1 protein, human)', '0 (Homeodomain Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",IM,,"['Biomarkers', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clonal Evolution/genetics', '*Disease Susceptibility', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Genetic Association Studies', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Homeodomain Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear', 'Loss of Heterozygosity', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*diagnosis/*etiology/mortality/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Prognosis', 'Repressor Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Sequence Deletion', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics/metabolism']",PMC6650742,,,2019/07/20 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2019/07/20 06:00'],"['2018/11/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/20 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2018028423 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2018028423 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Jul 23;3(14):2164-2178. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2018028423.,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,"['R01 HL118281/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL123904/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 HL132071/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 HL135795/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'KL2 TR002547/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'R37 CA222294/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Otherwise, childhood overweight and obesity are reaching epidemic proportions. They have been associated with poor outcomes in children with ALL. The aim of present study was to identify if overweight and obesity are predictors of early mortality and relapse in Mexican children with ALL. METHODS: A multicenter cohort study was conducted. ALL children younger than 15 years old were included and followed-up during the first 24 months after diagnosis. Overweight and obesity were classified according World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria. Early mortality and early relapses were the main outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 1070 children were analyzed. Overweight/obesity at diagnosis were predictors of early mortality (WHO: HR = 1.4, 95%CI:1.0-2.0; CDC: HR = 1.6, 95%CI:1.1-2.3). However, no associations between overweight (WHO: HR = 1.5, 95%CI:0.9-2.5; CDC: HR = 1.0; 95% CI:0.6-1.6) and obesity (WHO: HR = 1.5, 95%CI:0.7-3.2; CDC: HR = 1.4; 95%CI:0.9-2.3) with early relapse were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Overweight and obese patients embody a subgroup with high risk of dying during leukemia treatment.","['Nunez-Enriquez, Juan Carlos', 'Gil-Hernandez, Ana Elena', 'Jimenez-Hernandez, Elva',

The effect of MOV10 on Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is not known and its role on the replication of this virus is poorly understood. We investigated the effect of MOV10 down-regulation and MOV10 over-expression on HBV in a variety of cell lines, as well as in an infection system using a replication competent virus. We report that MOV10 down-regulation, using siRNA, shRNA, and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology, resulted in increased levels of HBV DNA, HBV pre-genomic RNA, and HBV core protein. In contrast, MOV10 over-expression reduced HBV DNA, HBV pre-genomic RNA, and HBV core protein. These effects were consistent in all tested cell lines, providing strong evidence for the involvement of MOV10 in the HBV life cycle. We demonstrated that MOV10 does not interact with HBV-core. However, MOV10 binds HBV pgRNA and this interaction does not affect HBV pgRNA decay rate. We conclude that the restriction of HBV by MOV10 is mediated through effects at the level of viral RNA.","['Puray-Chavez, Maritza N', 'Farghali, Mahmoud H', 'Yapo, Vincent', 'Huber, Andrew D', 'Liu, Dandan', 'Ndongwe, Tanyaradzwa P', 'Casey, Mary C', 'Laughlin, Thomas G', 'Hannink, Mark', 'Tedbury, Philip R', 'Sarafianos, Stefan G']","['Puray-Chavez MN', 'Farghali MH', 'Yapo V', 'Huber AD', 'Liu D', 'Ndongwe TP', 'Casey MC', 'Laughlin TG', 'Hannink M', 'Tedbury PR', 'Sarafianos SG']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-3790-8368', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8151-4967']","['Christopher S.

However, some cancers may be underfunded relative to their burden. This study examined the alignment of cancer burden by histology with NPO funding for each histology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This nationwide, cross-sectional study conducted from October 2017 through February 2018 included all oncology NPOs with >$5 million in annual revenue. Total revenue from NPOs supporting individual cancer types with the incidence, mortality, and person-years of life lost (PYLL) for each cancer type was compared using scatter plots and Pearson correlation coefficients. Correlation of expenditure types (eg, fundraising, patient education) with revenue was assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Effect of disease association with a stigmatized behavior (eg, lung cancer and smoking) was evaluated using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: A total of 119 cancer-related NPOs were included, generating approximately $6 billion in annual revenue in 2015. Cancers with the largest revenue were breast cancer ($460 million; 33.2%), leukemia ($201 million; 14.5%), pediatric cancers ($177 million; 12.8%), and lymphoma ($145 million; 10.5%). Breast cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, and pediatric cancers were all well funded compared with their incidence, mortality, and PYLL. Gastrointestinal (colorectal, pancreas, and hepatobiliary), gynecologic (ovarian, cervical, and endometrial), brain, and lung cancers were poorly funded in all 3 metrics. All cancers associated with a stigmatized behavior were poorly funded in at least 2 metrics. Increased spending on fundraising, administrative costs, patient education, and treatment was highly correlated with increased revenue (Pearson correlation coefficients all >0.92). CONCLUSIONS: NPO funding by cancer type is not proportionate with individual cancer burden on society. Disease stigma negatively impacts funding. A significant need exists to increase awareness and funding for many undersupported but common and highly lethal cancers.","['Kamath, Suneel D', 'Kircher, Sheetal M', 'Benson, Al B']","['Kamath SD', 'Kircher SM', 'Benson AB']",,"['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, and.', 'Robert H.

A total of 138 children and adolescents who underwent HSCT from HLA-identical sibling donors (MSDs) and 210 who underwent HSCT from matched donors (MDs) (median age, 9 years; 68% male) in 10 countries were enrolled in the International-BFM ALL SCT 2007 prospective study to assess the impact of donor type in HSCT for pediatric ALL. The 4-year event-free survival (65 +/- 5% vs 61 +/- 4%; P=.287), overall survival (72 +/- 4% versus 68 +/- 4%; P=.235), cumulative incidence of relapse (24 +/- 4% versus 25 +/- 3%; P=.658) and nonrelapse mortality (10 +/- 3% versus 14 +/- 3%; P=.212) were not significantly different between MSD and MD graft recipients. The risk of extensive chronic (cGVHD) was lower in MD graft recipients than in MSD graft recipients (hazard ratio [HR], .38; P=.002), and the risks of severe acute GVHD (aGVHD) and cGVHD were higher in peripheral blood stem cell graft recipients than in bone marrow graft recipients (HR, 2.06; P=.026). Compared with the absence of aGVHD, grade I-II aGVHD was associated with a lower risk of graft failure (HR, .63; P=.042) and grade III-IV aGVHD was associated with a higher risk of graft failure (HR, 1.85; P=.020) and nonleukemic death (HR, 8.76; P < .0001), despite a lower risk of relapse (HR, .32; P=.021). Compared with the absence of cGVHD, extensive cGVHD was associated with a higher risk of nonleukemic death (HR, 8.12; P < .0001). Because the outcomes of transplantation from a matched donor were not inferior to those of transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling, eligibility criteria for transplantation might be reviewed in pediatric ALL and possibly in other malignancies as well. Bone marrow should be the preferred stem cell source, and the addition of MTX should be considered in MSD graft recipients.","['Balduzzi, Adriana', 'Dalle, Jean-Hugues', 'Wachowiak, Jacek', 'Yaniv, Isaac', 'Yesilipek, Akif', 'Sedlacek, Petr', 'Bierings, Marc', 'Ifversen, Marianne', 'Sufliarska, Sabina', 'Kalwak, Krzysztof', 'Lankester, Arjan', 'Toporski, Jacek', 'Di Maio, Lucia', 'Glogova, Evgenia', 'Poetschger, Ulrike', 'Peters, Christina']","['Balduzzi A', 'Dalle JH', 'Wachowiak J', 'Yaniv I', 'Yesilipek A', 'Sedlacek P', 'Bierings M', 'Ifversen M', 'Sufliarska S', 'Kalwak K', 'Lankester A', 'Toporski J', 'Di Maio L', 'Glogova E', 'Poetschger U', 'Peters C']",,"['Clinica Pediatrica, Universita degli Studi di Milano Bicocca, Fondazione Monza e Brianza per il Bambino e la sua Mamma, Ospedale San Gerardo, Monza, Italy.

Here we described the development and specific targeting of daunorubicin (DNR)-loaded CD123/CD33 dual-antibody modified liposome, CD123/CD33-LP-DNR. Since the majority of AML cells carries at least one of the antigens of CD123 and CD33, it is promising to treat AML using the dual-targeting agents. In this study, antibody mixture of CD123 and CD33 (1:1, molar ratio) were thiolated and coupled to Mal-PEG2000-DSPE, then the antibody-Mal-PEG2000-DSPE conjugations were inserted on the DNR-loaded PEGylated liposomes (PEG-LP-DNR) via a post insertion method to prepare CD123/CD33-LP-DNR (antibody/S100PC, molar ratio, 0.06%). The cellular uptake and cytotoxicity were evaluated in THP-1 (CD123(bright)CD33(bright)) and HL-60 (CD123(dim)CD33(bright)) cells. Compared to the unmodified liposome, CD123/CD33-LP-DNR showed higher cellular uptake which was 1.8-times and 1.6-times in both THP-1 and HL-60 cells, respectively, while the cellular uptake increased to 1.5-times only in the CD123(bright) cells for the single-antibody modified liposome, CD123-LP-DNR. MTT assay indicated stronger cytotoxicity of CD123/CD33-LP-DNR than CD123-LP-DNR on AML cells. The results indicated that CD123/CD33-LP-DNR might present an effective delivery strategy to enhance the targeting ability against AML cells and potentially reduce the antigen-negative escape.","['Sun, Shili', 'Zou, Huixi', 'Li, Lin', 'Liu, Qi', 'Ding, Ning', 'Zeng, Lili', 'Li, Hui', 'Mao, Shengjun']","['Sun S', 'Zou H', 'Li L', 'Liu Q', 'Ding N', 'Zeng L', 'Li H', 'Mao S']",,"['Key Laboratory of Drug-Targeting and Drug Delivery System of the Education Ministry, Sichuan Engineering Laboratory for Plant-Sourced Drug and Sichuan Research Center for Drug Precision Industrial Technology, West China School of Pharmacy Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Drug-Targeting and Drug Delivery System of the Education Ministry, Sichuan Engineering Laboratory for Plant-Sourced Drug and Sichuan Research Center for Drug Precision Industrial Technology, West China School of Pharmacy Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Drug-Targeting and Drug Delivery System of the Education Ministry, Sichuan Engineering Laboratory for Plant-Sourced Drug and Sichuan Research Center for Drug Precision Industrial Technology, West China School of Pharmacy Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Drug-Targeting and Drug Delivery System of the Education Ministry, Sichuan Engineering Laboratory for Plant-Sourced Drug and Sichuan Research Center for Drug Precision Industrial Technology, West China School of Pharmacy Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Drug-Targeting and Drug Delivery System of the Education Ministry, Sichuan Engineering Laboratory for Plant-Sourced Drug and Sichuan Research Center for Drug Precision Industrial Technology, West China School of Pharmacy Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, PR China.', 'Key Laboratory of Drug-Targeting and Drug Delivery System of the Education Ministry, Sichuan Engineering Laboratory for Plant-Sourced Drug and Sichuan Research Center for Drug Precision Industrial Technology, West China School of Pharmacy Sichuan University, Chengdu 610064, PR China.', ""Department of Hematology, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences & Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital & Affiliated Hospital of University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu 611731, PR China.

In particular, chromosomal rearrangements resulting in the overexpression of cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) occur in 50% of Ph-like ALL cases. CRLF2 overexpression is associated with particularly poor clinical outcomes, though the molecular basis for this is currently unknown. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are integral to the treatment of ALL and GC resistance at diagnosis is an important negative prognostic factor. Given the importance of GCs in ALL therapy and the poor outcomes for patients with CRLF2 overexpression, we hypothesized that the aberrant signal transduction associated with CRLF2 overexpression might mediate intrinsic GC insensitivity. To test this hypothesis, we exposed Ph-like ALL cells from patient-derived xenografts to GCs and found that CRLF2 rearranged (CRLF2R) leukemias uniformly demonstrated reduced GC sensitivity in vitro. Furthermore, targeted inhibition of signal transduction with the MEK inhibitor trametinib and the Akt inhibitor MK2206, but not the JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib, was sufficient to augment GC sensitivity. These data suggest that suboptimal GC responses may in part underlie the poor clinical outcomes for patients with CRLF2 overexpression and provide rationale for combination therapy involving GCs and signal transduction inhibitors as a means of enhancing GC efficacy.","['Meyer, Lauren K', 'Delgado-Martin, Cristina', 'Maude, Shannon L', 'Shannon, Kevin M', 'Teachey, David T', 'Hermiston, Michelle L']","['Meyer LK', 'Delgado-Martin C', 'Maude SL', 'Shannon KM', 'Teachey DT', 'Hermiston ML']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1790-2679'],"['Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of California, San Francisco, CA, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (CRLF2 protein, human)', '0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, Cytokine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'EC 2.7.11.25 (MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases)']",IM,,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Glucocorticoids/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'MAP Kinase Kinase Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Receptors, Cytokine/*genetics', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC6638974,,,2019/07/19 06:00,2020/03/04 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/04 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0220026 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-10386 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jul 18;14(7):e0220026. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0220026. eCollection 2019.,,20190718,,"['T32 GM007618/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA193776/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) nilotinib inhibits the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL1 in CML patients. Despite the success of nilotinib treatment in patients with chronic-phase (CP) CML, a population of Philadelphia-positive (Ph+) quiescent stem cells escapes the drug activity and can lead to drug resistance. The molecular mechanism by which these quiescent cells remain insensitive is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to compare the gene expression profiling (GEP) of bone marrow (BM) CD34+/lin- cells from CP-CML patients at diagnosis and after 12 months of nilotinib treatment by microarray, in order to identify gene expression changes and the dysregulation of pathways due to nilotinib action. We selected BM CD34+/lin- cells from 78 CP-CML patients at diagnosis and after 12 months of first-line nilotinib therapy and microarray analysis was performed. GEP bioinformatic analyses identified 2,959 differently expressed probes and functional clustering determined some significantly enriched pathways between diagnosis and 12 months of nilotinib treatment. Among these pathways, we observed the under expression of 26 genes encoding proteins belonging to the cell cycle after 12 months of nilotinib treatment which led to the up-regulation of chromosome replication, cell proliferation, DNA replication, and DNA damage checkpoint at diagnosis. We demonstrated the under expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCC4, ABCC5, and ABCD3 encoding proteins which pumped drugs out of the cells after 12 months of nilotinib. Moreover, GEP data demonstrated the deregulation of genes involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The down-regulation of JAK2, IL7, STAM, PIK3CA, PTPN11, RAF1, and SOS1 key genes after 12 months of nilotinib could demonstrate the up-regulation of cell cycle, proliferation and differentiation via MAPK and PI3K-AKT signaling pathways at diagnosis.","['Trojani, Alessandra', 'Pungolino, Ester', 'Dal Molin, Alessandra', 'Lodola, Milena', 'Rossi, Giuseppe', ""D'Adda, Mariella"", 'Perego, Alessandra', 'Elena, Chiara', 'Turrini, Mauro', 'Borin, Lorenza', 'Bucelli, Cristina', 'Malato, Simona', 'Carraro, Maria Cristina', 'Spina, Francesco', 'Latargia, Maria Luisa', 'Artale, Salvatore', 'Spedini, Pierangelo', 'Anghilieri, Michela', 'Di Camillo, Barbara', 'Baruzzo, Giacomo', 'De Canal, Gabriella', 'Iurlo, Alessandra', 'Morra, Enrica', 'Cairoli, Roberto']","['Trojani A', 'Pungolino E', 'Dal Molin A', 'Lodola M', 'Rossi G', ""D'Adda M"", 'Perego A', 'Elena C', 'Turrini M', 'Borin L', 'Bucelli C', 'Malato S', 'Carraro MC', 'Spina F', 'Latargia ML', 'Artale S', 'Spedini P', 'Anghilieri M', 'Di Camillo B', 'Baruzzo G', 'De Canal G', 'Iurlo A', 'Morra E', 'Cairoli R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7659-2968', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4401-0812']","['Division of Hematology, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milano, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milano, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, ASST Spedali Civili, Brescia, Italy.', 'Internal Medicine-Haematology, Desio Hospital, Desio, Italy.', 'Hematology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Valduce Hospital, Como, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy.', ""Hematology Division, Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italy."", 'Hematology and Bone Marrow Transplantation Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milano, Italy.', 'Hematology and Transfusion Medicine, Sacco Hospital, Milano, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology-Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori, Milano, Italy.', 'ASST Valle Olona Ospedale di Circolo, Busto Arsizio, Italy.', ""ASST Valle Olona Sant'Antonio Abate, Gallarate, Italy."", 'Division of Hematology, Hospital of Cremona, Cremona, Italy.', 'ASST Lecco, Lecco, Italy.', 'Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Department of Information Engineering, University of Padova, Padova, Italy.', 'Pathology Department, Cytogenetics, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milano, Italy.', ""Hematology Division, Foundation IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Milano, Italy."", 'Executive Committee, Rete Ematologia Lombarda, Italy.', 'Division of Hematology, ASST Grande Ospedale Metropolitano Niguarda, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT Transcription Factors)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinases)', 'F41401512X (nilotinib)']",IM,,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/*blood', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinases/*blood', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*blood', 'Pyrimidines/*administration & dosage', 'STAT Transcription Factors/*blood', 'Signal Transduction/*drug effects', 'Time Factors']",PMC6638825,,,2019/07/19 06:00,2020/02/19 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2018/11/27 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/19 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0218444 [doi]', 'PONE-D-18-31648 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jul 18;14(7):e0218444. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0218444. eCollection 2019.,,20190718,,,"['The authors have declared that non-financial competing interests exist.

Ig administration has become common practice in the treatment of the immunocompromised patient and has recently expanded into the treatment of those patients with an inflammatory disease and autoimmune neuropathies per established clinical guidelines. As research into the genetic basis of disease advances, clinicians should better assess complex data surrounding safe and effective uses of Ig to treat patients who present with B-cell and T-cell deficiencies, along with those harboring gene deletions or genetic anomalies who may potentially benefit from Ig therapy. Evidence-based clinical indications for the use of Ig include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Kawasaki disease, chronic idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy, multifocal motor neuropathy, bone marrow transplantation, and pediatric HIV infection, among others, and have evolved over time. Ig is also often tried in refractory cases that might benefit from its anti-inflammatory effects or empirically in off-label situations. Due to its anti-inflammatory effects, high-dose Ig has been used for numerous off-label indications with varying levels of effectiveness and evidence to support its use. A review of all autoimmune conditions for which Ig has been used is beyond the scope of this article and newer treatments are available for many of these disorders. Here the focus will be on selected conditions in which Ig has clear benefit.

Scenarios were assessed to find the relative impact of critical parameters on incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). METHODS: A partitioned survival model was constructed comparing acalabrutinib and ibrutinib from a UK national health service perspective. This model included states for progression-free survival (PFS), post-progression survival (PPS) and death. PFS and overall survival (OS) were parametrically extrapolated from ibrutinib publications and a preliminary hazard ratio based on phase I/II data was applied for acalabrutinib. Deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed, and 1296 scenarios were assessed. RESULTS: The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was pound61,941/QALY, with 3.44 incremental QALYs and incremental costs of pound213,339. Deterministic sensitivity analysis indicated that survival estimates, utilities and treatment costs of ibrutinib and acalabrutinib and resource use during PFS have the greatest influence on the ICER. Probabilistic results under different development scenarios indicated that greater efficacy of acalabrutinib would decrease the likelihood of cost effectiveness (from 63% at no effect to 2% at maximum efficacy). Scenario analyses showed that a reduction in PFS did not lead to great QALY differences (- 8 to - 14% incremental QALYs) although it did greatly affect costs (- 47 to - 122% incremental pounds). For OS, the opposite was true (- 89 to - 93% QALYs and - 7 to - 39% pounds). CONCLUSIONS: Acalabrutinib is not likely to be cost effective compared with ibrutinib under current development scenarios. The conflicting effects of OS, PFS, drug costs and utility during PFS show that determining the cost effectiveness of acalabrutinib without insight into all parameters complicates health technology assessment decision making. Early assessment of the cost effectiveness of new products can support development choices and reimbursement processes through effective early dialogues between stakeholders.","['Vreman, Rick A', 'Geenen, Joost W', 'Hovels, Anke M', 'Goettsch, Wim G', 'Leufkens, Hubert G M', 'Al, Maiwenn J']","['Vreman RA', 'Geenen JW', 'Hovels AM', 'Goettsch WG', 'Leufkens HGM', 'Al MJ']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2076-322X'],"['Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, Universiteitsweg 99, 3584 CG, Utrecht, The Netherlands. r.a.vreman@uu.nl.', 'The National Health Care Institute (ZIN), Diemen, The Netherlands. r.a.vreman@uu.nl.', 'Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, Universiteitsweg 99, 3584 CG, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, Universiteitsweg 99, 3584 CG, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, Universiteitsweg 99, 3584 CG, Utrecht, The Netherlands. w.g.goettsch@uu.nl.', 'The National Health Care Institute (ZIN), Diemen, The Netherlands. w.g.goettsch@uu.nl.', 'Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Clinical Pharmacology, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University, Universiteitsweg 99, 3584 CG, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Erasmus School of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article']",New Zealand,Appl Health Econ Health Policy,Applied health economics and health policy,101150314,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Pyrazines)', 'I42748ELQW (acalabrutinib)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Benzamides/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Pyrazines/administration & dosage/*economics', 'Quality-Adjusted Life Years', 'State Medicine', 'Survival Analysis', 'United Kingdom']",PMC6885502,,,2019/07/19 06:00,2020/08/12 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/12 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40258-019-00496-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s40258-019-00496-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Appl Health Econ Health Policy. 2019 Dec;17(6):883-893. doi: 10.1007/s40258-019-00496-1.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The development of cancer thrombosis is dependent on a number of factors including cancer type, stage, various biologic markers, and the use of central venous catheters. In addition, cancer treatment itself may increase thrombotic risk. Tamoxifen increases the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) by two- to sevenfold, while an impact on risk of arterial thrombosis is uncertain. Immunomodulatory imide drugs (IMiDs) such as thalidomide and lenalidomide increase the risk of VTE in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) by about 10-40% when given in combination with glucocorticoids or other chemotherapy agents; the risk of VTE in MM patients treated with IMiD-containing regimens necessitates that such patients receive thromboprophylaxis with aspirin, low-molecular-weight heparin, or warfarin. Among cytotoxic chemotherapy agents, cisplatin, and to a lesser extent fluorouracil, has been described in association with thrombosis. L-asparaginase in treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia is significantly associated with increased thrombosis particularly affecting the CNS, which may be due to acquired antithrombin deficiency; at some centers, plasma infusions or antithrombin replacement is used to mitigate this. Bevacizumab, an inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor, increases arterial and possibly venous thrombotic risk, although the literature is conflicting about the latter. Supportive care agents in cancer care, such as erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, and steroids, also have some impact on thrombosis. This review summarizes the mechanisms by which these and other therapies modulate thrombotic risks and how such risks may be managed.","['Debbie Jiang, M D', 'Alfred Ian Lee, M D']","['Debbie Jiang MD', 'Alfred Ian Lee MD']",,"['Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA. dcjiang@uw.edu.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.', 'Yale School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Res,Cancer treatment and research,8008541,"['0 (Anticoagulants)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)']",IM,,"['Anticoagulants/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/complications/*drug therapy', 'Risk Factors', 'Thrombosis/*drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control', 'Venous Thromboembolism/drug therapy/etiology/prevention & control']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Cancer', 'Chemotherapy', 'Immunomodulatory drugs', 'Procoagulant mechanisms', 'Thrombosis']",2019/07/19 06:00,2019/09/10 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/10 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1007/978-3-030-20315-3_6 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Treat Res. 2019;179:87-101. doi: 10.1007/978-3-030-20315-3_6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In indolent B cell lymphoma, transformation to a more aggressive high-grade lymphoma occurs frequently during the course of disease and is thought to be caused by clonal evolution.

Methods: A total of 92 patients diagnosed CCP were retrospectively reviewed. One patient was from Nanfang Hospital of Southern Medical University, 5 patients were from Tongji Hospital, and 86 patients were from case reports in the PubMed database from 1961 to 2019. Patients and tumor characteristics were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used to analyze the 5-year disease-specific survival (DSS). Results: Most patients (73 cases) were stage I according to the 2018 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) standards. Twelve patients (13.04%) terminated pregnancy once diagnosed. These patients were diagnosed at the mean gestational age (GA) of 11+/-3 weeks, during early pregnancy. For the rest of the patients (80 cases) who continued pregnancy, the mean GA was 35+/-2 weeks at delivery. There was a significant difference in survival whether the treatment was performed once diagnosed or not. The 5-year DSS was 75% in adenocarcinoma (AC), 68.5% in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and 43.7% in the rare subtype. Among the 38 patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT), one patient suffered from spontaneous abortion, and one baby experienced acute myeloid leukemia (AML) ex-FAB (French-American-British)-M7 subtype and received bone marrow transplantation. Other delivered newborns showed no abnormality or malformation. Cox multi-factorial analysis demonstrated that tumor size (2 cm) was an independent overall survival predictor for CCP patients (P<0.05). Conclusions: Tumor size was an independent prognostic factor of survival in CCP patients. Pregnancy has adverse effects on the prognosis of cervical cancer. Personalized treatment is a priority for CCP patients.","['Ma, Jing', 'Yu, Lan', 'Xu, Fan', 'Yi, Hongyan', 'Wei, Wenfei', 'Wu, Peng', 'Wu, Sha', 'Li, Hua', 'Ye, Hong', 'Wang, Wei', 'Xing, Hui', 'Fan, Liangsheng']","['Ma J', 'Yu L', 'Xu F', 'Yi H', 'Wei W', 'Wu P', 'Wu S', 'Li H', 'Ye H', 'Wang W', 'Xing H', 'Fan L']",,"['Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China.', ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, People's Hospital of Three Gorges University, Yichang 443000, China."", 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nanchong Central Hospital, North Sichuan Medical University, Nanchong 637000, China.', 'Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou 510515, China.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China.', 'Cancer Biology Research Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430000, China.', 'Department of Immunology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Southern Medical University, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Proteomics, Guangzhou 510515, China.', ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, People's Hospital of Three Gorges University, Yichang 443000, China."", ""Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, People's Hospital of Three Gorges University, Yichang 443000, China."", 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Xiangyang Hospital, Xiangyang 441000, China.', 'Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou 511436, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Ann Transl Med,Annals of translational medicine,101617978,,,,,PMC6603350,['NOTNLM'],"['Cervical cancer', 'clinicopathologic factor', 'neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT)', 'pregnancy', 'tumor size']",2019/07/19 06:00,2019/07/19 06:01,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/19 06:01 [medline]']","['10.21037/atm.2019.04.76 [doi]', 'atm-07-11-241 [pii]']",ppublish,Ann Transl Med. 2019 Jun;7(11):241. doi: 10.21037/atm.2019.04.76.,,,,,['Conflicts of Interest: The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is accumulating evidence that Hh signaling plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of various haemopoietic malignancies. Particular interest has focused on the role of Hh signaling in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The Hh signaling is increased in BCR-ABL+ve progenitor cells and Hh signaling is further up regulated with disease progression. AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency and types of PTCH1 gene mutations in Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients and to correlate the effect of these mutations on the prognosis and outcome of CML and for predicting the imatinib response in CML patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The study included fifty newly diagnosed CML patients and ten healthy volunteers (the control group) to verify the presence or absence of PTCH1 gene mutation. The patients were subjected to clinical examination, routine laboratory investigations, bone marrow examination, Cytogenetic evaluations of t(9;22) and molecular study of BCR-ABL fusion gene. All participants in this study were subjected to the assessment for the presence of PTCH1 gene mutation by DNA extraction followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of genomic DNA corresponding to exon 23 of PTCH1 gene, purification of amplified PCR product, followed by sequencing analysis for detection of PTCH1 gene exon 23 mutations and the types of these mutations. RESULTS: Four types of mutations of PTCH1 gene were detected in 24 CML patients (48%), three types of them were missence while the fourth type was frame shift mutation. There was no significant association between PTCH1 gene mutation and percent of BCR-ABL fusion genes at level less than 10% at 3 months of treatment, complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) at one year, disease free survival and overall survival. However there was significant association between PTCH1 gene mutation and imatinib failure (P=0.03). CONCLUSION: PTCH1 gene mutation should be considered a promising molecular marker for predicting the probability of imatinib response in CML patients. Hedgehog pathway activation in CML patients can raise a possibility that combinations of ABL and Hh inhibitors might offer a new treatment strategy in CML and might help to effectively cure this disease.","['Abd Elrhman, Heba E', 'Ebian, Huda F']","['Abd Elrhman HE', 'Ebian HF']",,"['Department of Clinical Pathology and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University Zagazig, Egypt.', 'Department of Clinical Pathology and Chemical Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Zagazig University Zagazig, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Blood Res,American journal of blood research,101569577,,,,,PMC6627272,['NOTNLM'],"['CML', 'PTCH1 gene', 'hedgehog pathways']",2019/07/19 06:00,2019/07/19 06:01,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/02/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/19 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Blood Res. 2019 Jun 15;9(2):15-24. eCollection 2019.,,20190615,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein NOXA in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway was upregulated by TIM, while the expression of myeloid cell leukemia 1, an anti-apoptotic protein, was downregulated. In addition, TIM increased the protein expression of the endoplasmic reticulum stress markers inositol-requiring enzyme 1, activating transcription factor 6 and glucose-regulated protein 78. These results suggested that TIM induced ER stress response while activating intrinsic apoptosis. Furthermore, treating osteosarcoma tumor-bearing mice with TIM significantly inhibited the tumor growth in the xenograft animal model.

Moreover, similarities between human and swine physiology suggest that pigs are a superior animal model for immunological studies. However, paucity of experimental tools for a systematic analysis of the immune responses in pigs represent a major disadvantage. To evaluate the pig as a biomedical model and additionally expand the knowledge of rare immune cell populations in swine, we established a multicolor flow cytometry analysis platform of surface marker expression and cellular responses for porcine invariant Natural Killer T cells (iNKT). In humans, iNKT cells are among the first line defenders in various tissues, respond to CD1d-restricted antigens and become rapidly activated. Naive porcine iNKT cells were CD3(+)/CD4(-)/CD8(+) or CD3(+)/CD4(-)/CD8(-) and displayed an effector- or memory-like phenotype (CD25(+)/ICOS(+)/CD5(hi)/CD45RA(-)/CCR7 (+/-) /CD27(+)). Based on their expression of the transcription factors T bet and the iNKT cell-specific promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF), porcine iNKT cells were differentiated into functional subsets. Analogous to human iNKT cells, in vitro stimulation of porcine leukocytes with the CD1d ligand alpha-galactosylceramide resulted in rapid iNKT cell proliferation, evidenced by an increase in frequency and Ki-67 expression. Moreover, this approach revealed CD25, CD5, ICOS, and the major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) as activation markers on porcine iNKT cells. Activated iNKT cells also expressed interferon-gamma, upregulated perforin expression, and displayed degranulation. In steady state, iNKT cell frequency was highest in newborn piglets and decreased with age. Upon infection with two viruses of high relevance to swine and humans, iNKT cells expanded. Animals infected with African swine fever virus displayed an increase of iNKT cell frequency in peripheral blood, regional lymph nodes, and lungs. During Influenza A virus infection, iNKT cell percentage increased in blood, lung lymph nodes, and broncho-alveolar lavage. Our in-depth characterization of porcine iNKT cells contributes to a better understanding of porcine immune responses, thereby facilitating the design of innovative interventions against infectious diseases. Moreover, we provide new evidence that endorses the suitability of the pig as a biomedical model for iNKT cell research.","['Schafer, Alexander', 'Huhr, Jane', 'Schwaiger, Theresa', 'Dorhoi, Anca', 'Mettenleiter, Thomas C', 'Blome, Sandra', 'Schroder, Charlotte', 'Blohm, Ulrike']","['Schafer A', 'Huhr J', 'Schwaiger T', 'Dorhoi A', 'Mettenleiter TC', 'Blome S', 'Schroder C', 'Blohm U']",,"['Institute of Immunology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Animal Facilities and Biorisk Management, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.', 'Institute of Molecular Virology and Cell Biology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.', 'Institute of Diagnostic Virology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.', 'Department of Experimental Animal Facilities and Biorisk Management, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.', 'Institute of Immunology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut, Greifswald-Insel Riems, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Front Immunol,Frontiers in immunology,101560960,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, CD1d)', '0 (Galactosylceramides)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (alpha-galactosylceramide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology/metabolism', 'Antigens, CD1d/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/immunology', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Galactosylceramides/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon-gamma/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/cytology/immunology/metabolism', 'Models, Animal', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*immunology/metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/immunology/metabolism', 'Swine', 'Virus Diseases/*immunology/metabolism/virology']",PMC6611438,['NOTNLM'],"['*African swine fever virus', '*T cells', '*biomedical model', '*iNKT cells', '*influenza A virus', '*pig']",2019/07/19 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2018/10/29 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]']",['10.3389/fimmu.2019.01380 [doi]'],epublish,Front Immunol. 2019 Jun 18;10:1380. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.01380. eCollection 2019.,,20190618,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Material and methods: The study group consisted of 100 close relatives supporting leukaemia patients (66 women and 34 men). The study included close relatives who supported patients with the diagnosis of leukaemia. A standardized interview and the questionnaires CISS, SES, SOC-29, STAI, and the Questionnaire of Perceived Control of Life were used in the study. Results: The research results show that 65% of the respondents indicate the illness of a close relative as the main source of stress. Among the respondents, the emotion-oriented style (beta = 0.301, p = 0.008) and anxious personality (beta = 0.560, p = 0.000) proved to be predictors of stress. Stress is counteracted by a sense of coherence (beta = -0.294, p = 0.028).

The lesions occurring in the oral cavity caused by medications and chemotherapy may also be directly related to hematological and systemic disorders. The aim of this study was to examine the levels of selected pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in saliva and serum of both patients undergoing remission maintenance and those after the cessation of therapy who reported to the hematology clinic of the Pediatric University Hospital in Lublin. The results were later analyzed in relation to the frequency of oral lesions and subjective intensity of oral complaints. The study revealed significant differences in salivary and serum concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-10 between test and control groups. Oral lesions were more frequent in patients receiving therapy compared to the control group.

LSCs are defined by their capacity to initiate leukaemia in immunocompromised mice(4). However, this precludes analyses of their interaction with lymphocytes as components of anti-tumour immunity(5), which LSCs must escape to induce cancer. Here we demonstrate that stemness and immune evasion are closely intertwined in AML. Using xenografts of human AML as well as syngeneic mouse models of leukaemia, we show that ligands of the danger detector NKG2D-a critical mediator of anti-tumour immunity by cytotoxic lymphocytes, such as NK cells(6-9)-are generally expressed on bulk AML cells but not on LSCs. AML cells with LSC properties can be isolated by their lack of expression of NKG2D ligands (NKG2DLs) in both CD34-expressing and non-CD34-expressing cases of AML. AML cells that express NKG2DLs are cleared by NK cells, whereas NKG2DL-negative leukaemic cells isolated from the same individual escape cell killing by NK cells. These NKG2DL-negative AML cells show an immature morphology, display molecular and functional stemness characteristics, and can initiate serially re-transplantable leukaemia and survive chemotherapy in patient-derived xenotransplant models. Mechanistically, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 (PARP1) represses expression of NKG2DLs. Genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of PARP1 induces NKG2DLs on the LSC surface but not on healthy or pre-leukaemic cells. Treatment with PARP1 inhibitors, followed by transfer of polyclonal NK cells, suppresses leukaemogenesis in patient-derived xenotransplant models. In summary, our data link the LSC concept to immune escape and provide a strong rationale for targeting therapy-resistant LSCs by PARP1 inhibition, which renders them amenable to control by NK cells in vivo.","['Paczulla, Anna M', 'Rothfelder, Kathrin', 'Raffel, Simon', 'Konantz, Martina', 'Steinbacher, Julia', 'Wang, Hui', 'Tandler, Claudia', 'Mbarga, Marcelle', 'Schaefer, Thorsten', 'Falcone,

LW-213, a newly synthesized flavonoid compound, was found to exert antitumor effects against breast cancer through inducing G2/M phase arrest. We investigated whether LW-213 exerted anti-CML effects and the underlying mechanisms. We showed that LW-213 inhibited the growth of human CML cell lines K562 and imatinid-resistant K562 (K562r) in dose- and time-dependent manners with IC50 values at the low mumol/L levels. LW-213 (5, 10, 15 muM) caused G2/M phase arrest of K562 and K562r cells via reducing the activity of G2/M phase transition-related proteins Cyclin B1/CDC2 complex. LW-213 treatment induced apoptosis of K562 and K562r cells via inhibiting the expression of CDK9 through lysosome degradation, thus leading to the suppression of RNAPII phosphorylation, down-regulation of a short-lived anti-apoptic protein MCL-1. The lysosome inhibitor, NH4Cl, could reverse the anti-CML effects of LW-213 including CDK9 degradation and apoptosis. LW-213 treatment also degraded the downstream proteins of BCR-ABL1, such as oncoproteins AKT, STAT3/5 in CML cells, which was blocked by NH4Cl. In primary CML cells and CD34(+) stem cells, LW-213 maintained its pro-apoptotic activity. In a K562 cells-bearing mice model, administration of LW-213 (2.5, 5.0 mg/kg, ip, every other day for 4 weeks) dose-dependently prolonged the survival duration, and significantly suppressed huCD45(+) cell infiltration and expression of MCL-1 in spleens. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LW-213 may be an efficient agent for CML treatment.","['Liu, Xiao', 'Hu, Po', 'Li, Hui', 'Yu, Xiao-Xuan', 'Wang, Xiang-Yuan', 'Qing, Ying-Jie', 'Wang, Zhan-Yu', 'Wang, Hong-Zheng', 'Zhu, Meng-Yuan', 'Guo, Qing-Long', 'Hui, Hui']","['Liu X', 'Hu P', 'Li H', 'Yu XX', 'Wang XY', 'Qing YJ', 'Wang ZY', 'Wang HZ', 'Zhu MY', 'Guo QL', 'Hui H']",,"['State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China. anticancer_drug@163.com.', 'State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Carcinogenesis and Intervention, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, 210009, China. moyehh@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Acta Pharmacol Sin,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,100956087,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Flavonoids)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Flavonoids/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/pharmacology', 'Inhibitory Concentration 50', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*drug therapy/pathology', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, Nude', 'Mice, SCID', 'Time Factors']",PMC7468447,['NOTNLM'],"['CDK9', 'G2/M phase arrest', 'LW-213', 'MCL-1', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'lysosome-dependent apoptosis']",2019/07/19 06:00,2020/10/24 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/03/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41401-019-0270-4 [doi]', '10.1038/s41401-019-0270-4 [pii]']",ppublish,Acta Pharmacol Sin. 2020 Feb;41(2):249-259. doi: 10.1038/s41401-019-0270-4.

These diseases arise from one or several infected CD4(+) T cells among thousands acquiring proliferation and survival advantages and ultimately becoming pathogenic. Given the low incidence of HTLV-1-associated diseases among carriers, such cellular evolutionary processes appear to occur rarely. Therefore, infectious spread of HTLV-1 within the T-cell population may be one underlying factor influencing disease development. Free HTLV-1 virions are poorly infectious, so infection of T cells relies on direct contact between infected and target cells. Following contact, virions pass to target cells through a virological synapse or cellular conduits or are transferred to target cells within an extracellular matrix. Lymphocyte functioning antigen 1 (LFA-1) on the surface of the target cell engaging with its ligand, ICAM-1, on the surface of the infected cell (effector cell) initiates and stabilizes cell-cell contact for infection. We found that stable expression of an HTLV-1 accessory protein, HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ), in Jurkat T cells increases homotypic aggregation. This phenotype was attributed to elevated ICAM-1 expression in the presence of HBZ. Using a single-cycle replication-dependent luciferase assay, we found that HBZ expression in Jurkat cells (used as effector cells) increases HTLV-1 infection. Despite this effect, HBZ could not replace the critical infection-related functions of the HTLV-1 regulatory protein Tax. However, in HTLV-1-infected T cells, knockdown of HBZ expression did lead to a decrease in infection efficiency. These overall results suggest that HBZ contributes to HTLV-1 infectivity.IMPORTANCE Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes a variety of diseases, ranging from a fatal form of leukemia to immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. These diseases occur rarely, arising from one or a small subset of virally infected cells infrequently evolving into a pathogenic state. Thus, the process of HTLV-1 cell-to-cell transmission within the host helps influence the probability of disease development. HTLV-1 primarily infects T cells and initially spreads within this cell population when virally infected T cells dock to uninfected target T cells and then transfer HTLV-1 virus particles to the target cells. Here we found that the viral protein HTLV-1 bZIP factor (HBZ) promotes infectivity. HBZ accomplishes this task by increasing the surface abundance of a cellular adhesion protein known as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), which helps initiate and stabilize contact (docking) between infected and target T cells. These results define a novel and unexpected function of HBZ, diverging from its defined functions in cellular survival and proliferation.","['Fazio, Ana Laura', 'Kendle, Wesley', 'Hoang, Kimson', 'Korleski, Erica', 'Lemasson, Isabelle', 'Polakowski, Nicholas']","['Fazio AL', 'Kendle W', 'Hoang K', 'Korleski E', 'Lemasson I', 'Polakowski N']",,"['Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA lemassoni@ecu.edu polakowskin@ecu.edu.', 'Brody School of Medicine, Department of Microbiology and Immunology, East Carolina University, Greenville, North Carolina, USA lemassoni@ecu.edu polakowskin@ecu.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors)', '0 (HBZ protein, human T-cell leukemia virus type I)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '126547-89-5 (Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1)']",IM,,"['Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Cell Aggregation', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Humans', 'Intercellular Adhesion Molecule-1/*biosynthesis', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*virology', '*Up-Regulation']",PMC6744244,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cell-to cell infection', '*HBZ', '*HTLV-1', '*ICAM-1', '*retrovirus']",2019/07/19 06:00,2020/06/03 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00608-19 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00608-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2019 Sep 12;93(19). pii: JVI.00608-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00608-19.

HTLV-1 orf-I encodes two proteins, p8 and p12, whose functions in humans are to counteract innate and adaptive responses and to support viral transmission. However, the in vivo requirements for orf-I expression vary in different animal models. In macaques, the ablation of orf-I expression by mutation of its ATG initiation codon abolishes the infectivity of the molecular clone HTLV-1p12KO In rabbits, HTLV-1p12KO is infective and persists efficiently. We used humanized mouse models to assess the infectivity of both wild-type HTLV-1 (HTLV-1WT) and HTLV-1p12KO We found that NOD/SCID/gammaC (-/-) c-kit(+) mice engrafted with human tissues 1 day after birth (designated NSG-1d mice) were highly susceptible to infection by HTLV-1WT, with a syndrome characterized by the rapid polyclonal proliferation and infiltration of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells into vital organs, weight loss, and death. HTLV-1 clonality studies revealed the presence of multiple clones of low abundance, confirming the polyclonal expansion of HTLV-1-infected cells in vivo HTLV-1p12KO infection in a bone marrow-liver-thymus (BLT) mouse model prone to graft-versus-host disease occurred only following reversion of the orf-I initiation codon mutation within weeks after exposure and was associated with high levels of HTLV-1 DNA in blood and the expansion of CD4(+) CD25(+) T cells. Thus, the incomplete reconstitution of the human immune system in BLT mice may provide a window of opportunity for HTLV-1 replication and the selection of viral variants with greater fitness.IMPORTANCE Humanized mice constitute a useful model for studying the HTLV-1-associated polyclonal proliferation of CD4(+) T cells and viral integration sites in the human genome. The rapid death of infected animals, however, appears to preclude the clonal selection typically observed in human ATLL, which normally develops in 2 to 5% of individuals infected with HTLV-1. Nevertheless, the expansion of multiple clones of low abundance in these humanized mice mirrors the early phase of HTLV-1 infection in humans, providing a useful model to investigate approaches to inhibit virus-induced CD4(+) T cell proliferation.","['Galli, Veronica', 'Nixon, Christopher C', 'Strbo, Natasa', 'Artesi, Maria', 'de Castro-Amarante, Maria F', 'McKinnon, Katherine', 'Fujikawa, Dai', 'Omsland, Maria', 'Washington-Parks, Robyn', 'Romero, Laura', 'Caruso, Breanna', 'Durkin, Keith', 'Brown, Sophia', 'Karim, Baktiar', 'Vaccari, Monica', 'Jacobson, Steve', 'Zack, Jerome A', 'Van den Broeke, Anne', 'Pise-Masison, Cynthia', 'Franchini, Genoveffa']","['Galli V', 'Nixon CC', 'Strbo N', 'Artesi M', 'de Castro-Amarante MF', 'McKinnon K', 'Fujikawa D', 'Omsland M', 'Washington-Parks R', 'Romero L', 'Caruso B', 'Durkin K', 'Brown S', 'Karim B', 'Vaccari M', 'Jacobson S', 'Zack JA', 'Van den Broeke A', 'Pise-Masison C', 'Franchini G']",,"['Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Free University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Vaccine Branch Flow Cytometry Core, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Miami, Florida, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Free University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Vaccine Branch Flow Cytometry Core, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Pathology/Histotechnology Laboratory, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, Maryland, USA.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Viral Immunology Section, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA.', 'Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Molecular Genetics, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, USA.', 'Laboratory of Experimental Hematology, Jules Bordet Institute, Free University of Brussels, Brussels, Belgium.', 'Unit of Animal Genomics, GIGA, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA cynthia.masison@mail.nih.gov franchig@mail.nih.gov.', 'Animal Models and Retroviral Vaccines Section, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA cynthia.masison@mail.nih.gov franchig@mail.nih.gov.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins)', '0 (p12I protein, Human T-lymphotropic virus 1)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/*virology', '*Cell Proliferation', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Disease Transmission, Infectious', 'HTLV-I Infections/*pathology/*virology', '*Host-Pathogen Interactions', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*growth & development', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, SCID', 'Viral Regulatory and Accessory Proteins/deficiency/*metabolism']",PMC6744231,['NOTNLM'],"['*CD4+ CD25+', '*HTLV-1', '*humanized mouse models', '*orf-I', '*viral replication']",2019/07/19 06:00,2020/06/03 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/04/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/03 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['JVI.00565-19 [pii]', '10.1128/JVI.00565-19 [doi]']",epublish,J Virol. 2019 Sep 12;93(19). pii: JVI.00565-19. doi: 10.1128/JVI.00565-19.

Efficient strategies and targets need to be identified to overcome T-cell exhaustion and further improve overall responses in the clinic. Here, we took advantage of the Emu-TCL1 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and B16 melanoma mouse models to assess the role of the homophilic cell-surface receptor SLAMF6 as an immune-checkpoint regulator. The transfer of SLAMF6(+) Emu-TCL1 cells into SLAMF6(-/-) recipients, in contrast to wild-type (WT) recipients, significantly induced expansion of a PD-1(+) subpopulation among CD3(+)CD44(+)CD8(+) T cells, which had impaired cytotoxic functions. Conversely, administering anti-SLAMF6 significantly reduced the leukemic burden in Emu-TCL1 recipient WT mice concomitantly with a loss of PD-1(+)CD3(+)CD44(+)CD8(+) T cells with significantly increased effector functions. Anti-SLAMF6 significantly reduced leukemic burden in the peritoneal cavity, a niche where antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is impaired, possibly through activation of CD8(+) T cells. Targeting of SLAMF6 affected tumor growth not only in B cell-related leukemia and lymphomas but also in nonhematopoietic tumors such as B16 melanoma, where SLAMF6 is not expressed.

METHODS: We conducted an environmental scan of cancer survivor cohorts to determine the scope and scale of information collected on demographic, biopsychosocial, and selected clinical variables from cancer survivors. Cohorts were eligible for inclusion in the environmental scan if the study was conducted in the United States, reported in English, and consisted of data collected from cancer survivors postdiagnosis and followed for at least 1 year. RESULTS: Out of the 131 cohorts identified, 62 were eligible. There were 23 cancer sites represented, and more than half of the studies included breast cancer survivors (n = 34). The next most commonly included cancers were leukemia (n = 22) and lymphoma (n = 23). The majority (n = 59) collected information on clinical characteristics and basic diagnostic information, patient demographic characteristics (n = 57), patient-reported symptoms (n = 44), lifestyle (n = 45), and psychologic characteristics (n = 42). Half collected biospecimens (n = 35) and biomarkers (n = 35); fewer collected CAM use (n = 19) and social characteristics (n = 27). CONCLUSIONS: Extensive data are available in cancer cohorts to study important questions relevant to cancer survivors. Cohorts should consider collecting information on social and environmental factors, as well as biospecimen collection and biomarker analyses, and should include survivors from cancer sites less likely to be studied. IMPACT: This information can assist researchers in understanding the types of information currently being gathered from cancer survivors for further analysis and identify areas where more research is needed.","['Krok-Schoen, Jessica L', 'Bernardo, Brittany M', 'Elena, Joanne W', 'Green, Paige A', 'Hoover, Elise', 'Peng, Juan', 'Anderson, Garnet L', 'Caan, Bette', 'Johnson, Lisa G', 'Paskett, Electra D']","['Krok-Schoen JL', 'Bernardo BM', 'Elena JW', 'Green PA', 'Hoover E', 'Peng J', 'Anderson GL', 'Caan B', 'Johnson LG', 'Paskett ED']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-2484-5887', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7886-8924', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5087-7837']","['Division of Medical Dietetics and Health Sciences, School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Basic Biobehavioral and Psychological Science Branch, Behavioral Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, NCI, NIH, Bethesda, Maryland.', 'Center for Biostatistics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Division of Research, Kaiser Permanente of Northern California, Oakland, California.', 'Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. electra.paskett@osumc.edu.', 'Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, Department of Internal Medicine, College of Medicine, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Epidemiology, College of Public Health, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev,"Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology",9200608,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cancer Survivors/*psychology', 'Child', 'Cohort Studies', 'Comorbidity', 'Demography', 'Environment', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*pathology/*psychology/therapy', 'Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Psychology', 'Quality of Life', 'Social Environment', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Young Adult']",PMC6774809,,,2019/07/19 06:00,2020/09/25 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2018/05/16 00:00 [received]', '2018/07/25 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['1055-9965.EPI-18-0541 [pii]', '10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0541 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2019 Oct;28(10):1621-1641. doi: 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-18-0541.

A study using real-world data in two cohorts to determine how well they are actually working in practice compared with bone marrow transplants.,98-102,10.1136/bmjebm-2019-111226 [doi],"With the increasing use of new regulatory tools, like the Food and Drug Administration's breakthrough designation, there are increasing challenges for European health technology assessors (HTAs) to make an accurate assessment of the long-term value and performance of chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapies, particularly for orphan conditions, such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. The aim of this study was to demonstrate a novel methodology harnessing longitudinal real-world data, extracted from the electronic health records of a medical centre functioning as a clinical trial site, to develop an accurate analysis of the performance of CAR-T compared with the next-best treatment option, namely allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplant (HCT). The study population comprised 43 subjects in two cohorts: 29 who had undergone HCT treatment and 14 who had undergone CAR-T therapy. The 3-year relapse-free survival probability was 46% (95% CI: 08% to 79%) in the CAR-T cohort and 68% (95% CI: 46% to 83%) in the HCT cohort. To explain the lower RFS probability in the CAR-T cohort compared with the HCT cohort, the authors hypothesised that the CAR-T cohort had a far higher level of disease burden. This was validated by log-rank test analysis (p=0.0001) and confirmed in conversations with practitioners at the study site. The authors are aware that the small populations in this study will be seen as limiting the generalisability of the findings to some readers. However, in consultation with many European HTAs and regulators, there is broad agreement that this methodology warrants further investigation with a larger study.","['Schulthess, Duane', 'Gassull, Daniel', 'Makady, Amr', 'Ludlow, Anna', 'Rothman, Brian', 'Have, Pieter Ten', 'Wu, Yiyang', 'Ekstrom, Leeland', 'Minnema, Monique', 'Jagasia, Madan']","['Schulthess D', 'Gassull D', 'Makady A', 'Ludlow A', 'Rothman B', 'Have PT', 'Wu Y', 'Ekstrom L', 'Minnema M', 'Jagasia M']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2886-2975'],"['Vital Transformation, BVBA, Wezembeek-Oppem, Belgium.', 'Vital Transformation, BVBA, Wezembeek-Oppem, Belgium.', 'Zorginstituut Nederland, Diemen, The Netherlands.', 'Vital Transformation, BVBA, Wezembeek-Oppem, Belgium.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Zorginstituut Nederland, Diemen, The Netherlands.', 'Nashville Biosciences, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'Nashville Biosciences, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.', 'UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMJ Evid Based Med,BMJ evidence-based medicine,101719009,"['0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)']",IM,,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen', 'T-Lymphocytes']",PMC8165150,['NOTNLM'],"['health economics', 'leukaemia', 'paediatric oncology', 'quality in health care']",2019/07/19 06:00,2021/11/26 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/11/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']","['bmjebm-2019-111226 [pii]', '10.1136/bmjebm-2019-111226 [doi]']",ppublish,BMJ Evid Based Med. 2021 Jun;26(3):98-102. doi: 10.1136/bmjebm-2019-111226.

METHODS: A total of 278 children diagnosed with ALL between December 2015 and February 2018 were systematically treated according to the Chinese Children's Leukemia Group-ALL 2008 protocol (CCLG-ALL 2008). The patients were divided into an IKZF1-deleted group and a control group according to the presence or absence of IKZF1. The IKZF1-deleted group was treated with the regimen for high-risk group (HR) in the CCLG-ALL 2008 protocol, while the control group received different intensities of chemotherapy according to clinical risk classification. The clinical features and event-free survival rate (EFS) were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: A total of 24 (8.6%) cases of 278 children were found to have large deletions of exons of the IKZF1 gene. The IKZF1-deleted group had significantly higher proportions of cases with white blood cell count >/=50x10(9)/L at initial diagnosis, BCR-ABL1 fusion gene positive, minimal residual disease >/=10% on the 15th day of induction remission treatment, minimal residual disease-high risk and clinical risk classification-high risk compared with the control group (P<0.05). The 3-year EFS rate (76%+/-10%) in the IKZF1-deleted group was lower than that in the control group (84%+/-4%), but with no significant difference between the two groups (P=0.282). The estimated 3-year EFS rate in the IKZF1-deleted-non-HR group (actually treated with the chemotherapy regimen for HR in the CCLG-ALL 2008 protocol) was 82%+/-12%, which was lower than that in the control-non-HR group (86%+/-5%), but there was no significant difference (P=0.436). CONCLUSIONS: ALL children with IKZF1 deletion have worse early treatment response, and increasing the intensity of chemotherapy might improve the prognosis.","['Zheng, Yong-Zhi', 'Li, Jian', 'LE, Shao-Hua', 'Zheng, Hao', 'Hua, Xue-Ling', 'Chen, Zai-Sheng', 'Hu, Jian-Da']","['Zheng YZ', 'Li J', 'LE SH', 'Zheng H', 'Hua XL', 'Chen ZS', 'Hu JD']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology, Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, Fuzhou 350001, China. 1354113723@qq.com.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,100909956,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",,,"['Disease-Free Survival', 'Gene Deletion', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Prognosis']",PMC7389101,,,2019/07/19 06:00,2019/07/25 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/25 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7499/j.issn.1008-8830.2019.07.014 [pii]'],ppublish,Zhongguo Dang Dai Er Ke Za Zhi. 2019 Jul;21(7):690-695.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The number of leukemia cases has dramatically increased from 297,000 to 437, 033 cases worldwide. As result, the the Saudi Cancer Registry ramked leukemia as the 5th type of cancer cases among both genders in Saudi Arabia. Data on the trend and incidence of leukemnia in Saudi Arabia is lacking. This study aims to report the trend and incidence of leukemia in Saudi Arabia using available data from the Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR), as a population-based cancer registry in the country over a period of 15 years (1999-2013). METHODS: Data of registered leukemia cases between years 1999-2013 were retrieved from the Saudi Council of Health, Saudi Cancer Registry. Data were coded using the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O). Main and essential variables were retrieved such as age, sex, years of incidence, residency, and histopathological type of leukemia. RESULTS: A total of 8712 cases of leukemia were analyzed in this study, 57.2% were males and 42.8% were females. Around 33.6% of cases were from the central region of Saudi Arabia. The most diagnosed type of leukemia was the Precursor B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (18.7%), followed by Precursor cell lymphoblastic leukemia, NOS (17.3%) with equal percentage of reported cases between males and females in these subsets. CONCLUSION: Ove a period of 15 years, the trend of leukemia showed the likelihood of increase in rate particularly in males with highest incidence reported from the central region of Saudi Arabia which needs more investigation. Resources for diagnosis and treatment should be planned with more orientation toward the accurate diagnosis of leukemia to minimize the number of ""none specific diagnosis"".","['Bawazir, Amen', 'Al-Zamel, Nouf', 'Amen, Abeer', 'Akiel, Maaged A', 'Alhawiti, Naif M', 'Alshehri, Ali']","['Bawazir A', 'Al-Zamel N', 'Amen A', 'Akiel MA', 'Alhawiti NM', 'Alshehri A']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6308-3136'],"['College of Public Health and Health Informatics, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. bawazir56@hotmail.com.', 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. bawazir56@hotmail.com.', 'King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Dentistry, Aden University, Aden, Yemen.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, College of Applied Medical Sciences, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'King Abdullah International Medical Research Center (KAIMRC), Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.', 'College of Public Health and Health Informatics, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gray Matter', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/*diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prevalence', 'Prognosis', 'Registries', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Saudi Arabia/epidemiology', 'Young Adult']",PMC6637507,['NOTNLM'],"['Burden', 'Cancer', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia', 'Saudi Arabia']",2019/07/19 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/01/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5897-5 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5897-5 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Jul 17;19(1):703. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5897-5.,,20190717,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed the data of patients with hematological malignancies who received a diagnosis of CDC at a medical center in Taiwan between 2008 and 2013. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients (32 men and 29 women) were diagnosed with CDC. The median age was 51 years (range: 18-83). The overall incidence of CDC was 1.53 per 100 patient-years in patients with hematological malignancies between 2008 and 2013. The highest incidence of CDC was 4.3 per 100 patient-years for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, followed by 3.6 for acute myeloid leukemia. We detected 3 (4.9%) proven, 13 (21.3%) probable, and 45 (73.8%) possible cases of CDC. A total of 13 patients had positive blood cultures for Candida species: C. tropicalis (8), C. albicans (2), C. glabrata (2), and C. famata (1). The median duration of antifungal treatment was 96 days (range: 7-796 days). Serial imaging studies revealed that the resolution rate of CDC was 30.0% at 3 months and 54.3% at 6 months. Five patients (8.2%) had residual lesions that persisted beyond one year. A multivariate analysis of the 90-day outcome revealed that shock was the only independent prognostic factor of 90-day survival in patients with CDC. CONCLUSION: The incidence of CDC did not decrease between 2008 and 2013. Patients with acute leukemia had a higher risk of CDC than those with other hematological malignancies. Imaging studies conducted at 6 months after diagnosis revealed that only half of the patients showed complete resolution.

Methods: The eligible patients treated with decitabine-based chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. Responses and long-term survival were calculated and their correlation with clinical characteristics was analyzed. Minimal residual disease (MRD) detected by flow cytometry (FCM) after the induction therapy was measured, and the association with prognosis was explored. Results: Fifty-five newly diagnosed AML patients were enrolled. The overall response rate (ORR) was 80.0%, with a complete remission (CR) rate of 63.64% and partial remission (PR) rate of 16.36%. Grade 4 hematological toxicity was common, and the incidence of infections was 83.64%, with 18.18% of patients suffered from severe infections. No serious bleeding or non-hematological adverse events occurred. Treatment-related mortality was 3.64%. The median overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 17.0 (13.7-20.3) months and 17.0 (10.2-23.8) months, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that an advanced age (>/= 60 years) and higher MRD (>/= 1.34%) after induction therapy were adverse prognostic factors for patients who had achieved CR. Conclusions: Decitabine-based chemotherapy may be a suitable therapeutic alternative for newly diagnosed AML patients who are unfit for intensive chemotherapy. An advanced age (>/= 60 years) and higher MRD (>/= 1.34%) were considered adverse prognostic factors.","['Tan, Yehui', 'Fu, Yu', 'Liu, Chunshui', 'Sun, Jingnan', 'Liu, Shanshan', 'Lin, Hai', 'Liu, Qiuju', 'Yang, Yanping', 'Li, Yuying', 'Su, Long', 'Gao, Sujun']","['Tan Y', 'Fu Y', 'Liu C', 'Sun J', 'Liu S', 'Lin H', 'Liu Q', 'Yang Y', 'Li Y', 'Su L', 'Gao S']",,"[""a Department of Hematology , The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Hematology , The First Hospital of Jilin University , Changchun , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '143011-72-7 (Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)', '776B62CQ27 (Decitabine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,,"['Aclarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Decitabine/administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Disease-Free Survival', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor/administration & dosage', 'Hematologic Diseases/chemically induced', 'Homoharringtonine/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm, Residual', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Treatment Outcome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'decitabine', 'induction therapy', 'low/reduced-dose chemotherapy', 'minimal residual disease', 'prognosis', 'response rate']",2019/07/19 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2019.1642552 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2019 Dec;24(1):552-558. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2019.1642552.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Method: This study retrospectively analyses the molecular biological characteristics, laboratory characteristics and clinical data of four patients with CNL that were admitted in the second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University from May 2014 to October 2016. On the basis of the molecular biological data of 22 patients with CNL and 4 patients with CNL, we further analysed the characteristics of CNL molecular mutation. Results: Two out of the four patients with CNL were carriers of colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) mutation, among which two were carriers of CSF3R T618I mutation combined with ASXL1 mutation and SETBP1 mutation, and two were only carriers of JAK2 V617F mutation. According to the molecular biological data of 22 patients with CNL, 20 patients were positive for CSF3R mutation. Two patients were positive for JAK2 V617F mutation. A total of 10 patients were positive for SETBP1 mutation which was correlated with the CSF3R T618I gene mutation (P = 0.03). A total of 13 patients were positive for ASXL1 mutation. No patients carried mutations in ASXL2 and MPL genes. Conclusion and Discussion: CSF3R mutation is the main tumorigenic mutation in CNL, in which CSF3R T618I mutation is the main mutation, and an extremely small number of CNL patients may be caused by JAK2 V617F mutation. SETBP1 and ASXL1 are the most common concomitant mutations in CNL with CSF3R mutation, and SETBP1 and CSF3R T618Imutations may have a certain correlation.","['Yin, Bin', 'Chen, XiuHua', 'Gao, Feng', 'Li, Juan', 'Wang, Hong Wei']","['Yin B', 'Chen X', 'Gao F', 'Li J', 'Wang HW']",,"[""a Institute of Hematology , the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University , Taiyuan , People's Republic of China."", ""b Clinical Medical Laboratory Center , Children's Hospital of Shanxi , Taiyuan , People's Republic of China."", ""a Institute of Hematology , the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University , Taiyuan , People's Republic of China."", ""a Institute of Hematology , the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University , Taiyuan , People's Republic of China."", ""a Institute of Hematology , the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University , Taiyuan , People's Republic of China."", ""a Institute of Hematology , the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University , Taiyuan , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (ASXL1 protein, human)', '0 (ASXL2 protein, human)', '0 (CALR protein, human)', '0 (CSF3R protein, human)', '0 (Calreticulin)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', '0 (SETBP1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (JAK2 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Janus Kinase 2)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Blood Cell Count', 'Calreticulin/genetics', 'Carrier Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Janus Kinase 2/genetics', 'Leukemia, Neutrophilic, Chronic/blood/complications/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Nuclear Proteins/genetics', 'Receptors, Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenomegaly/etiology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic neutrophilic leukaemia', 'Myeloproliferative neoplasm', 'mutation']",2019/07/19 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2019.1642554 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2019 Dec;24(1):538-543. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2019.1642554.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a severe hematological disease, and it is essential to find out new biomarkers to better diagnose and cure ALL due to the development of chemo-resistance and low cure rate in adult ALL. This study aims to describe the role of global methylation and demethylation intermediates in ALL. Methods: The levels of global methylation and its oxidation products in the peripheral blood (PB) of ALL patients and healthy controls were determined by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Results: In this study, we described that global 5-mC, 5-hmC and 5-fC levels were dysregulated in ALL, and they were associated with clinical characteristics and genetic abnormalities of ALL patients. Interestingly, 5-mC and 5-hmC were closely related to inflammation, and the levels of 5-hmC were inversely correlated with C-Reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin. Finally, 5-mC and 5-hmC were associated with complete remission (CR), and 5-hmC was revealed as an independent prognostic indicator for ALL. Conclusion: This study described a novel role for global methylation and demethylation intermediates in ALL detection and prognosis, and provided new clue to distinguish high-risk patients and improve the curative effect on ALL patients.","['Cao, Lin-Lin', 'Liu, Hangqi', 'Yue, Zhihong', 'Pei, Lin', 'Wang, Hui', 'Jia, Mei']","['Cao LL', 'Liu H', 'Yue Z', 'Pei L', 'Wang H', 'Jia M']",,"[""a Department of Clinical Laboratory , Peking University People's Hospital , Beijing , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Clinical Laboratory , Peking University People's Hospital , Beijing , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Clinical Laboratory , Peking University People's Hospital , Beijing , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Clinical Laboratory , Peking University People's Hospital , Beijing , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Clinical Laboratory , Peking University People's Hospital , Beijing , People's Republic of China."", ""a Department of Clinical Laboratory , Peking University People's Hospital , Beijing , People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematology,"Hematology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",9708388,"['0 (5-carboxylcytosine)', '0 (5-formylcytosine)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '1123-95-1 (5-hydroxymethylcytosine)', '6R795CQT4H (5-Methylcytosine)', '8J337D1HZY (Cytosine)']",IM,,"['5-Methylcytosine/analogs & derivatives/blood', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/blood', 'Cell Lineage', 'Child', 'Cytosine/analogs & derivatives/blood', '*DNA Methylation', 'DNA, Neoplasm/chemistry/*genetics', 'Demethylation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*genetics', 'ROC Curve', 'Remission Induction', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['5-fC', '5-hmC', '5-mC', 'Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'ELISA', 'complete remission', 'demethylation', 'methylation']",2019/07/19 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/16078454.2019.1642563 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematology. 2019 Dec;24(1):567-576. doi: 10.1080/16078454.2019.1642563.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHOD: A repeated-measures design was used to evaluate symptoms experienced by 218 children during treatment. A symptom cluster (fatigue, pain, and nausea) was explored over four time periods: initiation of post-induction therapy, 4 and 8 months into post-induction therapy, and the beginning of maintenance therapy (12 months postinduction). F2-isoprostanes and IL-8 were evaluated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected at baseline (diagnosis) and then at the four time periods. The longitudinal relationships of these biomarkers with the symptom cluster were examined using the longitudinal parallel process. RESULTS: Pain and fatigue levels were highest during the post-induction phases of treatment and decreased slightly during maintenance therapy, while nausea scores were relatively stable. Even in the later phases of treatment, children continued to experience symptoms. CSF levels of the biomarkers increased during the post-induction phases of treatment. Early increases in the biomarkers were associated with more severe symptoms during the same period; patients who had increased biomarkers over time also experienced more severe symptoms over time. CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal that children experienced symptoms throughout the course of leukemia treatment and support hypothesized longitudinal relationships of oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers with symptom severity. Activation of the biomarker pathways during treatment may explain underlying mechanisms of symptom experiences and identify which children are at risk for severe symptoms.","['Hockenberry, Marilyn J', 'Pan, Wei', 'Scheurer, Michael E', 'Hooke, Mary C', 'Taylor, Olga', 'Koerner, Kari', 'Montgomery, David', 'Whitman, Susan', 'Mitby, Pauline', 'Moore, Ida']","['Hockenberry MJ', 'Pan W', 'Scheurer ME', 'Hooke MC', 'Taylor O', 'Koerner K', 'Montgomery D', 'Whitman S', 'Mitby P', 'Moore I']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2410-9935'],"['1 School of Nursing, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', '1 School of Nursing, Duke University, Durham, NC, USA.', '2 Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', ""3 Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Houston, TX, USA."", '4 School of Nursing, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA.', '2 Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.', ""3 Texas Children's Cancer and Hematology Centers, Houston, TX, USA."", '5 College of Nursing, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', '5 College of Nursing, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', '5 College of Nursing, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.', ""6 Children's Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA."", '5 College of Nursing, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Biol Res Nurs,Biological research for nursing,9815758,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (F2-Isoprostanes)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'F2-Isoprostanes/*blood', 'Fatigue/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Nausea/etiology', 'Oxidative Stress/*immunology', 'Pain/etiology', 'Syndrome']",PMC6854429,['NOTNLM'],"['*childhood leukemia', '*inflammatory biomarker', '*longitudinal parallel process', '*oxidative stress biomarker', '*symptom trajectory']",2019/07/19 06:00,2020/01/11 06:00,['2019/07/19 06:00'],"['2019/07/19 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/19 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/1099800419863160 [doi]'],ppublish,Biol Res Nurs. 2019 Oct;21(5):458-465. doi: 10.1177/1099800419863160.

Studies using Lck knock-out mice or Lck-deficient T-cell lines have shown that Lck regulates the initiation of TCR signaling, T-cell development, and T-cell homeostasis. Because of the crucial role of Lck in T-cell responses, strategies have been employed to redirect Lck activity to improve the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and to potentiate T-cell responses in cancer immunotherapy. In addition to the well-studied role of Lck in T cells, evidence has been accumulated suggesting that Lck is also expressed in the brain and in tumor cells, where it actively takes part in signaling processes regulating cellular functions like proliferation, survival and memory. Therefore, Lck has emerged as a novel druggable target molecule for the treatment of cancer and neuronal diseases.

These disorders most commonly occur following hematopoietic or solid organ transplantation (called post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders or PTLD), but cases have also been described during the treatment of autoimmune and rheumatologic disorders by immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory medications. These disorders are strongly associated with infection by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as a result of impaired immune function in the immunosuppressed state. While this phenomenon has been well documented in autoimmune conditions, cases affecting pediatric patients while on anti-leukemia chemotherapy are lacking. In this report, we describe a case of a pediatric immunosuppressed patient with recurrent sinusitis found to have a nasopharyngeal mass consistent with EBV-positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder resembling a polymorphic PTLD during the maintenance phase of B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) therapy. The patient was successfully treated with rituximab without any cytotoxic chemotherapy, highlighting the importance of recognizing this clinical entity in non-transplant patients with hematologic malignancies.","['Shahid, Sanam', 'Rossi, Christopher', 'Vyas, Pranav', 'Bollard, Catherine', 'Dave, Hema']","['Shahid S', 'Rossi C', 'Vyas P', 'Bollard C', 'Dave H']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4281-4910', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-5530-0201']","[""Children's National Health System , Washington , D.C."", ""Children's National Health System , Washington , D.C."", ""Children's National Health System , Washington , D.C."", ""Children's National Health System , Washington , D.C."", ""Children's National Health System , Washington , D.C.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,['4F4X42SYQ6 (Rituximab)'],IM,,"['Child', '*Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/drug therapy/virology', '*Herpesvirus 4, Human', 'Humans', 'Iatrogenic Disease', '*Lymphoproliferative Disorders/drug therapy/virology', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/virology', 'Rituximab/*administration & dosage']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Iatrogenic immunodeficiency-associated lymphoproliferative disorder', 'nasopharyngeal EBV-positive B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder', 'polymorphic post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder', 'rituximab']",2019/07/18 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2019.1637982 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Aug;36(5):309-316. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2019.1637982.

METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: A 49-year-old Caucasian man presented with anterior uveitis of the left eye. He had a history of chronic myeloid leukemia undergoing ipilimumab therapy. He was treated with topical corticosteroids and achieved inactive inflammation. Ipilimumab was stopped by his oncologist since he manifested other immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Five months later, his visual acuity decreased in his left eye and optical coherence tomography demonstrated new cystoid macular edema. Fluorescein angiography revealed diffuse capillary leakage of the left eye. He received oral prednisone with improvement of both macular edema and vascular leakage, however, both remained persistent. He received an intravitreal injection of a 0.7 mg dexamethasone implant in the left eye with subsequent resolution of macular edema and vasculitis.

Strategies which involve harnessing this effect are crucial to success and need to be exploited and refined to improve outcome. Further research is required to identify new strategies and therapies to improve the outlook for patients who relapse post-HSCT.

Advantages of peripherally harvested cells include higher stem cell dose, more rapid engraftment, reduced donor/patient discomfort, and better graft-versus-leukemia effect in the allogeneic setting. Within the apheresis machine, whole blood is separated into its components by centrifugation, and the red cell-depleted, stem cell-rich buffy coat is extracted for use as a stem cell product, simultaneously returning the other blood components back to the donor. Prediction of procedure length is based on the required cell dose target but still remains challenging. Moreover, the number of apheresis procedures needed should be as few as possible in order to reduce costs and patient/donor discomfort and to increase safety. The volume of blood which needs to be processed in order to collect an adequate number of stem cells depends on several factors such as method of stem cell mobilization, vascular access, and collection efficiency. Another issue to take into consideration is cell storage: according to GITMO's study (Perseghin et al. 2014) in most Italian centers, even up to 83.4% correspond to useless storage and only the remaining 16.6% to useful storage. Therefore, SIdEM and GITMO proposed a policy for autologous HPC disposal that fulfills clinical, ethical, and economic criteria. JACIE standards on peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection by apheresis require that collection, manipulation, and clinical use of peripheral blood stem cells must be validated and monitored rigorously. The validation procedure consists of systematic review of all apheresis procedures performed at the collection facility of a transplant program.","['Babic, Aleksandra', 'Trigoso, Eugenia']","['Babic A', 'Trigoso E']",,,['eng'],"['Review', 'Book Chapter']",Cham (CH),,,,,,,,,['NLM'],"['Stem cell source', 'Peripheral stem cell mobilization', 'SC mobilization and apheresis', 'Vascular access', 'Quality and apheresis']",2019/07/18 06:01,2019/07/18 06:01,,,"['NBK543662 [bookaccession]', '10.1007/978-3-319-50026-3_5 [doi]']",,,"['Copyright 2018, EBMT and the Author(s).']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,20190718,['20171122'],"['9783319500256', '9783319500263']",['Springer'],"['The European Blood and Marrow Transplantation Textbook for Nurses: Under the', 'Auspices of EBMT']",['Chapter 5'],"['Kenyon, Michelle', 'Babic, Aleksandra']","['Kenyon M', 'Babic A']",['2019/07/18 06:01'],

Twenty-nine de novo childhood ALL patients were enrolled and BM biopsy sections at diagnosis (BM0), after induction (BM1), consolidation (BM3), interim maintenance (BM5) and delayed intensification (BM7) chemotherapy were obtained. Expressions of CD133, CD34, CD117, osteopontin, osteonectin, CXCL12, and CXCR4 were evaluated by semiquantitative immunohistochemical stains. All markers recovered significantly following chemotherapy while highest values at BM3 (for CD133/CD117/CXCL12/CXCR4), BM5 (for CXCL12/CD34/osteonectin), and BM7 (for osteopontin). Patients with cytogenetic good risk expressed significantly more CD133(+)/CD34(+) cells than those with standard and poor risk in BM5. Patients without aberrant immunophenotype expressed significantly more CD133(+) cells in BM1, and more CD117(+) cells in BM5 than those with aberrant immunophenotype.

Patients who showed lowest ANC >/= 200/microL during induction chemotherapy expressed significantly more CXCR4(+) cells at from BM1 to BM5, and more CD133(+) cells in BM3 than those who did not. Early and full recovery of BM HSC is most vigorous at BM3 and BM5, respectively. Reconstruction of BM niche and stromal cell recovery is mostly active at BM5, and hematopoietic activity of BM niche recovers mostly at BM7.

However, Sb2O3 (Sb(III)) has no methylation capacity, unlike arsenic trioxide (As2O3). In the present study, we determined the effect of Sb(III) on NB4 cells and found that antimony could induce PML-RARalpha fusion protein degradation, reorganization of PML-NBs, and NB4 cell differentiation with low cytotoxicity. On the other hand, zinc finger motifs in PML protein are considered to be a key target binding site for arsenic-induced PML-RARalpha protein degradation. Interestingly, antimony and arsenic lost their ability to degrade PML-RARalpha fusion protein in NB4 cells following pretreatment with phenanthroline (i.e., chelator of zinc ions), indicating that the integrity of zinc finger motifs in PML-RARalpha fusion protein is a fundamental condition for inducing the protein's degradation by antimony and arsenic. Moreover, we found that Sb(III) could not induce mutant PML (e.g., A126V and L218P) solubility change and degradation, similar to As2O3. In contrast, we found that the organic antimony compound phenylstibine oxide (PSO) could induce mutant PML protein degradation. In conclusion, our results indicate that Sb(III) might also be a promising agent to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, in the same manner as As2O3.","['Yang, Chang', 'Hao, Rui', 'Lan, Yong Fei', 'Chen, Ye Jia', 'Wang, Chao', 'Bu, Na', 'Wang, Qian Qian', 'Hussain, Liaqat', 'Ma, Li Ya', 'Maimaitiyiming, Yasen', 'Lu, Xiao Yang', 'Naranmandura, Hua']","['Yang C', 'Hao R', 'Lan YF', 'Chen YJ', 'Wang C', 'Bu N', 'Wang QQ', 'Hussain L', 'Ma LY', 'Maimaitiyiming Y', 'Lu XY', 'Naranmandura H']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0799-2340'],"['Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China and Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot, China.', 'College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn.', ""Department of Pharmacy, Women's Hospital, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China."", 'Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China and Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China and Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn.', 'Department of Pharmacy, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, China.', 'Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Zhejiang University, China and Department of Toxicology, School of Medicine and Public Health, Zhejiang University, Zhejiang, 310058, China. narenman@zju.edu.cn and College of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot, China and Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Metallomics,Metallomics : integrated biometal science,101478346,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '9IT35J3UV3 (Antimony)']",IM,,"['Antimony/*pharmacology', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Proteolysis/*drug effects', 'Zinc Fingers/*drug effects']",,,,2019/07/18 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c9mt00102f [doi]'],ppublish,Metallomics. 2019 Aug 1;11(8):1419-1429. doi: 10.1039/c9mt00102f.

The risk of relapse was higher in children with IMC of both 0.1% and 0.05% compared to children without IMC (HR 12.8 [95% CI: 3.9-41.4; P < .0001] and 7.6 [95% CI: 2.2-26.9; P < .01], respectively). The first IMC was detected at a median of 208 days prior to relapse. The 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse for children with a single IMC was 45.5% (CI 12.3-74.4) and 41.0% (14.2-66.6) for IMC above 0.1% and 0.05%, respectively. However, in 47 and 38 children never attaining IMC > 0.1% and >0.05%, 10 and 8 children relapsed, respectively. In a landmark analysis, no association was found between IMC prior to 90 days post-HCT and subsequent relapse by either classification of IMC and AUC for RQ-PCR chimerism was 54.2% (95 CI 27.7- 84.8). Although limited by a retrospective design, these results indicate that monitoring of RQ-PCR chimerism in peripheral blood may have a role in early detection of relapse in acute childhood leukemia.","['Haugaard, Anna Karen', 'Madsen, Hans Ole', 'Marquart, Hanne Vibeke', 'Rosthoj, Susanne', 'Masmas, Tania Nicole', 'Heilmann, Carsten', 'Muller, Klaus Gottlob', 'Ifversen, Marianne']","['Haugaard AK', 'Madsen HO', 'Marquart HV', 'Rosthoj S', 'Masmas TN', 'Heilmann C', 'Muller KG', 'Ifversen M']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7686-9739'],"['Department for Children and Adolescents, Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunodeficiency, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, The Tissue Typing Laboratory, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Clinical Immunology, The Tissue Typing Laboratory, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department of Public Health, Section of Biostatistics, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department for Children and Adolescents, Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunodeficiency, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department for Children and Adolescents, Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunodeficiency, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department for Children and Adolescents, Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunodeficiency, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.', 'Department for Children and Adolescents, Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Immunodeficiency, Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Pediatr Transplant,Pediatric transplantation,9802574,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*therapy', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Assessment', '*Transplantation Chimera', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation', '*childhood leukemia', '*chimerism', '*relapse']",2019/07/18 06:00,2020/08/26 06:00,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2018/11/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/petr.13549 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Transplant. 2019 Nov;23(7):e13549. doi: 10.1111/petr.13549.

METHODS: Female Sprague Dawley rats with regular estrous cycle were enrolled and given Bushen Tiaoxue Granules or Kunling Wan by gavage for 12 days, and then, controlled ovarian hyperstimulation model was induced. We assessed endometrial microvessels, endometrial blood flow, levels of estradiol and progesterone in serum, vascular endothelial growth factor A upstream molecules estrogen and progesterone receptors in the endometrium, and pregnancy outcome. RESULTS: Pre-treatment of Bushen Tiaoxue Granules or Kunling Wan increases endometrial blood flow of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation rats, up-regulates vascular endothelial growth factor A and microvessels, improves the endometrial morphology of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation rats during implantation, decreases the super physiological concentration of estradiol and progesterone in serum, and increases the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A upstream molecules estrogen and progesterone receptors in the endometrium. In addition, Bushen Tiaoxue Granules or Kunling Wan elevates the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 that participates in vascularization and increases the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor through up-regulating the expression of p53 in the endometrium, ultimately affecting pregnancy outcome. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated Bushen Tiaoxue Granules or Kunling Wan as a potential strategy for prevention of impairment in angiogenesis and endometrial receptivity induced by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.","['Lv, Bo-Yang', 'Sun, Hao-Yu', 'Li, Quan', 'Zhang, Hao-Lin', 'Pan, Chun-Shui', 'Yan, Li', 'Fan, Jing-Yu', 'Li, Dong', 'Han, Jing-Yan']","['Lv BY', 'Sun HY', 'Li Q', 'Zhang HL', 'Pan CS', 'Yan L', 'Fan JY', 'Li D', 'Han JY']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-2286-8076'],"['Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Integration of Chinese and Western Medicine, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Tasly Microcirculation Research Center, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.', 'Academy of integration of Chinese and Western Medicine, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Microcirculation, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stasis and Phlegm, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Core Technology in Innovative Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Tasly Microcirculation Research Center, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.', 'Academy of integration of Chinese and Western Medicine, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Microcirculation, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stasis and Phlegm, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Core Technology in Innovative Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Tasly Microcirculation Research Center, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.', 'Academy of integration of Chinese and Western Medicine, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Microcirculation, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stasis and Phlegm, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Core Technology in Innovative Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Tasly Microcirculation Research Center, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.', 'Academy of integration of Chinese and Western Medicine, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Microcirculation, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stasis and Phlegm, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Core Technology in Innovative Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital, Beijing, China.', 'Department of Integration of Chinese and Western Medicine, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University, Beijing, China.', 'Tasly Microcirculation Research Center, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.', 'Academy of integration of Chinese and Western Medicine, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Microcirculation, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine of China, Beijing, China.', 'Key Laboratory of Stasis and Phlegm, State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Core Technology in Innovative Chinese Medicine, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Microcirculation,"Microcirculation (New York, N.Y. : 1994)",9434935,"['0 (Drugs, Chinese Herbal)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Drugs, Chinese Herbal/*pharmacology', 'Embryo Implantation/*drug effects', 'Endometrium/*blood supply', 'Female', 'Neovascularization, Physiologic/*drug effects', '*Ovulation Induction', 'Pregnancy', 'Rats', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Bushen Tiaoxue Granules', '*Kunling Wan', '*angiogenesis', '*controlled ovarian hyperstimulation', '*vascular dysfunction']",2019/07/18 06:00,2021/04/10 06:00,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/micc.12581 [doi]'],ppublish,Microcirculation. 2020 Jan;27(1):e12581. doi: 10.1111/micc.12581.

Its main mechanism of action has been related to the increase in extracellular adenosine, which leads to the effects of A2A receptor in M1 macrophages that dampens TNFalpha and IL12 production and increases IL1Ra and TNFRp75. By acting on A2B receptor on M2 macrophages it enhances IL10 synthesis and inhibits NF-kB signaling. MTX has also been shown to exert JAK inhibition of JAK2 and JAK1 when tested in Drosophila melanogaster as a model of kinase activity and in human cell lines (nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's lymphoma and acute myeloid leukemia cell lines). These effects may explain why MTX leads to clinical effects similar to anti-TNFalpha biologics in monotherapy, but is less effective when compared to anti-IL6R in monotherapy, which acting upstream exerts major effects downstream on the JAK1-STAT3 pathway. The MTX effects on JAK1/JAK2 inhibition also allows to understand why the combination of MTX with Leflunomide, or JAK1/JAK3 inhibitor leads to better clinical outcomes than monotherapy, while the combination with JAK1/JAK2 or JAK1 specific inhibitors does not seem to exert additive clinical benefit.","['Gremese, Elisa', 'Alivernini, Stefano', 'Tolusso, Barbara', 'Zeidler, Martin P', 'Ferraccioli, Gianfranco']","['Gremese E', 'Alivernini S', 'Tolusso B', 'Zeidler MP', 'Ferraccioli G']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-6884-4301'],"['Division of Rheumatology, Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A.

An increase in exposure was observed in the second week of treatment, which has previously been explained by extensive binding of bortezomib to proteasome in erythrocytes and peripheral tissues. We characterized the nonlinear population PK and pharmacodynamics (PD) of bortezomib in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. METHODS: Overall, 323 samples from 28 patients were available from a pediatric clinical study investigating bortezomib at an intravenous dose of 1.3 mg/m(2) twice weekly (Dutch Trial Registry number 1881/ITCC021). A semi-physiological PK model for bortezomib was first developed; the PK were linked to the decrease in 20S proteasome activity in the final PK/PD model. RESULTS: The plasma PK data were adequately described using a two-compartment model with linear elimination. Increased concentrations were observed in week 2 compared with week 1, which was described using a Langmuir binding model. The decrease in 20S proteasome activity was best described by a direct effect model with a sigmoidal maximal inhibitory effect, representing the relationship between plasma concentrations and effect. The maximal inhibitory effect was 0.696 pmol AMC/s/mg protein (95% confidence interval 0.664-0.728) after administration. CONCLUSION: The semi-physiological model adequately described the nonlinear PK and PD of bortezomib in plasma. This model can be used to further optimize dosing of bortezomib.","['Janssen, Julie M', 'Dorlo, T P C', 'Niewerth, D', 'Wilhelm, A J', 'Zwaan, C M', 'Beijnen, J H', 'Attarbaschi, A', 'Baruchel, A', 'Fagioli, F', 'Klingebiel, T', 'De Moerloose, B', 'Palumbo, G', 'von Stackelberg, A', 'Kaspers, G J L', 'Huitema, A D R']","['Janssen JM', 'Dorlo TPC', 'Niewerth D', 'Wilhelm AJ', 'Zwaan CM', 'Beijnen JH', 'Attarbaschi A', 'Baruchel A', 'Fagioli F', 'Klingebiel T', 'De Moerloose B', 'Palumbo G', 'von Stackelberg A', 'Kaspers GJL', 'Huitema ADR']",,"['Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. ju.janssen@nki.nl.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacology and Pharmacy, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Erasmus-MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands."", 'ITCC Consortium, Paris, France.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences (UIPS), Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', ""Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology, St. Anna Children's Hospital, Vienna, Austria."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Pediatric Hematology, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.', 'ITCC Consortium, Paris, France.', 'Universita degli Studi di Torino, Turin, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Frankfurt, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium.', 'Ospedale Pediatrico Bambino Gesu, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, Charite Universitatsmedizin, Berlin, Germany.', 'Department of Pediatric Oncology/Hematology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Princess Maxima Center for Pediatric Oncology, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Pharmacy and Pharmacology, Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek, Plesmanlaan 121, 1066 CX, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Clinical Pharmacy, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht University, Utrecht, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Clin Pharmacokinet,Clinical pharmacokinetics,7606849,"['0 (Proteasome Inhibitors)', '69G8BD63PP (Bortezomib)']",IM,,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Adolescent', 'Bortezomib/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Erythrocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Models, Biological', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Proteasome Inhibitors/administration & dosage/blood/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Recurrence']",,,,2019/07/18 06:00,2021/05/26 06:00,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/05/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s40262-019-00803-y [doi]', '10.1007/s40262-019-00803-y [pii]']",ppublish,Clin Pharmacokinet. 2020 Feb;59(2):207-216. doi: 10.1007/s40262-019-00803-y.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SBT is currently in phase II and phase I clinical trials for the management of rheumatoid arthritis and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, respectively. We developed and validated a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analytical method to quantify SBT and investigate its metabolic stability. SBT and the naquotinib as internal standard were isocratically eluted on a C18 column. The linearity of the developed method is 5-500 ng ml(-1) (r(2) >/= 0.9999) in the human liver microsomes (HLMs) matrix. Good sensitivity was approved by the very low limit of detection (0.39 ng ml(-1)). Inter- and intra-assay accuracy values of -1.41 to 12.44 and precision values of 0.71% to 4.78%, were obtained. SBT was found to have an in vitro half-life (82.52 min) and intrinsic clearance (8.4 microl min(-1) mg(-1)) as computed following its incubation with HLMs. The latter finding, hypothesize that SBT could be slowly excreted from the body unlike other related tyrosine kinase inhibitors. So, drug plasma level and kidney function should be monitored because of potential bioaccumulation. To the best of our knowledge, this is considered the first analytical method for SBT quantification using LC-MS/MS with application to metabolic stability evaluation.","['Abdelhameed, Ali S', 'Attwa, Mohamed W', 'Al-Shaklia, Nasser S', 'Kadi, Adnan A']","['Abdelhameed AS', 'Attwa MW', 'Al-Shaklia NS', 'Kadi AA']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1147-4960'],"['Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO Box 2457, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO Box 2457, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.', ""Students' University Hospital, Mansoura University, Mansoura 35516, Egypt."", 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO Box 2457, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.', 'Department of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, King Saud University, PO Box 2457, Riyadh 11451, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,R Soc Open Sci,Royal Society open science,101647528,,,,,PMC6599791,['NOTNLM'],"[""Bruton's tyrosine kinase"", 'LC-MS/MS', 'intrinsic clearance', 'metabolic stability', 'spebrutinib']",2019/07/18 06:00,2019/07/18 06:01,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2019/03/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1098/rsos.190434 [doi]', 'rsos190434 [pii]']",epublish,R Soc Open Sci. 2019 Jun 5;6(6):190434. doi: 10.1098/rsos.190434. eCollection 2019 Jun.,,20190605,,,['We declare we have no competing interests.'],,,['Dryad/10.5061/dryad.5m09t8k'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Molecular modelling and dynamics simulation studies were conducted using in silico tools with the templates selected based on Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches of the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Ten protein models were generated using the MODELLER software, and the best model was selected according to the Discrete Optimised Protein Energy (DOPE) score and validated using the RAMPAGE server by evaluation of the Ramachandran plot. More than 93% of the amino acid residues of the best model of BCL11A were found to be in the favoured and allowed regions. The best model was validated using a 100-ns time span molecular dynamics simulation. The root-mean-square deviation, root-mean-square fluctuation, and radius of gyration values were found to explain the stability of the best BCL11A protein molecular model generated in the study.

However, TCF21 methylation pattern remains unknown in hematologic malignancies. The aim of this study was to investigate TCF21 methylation and its clinical relevance in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and non-M3 acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A total cohort of 33 MDS patients, 100 non-M3 AML patients and 25 healthy donors were enrolled in the study. Targeted bisulfite sequencing assay was performed to identify the methylation pattern of CpG islands within the promoter of TCF21 gene. The bioinformatics analyses were based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). The results showed that there were significant differences in the methylation levels of TCF21 between MDS, non-M3 AML and controls (P = 0.003 and < 0.001, respectively). TCF21 hypermethylation might be served as a promising biomarker which could distinguish MDS/AML from normal controls (P < 0.001 and = 0.003, respectively). There was a significant difference in cytogenetic risk categories between TCF21 hypermethylation and non-hypermethylation AML patients (P = 0.032). Notably, TCF21 hypermethylation occurred frequently in AML patients with adverse risk category, compared with those with favorable and intermediate categories, respectively (67% vs 44% and 29%). TCF21 non-hypermethylation AML patients showed a higher probability of normal karyotype than abnormal karyotype (P = 0.003). The rate of DNMT3A gene mutation was significantly higher in the non-hypermethylation AML patients than that in the hypermethylation (8/44 vs 0/34, P = 0.020). These results suggested that aberrant DNA promoter methylation of TCF21 was frequent event in MDS and non-M3 AML, and TCF21 hypermathylation was associated with adverse risk karyotype in AML.","['Gu, Yu', 'Zhou, Jing-Dong', 'Xu, Zi-Jun', 'Zhang, Ting-Juan', 'Wen, Xiang-Mei', 'Ma, Ji-Chun', 'Ji, Ren-Bi', 'Yuan, Qian', 'Zhang, Wei', 'Chen, Qin', 'Lin, Jiang', 'Qian, Jun']","['Gu Y', 'Zhou JD', 'Xu ZJ', 'Zhang TJ', 'Wen XM', 'Ma JC', 'Ji RB', 'Yuan Q', 'Zhang W', 'Chen Q', 'Lin J', 'Qian J']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Laboratory Center, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Affiliated People's Hospital of Jiangsu University Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""Zhenjiang Clinical Research Center of Hematology Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."", ""The Key Lab of Precision Diagnosis and Treatment of Zhenjiang City Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,,,PMC6614633,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'TCF21', 'methylation', 'myelodysplastic syndrome']",2019/07/18 06:00,2019/07/18 06:01,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2018/11/28 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/18 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2019 Jun 15;11(6):3450-3460. eCollection 2019.,,20190615,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although miRNA-9 (miR-9) is involved in the leukemogenesis of AML, the underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, we found that miR-9 and C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) were differentially expressed in myeloid leukemia, particularly in AML. The inverse correlation between miR-9 and CXCR4 was identified in AML samples and cell lines. The AML patients simultaneously with high levels of CXCR4 and low expression of miR-9 possessed poor prognosis. In vitro, miR-9 inhibited the proliferation, apoptosis resistance, migration, and invasion of AML cells. Dual luciferase assays verified CXCR4 as a direct target of miR-9. The suppressive effects of miR-9 on AML cells were counteracted or mimicked by CXCR4 overexpression or depletion, respectively. Overall, this study reveals that miR-9 retards the aggressive behaviors of AML cells by repressing CXCR4. Thus, miR-9/CXCR4 axis may represent a potential therapeutic target for AML.","['Zhu, Bingke', 'Xi, Xiaoping', 'Liu, Qiongqiong', 'Cheng, Yingying', 'Yang, Haiping']","['Zhu B', 'Xi X', 'Liu Q', 'Cheng Y', 'Yang H']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology Luoyang 471023, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology Luoyang 471023, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology Luoyang 471023, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology Luoyang 471023, Henan, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Clinical Medicine of Henan University of Science and Technology Luoyang 471023, Henan, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Transl Res,American journal of translational research,101493030,,,,,PMC6614627,['NOTNLM'],"['C-X-C chemokine receptor 4', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'apoptosis', 'growth', 'microRNA-9']",2019/07/18 06:00,2019/07/18 06:01,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2018/07/20 00:00 [received]', '2018/08/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/18 06:01 [medline]']",,epublish,Am J Transl Res. 2019 Jun 15;11(6):3384-3397. eCollection 2019.,,20190615,,,['None.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A patient was admitted to our department for a persistent dermatological lesion and adverse evolution despite debridements and the administration of antibiotics. He was followed for prostate cancer, high blood pressure and asthma. Due to observed biological abnormalities such as neutrophil leukocytosis with myelocyte and metamyelocyte myeloma, without blood blastosis and normochromic normocytic anemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia was suspected. It was later overturned by the various inconclusive supplementary examinations.

APL is now one of the curable hematological malignancies thanks to molecularly targeted therapies based on all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATX). Extramedullary (EM) relapse is a rare event in APL, ear involvement being even more infrequent, with only six cases so far described. About 30-35% of patients with newly diagnosed APL have additional cytogenetics abnormalities, whose prognostic significance is still controversial. The most common additional aberration is trisomy 8 or partial gain 8q. Case presentation: We describe here a novel unbalanced translocation der(3)t(3;8)(q29;q23.3-q24.3) associated with 8q partial gain in a 41 year-old man affected by APL in molecular remission after first line treatment, who had a responsive EM relapse in the auditory canal. Conclusions: EM relapse is a rare event in APL and ear involvement is even more infrequent. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of APL with a new der(3)t(3;8)(q29;q23.3-q24.3) and 8q partial gain associated with t(15;17)(q24;q21). Despite the recurrence of the disease at EM level, the clinical outcome of this patients was favorable.","['Nozza, Filomena', 'Vona, Gabriella', 'Trino, Stefania', ""D'Auria, Fiorella"", 'La Rocca, Francesco', 'Grieco, Vitina', 'Possidente, Luciana', 'De Luca, Luciana', 'Musto, Pellegrino']","['Nozza F', 'Vona G', 'Trino S', ""D'Auria F"", 'La Rocca F', 'Grieco V', 'Possidente L', 'De Luca L', 'Musto P']",,"['Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Via Padre Pio 1, 85028 Rionero in Vulture, PZ Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Via Padre Pio 1, 85028 Rionero in Vulture, PZ Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Via Padre Pio 1, 85028 Rionero in Vulture, PZ Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Via Padre Pio 1, 85028 Rionero in Vulture, PZ Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Via Padre Pio 1, 85028 Rionero in Vulture, PZ Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Via Padre Pio 1, 85028 Rionero in Vulture, PZ Italy.', 'Laboratory of Clinical Research and Advanced Diagnostics, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Via Padre Pio 1, 85028 Rionero in Vulture, PZ Italy.', 'Laboratory of Preclinical and Translational Research, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Via Padre Pio 1, 85028 Rionero in Vulture, PZ Italy.', 'Unit of Hematology and Stem Cell Transplantation and Hematology Department of Basilicata, IRCCS-CROB, Referral Cancer Center of Basilicata, Via Padre Pio 1, 85028 Rionero in Vulture, PZ Italy.']",['eng'],['Case Reports'],England,Mol Cytogenet,Molecular cytogenetics,101317942,,,,,PMC6612227,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute promyelocytic leukemia', 'Chromosome 8', 'FISH', 'Molecular cytogenetics', 'Painting', 'c-myc gene']",2019/07/18 06:00,2019/07/18 06:01,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2019/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13039-019-0445-1 [doi]', '445 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Cytogenet. 2019 Jul 5;12:32. doi: 10.1186/s13039-019-0445-1. eCollection 2019.,,20190705,,,['Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, deciphering its role in different genetically defined subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is critical. Activating mutations of the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase are frequently detected in core-binding factor AML and are associated with a greater risk of relapse. Herein, we report that basal autophagy was significantly increased by the KIT(D816V) mutation in AML cells and contributed to support their cell proliferation and survival. Invalidation of the key autophagy protein Atg12 strongly reduced tumor burden and improved survival of immunocompromised NSG mice engrafted with KIT(D816V) TF-1 cells. Downstream of KIT(D816V), STAT3, but not AKT or ERK pathways, was identified as a major regulator of autophagy. Accordingly, STAT3 pharmacological inhibition or downregulation inhibited autophagy and reduced tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our results support the notion that targeting autophagy or STAT3 opens up an exploratory pathway for finding new therapeutic opportunities for patients with CBF-AML or others malignancies with KIT(D816V) mutations.","['Larrue, Clement', 'Heydt, Quentin', 'Saland, Estelle', 'Boutzen, Helena', 'Kaoma, Tony', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Joffre, Carine', 'Recher, Christian']","['Larrue C', 'Heydt Q', 'Saland E', 'Boutzen H', 'Kaoma T', 'Sarry JE', 'Joffre C', 'Recher C']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7551-356X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-3332-4525']","['Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE, Toulouse, France.', 'University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE, Toulouse, France.', 'University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE, Toulouse, France.', 'University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE, Toulouse, France.', 'University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Proteome and Genome Research Unit, Department of Oncology, Luxembourg Institute of Health, Strassen, Luxembourg.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE, Toulouse, France.', 'University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE, Toulouse, France.', 'University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France.', 'Cancer Research Center of Toulouse (CRCT), UMR1037 INSERM, ERL5294 CNRS, Equipe Labellisee LIGUE, Toulouse, France. recher.christian@iuct-oncopole.fr.', 'University of Toulouse, Toulouse, France. recher.christian@iuct-oncopole.fr.', ""Service d'Hematologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Institut Universitaire du Cancer de Toulouse Oncopole, Toulouse, France. recher.christian@iuct-oncopole.fr.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Oncogenesis,Oncogenesis,101580004,,,,,PMC6635375,,,2019/07/18 06:00,2019/07/18 06:01,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2017/05/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/04/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/18 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1038/s41389-019-0148-9 [doi]', '10.1038/s41389-019-0148-9 [pii]']",epublish,Oncogenesis. 2019 Jul 16;8(8):39. doi: 10.1038/s41389-019-0148-9.,,20190716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To test whether the degradation of BCR-ABL1 kinase could offer improved response, we developed a series of proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) that allosterically target BCR-ABL1 protein and recruit the E3 ligase Von Hippel-Lindau, resulting in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the oncogenic fusion protein. In both human CML K562 cells and murine Ba/F3 cells expressing BCR-ABL1, lead compound GMB-475 induced rapid proteasomal degradation and inhibition of downstream biomarkers, such as STAT5, and showed increased sensitivity compared with diastereomeric controls lacking degradation activity. Notably, GMB-475 inhibited the proliferation of certain clinically relevant BCR-ABL1 kinase domain point mutants and further sensitized Ba/F3 BCR-ABL1 cells to inhibition by imatinib, while demonstrating no toxicity toward Ba/F3 parental cells. Reverse phase protein array analysis suggested additional differences in levels of phosphorylated SHP2, GAB2, and SHC associated with BCR-ABL1 degradation. Importantly, GMB-475 reduced viability and increased apoptosis in primary CML CD34(+) cells, with no effect on healthy CD34(+) cells at identical concentrations. GMB-475 degraded BCR-ABL1 and reduced cell viability in primary CML stem cells. Together, these findings suggest that combined BCR-ABL1 kinase inhibition and protein degradation may represent a strategy to address BCR-ABL1-dependent drug resistance, and warrant further investigation into the eradication of persistent leukemic stem cells, which rely on neither the presence nor the activity of the BCR-ABL1 protein for survival. SIGNIFICANCE: Small-molecule-induced degradation of BCR-ABL1 in CML provides an advantage over inhibition and provides insights into CML stem cell biology.

Pan-reactive antibodies against modified amino acids (e.g., anti-phosphotyrosine), which are often used to assay these changes, require isolation of the specific protein prior to analysis and do not identify the specific residue that has been modified (in the case that multiple amino acids have been modified). Phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (PSSAs) developed to recognize post-translational modifications within a specific amino acid sequence can be used to study the timeline of modifications during a signal cascade. We used the FcepsilonRI receptor as a model system to develop and characterize high-affinity PSSAs using phage and yeast display technologies. We selected three beta-subunit antibodies that recognized: 1) phosphorylation of tyrosines Y218 or Y224; 2) phosphorylation of the Y228 tyrosine; and 3) phosphorylation of all three tyrosines. We used these antibodies to study the receptor activation timeline of FcepsilonR1 in rat basophilic leukemia cells (RBL-2H3) upon stimulation with DNP24-BSA. We also selected an antibody recognizing the N-terminal phosphorylation site of the gamma-subunit (Y65) of the receptor and applied this antibody to evaluate receptor activation. Recognition patterns of these antibodies show different timelines for phosphorylation of tyrosines in both beta and gamma subunits. Our methodology provides a strategy to select antibodies specific to post-translational modifications and provides new reagents to study mast cell activation by the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcepsilonRI.","['Velappan, Nileena', 'Mahajan, Avanika', 'Naranjo, Leslie', 'Velappan, Priyanka', 'Andrews, Nasim', 'Tiee, Nicholas', 'Chakraborti, Subhendu', 'Hemez, Colin', 'Gaiotto, Tiziano', 'Wilson, Bridget', 'Bradbury, Andrew']","['Velappan N', 'Mahajan A', 'Naranjo L', 'Velappan P', 'Andrews N', 'Tiee N', 'Chakraborti S', 'Hemez C', 'Gaiotto T', 'Wilson B', 'Bradbury A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4488-9126', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3323-6787', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2165-0814', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1776-6435', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4823-3279', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7123-235X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4117-9719', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-3445-7706', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9957-5119', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3775-4450']","['Biosecurity and Public Health, Bioscience Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , NM , USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine , Albuquerque , NM , USA.', 'Specifica Inc ., Los Alamos , NM , USA.', 'Biosecurity and Public Health, Bioscience Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , NM , USA.', 'Biosecurity and Public Health, Bioscience Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , NM , USA.', 'Biosecurity and Public Health, Bioscience Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , NM , USA.', 'Biosecurity and Public Health, Bioscience Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , NM , USA.', 'Biosecurity and Public Health, Bioscience Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , NM , USA.', 'Biosecurity and Public Health, Bioscience Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory , Los Alamos , NM , USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of New Mexico School of Medicine , Albuquerque , NM , USA.', 'Specifica Inc ., Los Alamos , NM , USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,MAbs,mAbs,101479829,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Phospho-Specific)', '0 (FCER1A protein, rat)', '0 (Receptors, IgE)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/*isolation & purification', 'Antibodies, Phospho-Specific/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Basophils/*physiology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Surface Display Techniques', 'Phosphorylation', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Rats', 'Receptors, IgE/*metabolism', 'Tyrosine/immunology/metabolism', 'Yeasts/*physiology']",PMC6748597,['NOTNLM'],"['*FcepsilonR1 receptor subunits', '*Phosphorylation state-specific antibodies', '*phage display', '*post-translational modifications', '*yeast display']",2019/07/18 06:00,2020/07/18 06:00,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/19420862.2019.1632113 [doi]'],ppublish,MAbs. 2019 Oct;11(7):1206-1218. doi: 10.1080/19420862.2019.1632113.

In this retrospective study, we aim to elucidate the mutation profile of EBV+T/NK-LPD using capture-based targeted sequencing with a panel consisting of 64 lymphoma-related genes to identify driver genes associated with the development of EBV+T/NK-LPD. Targeted sequencing of 169 EBV+T/NK-LPD cases was performed using a panel of 64 lymphoma-related genes. Of the 169 EBV+T/NK-LPD cases, 123 had extra-nodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), 12 had aggressive NK-cell leukemia (ANKL) and 34 had EBV+ T-cell lymphoma of childhood (EBV+TL). The mutation profile revealed that all three subtypes of EBV+T/NK-LPDs had high mutation rates in STAT3, KMT2D, DDX3X, NOTCH1 and TET2. Target sequencing revealed that ENKTL, ANKL and EBV+TL were molecularly distinct, the mutation in nasal-ENKTL and extra-nasal-ENKTL are also different. Survival analysis revealed that ENKTL patients with gene mutations or loss of protein expression in either KMT2D or TET2 were significantly correlated with shorter overall survival. And although the EBV+TL and ANKL groups were too small to confirm survival disadvantage, the adverse prognosis trends of KMT2D or TET2 were showed in these two groups. We conclude that EBV+T/NK lymphoproliferative disorders have very distinct molecular profiles. Our findings also suggest the likely involvement of KMT2D and TET2 in the development of ENKTL, and possibly EBV+T/NK-LPDs in general.","['Gao, Li-Min', 'Zhao, Sha', 'Zhang, Wen-Yan', 'Wang, Mi', 'Li, Hui-Fang', 'Lizaso, Anle', 'Liu, Wei-Ping']","['Gao LM', 'Zhao S', 'Zhang WY', 'Wang M', 'Li HF', 'Lizaso A', 'Liu WP']",,"['Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'Department of Dermatology and Venerology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'Cellular Biology Laboratory of Core Facility, West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.', 'Department of Medicine, Burning Rock Biotech , Shanghai , China.', 'Department of Pathology, West China Hospital of Sichuan University , Chengdu , China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Biol Ther,Cancer biology & therapy,101137842,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2D protein, human)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (Dioxygenases)', 'EC 1.13.11.- (TET2 protein, human)']",IM,,"['Biomarkers', 'Computational Biology/methods', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Dioxygenases', 'Disease Susceptibility', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/*complications/virology', 'Female', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/diagnosis/*etiology/*mortality/therapy', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Annotation', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics']",PMC6783120,['NOTNLM'],"['EBV+ T-cell lymphoma', 'Epstein-Barr virus', 'KMT2D', 'TET2', 'aggressive NK-cell leukemia', 'extra-nodal NK/T-cell lymphoma', 'lymphoproliferative disorder']",2019/07/18 06:00,2020/08/22 06:00,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/08/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15384047.2019.1638670 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Biol Ther. 2019;20(10):1319-1327. doi: 10.1080/15384047.2019.1638670.

Cellular therapy, which is already widely used as a treatment for several hematological malignancies, could be a potential treatment alternative. Natural killer (NK) cells play an important role in relapse control but can be inhibited by the leukemia cells highly positive for HLA class I. In order to restore NK cell activity after their ex vivo activation, NK cells can be combined with conditioning target cells. In this study, we tested NK cell activity against KG1a (AML cell line) with and without two types of pretreatment-Ara-C treatment that induced NKG2D ligands (increased activating signal) and/or blocking of HLA-KIR (killer-immunoglobulin-like receptors) interaction (decreased inhibitory signal). Both treatments improved NK cell killing activity. Compared with target cell killing of NK cells alone (38%), co-culture with Ara-C treated KG1a target cells increased the killing to 80%. Anti-HLA blocking antibody treatment increased the proportion of dead KG1a cells to 53%. Interestingly, the use of the combination treatment improved the killing potential to led to the death of 85% of KG1a cells. The combination of Ara-C and ex vivo activation of NK cells has the potential to be a feasible approach to treat relapsed AML after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Holubova, Monika', 'Leba, Martin', 'Gmucova, Hana', 'Caputo, Valentina S', 'Jindra, Pavel', 'Lysak, Daniel']","['Holubova M', 'Leba M', 'Gmucova H', 'Caputo VS', 'Jindra P', 'Lysak D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5096-9659', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9391-4247']","['Biomedical Center, Faculty of Medicine in Pilsen, Charles University, Pilsen 323 00, Czech Republic. holubovam@fnplzen.cz.', 'Faculty of Applied Science, University of West Bohemia, Pilsen 301 00, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen 304 60, Czech Republic.', 'Centre for Haematology, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, W12 0NN, UK.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen 304 60, Czech Republic.', 'Department of Haematology and Oncology, University Hospital Pilsen, Pilsen 304 60, Czech Republic.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Int J Mol Sci,International journal of molecular sciences,101092791,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '0 (KLRK1 protein, human)', '0 (NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,,"['Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/pharmacology', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology/transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*therapy', 'NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily K/immunology', 'Receptors, KIR/immunology', 'Signal Transduction']",PMC6679089,['NOTNLM'],"['HLA-KIR', 'NK cells', 'NKG2D ligands', 'relapsed AML']",2019/07/18 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/18 06:00'],"['2019/06/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/18 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['ijms20143472 [pii]', '10.3390/ijms20143472 [doi]']",epublish,Int J Mol Sci. 2019 Jul 15;20(14). pii: ijms20143472. doi: 10.3390/ijms20143472.,,20190715,,['15-30661A/Ministerstvo Zdravotnictvi Ceske Republiky'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Abivertinib was also found to be more sensitive than ibrutinib in treating AML. We demonstrate that in addition to targeting the phosphorylation of BTK, abivertinib also targeted the crucial PI3K survival pathway. Furthermore, abivertinib suppressed the expression of p-FLT3 and the downstream target p-STAT5 in AML cells harboring FLT3-ITD mutations. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo data revealed synergistic activity between abivertinib and homoharringtonine (HHT), a natural plant alkaloid commonly used in China, in treating AML cells with or without FLT3-ITD mutations.

Maternal antibiotics use during prepregnancy (6 months prior to pregnancy) and pregnancy periods was assessed. Children's cancer incidence was tracked up to the end of the follow-up period (December 2015). We calculated incidence rate and used Cox regression to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). Antibiotics use during pregnancy was not associated with overall cancer (HR = 1.1, 95% confidence interval 0.9-1.4), leukemias (1.3, 0.9-1.8), or acute lymphocytic leukemia (1.1, 0.7-1.6).

Further research is necessary to confirm the association between first-trimester exposure and cancer risk after a better controlling of confounding factors.","['Ye, Xibiao', 'Monchka, Barret A', 'Righolt, Christiaan H', 'Mahmud, Salaheddin M']","['Ye X', 'Monchka BA', 'Righolt CH', 'Mahmud SM']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2646-9187', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6574-0574']","['Vaccine and Drug Evaluation Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'School of Health Information Science, University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.', 'Vaccine and Drug Evaluation Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Vaccine and Drug Evaluation Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'Vaccine and Drug Evaluation Centre, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'College of Pharmacy, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.', 'George & Fay Yee Centre for Healthcare Innovation, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)'],IM,,"['Anti-Bacterial Agents/administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Male', 'Manitoba/epidemiology', 'Maternal Exposure/*adverse effects', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Risk Factors']",PMC6718549,['NOTNLM'],"['Prenatal exposure', 'antibiotics', 'childhood cancer', 'trimester']",2019/07/17 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/05/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/27 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2412 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Sep;8(11):5367-5372. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2412.

Treatments against ALL might lead to later cognitive effects and alterations in brain structure in survivors but to the authors' knowledge the observed variability in the severity of neurocognitive deficits is not fully understood. The objective of the current study was to investigate abnormalities in visual short-term memory (VSTM) brain activation in survivors of childhood ALL using magnetoencephalography. METHODS: A VSTM task was completed by 40 survivors of ALL and 26 controls. VSTM capacity (Cowan K) and brain activation were assessed during the retention period of the task (400-1400 milliseconds) using a standard minimum norm source localization method. RESULTS: Performance (Cowan K) was found to be similar between survivors of ALL and controls. Atypical brain activation was found in survivors of ALL during the task, including overactivation of regions usually involved in VSTM (lateral occipital, precentral gyrus, and postcentral gyrus), recruitment of regions that typically are not involved in VSTM (superior/middle temporal gyrus and supramarginal gyrus), and lower activation of frontal brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus). These patterns of activation were modulated by the age at the time of cancer onset (P = .01) because activity was found to be reduced in participants who were younger at diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest a pattern of neural inefficiency and compensatory activity during VSTM in survivors of ALL.","['Boulet-Craig, Aubree', 'Robaey, Philippe', 'Barlaam, Fanny', 'Laniel, Julie', 'Oswald, Victor', 'Jerbi, Karim', 'Sultan, Serge', 'Affret-Bertout, Laurence', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Jolicoeur, Pierre', 'Lippe, Sarah']","['Boulet-Craig A', 'Robaey P', 'Barlaam F', 'Laniel J', 'Oswald V', 'Jerbi K', 'Sultan S', 'Affret-Bertout L', 'Drouin S', 'Krajinovic M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sinnett D', 'Jolicoeur P', 'Lippe S']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0129-0663'],"['CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychiatry, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.', ""Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada."", 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'CHU Sainte-Justine Research Center, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Female', 'Frontal Lobe/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', '*Memory, Short-Term', 'Neuropsychological Tests', '*Ocular Physiological Phenomena', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/diagnostic imaging/*physiopathology', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cognitive function', '*short-term memory', '*survivors of childhood cancer']",2019/07/17 06:00,2020/05/21 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/02/05 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/22 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32374 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Oct 15;125(20):3639-3648. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32374.

Sorafenib is a potent multikinase inhibitor with efficacy when given as monotherapy. The authors investigated whether the addition of sorafenib to intensive induction chemotherapy improves outcomes in patients with FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-mutated AML. METHODS: In total, 183 patients who were newly diagnosed with FLT3-ITD-mutated AML between February 2001 and December 2017 were identified. Of these, 79 patients (43%) underwent intensive chemotherapy with the addition of sorafenib, and 104 (57%) received intensive chemotherapy alone. Propensity score matching identified 42 patients in each cohort. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 98% in the sorafenib cohort and 83% in the intensive chemotherapy cohort (P = .057). The median follow-up was 54 months. The median event-free survival was 35 months in the sorafenib cohort and 8 months in the intensive chemotherapy cohort (P = .019), and the median overall survival was 42 and 13 months, respectively (P = .026). With censoring at the time of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, the median event-free survival was 31 and 8 months in the sorafenib and intensive therapy cohorts, respectively (P = .031), and the median overall survival was not reached and 10 months, respectively (P = .001). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models confirmed that treatment with sorafenib was a favorable prognostic factor (P = .009; hazard ratio, 0.558; 95% CI, 0.360-0.865). CONCLUSIONS: The addition of sorafenib improves survival in patients with FLT3-ITD-mutated AML regardless of whether they undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation.","['Sasaki, Koji', 'Kantarjian, Hagop M', 'Kadia, Tapan', 'Patel, Keyur', 'Loghavi, Sanam', 'Garcia-Manero, Guillermo', 'Jabbour, Elias J', 'DiNardo, Courtney', 'Pemmaraju, Naveen', 'Daver, Naval', 'Dalle, Iman Abou', 'Short, Nicholas', 'Yilmaz, Musa', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Naqvi, Kiran', 'Pierce, Sherry', 'Yalniz, Fevzi', 'Cortes, Jorge E', 'Ravandi, Farhad']","['Sasaki K', 'Kantarjian HM', 'Kadia T', 'Patel K', 'Loghavi S', 'Garcia-Manero G', 'Jabbour EJ', 'DiNardo C', 'Pemmaraju N', 'Daver N', 'Dalle IA', 'Short N', 'Yilmaz M', 'Bose P', 'Naqvi K', 'Pierce S', 'Yalniz F', 'Cortes JE', 'Ravandi F']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9140-0610', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1908-3307', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9892-9832', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3631-2482', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-4465-6119', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9003-0390', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7103-373X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2983-2738', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5511-6153']","['Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)']",IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cohort Studies', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/*methods', 'Humans', 'Induction Chemotherapy/methods', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Mutation', 'Remission Induction', 'Sorafenib/administration & dosage', 'Staurosporine/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Tandem Repeat Sequences/*genetics', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Young Adult', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['FLT3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD)', 'acute myeloid leukemia', 'allogeneic stem cell transplantation', 'induction chemotherapy', 'sorafenib']",2019/07/17 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/10 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/14 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32387 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Nov 1;125(21):3755-3766. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32387.

METHODS: The Workshop Panel reviewed 51 cases with germline mutations and rendered consensus diagnoses. Of these, six cases were presented at the meeting by the submitting pathologists. RESULTS: The cases submitted to the session covering germline predisposition included 16 cases with germline GATA2 mutations, 10 cases with germline RUNX1 mutations, two cases with germline CEBPA mutations, two germline TP53 mutations, and one case of germline DDX41 mutation. The most common diagnoses were acute myeloid leukemia (15 cases) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, 14 cases). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the submitted neoplasms occurring in patients with germline predisposition were myeloid neoplasms with germline mutations in GATA2 and RUNX1. The presence of a germline predisposition mutation is not sufficient for a diagnosis of a neoplasm until the appearance of standard diagnostic features of a hematolymphoid malignancy manifest: in general, the diagnostic criteria for neoplasms associated with germline predisposition disorders are the same as those for sporadic cases.","['Weinberg, Olga K', 'Kuo, Frank', 'Calvo, Katherine R']","['Weinberg OK', 'Kuo F', 'Calvo KR']",,"[""Department of Pathology, Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA."", ""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA."", 'University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles.', 'Hematology Section, Department of Laboratory Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,"['0 (CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins)', '0 (CEBPA protein, human)', '0 (Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit)', '0 (GATA2 Transcription Factor)', '0 (GATA2 protein, human)', '0 (RUNX1 protein, human)', '0 (TP53 protein, human)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX41 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Core Binding Factor Alpha 2 Subunit/genetics', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/genetics', 'Female', 'GATA2 Transcription Factor/genetics', '*Genetic Predisposition to Disease', '*Germ-Line Mutation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/genetics', 'Young Adult']",PMC7179513,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CEBPA', '*GATA2', '*Germline predisposition', '*Hematolymphoid neoplasia', '*MDS', '*Molecular genetics', '*RUNX1', '*Targeted therapy']",2019/07/17 06:00,2020/03/25 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['5532613 [pii]', '10.1093/ajcp/aqz067 [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 2019 Aug 1;152(3):258-276. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/aqz067.,"['(c) American Society for Clinical Pathology, 2019.

After some time, however, joints and bony pains worsened. After referral to us, he was found to have multiple bony lytic lesions and peripheral smear suggested B cell ALL. So, presentation predominantly with musculoskeletal symptoms, a normal peripheral smear and a partial therapeutic response to steroids as treatment of Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, delayed the diagnosis significantly leading to complications. So through our report we would like to stress that suspecting and diagnosing leukaemia early is important to prevent complications and resistance to treatment. An early bone marrow examination should also be instituted as a standard of care in peripheral smear negative patients.","['Keri, Vishakh C', 'Sethi, Prayas', 'Swain, Satish', 'Nischal, Neeraj', 'Kumar, Arvind', 'Wig, Naveet']","['Keri VC', 'Sethi P', 'Swain S', 'Nischal N', 'Kumar A', 'Wig N']",,"['Junior Resident,Department of Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.', 'Assistant Professor,Department of Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.', 'Junior Resident,Department of Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.', 'Assistant Professor,Department of Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.', 'Assistant Professor,Department of Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.', 'Professor, Department of Medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",India,J Assoc Physicians India,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,7505585,,,,"['Arthralgia', 'Arthritis, Juvenile/complications/*diagnosis', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Fever/complications/*diagnosis', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Splenomegaly']",,,,2019/07/17 06:00,2019/08/09 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Physicians India. 2019 Apr;67(4):76-78.,['(c) Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of allo-HSCT on the outcome of HR AML. Patients with either monosomy 7, 5q-, t(16;21), Ph1, FLT3-ITD, or induction failure after the first course of chemotherapy were eligible for transplant. Of 53 children with HR AML, 51 received allo-HSCT-45 in CR1, five in CR2, and one with non-CR. t(8;21), t(9;11), and t(16;21) abnormalities were identified in eight, five, and four patients, respectively. The stem cell sources varied-bone marrow in 30 patients, peripheral blood in three, and cord blood in 18. The median follow-up was 62 months. The overall survival (OS) rates at 3 years were 73% and 25% for patients who received transplant at CR1 and >/=CR2, respectively. Multivariable analysis showed that patients with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) had better OS. This study supports that allo-HSCT is a suitable treatment for HR AML in CR1.

METHODS: IFI episodes in children with primary or relapsed ALL, identified for The Epidemiology and Risk Factors for Invasive Fungal Infections in Immunocompromised Children study, were analysed. IFI were classified according to European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer/Invasive Fungal Infections Cooperative Group criteria with a 'modified-possible' category included. RESULTS: A total of 123 IFI episodes in 119 patients with ALL were included. A proven, probable, possible and modified-possible IFI was diagnosed in 56 (45.5%), 22 (17.9%), 39 (31.7%) and six (4.9%) episodes, respectively. The prevalence was 9.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8-11.4%) overall and 23.5% (95% CI 14.5-32.5%) for relapsed/refractory ALL. For non-relapsed ALL, the IFI prevalence was significantly higher for children with high-risk compared to standard-risk ALL (14.5% vs 7.3%, P = .009), and IFI were more common during induction, consolidation and delayed intensification phases. Mould infections occurred more frequently than non-mould infections. Thirteen children (10.9%) died within 6 months of IFI diagnosis with five deaths (4.2%) attributable to an IFI. CONCLUSIONS: IFI is more common in children with high-risk ALL and in relapsed disease. Overall survival was encouraging, with IFI contributing to very few deaths.","['Wang, Stacie S', 'Kotecha, Rishi S', 'Bernard, Anne', 'Blyth, Christopher C', 'McMullan, Brendan J', 'Cann, Megan P',

Efficacy of denosumab, an effective therapy for adult patients with osteoporosis, remains unclear in children. This study aimed to investigate denosumab therapy efficacy for low BMD in childhood cancer survivors. PROCEDURE: Between January 2014 and January 2018, we monitored lumbar BMD of children with cancer using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry after completing chemotherapy with a 6-month interval. For patients with low BMD, defined as height-adjusted Z-scores of BMD < -1.5 in this study, calcium carbonate and vitamin D supplements were initially administered. When low BMD continued for at least 6 months, denosumab therapy was introduced. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation were continued in patients on denosumab. We investigated BMD change and adverse effects during denosumab therapy. RESULTS: During the study period, 20 patients received denosumab treatment. Mean height-adjusted Z-score of BMD before denosumab treatment was -2.68 but increased to -2, -1.96, and -1.33 at 0.5, 1, and 1.5 years after denosumab treatment, respectively (P = .012). In addition, hypocalcemia occurred in 40% (8/20) of patients; three patients had hypocalcemic symptoms with numbness in all four limbs. All hypocalcemic patients, except one patient who died due to relapsed leukemia, recovered well after continuous calcium supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: Denosumab is an effective treatment for low BMD in childhood cancer survivors. However, the complication of hypocalcemia might develop posttreatment.","['Huang, Ting-Huan', 'Liu, Hsi-Che', 'Hou, Jen-Yin', 'Chang, Ching-Yi', 'Sun, Fang-Ju', 'Yeh, Ting-Chi']","['Huang TH', 'Liu HC', 'Hou JY', 'Chang CY', 'Sun FJ', 'Yeh TC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9336-3147', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0716-0838', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0437-3130']","['Department of Pediatrics, Hsinchu Mackay Memorial Hospital, Hsinchu, Taiwan.', ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Children's Hospital and Mackay Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan."", ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Children's Hospital and Mackay Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan."", ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Children's Hospital and Mackay Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan."", 'Department of Medical Research, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan.', ""Department of Hematology-Oncology, Mackay Children's Hospital and Mackay Medical College, Taipei, Taiwan.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,"['0 (Bone Density Conservation Agents)', '4EQZ6YO2HI (Denosumab)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Density Conservation Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Diseases, Metabolic/*drug therapy/etiology', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Denosumab/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypocalcemia/chemically induced', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*bone mineral density', '*cancer', '*children', '*denosumab', '*osteoporosis']",2019/07/17 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/03/19 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/21 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/01 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27927 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Oct;66(10):e27927. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27927.

A large number of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed that target either FLT3 or KIT and significant clinical benefit has been demonstrated in multiple clinical trials. Given the structural similarity of FLT3 and KIT, it is not surprising that some of these TKIs inhibit both of these receptors. This is typified by midostaurin, which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for mutant FLT3-positive AML and for KIT D816V-positive SM. Here, we compare the in vitro activities of the clinically available FLT3 and KIT inhibitors with those of midostaurin against a panel of cells expressing a variety of oncogenic FLT3 or KIT receptors, including wild-type (wt) FLT3, FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD), FLT3 D835Y, the resistance mutant FLT3-ITD+ F691L, KIT D816V, and KIT N822K. We also examined the effects of these inhibitors in vitro and in vivo on cells expressing mutations in c-CBL found in AML that result in hypersensitization of RTKs, such as FLT3 and KIT. The results show a wide spectrum of activity of these various mutations to these clinically available TKIs.","['Weisberg, Ellen', 'Meng, Chengcheng', 'Case, Abigail E', 'Sattler, Martin', 'Tiv, Hong L', 'Gokhale, Prafulla C', 'Buhrlage, Sara J', 'Liu, Xiaoxi', 'Yang, Jing', 'Wang, Jinhua', 'Gray, Nathanael', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Adamia, Sophia', 'Dubreuil, Patrice', 'Letard, Sebastien', 'Griffin, James D']","['Weisberg E', 'Meng C', 'Case AE', 'Sattler M', 'Tiv HL', 'Gokhale PC', 'Buhrlage SJ', 'Liu X', 'Yang J', 'Wang J', 'Gray N', 'Stone RM', 'Adamia S', 'Dubreuil P', 'Letard S', 'Griffin JD']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-5679-9531'],"['Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Core and Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Experimental Therapeutics Core and Belfer Center for Applied Cancer Science, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Cancer Biology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.', 'CRCM, [Signalling, Haematopoiesis and Mechanism of Oncogenesis, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer], Inserm, U1068; Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', 'CRCM, [Signalling, Haematopoiesis and Mechanism of Oncogenesis, Equipe Labellisee Ligue Contre le Cancer], Inserm, U1068; Institut Paoli-Calmettes; Aix-Marseille University, Marseille, France.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA, USA.', 'Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Aniline Compounds)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzimidazoles)', '0 (Benzothiazoles)', '0 (Mutant Proteins)', '0 (Phenylurea Compounds)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Pyrazines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrroles)', '0 (Triazines)', '0 (gilteritinib)', '513P80B4YJ (avapritinib)', '7LA4O6Q0D3 (quizartinib)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (FLT3 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (KIT protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)', 'EC 6.3.2.- (CBL protein, human)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'ID912S5VON (midostaurin)', 'LQF7I567TQ (crenolanib)']",IM,,"['Aniline Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzimidazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Benzothiazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Hematologic Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Humans', 'Mutant Proteins/*drug effects', 'Phenylurea Compounds/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Piperidines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-cbl/drug effects/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-kit/drug effects/genetics', 'Pyrazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrroles/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sorafenib/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Staurosporine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Triazines/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/drug effects/genetics']",PMC7887860,['NOTNLM'],"['*BLU-285', '*FLT3', '*KIT', '*acute myeloid leukaemia', '*tyrosine kinase inhibitors']",2019/07/17 06:00,2020/07/09 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/21 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/bjh.16092 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 2019 Nov;187(4):488-501. doi: 10.1111/bjh.16092.

Here, we report a rare case of GVHD involving the central nervous system (CNS). A 35-year-old woman was diagnosed with myelodysplastic syndrome unclassifiable and underwent allogeneic peripheral blood SCT for disease progression to myelodysplastic syndrome with excess blasts-2. One year following SCT, she experienced chronic oral and hepatic GVHD symptoms, which were managed with oral steroids and tacrolimus. Sixteen months after SCT, she developed sudden-onset, generalized, tonic-clonic-type seizures. Magnetic resonance imaging and cerebrospinal fluid evaluation showed multiple discrete white lesions and elevated IgG levels. Brain biopsy revealed periventricular plaques with the destruction of axons, representing a demyelinating disease of the CNS. We diagnosed the case as CNS GVHD. Neurologic symptoms gradually improved with methylprednisolone pulse therapy and total plasma exchange combined with a calcineurin inhibitor; the brain lesions nearly disappeared after decreasing steroid maintenance dosage, and were completely resolved 1 year after the onset of CNS GVHD. The patient is CNS GVHD-symptom-free, 3-year post-transplantation. Thus, CNS GVHD should be considered in cases of newly developed neurologic symptoms in SCT recipients showing evidence of preceding chronic GVHD.","['Min, Gi-June', 'Park, Silvia', 'Park, Sung-Soo',

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of cancers that starts in certain blood-forming cells of the bone marrow. Here, we showed that poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor talazoparib could induce a concentration-dependent cytotoxicity in CML cells derived from pediatric patients. During talazoparib treatment, autophagy was markedly activated, which was confirmed by the accumulation of autophagosomes, decrease of SQSTM1 and up-regulation of LC3-II. Inhibition of autophagy by pharmaceutical inhibitor chloroquine or small-interfering RNA siATG5 significantly increased the cytotoxicity of talazoparib in pediatric CML cells and elicited synergistic anti-tumor effect in patient-derived xenograft model. Our data demonstrated that autophagy played a cyto-protective role in talazoparib-treated pediatric CML and co-treatment with talazoparib and autophagy inhibitor could induce synergetic anti-tumor effect, providing novel insights for pediatric CML treatment.","['Liu, Yuanyuan', 'Song, Hong', 'Song, Huanqing', 'Feng, Xiaoxia', 'Zhou, Chuan', 'Huo, Zhifang']","['Liu Y', 'Song H', 'Song H', 'Feng X', 'Zhou C', 'Huo Z']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0113-2438'],"['Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450014, China. yuanyuanliu2019@163.com.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450014, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450014, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450014, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450014, China.', 'Department of Pediatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, 450014, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,AMB Express,AMB Express,101561785,,,,,PMC6629728,['NOTNLM'],"['Autophagy', 'Cytotoxicity', 'Pediatric chronic myeloid leukemia', 'Talazoparib']",2019/07/17 06:00,2019/07/17 06:01,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/05/09 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13568-019-0836-z [doi]', '10.1186/s13568-019-0836-z [pii]']",epublish,AMB Express. 2019 Jul 15;9(1):108. doi: 10.1186/s13568-019-0836-z.,,20190715,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

METHODS: Cytotoxicity of (177)Lu-NNV003 was measured in REC-1 (mantle cell lymphoma) and DOHH-2 (diffuse large B cell lymphoma) cell lines. Biodistribution was studied in mice bearing subcutaneous DOHH-2 or MEC-2 (chronic lymphocytic leukaemia) xenografts. The therapeutic effect of a single injection of (177)Lu-NNV003 was measured in mice intravenously or subcutaneously injected with REC-1 cells. Haematological and histopathological assessments were used to evaluate the toxic effect of (177)Lu-NNV003. The immunotherapeutic effect of NNV003 was assessed by measuring binding to Fcgamma receptors, activation of ADCC and ADCP. NNV003's immunogenicity potential was assessed using in silico immunogenicity prediction tools. RESULTS: (177)Lu-NNV003 showed an activity dependent antiproliferative effect in all cell lines. Maximum tumour uptake in vivo was 45% of injected activity/g in MEC-2 tumours and 15% injected activity/g in DOHH-2 tumours. In mice injected intravenously with REC-1 cells, (177)Lu-NNV003 (50-100 MBq/kg) improved survival compared to control groups (p < 0.02). In mice with subcutaneous REC-1 xenografts, 500 MBq/kg (177)Lu-NNV003 extended survival compared to the control treatments (p < 0.005). Transient haematological toxicity was observed in all mice treated with radioactivity. NNV003 induced ADCC and ADCP and was predicted to have a lower immunogenicity potential than its murine counterpart. CONCLUSION: (177)Lu-NNV003 had a significant anti-tumour effect and a favourable toxicity profile. These results warrant further clinical testing in patients with CD37-expressing B cell malignancies.","['Maaland, Astri Fjelde', 'Heyerdahl, Helen', ""O'Shea, Adam"", 'Eiriksdottir, Bergthora', 'Pascal, Veronique', 'Andersen, Jan Terje', 'Kolstad, Arne', 'Dahle, Jostein']","['Maaland AF', 'Heyerdahl H', ""O'Shea A"", 'Eiriksdottir B', 'Pascal V', 'Andersen JT', 'Kolstad A', 'Dahle J']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5282-6571'],"['Nordic Nanovector ASA, Kjelsasveien 168 B, 0884, Oslo, Norway. amaaland@nordicnanovector.com.', 'Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway. amaaland@nordicnanovector.com.', 'Nordic Nanovector ASA, Kjelsasveien 168 B, 0884, Oslo, Norway.', 'Nordic Nanovector ASA, Kjelsasveien 168 B, 0884, Oslo, Norway.', 'ArcticLAS ehf, Krokhalsi 5d, 110, Reykjavik, Iceland.', 'Nordic Nanovector ASA, Kjelsasveien 168 B, 0884, Oslo, Norway.', 'Centre for Immune Regulation, Department of Immunology, Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Pharmacology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Oslo and Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway.', 'Department of Oncology, Oslo University Hospital, Radiumhospitalet, Oslo, Norway.', 'Jebsen Center for Cancer Immunotherapy, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.', 'Nordic Nanovector ASA, Kjelsasveien 168 B, 0884, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,101140988,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (CD37 protein, human)', '0 (Immunoconjugates)', '0 (Radioisotopes)', '0 (Tetraspanins)', '5H0DOZ21UJ (Lutetium)', 'BRH40Y9V1Q (Lutetium-177)', 'CPW7BR9UY7 (tetulomab tetraxetan lu-177)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/chemistry', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*chemistry', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoconjugates/*therapeutic use', 'Immunotherapy', 'Lutetium/*chemistry', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Radioimmunotherapy', 'Radioisotopes/*chemistry', 'Radiometry', 'Tetraspanins/*chemistry', 'Tissue Distribution']",PMC6717602,['NOTNLM'],"['CD37', 'Chronic lymphocytic Leukaemia', 'Diffuse large B cell lymphoma', 'Lutetium-177', ""Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma"", 'Radioimmunoconjugate', 'Radioimmunotherapy']",2019/07/17 06:00,2020/10/21 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2018/12/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/21 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00259-019-04417-1 [doi]', '10.1007/s00259-019-04417-1 [pii]']",ppublish,Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging. 2019 Oct;46(11):2311-2321. doi: 10.1007/s00259-019-04417-1.

To investigate CEBPA mutant AML, we performed microscale, in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and identified a set of aberrantly activated enhancers, exclusively occupied by the leukemia-associated CEBPA-p30 isoform. Comparing gene expression changes in human CEBPA mutant AML and the corresponding Cebpa (Lp30) mouse model, we identified Nt5e, encoding CD73, as a cross-species AML gene with an upstream leukemic enhancer physically and functionally linked to the gene. Increased expression of CD73, mediated by the CEBPA-p30 isoform, sustained leukemic growth via the CD73/A2AR axis. Notably, targeting of this pathway enhanced survival of AML-transplanted mice. Our data thus indicate a first-in-class link between a cancer driver mutation in a TF and a druggable, direct transcriptional target.","['Jakobsen, Janus S', 'Laursen, Linea G', 'Schuster, Mikkel B',

Amoebae used in this study were isolated from the bronchial aspirate of a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and atypical symptoms of pneumonia. We found statistically significant differences in the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in the eye of immunocompetent mice at 8, 16, and 24 days after Acanthamoeba spp. infection (dpi) compared to control group. Immunosuppressed mice showed significant differences in the expression of TLR2 at 16 and 24 dpi compared to uninfected animals. Our results indicate that TLR2 and TLR4 are upregulated in the eyes of mice in response to Acanthamoeba spp. We suggest that it is possible for trophozoites to migrate through the optic nerve from the brain to the eyes. The course of disseminated acanthamoebiasis may be influenced by the host's immunological status, and the observed changes in expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in the host's organs may indicate the role of these receptors in the pathomechanism of acanthamoebiasis.","['Kot, Karolina', 'Kosik-Bogacka, Danuta', 'Lanocha-Arendarczyk, Natalia', 'Wojtkowiak-Giera, Agnieszka', 'Kolasa-Wolosiuk, Agnieszka']","['Kot K', 'Kosik-Bogacka D', 'Lanocha-Arendarczyk N', 'Wojtkowiak-Giera A', 'Kolasa-Wolosiuk A']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-0051-2295', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3796-5493', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-1755-155X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6933-7643']","['Department of Biology and Medical Parasitology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, 70-204 Szczecin, Poland.', 'Independent of Pharmaceutical Botany, Department of Biology and Medical Parasitology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, 70-204 Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Biology and Medical Parasitology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, 70-204 Szczecin, Poland.', 'Department of Biology and Medical Parasitology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Fredry 10, 61-701 Poznan, Poland.', 'Department of Histology and Embryology, Pomeranian Medical University in Szczecin, 70-204 Szczecin, Poland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Biomed Res Int,BioMed research international,101600173,"['0 (Eye Proteins)', '0 (TLR7 protein, human)', '0 (Tlr2 protein, mouse)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 2)', '0 (Toll-Like Receptor 7)']",IM,,"['Acanthamoeba/immunology', 'Amebiasis/*immunology/pathology', 'Animals', 'Eye/*immunology/parasitology', 'Eye Proteins/*immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Toll-Like Receptor 2/*immunology', 'Toll-Like Receptor 7/*immunology']",PMC6594330,,,2019/07/17 06:00,2019/12/20 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/03/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/20 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1155/2019/1401894 [doi]'],epublish,Biomed Res Int. 2019 Jun 12;2019:1401894. doi: 10.1155/2019/1401894. eCollection 2019.,,20190612,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was previously shown that various mechanisms and expression patterns of Ikaros are linked to a variety of cancers. We hypothesized that aberrant methylation (hypomethylation) of the IKZF1 promoter region might be one of the causes of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). In B-ALL patients, an increased expression of this gene is a potential cause of B-cell differentiation arrest and proliferation induction. Therefore, as more than 90% of patients with ALL are <15 years old, we investigated the methylation pattern of the IKZF1 promoter in childhood B-ALL. Methods: Twenty-five newly diagnosed B-ALL cases were included (all younger than 15 yr). In addition, we selected 25 healthy age- and sex-matched children as the control group. We collected the blood samples in EDTA-containing tubes and isolated lymphocytes from whole blood using Ficoll 1.077 Lymphosep. Next, we extracted genomic DNA with the phenol/chloroform method. Two microgram of DNA per sample was treated with sodium bisulfite using the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit, followed by an assessment of DNA methylation by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the bisulfite-modified genomic DNA. Results: Our data highlighted a hypomethylated status of the IKZF1 promoter in the ALL cases (96% of the cases were unmethylated). In contrast, the control group samples were partially methylated (68%).

Methods: This was a cross-sectional, HSCT survivor-spouse caregiver matching study to determine quality of life (QoL) and depression among HSCT survivors and their caregivers. QoL and depression were measured with the World Health Organization Quality of Life: Brief Version (26 items) and the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, respectively. Data from 97 married couples were analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences in overall QoL and psychological, social, and environmental health between survivors and spouse caregivers (P=0.345, 0.424, 0.415, and 0.253); however, physical QoL was better in the spouse caregiver group (P=0.011). There was no difference in mean depression scale scores (5.3 vs. 5.1, P=0.812) or proportion of severe depression (15.6% vs. 13.7%, P=0.270) between the two groups. We found that family income had a significant impact on overall QoL and environmental health among spouse caregivers (P=0.013 and 0.023), and female gender, co-morbidities, and family income were the important factors associated with depression among spouse caregivers (P=0.007, 0.017 and 0.049). Conclusion: This study found that there were no significant differences in QoL or level of depression between HSCT survivors and their spouse caregivers.

However, the dynamics of PLK1 transcription in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the transcript dynamics of PLK1 and determine its role in the pathophysiology of MDS. Methods: PLK1 mRNA obtained from the bone marrow samples of 67 patients with MDS, 16 patients with secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML), and 10 healthy controls were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR and compared according to various clinical parameters. Results: The median PLK1 expression levels differed slightly, but not significantly, between MDS and sAML patients [661.21 (range, 29.38-8,987.31) vs. 1,462.05 (32.22-5,734.09), respectively], but were significantly higher (P<0.001) than the levels in the healthy controls [19.0 (1.60-49.90)]. Further analyses of PLK1 levels according to the WHO classification of MDS, prognostic risk groups, karyotype risk groups, marrow blast percentage, and depth of cytopenia did not reveal any significant associations. In patients progressing to sAML, PLK1 expression levels differed significantly according to the presence or absence of resistance to hypomethylation treatment (2,470.58 vs. 415.98, P=0.03). Conclusion: PLK1 is upregulated in MDS patients; however, its role in the pathophysiology of MDS is unclear. Gene upregulation in cases with pharmacotherapeutic resistance warrants further investigation.","['Min, Kyoung Il', 'Park, Silvia', 'Shin, Seung-Hwan', 'Kwon, Yong-Rim', 'Kim, Hye-Joung', 'Kim, Yoo Jin']","['Min KI', 'Park S', 'Shin SH', 'Kwon YR', 'Kim HJ', 'Kim YJ']",,"[""Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Seoul St. Mary's Hematology Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", ""Department of Hematology, Yeoido St. Mary's Hospital, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea."", 'Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Laboratory of Hematological Disease and Immunology, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.', 'Leukemia Research Institute, College of Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul, Korea.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Blood Res,Blood research,101605247,,,,,PMC6614105,['NOTNLM'],"['DNA methylation', 'Gene expression', 'Myelodysplastic syndromes', 'Polo-like kinase 1', 'Protein-serine-threonine kinases']",2019/07/17 06:00,2019/07/17 06:01,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2018/11/09 00:00 [received]', '2018/11/22 00:00 [revised]', '2018/11/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/17 06:01 [medline]']",['10.5045/br.2019.54.2.102 [doi]'],ppublish,Blood Res. 2019 Jun;54(2):102-107. doi: 10.5045/br.2019.54.2.102.

The relationship between patient characteristics and severe adverse events (AEs) has yet to be determined. Objective: To analyze the relationship between the MTX concentration and toxicities and to identify the risk predictors from patient characteristics for severe AEs during HD-MTX therapy in children with ALL. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on children with ALL who were treated with 388 HD-MTX infusions. The chi-square test and univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the relationship between the MTX concentrations and toxicities and to identify predictors for severe AEs. Results: Febrile neutropenia (P=0.000) and vomiting (P=0.034) were more likely to occur if the infusion had an MTX level >/=1 mumol/L at 44 h, but other toxicities had no correlations with MTX concentration. Predictive factors for toxicities were as follows: higher risk stratification and higher values of albumin (ALB) for leucopenia, higher values of white blood cell count (WBC) for anemia, higher values of ALB and creatinine (Cr) for neutropenia, higher risk stratification and higher 44-h MTX concentration for febrile neutropenia, higher values of alanine transferase (ALT) for elevated ALT, higher values of ALT for elevated aspartate transferase (AST), and higher values of total bilirubin (TBil) for vomiting. Conclusion: Routine monitoring of 44-h MTX concentrations is essential to identify patients at high risk of developing febrile neutropenia and vomiting. This study may provide a reference for clinicians to distinguish patients with a relatively high risk of severe AEs based on certain characteristics before HD-MTX infusion.","['Li, Xiao', 'Sui, Zhongguo', 'Jing, Fanbo', 'Xu, Wen', 'Li, Xiangpeng', 'Guo, Qie', 'Sun, Shuhong', 'Bi, Xiaolin']","['Li X', 'Sui Z', 'Jing F', 'Xu W', 'Li X', 'Guo Q', 'Sun S', 'Bi X']",,"[""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Clinical Pharmacy, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong 266003, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Nutrition, The Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, Qingdao, Shandong, 266003, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Cancer Manag Res,Cancer management and research,101512700,,,,,PMC6615715,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'high-dose methotrexate', 'methotrexate concentration', 'patient characteristics', 'risk predictors', 'toxicities']",2019/07/17 06:00,2019/07/17 06:01,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/17 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/CMAR.S207959 [doi]', '207959 [pii]']",epublish,Cancer Manag Res. 2019 Jul 5;11:6265-6274. doi: 10.2147/CMAR.S207959. eCollection 2019.,,20190705,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have received much more attention as alternative chemotherapeutic agents. This study aimed to examined the cytotoxicity of a novel AMP myristoly-CM4 against chronic myeloid leukemia cells (K562/MDR) and acute lymphocytic leukemia cells (Jurkat), and further investigated its selectivity to clarify the cytotoxic mechanism. Materials and methods: In this study, the cytotoxicity and selectivity of myristoly-CM4 against K562/MDR and Jurkat cells were assessed in vitro, and the anticancer mechanism responsible for its cytotoxicity and selectivity was further investigated. Results: Myristoly-CM4 was cytotoxic to these leukemia cell lines (IC50 2-4 muM) and was less cytotoxic to normal cells (HEK-293, L02 cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and erythrocytes). Myristoyl-CM4 had stronger affinity to K562/MDR and Jurkat cells than to normal cells, while the contents of phosphatidylserine and sialic acids on the cell surfaces of K562/MDR and Jurkat cells were significantly higher than that of HEK293 cells. The myristoyl group effectively mediated the internalization of myristoyl-CM4 to leukemia cells. After internalization, myristoyl-CM4 could target mitochondria and affected mitochondrial function, including disruption of Deltapsim, increasing the accumulation of ROS, increasing the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, activating caspase 9 and 3, and PARP to induce mitochondria-dependent apoptosis in both K562/MDR and Jurkat cells. Myristoyl-CM4 also induced K562/MDR cell necrosis by directive membrane disruption, and significantly decreased the level of P-glycoprotein in K562/MDR cells. Conclusion: These results suggested that myristoyl-CM4 showed selective cytotoxicity to leukemia K562/MDR and Jurkat cells by apoptosis and/or necrosis pathway. Myristoyl-CM4, thus, appears to be a promising candidate for leukemia treatment, including multidrug-resistant leukemia.","['Zhang, Huidan', 'Han, Dongju', 'Lv, Tongtong', 'Liu, Kehang', 'Yang, Yunqing', 'Xu, Xixi', 'Chen, Yuqing']","['Zhang H', 'Han D', 'Lv T', 'Liu K', 'Yang Y', 'Xu X', 'Chen Y']",,"[""Department of Biochemistry, Life Sciences College, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, Life Sciences College, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, Life Sciences College, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, Life Sciences College, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, Life Sciences College, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, Life Sciences College, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Biochemistry, Life Sciences College, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Drug Des Devel Ther,"Drug design, development and therapy",101475745,"['0 (Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides)', '0 (CM4 peptide, Bombyx mori)', '0 (Reactive Oxygen Species)', '0 (myristoyl-CM4)']",IM,,"['Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mitochondria/drug effects/metabolism', 'Necrosis/*drug therapy', 'Reactive Oxygen Species/analysis/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",PMC6612960,['NOTNLM'],"['apoptosis', 'leukemia', 'multi-drug resistance', 'myristoyl-CM4', 'necrosis', 'selectivity']",2019/07/17 06:00,2020/01/22 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/03/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/09 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/22 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2147/DDDT.S207224 [doi]', '207224 [pii]']",epublish,Drug Des Devel Ther. 2019 Jul 2;13:2153-2167. doi: 10.2147/DDDT.S207224. eCollection 2019.,,20190702,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cancer cells also acquire and depend on cancer-specific epigenetic changes. To conclusively demonstrate the crucial relevance of the epigenetic programme for the tumourigenicity of the cancer cells, we used cellular reprogramming technology to reverse these epigenetic changes. We reprogrammed human PDAC cultures using three different techniques - (1) lentivirally via induction of Yamanaka Factors (OSKM), (2) the pluripotency-associated gene OCT4 and the microRNA mir-302, or (3) using episomal vectors as a safer alternative without genomic integration. We found that induction with episomal vectors was the most efficient method to reprogram primary human PDAC cultures as well as primary human fibroblasts that served as positive controls. Successful reprogramming was evidenced by immunostaining, alkaline phosphatase staining, and real-time PCR. Intriguingly, reprogramming of primary human PDAC cultures drastically reduced their in vivo tumourigenicity, which appeared to be driven by the cells' enhanced differentiation and loss of stemness upon transplantation. Our study demonstrates that reprogrammed primary PDAC cultures are functionally distinct from parental PDAC cells resulting in drastically reduced tumourigenicity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, epigenetic alterations account at least in part for the tumourigenicity and aggressiveness of pancreatic cancer, supporting the notion that epigenetic modulators could be a suitable approach to improve the dismal outcome of patients with pancreatic cancer.","['Khoshchehreh, Reyhaneh', 'Totonchi, Mehdi', 'Carlos Ramirez, Juan', 'Torres, Raul', 'Baharvand, Hossein', 'Aicher, Alexandra', 'Ebrahimi, Marzieh', 'Heeschen, Christopher']","['Khoshchehreh R', 'Totonchi M', 'Carlos Ramirez J', 'Torres R', 'Baharvand H', 'Aicher A', 'Ebrahimi M', 'Heeschen C']",,"['Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, University of Science and Culture, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Genetics, Reproductive Biomedicine Research Center, Royan Institute for Reproductive Biomedicine, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'VIVEBioTECH, San Sebastian, 20009, Spain.', 'Molecular Cytogenetics and Genome Editing Unit, Human Cancer Genetics Program, Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), Madrid, 28029, Spain.', 'Josep Carreras Leukemia Research Institute and Department of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, 08036, Spain.', 'Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Developmental Biology, University of Science and Culture, Tehran, Iran.', 'Gene and Stem Cell Therapy Program, Centenary Institute, the University of Sydney, Camperdown, 2050, NSW, Australia. aicher_a@yahoo.com.', 'Molecular Pathology Programme, Spanish National Cancer Research Centre (CNIO), Madrid, 28029, Madrid, Spain. aicher_a@yahoo.com.', 'Department of Stem Cells and Developmental Biology, Cell Science Research Center, Royan Institute for Stem Cell Biology and Technology, ACECR, Tehran, Iran.

Kostmann syndrome, or severe congenital neutropenia, is an autosomal recessive disease that affects the production of neutrophils. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common type of thyroid malignancy associated with gene alterations, including in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway gene. Translocation of the ETS variant 6/neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 3 (ETV6/NTRK3) gene has been implicated in radiation-induced and pediatric forms of thyroid carcinoma but has rarely been described in sporadic PTC. This report is of a case of PTC in a patient with Kostmann syndrome associated with ETV6/NTRK3 gene translocation. CASE REPORT A 32-year-old woman with a history of Kostmann syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) was diagnosed with PTC with cervical lymph node metastases and soft tissue invasion following total thyroidectomy and bilateral modified radical neck dissection. Her postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) scan confirmed lymph node metastasis. Gene expression studies identified increased expression of iodine-handling genes and ETV6/NTRK3 gene fusion. Because of the bone marrow compromise due to Kostmann syndrome and AML, a careful genomic and molecular analysis was performed to guide therapy. CONCLUSIONS This is the first reported case of the association between PTC, Kostmann syndrome, and ETV6/NTRK3 gene translocation in which multimodality treatment planning was optimized by genomic profiling.","['Han, Soo', 'Ehrhardt, John Jr', 'Shukla, Savya', 'Elkbuli, Adel', 'Nikiforov, Yuri E', 'Gulec, Seza A']","['Han S', 'Ehrhardt J Jr', 'Shukla S', 'Elkbuli A', 'Nikiforov YE', 'Gulec SA']",,"['Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Radiology, Aventura Hospital and Medical Center, Aventura, FL, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.', 'Miami Cancer Research Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Kendall Regional Medical Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine, Florida International University, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Miami Cancer Research Center, Miami, FL, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, Aventura Hospital and Medical Center, Miami, FL, USA.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Case Rep,The American journal of case reports,101489566,"['0 (ETS translocation variant 6 protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Receptor, trkC)', 'Neutropenia, Severe Congenital, Autosomal Recessive 3']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Congenital Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes/complications/genetics/*therapy', 'Female', 'Gene Fusion/genetics', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/complications/*congenital/genetics/therapy', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-ets/genetics', 'Receptor, trkC/genetics', 'Repressor Proteins/genetics', '*Theranostic Nanomedicine', 'Thyroid Cancer, Papillary/complications/genetics/*therapy', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/complications/genetics/*therapy']",PMC6647623,,,2019/07/17 06:00,2020/01/25 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/25 06:00 [medline]']","['916143 [pii]', '10.12659/AJCR.916143 [doi]']",epublish,Am J Case Rep. 2019 Jul 16;20:1027-1034. doi: 10.12659/AJCR.916143.,,20190716,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Several candidate genes have been reported to be significantly associated with high-altitude adaptation. Megakaryocytic leukemia 1 (MKL1) is a transcriptional regulator, which plays crucial roles in the phenotypic modulation of smooth muscle cells. To explore whether MKL1 gene is involved in high-altitude adaptation, we performed genetic association study between MKL1 gene polymorphisms and high-altitude adaptation. We recruited 595 Tibetans from the Qinghai-Tibet plateau and 442 Hans living at low altitude. The SNP rs59098711 locus in the MKL1 gene was genotyped using the MassARRAY assays. We compared the genotypes and allele frequency distributions of rs59098711 between the Hans and Tibetans. The results showed that the genotypes of rs59098711 are significantly different between these two populations (P<0.05). We further compared the genotypes of rs59098711 between Tibetans and other ethnic groups using data from various public databases. We also observed that the genotypes of rs59098711 are significantly different between Tibetans and these other populations (P<0.05). Bioinformatics analyses suggested that rs59098711 could be located at the enhancer region and regulate the expression of the MKL1 gene. Additional study of gene expression data from available public datasets showed that MKL1 gene was up-regulated in a hypobaric hypoxic environment. Our results suggested that the genetic polymorphism rs59098711 locus of the MKL1 gene is associated with high-altitude adaption.","['Zhang, Qing', 'Ping, Jie', 'Zhang, Hao Xiang', 'Kang, Bo', 'Zhou, Gang Qiao']","['Zhang Q', 'Ping J', 'Zhang HX', 'Kang B', 'Zhou GQ']",,"['Department of Epidemiology, School of PublicHealth, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, National Center for Protein Sciences at Beijing, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 1002206, China.', 'The No.954 Hospital of PLA, Shannan 856100, China.', 'The No.954 Hospital of PLA, Shannan 856100, China.', 'Department of Epidemiology, School of PublicHealth, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Proteomics, National Center for Protein Sciences at Beijing, Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine, Beijing 1002206, China.', 'Center for Global Health, School of Public Health, Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing 211166, China.']",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Yi Chuan,Yi chuan = Hereditas,9436478,"['0 (MRTFA protein, human)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,,"['Adaptation, Biological/*genetics', '*Altitude', 'Humans', '*Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide', 'Tibet', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics']",,,,2019/07/17 06:00,2019/08/15 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.16288/j.yczz.19-049 [doi]'],ppublish,Yi Chuan. 2019 Jul 20;41(7):634-643. doi: 10.16288/j.yczz.19-049.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many authors reported that MDR1 gene influences individual susceptibility to cancers. We carried out the present case-control study to investigate the impact of MDR1 gene in the predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in a sample of Moroccan population. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis study to discuss our results and to better highlight the influence of MDR1 gene on the susceptibility of AML. METHODS: The study included 187 AML patients and 206 controls. Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cell by salting method. Polymorphisms of G2677 T and C3435 T were genotyped by Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP), using Mbo I and Ban I restriction enzymes. Statistical analysis was performed using the software SPSS (version 19.0; SPPS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and MedCalcv.11.6.1.0 software. RESULTS: No statistically significant differences in genotype and allelic distribution were found in G2677 T and C3435 T polymorphisms between AML cases and controls in the Moroccan population. On the other hand, we found that the age of onset of AML in patients with homozygous mutant genotype was statistically lower than in patients with either the heterozygous or wild type genotype for both polymorphisms (P = 0.006; P = 0.03). Meta-analysis showed a significant association of C3435 T, G2677 T polymorphisms on the susceptibility of AML when considering the recessive and the allelic models.

Elderly patients particularly often relapse, leading to a 5-year overall survival (OS) of only 20%. In an effort to improve outcomes while minimizing toxicities, novel targeted therapies have been developed: monoclonal antibodies against CD19, CD20, and CD22; tyrosine kinase inhibitors; chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies; and BH3 mimetics.

Previous studies have suggested that HHT combined with ATO can synergistically kill U937 cells, and HHT has also demonstrated the ability to kill leukemia stem cells. We evaluated whether HHT combined with ATO can systematically kill leukemia stem cells (LSCs) and explored the synergistic effect and molecular mechanism. METHODS: CCK-8 was used to detect cell viability. The changes of cell cycle (PI staining), apoptosis (Annexin V/PI) and surface markers (CD34, CD38, CD96, CD45) were detected by flow cytometry. The cells of CD34+ primary leukemia and CD38- KG-1, and TF-1 were separated by flow cytometry. High-throughput mRNA sequencing was used to analysis mRNA level changes after the application of the two drugs. Western blot was used to verify the changes of pathway protein expression. NRG mice were used as the receptor of xenograft model. Histological H&E staining assess the invaded ability of leukemia cells, and laser scanning confocal microscopy evaluated the molecule markers change. RESULTS: HHT and ATO synergistically killed KG-1 (CD34(+)/CD96(+)/CD38(+)/(-)) and Kasumi-1 (CD34(+)/CD38(-)) cells. Their combination had a stronger effect of inducing apoptosis and blocking the cell cycle than HHT or ATO administrator alone, meanwhile significantly reducing the numbers of LSCs. Further, CD34(+)CD38(-) cells in KG-1, KG-1a, TF-1, and primary leukemia cells were more sensitive to HHT and ATO. High-throughput mRNA sequencing suggested that HHT alone could significantly upregulate molecules related to the Notch, P53, and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. When combined with ATO, HHT further upregulated P53, whereas HHT-induced NF-kappaB pathway activation was significantly suppressed. Western blot analysis verified the change of protein expression in the above pathways and further demonstrated that GSI, could eliminate these effects. In vivo, HHT combined with ATO significantly reduced the LSC burden, and weakened the expression of LSC markers. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence that HHT combined with arsenic can synergistically kill LSCs in vitro and in vivo, along with identification of the underlying mechanism, highlighting a potentially effective treatment strategy.","['Tan, Ming', 'Zhang, Qian', 'Yuan, Xiaohong', 'Chen, Yuanzhong', 'Wu, Yong']","['Tan M', 'Zhang Q', 'Yuan X', 'Chen Y', 'Wu Y']",,"['Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Medical University graduate school, 1 Xuefu North Road, Fuzhou, 350112, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, China.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, China. chenyz@mail.fjmu.edu.cn.', 'Fujian Institute of Hematology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory on Hematology, Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, 29 Xinquan Road, Fuzhou, 350001, Fujian, China. wuyong9195@126.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Exp Clin Cancer Res,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,8308647,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Arsenic Trioxide/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects', 'Homoharringtonine/*administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects', 'U937 Cells', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6631946,['NOTNLM'],"['Arsenic trioxide', 'Homoharringtonine', 'LSC', 'Notch', 'Xenograft leukemia model']",2019/07/17 06:00,2020/01/14 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/04/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13046-019-1295-8 [doi]', '10.1186/s13046-019-1295-8 [pii]']",epublish,J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Jul 15;38(1):308. doi: 10.1186/s13046-019-1295-8.,,20190715,,['Min201704/Construction project of Fujian medical center of hematology'],,,,,,,['J Exp Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Sep 16;38(1):407.

Participants who attended the Children's Oncology Group (COG) State of the Science Symposium on symptom distress completed an anonymous survey. The purpose was to explore participant perceptions of symptom distress experienced by children receiving cancer treatment on clinical trials, determine how symptom distress is currently assessed at COG institutions, and to identify what interventions are used to reduce symptom distress for these children. Among the 90 symposium attendees, 72% completed the survey, the majority (92%) of whom were nurses. The five most distressing symptoms in children with cancer enrolled on clinical trials identified by survey respondents were nausea/vomiting, fatigue, pain, anxiety, and sleep disturbances. Results from our survey also suggest that symptom distress may differ by disease type. For example, symptoms associated with leukemia/lymphoma included steroid side effects, procedural pain, and neuropathy. The majority of respondents (90%) also reported that symptoms go unrecognized by health care providers. The most commonly described unrecognized symptoms were behavioral (i.e., sadness, anxiety, fear, depression, and emotional needs; 45%) and fatigue (19%). Key focus areas reported by respondents included informal and inconsistent symptom assessment, the need for uniform measurement tools, and improved documentation of symptom-related distress. Management of symptom-related distress is an important aspect of pediatric oncology nursing. Further exploration of symptom distress experienced by children with specific types of cancers, and the development of standardized symptom assessment processes, will provide a foundation for developing future interventions aimed at alleviating symptom-related distress.","['Skeens, Micah A', 'Cullen, Patsy', 'Stanek, Joe', 'Hockenberry, Marilyn']","['Skeens MA', 'Cullen P', 'Stanek J', 'Hockenberry M']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-6786-8128'],"[""1 Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."", '2 Regis University, Denver, CO, USA.', ""1 Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, OH, USA."", '3 Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,8917825,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Female', 'Health Personnel/*psychology/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*nursing/*psychology', 'Oncology Nursing/*methods', 'Pediatric Nursing/*methods', 'Stress, Physiological', 'Stress, Psychological/*nursing', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Symptom Assessment/*nursing']",PMC7197224,['NOTNLM'],"[""*Children's Oncology Group"", '*survey', '*symptom distress', '*symptom science']",2019/07/17 06:00,2020/05/06 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/06 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1177/1043454219858608 [doi]'],ppublish,J Pediatr Oncol Nurs. 2019 Jul/Aug;36(4):287-293. doi: 10.1177/1043454219858608.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fully automated methods not only provide enhanced precision and accuracy, but also enable reliable measurements of mRNA content and cellular indices. However, problems still exist, such as interference. The aim of the present study was to investigate the interferents of Sysmex XN 9000 reticulocyte analysis and ensure the accuracy of the results. METHODS: We collected a total of 510 specimens from normal control patients and patients with various diseases including anemias, leukemias, infectious diseases, immune diseases, kidney disease, etc. Correlation of the agreement for reticulocytes between the new methylene blue (NMB) visual microscopy method and automated reticulocyte counting was evaluated by paired sample method according to the CLSI-ICSH document H44-A2-Methods for Reticulocyte Count. Blood smear microscopic examination was carried out on the disturbed samples, and the interferents were analyzed with the medical history, flagging algorithms, the warning information, and the microscopic examination. RESULTS: A total of 44 (8.6%) cases exhibited interference. The main interferents of spuriously high reticulocyte count were caused by parasites, such as malaria, as well as suspicious autofluorescence due to drugs, while the main interferents of spuriously low reticulocyte count were caused by RBC fragments. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of potential interferences may be accomplished through alarm information and flagging algorithms incorporated into the instrument and by examination of a blood film to ensure absence of relevant interferences.","['Jiang, Haoqin', 'Wang, Ji', 'Wang, Kaijun', 'Gu, Jianfei', 'Chen, Jian', 'Wang, Zhicheng']","['Jiang H', 'Wang J', 'Wang K', 'Gu J', 'Chen J', 'Wang Z']",,,['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Clin Lab,Clinical laboratory,9705611,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/blood', 'Automation, Laboratory/*instrumentation/methods', 'Blood Cell Count/*instrumentation/methods', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood', 'Malaria/blood', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Reticulocyte Count/*instrumentation/methods', 'Reticulocytes/cytology/*metabolism', 'Young Adult']",,,,2019/07/17 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/07/17 06:00'],"['2019/07/17 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/17 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]']",['10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.181245 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Lab. 2019 Jul 1;65(7). doi: 10.7754/Clin.Lab.2019.181245.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GCIII, a single-arm observational study, used new risk stratification, replaced consolidation chemotherapy with a standard number of cycles and introduced surveillance for all stage I MGCTs. Pure teratomas were registered to understand their natural history. METHODS: Patients with MGCTs were stratified to three risk groups - low risk (LR), intermediate risk (IR) and high risk (HR), using stage and prognostic factors. Patients with alpha fetoprotein (AFP) >10,000 kU/L, stage IV disease (except testis <5 years and all germinomas) or stage II-IV mediastinal tumour were classified HR. Stage I tumours (LR) received chemotherapy only if disease progressed. IR and HR patients received 4 and 6 JEB cycles, respectively. Carboplatin dose was calculated using glomerular filtration rate to give an area under the curve of 7.9 ml/m(2).min. RESULTS: Eighty-six patients with MGCTs were enrolled from 2005 to 2009: 59% female, median age, 5.7 years. Twenty-five patients were LR, 21 IR and 38 HR. Seven LR patients had disease progression; all were successfully treated with chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) for the whole group was 97%; 5-year event-free survival for JEb-treated patients was 92%, and OS, 95%. JEb was well tolerated with no observed significant hearing or renal side-effects. There was no discernible difference in carboplatin dose whether calculated by body surface area or creatinine clearance.

In this retrospective series, we report outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) in patients with hematologic disorders associated with SAMD9/SAMD9L mutations. Twelve patients underwent allogeneic HCT for MDS (n=10), congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (n=1), and dyskeratosis congenita (n=1). Exome sequencing revealed heterozygous mutations in SAMD9 (n=6) or SAMD9L (n=6) genes. Four SAMD9 patients had features of MIRAGE syndrome. Median age at HCT was 2.8 years (range, 1.2 to 12.8 years). Conditioning was myeloablative in 9 cases and reduced intensity in 3 cases. Syndrome-related comorbidities (diarrhea, infections, adrenal insufficiency, malnutrition, and electrolyte imbalance) were present in MIRAGE syndrome cases. One patient with a familial SAMD9L mutation, MDS, and morbid obesity failed to engraft and died of refractory acute myeloid leukemia. The other 11 patients achieved neutrophil engraftment. Acute post-transplant course was complicated by syndrome-related comorbidities in MIRAGE cases. A patient with SAMD9L-associated MDS died of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. The other 10 patients had resolution of hematologic disorder and sustained peripheral blood donor chimerism. Ten of 12 patients were alive with a median follow-up of 3.1 years (range, 0.1 to 14.7 years).

Outcomes of alternative donor HCT are less favorable, however. In patients without FA, several reports have documented stable engraftment and/or a low risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) using unmanipulated HLA-mismatched related donors and post-HCT cyclophosphamide (PT-CY) for GVHD prophylaxis. Data on the use of this approach in patients with FA are scarce, and thus we launched a study of HLA-mismatched related donor HCT in these patient. Here we report our findings in 19 patients. The conditioning was fludarabine 30 mg/m(2)/day for 5 days, antithymocyte globulin 5 mg/kg/day for 4 days, and total body irradiation (total dose, 200 cGy). GVHD prophylaxis was cyclosporine and mycophenolate and reduced doses of PT-CY, 25 mg/kg, on days +3 and +5. All patients exhibited absolute neutrophil count recovery. Grade III-IV acute GVHD occurred in 3 patients, and chronic GVHD occurred in 1 patient. At a mean follow-up of 38.3 +/- 5.8 months, the 5-year probability of overall survival for our patients was 89.2% +/- 7.2%. The regimen was well tolerated; hemorrhagic cystitis occurred in 7 patients, and severe mucositis occurred in 5 patients. There were 2 deaths; the primary cause of death was severe GVHD in 1 patient and leukemia recurrence in the other. We conclude that in patients with FA lacking a matched related donor, the use of mismatched related HCT with low-dose PT-CY is a viable option; it is well tolerated, with a high rate of engraftment and an acceptable incidence of GVHD.","['Ayas, Mouhab', 'Siddiqui, Khawar', 'Al-Jefri, Abdullah', 'Al-Ahmari, Ali', 'Ghemlas, Ibrahim', 'Al-Saedi, Hawazen', 'Alanazi, Awatif', 'Jafri, Rafat', 'Ayas, Mohamad F', 'Al-Seraihi, Amal']","['Ayas M', 'Siddiqui K', 'Al-Jefri A', 'Al-Ahmari A', 'Ghemlas I', 'Al-Saedi H', 'Alanazi A', 'Jafri R', 'Ayas MF', 'Al-Seraihi A']",,"['Department of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that long intergenic non-coding RNA 00662 (LINC00662) is overexpressed in multiple cancers and facilitates cancer development and progression. However, whether LINC00662 is involved in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains unknown. This study was aimed to explore the expression, biological function and regulatory mechanism of LINC00662 in AML. Here, we found that LINC00662 was significantly increased in AML tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of LINC00662 significantly reduced the growth of AML cells and upregulated AML cell apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of LINC00662 promoted AML cell growth. MicroRNA-340-5p (miR-340-5p) was predicted as a target of LINC00662. Luciferase reporter assays and RNA pull-down assays confirmed that LINC00662 directly interacted with miR-340-5p. Expression of miR-340-5p was downregulated in AML and silencing of LINC00662 upregulated miR-340-5p expression in AML cells. Moreover, overexpression of miR-340-5p inhibited cell growth and increased apoptosis in AML cells. Inhibition of miR-340-5p significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of LINC00662 silencing on AML cell growth. In addition, Rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) was verified as a target gene of miR-340-5p in AML cells. Restoration of ROCK1 expression partially reversed LINC00662 silencing or miR-340-5p overexpression-mediated inhibitory effect on AML cell growth. Overall, our results demonstrate that LINC00662 contributes to the malignant growth of AML cells by upregulating ROCK1 via sponging miR-340-5p, highlighting the important role of the LINC00662/miR-340-5p/ROCK1 axis in regulating the malignant behavior of AML cells.","['Liu, Yuan', 'Gao, Xiaoyan', 'Tian, Xiaoqing']","['Liu Y', 'Gao X', 'Tian X']",,"['Hematology, The First Hospital of Yulin, Yulin City, Shaanxi Province, 719000, China.', 'Hematology, Yulin No.2 Hospital, Yulin City, Shaanxi Province, 719000, China.

A major limitation in the comparability of the data available is attributed to the differences in diagnostic techniques employed and cat populations sampled. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of L. infantum infection in owned cats across Italy by serological and molecular tests and the identification of potential risk factors. Blood samples from 2,659 cats from northern (n = 1,543), central (n = 471) and southern (n = 645) Italy were tested for antibodies against L. infantum, by an immunofluorescence antibody test and for the parasites' DNA, by real-time PCR. Samples were additionally screened for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) proviral DNAs. An overall cumulative L. infantum prevalence of 3.9% was recorded by serology (3.3%) and/or qPCR (0.8%), with a higher rate (10.5%) in southern Italy. The risk of L. infantum infection in cats was significantly associated to the geographical areas (South vs North and Centre; p<0.0001), age class (from 19 months to 6 years old vs </=18 months old, p = 0.0003), neutering status (not neutered vs neutered, p = 0.0028) and FIV infection (p = 0.0051).Though the role of cats in the epidemiology of L. infantum is still debated, our findings indicate that cats are exposed to and/or infected by this protozoan, mainly in endemic regions of Italy. Hence, a standardization of procedures for a prompt diagnosis of L. infantum infection in cats and for screening cat population is crucial for a better understanding of the epidemiology of feline leishmaniasis, and of the potential role of cats in the transmission cycle of zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis.","['Iatta, Roberta', 'Furlanello, Tommaso', 'Colella, Vito', 'Tarallo, Viviana Domenica', 'Latrofa, Maria Stefania', 'Brianti, Emanuele', 'Trerotoli, Paolo', 'Decaro, Nicola', 'Lorusso, Eleonora', 'Schunack, Bettina', 'Miro, Guadalupe', 'Dantas-Torres, Filipe', 'Otranto, Domenico']","['Iatta R', 'Furlanello T', 'Colella V', 'Tarallo VD', 'Latrofa MS', 'Brianti E', 'Trerotoli P', 'Decaro N', 'Lorusso E', 'Schunack B', 'Miro G', 'Dantas-Torres F', 'Otranto D']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-4903-1479', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7102-9108', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0981-2470', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7518-476X']","['Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Clinica Veterinaria San Marco, Veggiano, Padova, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Faculty of Veterinary and Agricultural Sciences, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Veterinarie, Universita degli Studi di Messina, Messina, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita degli Studi di Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Bayer Animal Health GmbH, Leverkusen, Germany.', 'Departamento de Sanidad Animal, Facultad de Veterinaria, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, Bari, Italy.', 'Department of Immunology, Instituto Aggeu Magalhaes, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Recife, Brazil.', 'Dipartimento di Medicina Veterinaria, Universita degli Studi di Bari, Bari, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS Negl Trop Dis,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,101291488,"['0 (Antibodies, Protozoan)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Protozoan/blood', 'Cat Diseases/*epidemiology/*parasitology', 'Cats', 'Female', 'Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Leishmania infantum/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Leishmaniasis, Visceral/diagnosis/*epidemiology/parasitology/*veterinary', 'Leukemia Virus, Feline/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Male', 'Molecular Diagnostic Techniques/veterinary', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prevalence', 'Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction/veterinary', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk Factors', 'Serologic Tests/veterinary', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",PMC6667148,,,2019/07/16 06:00,2020/01/07 06:00,['2019/07/16 06:00'],"['2019/03/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/30 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1371/journal.pntd.0007594 [doi]', 'PNTD-D-19-00384 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2019 Jul 15;13(7):e0007594. doi: 10.1371/journal.pntd.0007594. eCollection 2019 Jul.,,20190715,,,"['Dr. Bettina Schunack is employed by a commercial company, Bayer Animal Health', 'GmBbH (Germany, Europe).

Over the past decade, the advance in high-throughput sequencing and transcriptome profiling has enabled the identification of circular RNAs (circRNAs) involved in many biological processes and the occurrence and development of diseases. Accumulating evidence has revealed that circRNAs may serve as new biomarkers for diagnosis as well as provide promising therapeutic approaches and novel drug screening strategies for leukemia.

However, whether this association persists after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remains unclear. To further clarify the prognostic role of EGFL7, seventy-one AML patients with EGFL7 expression data who underwent allo-HSCT from The Cancer Genome Atlas database were included and divided into either EGFL7(high) or EGFL7(low) group based on the median EGFL7 expression level. Two groups had similar clinical and molecular characteristics except that the EGFL7(high) group had less frequent NPM1 mutations (P= .001). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that high EGFL7 expressers had shorter OS than the low expressers (P= .040). Univariate analysis showed that high EGFL7 expression, MLL-PTD, RUNX1 and TP53 mutations were associated with short OS (all P< .05). Multivariate analysis indicated that high EGFL7 expression, FLT3-ITD, RUNX1 and TP53 mutations were independent risk factors for OS (all P< .05).

We have observed CD161 expression in some cases of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) and found it to be useful in follow-up and detection of disease after treatment. METHODS: Retrospective review of T-PLL cases with complete flow cytometry data including CD161. RESULTS: We identified 10 cases of T-PLL with flow cytometric evaluation of CD161 available. Six of these cases were positive for CD161 expression. All CD161-positive cases were positive for CD8 with variable CD4 expression, whereas all CD161-negative cases were negative for CD8. In a case with two neoplastic subsets positive and negative for CD8, only the former expressed CD161. CONCLUSIONS: These novel results suggest that CD161 is often aberrantly expressed in a defined subset of T-PLL positive for CD8.

This study characterizes bone marrow findings after ATRA/ATO therapy. METHODS: Bone marrow biopsies from 16 patients treated with ATRA/ATO and seven patients treated with ATRA/chemotherapy (CTX) for APL were evaluated. RESULTS: In ATRA/ATO cases, the marrow was likely to be hypercellular (79%) with a decreased myeloid:erythroid (M:E) ratio (88%), megaloblastoid maturation of erythroid precursors (100%), erythroid atypia (75%), and increased (88%) and atypical (75%) megakaryocytes. Significant myeloid atypia was only seen in extensive residual disease. The ATRA/CTX cases were less likely to be hypercellular (38%), have a M:E ratio of 1:1 or less (0%), exhibit significant erythroid atypia (0%), or have increased (0%) or atypical (38%) megakaryocytes.

In this study, we investigated the effect of tobacco smoking on the risk of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and myeloid leukemia (AML). METHODS: Information about tobacco smoking exposures of the mother before, during, and after pregnancy was collected via PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases through November 5, 2018. We performed to evaluate the association between smoking exposure and the risk of childhood ALL and AML. Study selection, data abstraction, and quality assessment were performed by 2 independent reviewers. Random effects models were used to obtain summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Nineteen case-control studies of childhood leukemia (age < 15 years) conducted in 9 countries from 1974 to 2018. Maternal smoking exposures did not a significant association with childhood ALL (OR = 1.004, 95% CI 0.953-1.058, P = .881) and AML (OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.815-1.038, P = .177) during exposure time windows. However, there was an association with paternal smoking and ALL (OR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.038-1.275, P = .007). Paternal smoking in AML showed there was no association with smoking exposures and childhood AML (OR = 1.133, 95% CI 0.943-1.362, P = .181). Next, maternal daily cigarettes consumption showed no associations with ALL (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.000-1.168, P = .051) during pregnancy. No association with maternal daily smoking and AML (OR = 0.909, 95% CI 0.682-1.211, P = .514). Paternal daily cigarettes consumption was associated with increased risks of childhood ALL (OR = 1.200, 95% CI 1.112-1.302, P = .000). The higher consumption of paternal smoking (more than 10 per day) was significantly related to childhood ALL. Paternal daily smoking consumption also was related to AML (OR = 1.242, 95% CI 1.031-1.496, P = .022). CONCLUSION: Maternal smoking before, during, or after pregnancy was not associated with childhood ALL or AML.

Clinical symptoms related to Type I cryoglobulin (CG) isotype often include skin, neurological and renal manifestations. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 42-year-old woman who initially presented urticaria, palpable purpura in both her upper extremities and legs, eosinophilia and Raynaud phenomenon. Skin biopsy revealed eosinophil infiltration. Monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G-kappaprotein was detected and CG was also positive. DIAGNOSES: The patient was finally diagnosed as MGUS related Type I CG. INTERVENTIONS: Cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone-thalidomide (CDT) therapy was initiated. OUTCOMES: The treatment relieved the skin symptoms efficiently. LESSONS: To our knowledge, this is a rare case of Type I cryoglobulinemic vasulitis with eosinophilia complicated by MGUS, and the effective treatment of cyclophosphamide combined with thalidomide and prednisone may provide a new therapeutic option for cryoglobulinemic vasulitis.","['Wen, Jingjing', 'Xu, Fang', 'Li, Min', 'Zhou, Qiaoling', 'Qu, Wen', 'Liu, Yiping', 'Su, Jing', 'Hu, Hong']","['Wen J', 'Xu F', 'Li M', 'Zhou Q', 'Qu W', 'Liu Y', 'Su J', 'Hu H']",,"['Hematology Department.', 'Hematology Department.', 'Rheumatology Department, Mianyang center hospital, Mianyang, China.', 'Hematology Department.', 'Hematology Department.', 'Hematology Department.', 'Hematology Department.', 'Hematology Department.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Cryoglobulinemia/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Eosinophilia/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy', 'Vasculitis/*complications/diagnosis/drug therapy']",PMC6641847,,,2019/07/16 06:00,2019/07/23 06:00,['2019/07/16 06:00'],"['2019/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000016382 [doi]', '00005792-201907120-00052 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Jul;98(28):e16382. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000016382.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Genomic profile may provide evidence for the solution of therapy. PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported a case of a 51-year-old woman with splenectomy 4 years ago and the postoperative histopathology diagnosis revealed ""splenic hemangioma"" with spontaneous rupture. Two years after the operation, the patient's rechecked abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed multiple hepatic occupations. DIAGNOSES: Pathological test suggested PSA hepatic metastasis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with trans-catheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and a pathological diagnosis of PSA was highly suspected in the hepatic biopsy. Four somatic alterations, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), Fos proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (FOS), MCL1 apoptosis regulator (MCL1), and phosphoinositide-3-kinase regulatory subunit 1 (PIK3R1) were detected in the tumor tissue using a Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. The results prompted that the patient may get clinical benefit from using some agents for targeted therapy, Everolimus, Temsirolimus, or Copanlisib. OUTCOMES: The patient refused targeted therapy. As a result, the patient passed away within 51 months after splenectomy. LESSONS: PSA is an aggressive disease that often presented with a high propensity for metastasis and rupture hemorrhage. Some of these mutations were first discovered in PSA and these findings added new contents to the genomic mutation profile of PSA.","['Cao, Linping', 'Hong, Jiawei', 'Wang, Yacong', 'Yu, Jun', 'Ma, Ruobing', 'Li, Jia', 'Wu, Jian', 'Zheng, Shusen']","['Cao L', 'Hong J', 'Wang Y', 'Yu J', 'Ma R', 'Li J', 'Wu J', 'Zheng S']",,"['Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Department of Surgery.', 'Key Lab of Combined Multi-Organ Transplantation, Ministry of Public Health.', 'Department of Gerontology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, Hangzhou.', 'Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Department of Surgery.', 'OrigiMed, Shanghai, China.', 'OrigiMed, Shanghai, China.', 'Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Department of Surgery.', 'Division of Hepatobiliary and Pancreatic Surgery, Department of Surgery.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (FOS protein, human)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', 'EC 2.7.1.- (PIK3R1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.1.137 (PIK3CA protein, human)']",IM,,"['Class I Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Class Ia Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase', 'Fatal Outcome', 'Female', 'Hemangiosarcoma/genetics/pathology/*surgery', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/*genetics/*secondary/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/genetics', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos/genetics', '*Splenectomy', 'Splenic Neoplasms/genetics/pathology/*surgery']",PMC6641855,,,2019/07/16 06:00,2019/07/23 06:00,['2019/07/16 06:00'],"['2019/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/23 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1097/MD.0000000000016245 [doi]', '00005792-201907120-00017 [pii]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 2019 Jul;98(28):e16245. doi: 10.1097/MD.0000000000016245.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A phase I study was initiated to establish the recommended phase 2 dose of sorafenib combined with vorinostat in patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients received vorinostat (200 to 400 mg by mouth once daily, 5 of 7 d) and sorafenib at standard or reduced doses (400 mg [cohort A] or 200 mg [cohort B] by mouth twice daily). Patients who received 14 days of vorinostat in cycle 1 were evaluable for dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). RESULTS: Sixteen patients were treated. Thirteen patients were evaluable for response. Three patients experienced DLTs, 2 in cohort A (grade [gr] 3 hypokalemia; gr 3 maculopapular rash) and 1 in cohort B (gr 3 hepatic failure; gr 3 hypophosphatemia; gr 4 thrombocytopenia). Eleven patients required dose reductions or omissions for non-DLTtoxicity. Ten patients (77%) had stable disease (SD). The median treatment duration was 4.7 months for response-evaluable patients. One patient with SD was on treatment for 29.9 months, and another patient, also with SD, was on treatment for 18.7 months. Another patient electively stopped therapy after 15 months and remains without evidence of progression 3 years later. CONCLUSIONS: Although some patients had durable disease control, the addition of vorinostat to sorafenib led to toxicities in most patients, requiring dose modifications that prevented determination of the recommended phase 2 dose. The combination is not recommended for further exploration with this vorinostat schedule in this patient population.","['Gordon, Sarah W', 'McGuire, William P 3rd', 'Shafer, Danielle A', 'Sterling, Richard K', 'Lee, Hannah M', 'Matherly, Scott C', 'Roberts, John D', 'Bose, Prithviraj', 'Tombes, Mary B', 'Shrader, E Ellen', 'Ryan, Alison A', 'Kmieciak, Maciej', 'Nguyen, Tri', 'Deng, Xiaoyan', 'Bandyopadhyay, Dipankar', 'Dent, Paul', 'Poklepovic, Andrew S']","['Gordon SW', 'McGuire WP 3rd', 'Shafer DA', 'Sterling RK', 'Lee HM', 'Matherly SC', 'Roberts JD', 'Bose P', 'Tombes MB', 'Shrader EE', 'Ryan AA', 'Kmieciak M', 'Nguyen T', 'Deng X', 'Bandyopadhyay D', 'Dent P', 'Poklepovic AS']",,"['Departments of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Palliative Care.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Palliative Care.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Palliative Care.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition, Virginia Commonwealth University, Richmond, VA.', 'Yale Cancer Center, Yale University, New Haven, CT.', 'Department of Leukemia, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Palliative Care.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Palliative Care.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center.', 'Biostatistics.', 'Biostatistics.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center.', 'Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.', 'Departments of Internal Medicine, Massey Cancer Center.', 'Division of Hematology, Oncology, and Palliative Care.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Clin Oncol,American journal of clinical oncology,8207754,"['58IFB293JI (Vorinostat)', '9ZOQ3TZI87 (Sorafenib)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage/*adverse effects', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/*drug therapy', 'Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury/etiology', 'Drug Eruptions/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypokalemia/chemically induced', 'Hypophosphatemia/chemically induced', 'Liver Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Sorafenib/administration & dosage', 'Thrombocytopenia/chemically induced', 'Vorinostat/administration & dosage/adverse effects']",,,,2019/07/16 06:00,2020/03/10 06:00,['2019/07/16 06:00'],"['2019/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/COC.0000000000000567 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Oncol. 2019 Aug;42(8):649-654. doi: 10.1097/COC.0000000000000567.,,,,"['P30 CA016059/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 DK052825/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since patients simultaneously have many prognostic factors, difficulties are associated with the construction of a patient-based prediction algorithm of relapse. The alternating decision tree (ADTree) is a successful classification method that combines decision trees with the predictive accuracy of boosting. It is a component of machine learning (ML) and has the capacity to simultaneously analyze multiple factors. Using ADTree, we attempted to construct a prediction model of leukemia relapse within 1 year of transplantation. With the model of training data (n = 148), prediction accuracy, the AUC of ROC, and the kappa-statistic value were 78.4%, 0.746, and 0.508, respectively. The false positive rate (FPR) of the relapse prediction was as low as 0.134. In an evaluation of the model with validation data (n = 69), prediction accuracy, AUC, and FPR of the relapse prediction were similar at 71.0%, 0.667, and 0.216, respectively. These results suggest that the model is generalized and highly accurate. Furthermore, the output of ADTree may visualize the branch point of treatment. For example, the selection of donor types resulted in different relapse predictions. Therefore, clinicians may change treatment options by referring to the model, thereby improving outcomes. The present results indicate that ML, such as ADTree, will contribute to the decision-making process in the diversified allo-HSCT field and be useful for preventing the relapse of leukemia.","['Fuse, Kyoko', 'Uemura, Shun', 'Tamura, Suguru', 'Suwabe, Tatsuya', 'Katagiri, Takayuki', 'Tanaka, Tomoyuki', 'Ushiki, Takashi', 'Shibasaki, Yasuhiko', 'Sato, Naoko', 'Yano, Toshio', 'Kuroha, Takashi', 'Hashimoto, Shigeo', 'Furukawa, Tatsuo', 'Narita, Miwako', 'Sone, Hirohito', 'Masuko, Masayoshi']","['Fuse K', 'Uemura S', 'Tamura S', 'Suwabe T', 'Katagiri T', 'Tanaka T', 'Ushiki T', 'Shibasaki Y', 'Sato N', 'Yano T', 'Kuroha T', 'Hashimoto S', 'Furukawa T', 'Narita M', 'Sone H', 'Masuko M']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8273-9436'],"['Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, Nagaoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, Nagaoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, Nagaoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, Nagaoka, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, Nagaoka Red Cross Hospital, Nagaoka, Japan.', 'Laboratory of Hematology and Oncology, Graduate School of Health Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Faculty of Medicine, Department of Hematology, Endocrinology and Metabolism, Niigata University, Niigata, Japan.', 'Department of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital, Niigata, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,,IM,,"['Adult', '*Algorithms', 'Clinical Decision-Making/*methods', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease Management', 'Female', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation/adverse effects/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', '*Machine Learning', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Theoretical', '*Patient Participation', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC6718546,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'machine learning', 'patient-based prediction', 'relapse posttransplantation']",2019/07/16 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/07/16 06:00'],"['2019/03/16 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2401 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Sep;8(11):5058-5067. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2401.

Prognosis of t(17;19)-ALL is extremely poor, while that of t(1;19)-ALL has recently improved dramatically in intensified chemotherapy. In this study, TCF3-HLF mRNA was detectable at a high level during induction therapy in a newly diagnosed t(17;19)-ALL case, while TCF3-PBX1 mRNA was undetectable at the end of induction therapy in most newly diagnosed t(1;19)-ALL cases. Using 4 t(17;19)-ALL and 16 t(1;19)-ALL cell lines, drug response profiling was analyzed. t(17;19)-ALL cell lines were found to be significantly more resistant to vincristine (VCR), daunorubicin (DNR), and prednisolone (Pred) than t(1;19)-ALL cell lines. Sensitivities to three (Pred, VCR, and l-asparaginase [l-Asp]), four (Pred, VCR, l-Asp, and DNR) and five (Pred, VCR, l-Asp, DNR, and cyclophosphamide) agents, widely used in induction therapy, were significantly poorer for t(17;19)-ALL cell lines than for t(1;19)-ALL cell lines. Consistent with poor responses to VCR and DNR, gene and protein expression levels of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) were higher in t(17;19)-ALL cell lines than in t(1;19)-ALL cell lines. Inhibitors for P-gp sensitized P-gp-positive t(17;19)-ALL cell lines to VCR and DNR. Knockout of P-gp by CRISPRCas9 overcame resistance to VCR and DNR in the P-gp-positive t(17;19)-ALL cell line. A combination of cyclosporine A with DNR prolonged survival of NSG mice inoculated with P-gp-positive t(17;19)-ALL cell line. These findings indicate involvement of P-gp in resistance to VCR and DNR in Pgp positive t(17;19)-ALL cell lines. In all four t(17;19)-ALL cell lines, RAS pathway mutation was detected. Furthermore, among 16 t(1;19)-ALL cell lines, multiagent resistance was usually observed in the cell lines with RAS pathway mutation in comparison to those without it, suggesting at least a partial involvement of RAS pathway mutation in multiagent resistance of t(17;19)-ALL.","['Watanabe, Atsushi', 'Inukai, Takeshi', 'Kagami, Keiko', 'Abe, Masako', 'Takagi, Masatoshi', 'Fukushima, Takashi',

Utilization of typical imaging features on conventional MR imaging techniques and other newer imaging techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and in- and out-of-phase MRI, for better characterisation of bone marrow pathologies has been highlighted. Aims and Objectives: To determine the prevalence of various bone marrow pathologies in spine. To study the MRI signal changes of bone marrow in various lesions such as anaemia, leukaemia, lymphomas and various bone marrow disorders. Materials and Methods: A total of 100 patients who were investigated between November 2012 and October 2014 were included. MRI spine studies were done on a 3.0 Tesla Philips Achieva Medical Systems. Observations and Results: In our study, out of 100 cases studied for various spinal pathologies, 48 patients were male and 52 were female indicating almost equal male to female distribution. Maximum cases were degenerative with most common site of involvement being lumbar followed by cervical region. There were only 3 cases of depletion disorder and no case with deposition disorder. The mean age group was 45.37 years, with the range being 9 years to 72 years. Maximum patients (n = 67) were found in the age group of 41-60. Conclusion: Various bone marrow disorders were classified and evaluated separately. A systematic approach to its evaluation by categorization is essential with prudent use of both conventional and problem-solving techniques, such as CSI and DWI, for accurate diagnosis and appropriate patient management. Conventional radiology depicts changes of an altered bony matrix while MRI displays changes at a cellular level and is well suited for imaging the bone marrow. MRI serves as a screening method in bone marrow disorders and the diagnosis is established in context with the clinical findings or by biopsy.","['Joshi, Anagha', 'Kulkarni, Sukhada', 'Dedhia, Tilak', 'Vaswani, Aakash']","['Joshi A', 'Kulkarni S', 'Dedhia T', 'Vaswani A']",,"['Professor,Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Resident, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra; Corresponding Author.', 'Resident, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra.', 'Resident, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College and General Hospital, Mumbai, Maharashtra.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],India,J Assoc Physicians India,The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,7505585,,,,"['Adult', '*Bone Marrow', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/*diagnostic imaging', 'Child', 'Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spine']",,,,2019/07/16 06:00,2019/08/09 06:00,['2019/07/16 06:00'],"['2019/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/08/09 06:00 [medline]']",,ppublish,J Assoc Physicians India. 2019 Mar;67(3):46-51.,['(c) Journal of the Association of Physicians of India 2011.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we evaluate the cytotoxic potential of expanded NK cells against a well-characterized panel of pediatric cancer cell lines representing Ewing sarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, lymphoma, leukemia, and brain tumors. We correlate their sensitivity NK cell lysis with tumor phenotypic, transcriptomic, and genetic determinants, and correlate known immunogenetic determinants with donor NK cell potency. Although ligand expression on cell lines stratified according to hematologic versus nonhematologic cancer types, the sensitivity to NK cell lysis varied widely and did not correlate with cancer type, expression of individual activating or inhibitory ligands, gene-expression clusters of NK cell ligands, disease status (newly diagnosed or relapsed), or MYCN amplification. Rather, sensitivity to NK cell-mediated lysis was associated with a novel 96-gene cluster of predominantly carcinoma-, apoptosis-, and cell death-related pathways, and with functional p53 status. NK cell potency was strongly associated with activating KIR gene content, but not with KIR/KIR-ligand mismatch. This study suggests that adoptive immunotherapy with expanded NK cells has the potential for a wide range of pediatric cancers, identifies potential biomarkers of efficacy and response, and establishes a foundation for using this cell line panel for the preclinical evaluation of immunotherapies.","['Ray, Anish K', 'Somanchi, Srinivas S', 'Dastgheyb, Neda', 'Aquino-Lopez, Arianexys', 'Cobanoglu, Zehra E', 'Geier, Brian', 'Lee, Dean A']","['Ray AK', 'Somanchi SS', 'Dastgheyb N', 'Aquino-Lopez A', 'Cobanoglu ZE', 'Geier B', 'Lee DA']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-6349-1869', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6693-5392']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, Cook Children's Hospital, Fort Worth, Texas."", 'Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', 'Department of Pediatrics Research, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.', ""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio."", ""Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Diseases, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Pediatr Blood Cancer,Pediatric blood & cancer,101186624,,IM,,"['Apoptosis/immunology', 'Carcinoma/immunology/pathology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy, Adoptive/methods', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology/transplantation', 'Neoplasms/*immunology/pathology', '*Transcriptome']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*activating ligands', '*cancer', '*cytotoxicity', '*inhibitory ligands', '*natural killer cells']",2019/07/16 06:00,2020/02/06 06:00,['2019/07/16 06:00'],"['2018/12/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/13 00:00 [revised]', '2019/03/23 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/06 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/pbc.27783 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Blood Cancer. 2019 Oct;66(10):e27783. doi: 10.1002/pbc.27783.

Inhibitors have been developed to target DOT1L activity in leukemia, but cellular mechanisms that regulate DOT1L are still poorly understood. We have identified the histone deacetylase Rpd3 as a negative regulator of budding yeast Dot1. At its target genes, the transcriptional repressor Rpd3 restricts H3K79 methylation, explaining the absence of H3K79me3 at a subset of genes in the yeast genome. Similar to the crosstalk in yeast, inactivation of the murine Rpd3 homolog HDAC1 in thymocytes led to an increase in H3K79 methylation. Thymic lymphomas that arise upon genetic deletion of Hdac1 retained the increased H3K79 methylation and were sensitive to reduced DOT1L dosage. Furthermore, cell lines derived from Hdac1(Delta/Delta) thymic lymphomas were sensitive to a DOT1L inhibitor, which induced apoptosis. In summary, we identified an evolutionarily conserved crosstalk between HDAC1 and DOT1L with impact in murine thymic lymphoma development.","['Vlaming, Hanneke', 'McLean, Chelsea M', 'Korthout, Tessy', 'Alemdehy, Mir Farshid', 'Hendriks, Sjoerd', 'Lancini, Cesare', 'Palit, Sander', 'Klarenbeek, Sjoerd', 'Kwesi-Maliepaard, Eliza Mari', 'Molenaar, Thom M', 'Hoekman, Liesbeth', 'Schmidlin, Thierry T', 'Altelaar, Af Maarten', 'van Welsem, Tibor', 'Dannenberg, Jan-Hermen', 'Jacobs, Heinz', 'van Leeuwen, Fred']","['Vlaming H', 'McLean CM', 'Korthout T', 'Alemdehy MF', 'Hendriks S', 'Lancini C', 'Palit S', 'Klarenbeek S', 'Kwesi-Maliepaard EM', 'Molenaar TM', 'Hoekman L', 'Schmidlin TT', 'Altelaar AM', 'van Welsem T', 'Dannenberg JH', 'Jacobs H', 'van Leeuwen F']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1743-6428', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5093-5945', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-6227-9850', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7267-7251']","['Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Tumor Biology & Immunology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Experimental Animal Pathology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Experimental Animal Pathology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University and Netherlands Proteomics Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics, Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research, Utrecht Institute for Pharmaceutical Sciences, Utrecht University and Netherlands Proteomics Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands.', 'Proteomics Facility, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Tumor Biology & Immunology, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Division of Gene Regulation, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,EMBO J,The EMBO journal,8208664,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins)', 'EC 2.1.1.- (DOT1L protein, human)', 'EC 2.1.1.43 (Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase)', 'EC 3.5.1.- (RPD3 protein, S cerevisiae)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC1 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (HDAC2 protein, human)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 1)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylase 2)', 'EC 3.5.1.98 (Histone Deacetylases)']",IM,,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Gene Deletion', 'Histone Deacetylase 1/*genetics', 'Histone Deacetylase 2/*metabolism', 'Histone Deacetylases/genetics', 'Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase/*genetics', 'Histones/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/genetics/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae/metabolism', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Thymus Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism']",PMC6627229,['NOTNLM'],"['*Chromatin', '*H3K79 methylation', '*histone acetylation', '*histone ubiquitination', '*lymphoma']",2019/07/16 06:00,2019/12/24 06:00,['2019/07/16 06:00'],"['2019/01/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/20 00:00 [revised]', '2019/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/24 06:00 [medline]']",['10.15252/embj.2019101564 [doi]'],ppublish,EMBO J. 2019 Jul 15;38(14):e101564. doi: 10.15252/embj.2019101564.

We here show that iNKT transnuclear mice, generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer, have increased tissue resident iNKT cells. We examined expression of PLZF, T-bet, and RORgammat, as well as cytokine/chemokine profiles, and found that both monoclonal and polyclonal iNKT cells differentiated into functional subsets that faithfully replicated those seen in wild-type mice. We detected iNKT cells from tissues in which they are rare, including adipose, lung, skin-draining lymph nodes, and a previously undescribed population in Peyer's patches (PP). PP-NKT cells produce the majority of the IL-4 in Peyer's patches and provide indirect help for B-cell class switching to IgG1 in both transnuclear and wild-type mice. Oral vaccination with alpha-galactosylceramide shows enhanced fecal IgG1 titers in iNKT cell-sufficient mice. Transcriptional profiling reveals a unique signature of PP-NKT cells, characterized by tissue residency.

The Khorana Risk Score (KRS), which has been widely used for thrombosis risk assessment in the clinical setting, was developed on the basis of solid tumor data and has not been validated among AML patients. This study aims to validate the use of the KRS as a thrombosis risk-scoring system among patients with AML. Methods: Using data from H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institution's Total Cancer Care Research Study, we retrospectively identified patients who were histologically confirmed with AML from 2000 to 2018. Clinical and laboratory variables at the time of AML diagnosis were characterized and analyzed. The thrombotic event rate was estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Results: A total of 867 AML patients were included in the analysis. The median age at AML diagnosis was 75 years (range, 51-96), and the majority were male (65%, n = 565). A total of 22% (n = 191), 51% (n = 445), 24% (n = 207), and 3% (n = 24) of patients had a KRS of 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A total of 42 thrombotic events (3% [n = 6/191] with a KRS of 1; 5% [n = 23/445] with a KRS of 2; 6.3% [n = 13/207] with a KRS of 3) were observed, with a median follow-up of 3 months (range, 0.1-307). There was no statistical difference in the risk of thrombosis between these groups (P = .1949). Conclusions: Although there was an increased risk of thrombosis associated with a higher KRS among AML patients with a KRS of 1 to 3, the difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, only a few patients were found to have a KRS > 3, and this was largely due to pancytopenia, which is commonly associated with AML. These results indicate the need for a better thrombotic risk-scoring system for AML patients.","['Mirza, Abu-Sayeef', 'Yun, Seongseok', 'Ali, Najla Al', 'Shin, Hannah', ""O'Neil, Joseph Luke"", 'Elharake, Maher', 'Schwartz, Daniel', 'Robinson, Katherine', 'Nowell, Ethan', 'Engle, Grace', 'Badat, Ibraahim', 'Brimer, Thomas', 'Kuc, Amra', 'Sequeira, Ashton', 'Mirza, Sabbir', 'Sikaria, Dhiraj', 'Vera, Jesus Diaz', 'Hackney, Noah', 'Abusrur, Sammy', 'Jesurajan, Jose', 'Kuang, Jameson', 'Patel, Shreyans', 'Khalil, Sabrina', 'Bhaskar, Sonya', 'Beard, Alexander', 'Abuelenen, Toaa', 'Ratnasamy, Kevin', 'Visweshwar, Nathan', 'Komrokji, Rami', 'Jaglal, Michael']","['Mirza AS', 'Yun S', 'Ali NA', 'Shin H', ""O'Neil JL"", 'Elharake M', 'Schwartz D', 'Robinson K', 'Nowell E', 'Engle G', 'Badat I', 'Brimer T', 'Kuc A', 'Sequeira A', 'Mirza S', 'Sikaria D', 'Vera JD', 'Hackney N', 'Abusrur S', 'Jesurajan J', 'Kuang J', 'Patel S', 'Khalil S', 'Bhaskar S', 'Beard A', 'Abuelenen T', 'Ratnasamy K', 'Visweshwar N', 'Komrokji R', 'Jaglal M']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1875-8966'],"['1Department of Internal Medicine, H.

This study investigated the tolerance and efficacy of DCAG for patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (aged 14-60 years). The clinical features or molecular markers that may predict response to DCAG were identified. Patients and methods: One-hundred sixty-one consecutive patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia received DCAG or standard (idarubicin plus cytarabine, IA) induction chemotherapy (n=64 and 97, respectively). Results: The rates of complete remission after the first cycle, overall survival (OS), and event-free survival (EFS) were comparable. After the second cycle, the complete remission rate of the DCAG group (54.7%) was significantly lower than that of the reference (78.35%, P=0.005). The following were associated with significantly worse OS, and EFS, in the DCAG group: Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score >/=3 and no response after the second induction therapy; and FLT3-ITD. The multivariate analysis showed the DCAG group with significantly shorter OS associated with ECOG >/=3 and FLT3-ITD. In the DCAG group, after the first cycle of induction chemotherapy the median recovery times of neutrophils and platelets were 15.8 and 13 days. Conclusion: The DCAG and IA groups were similar with regard to complete remission rate after the first cycle, OS, and EFS. The complete remission rate after the second cycle of the DCAG was significantly lower than that of the IA. Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were a major adverse event associated with DCAG.","['Dou, Liping', 'Xu, Qingyu', 'Wang, Mengzhen', 'Xiao, Yang', 'Cheng, Longcan', 'Li, Honghua', 'Huang, Wenrong', 'Mei, Junhui', 'Jing, Yu', 'Bo, Jian', 'Liu, Daihong', 'Yu, Li']","['Dou L', 'Xu Q', 'Wang M', 'Xiao Y', 'Cheng L', 'Li H', 'Huang W', 'Mei J', 'Jing Y', 'Bo J', 'Liu D', 'Yu L']",,"[""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hainan Branch of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Sanya, Hainan 572013, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hainan Branch of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Sanya, Hainan 572013, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Hainan Branch of Chinese PLA General Hospital, Sanya, Hainan 572013, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Hematology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, People's Republic of China.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],New Zealand,Onco Targets Ther,OncoTargets and therapy,101514322,,,,,PMC6605041,['NOTNLM'],"['acute myeloid leukemia', 'conventional chemotherapy', 'decitabine', 'induction therapy']",2019/07/16 06:00,2019/07/16 06:01,['2019/07/16 06:00'],"['2018/12/31 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/16 06:01 [medline]']","['10.2147/OTT.S200005 [doi]', '200005 [pii]']",epublish,Onco Targets Ther. 2019 Jun 28;12:5013-5023. doi: 10.2147/OTT.S200005. eCollection 2019.,,20190628,,,['The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They involve different clinical entities, of which one is NK cell leukemia, a highly aggressive hematologic neoplasm with poor prognosis that presents in young men and is more frequently seen in Asian descent. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) seems to be related to the pathogenesis. Case report: A male patient of 1 year and 7 months of age, who began his condition with anemic, febrile, infiltrative syndrome and hyperleukocytosis is described. Bone marrow aspirate showed L2 morphology blasts (96%), CD56 (80.87%) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (84.11%) immunophenotype. Bone marrow biopsy showed membranous CD2+, cytoplasmic CD3+ and membranous CD56+; serology positive to EBV. The patient received two different chemotherapy schemes based on methotrexate, ifosfamide, etoposide, dexamethasone and L-asparaginase, which resulted in partial remission. Currently, the patient lives with the disease. Conclusions: NK cells leukemia is rare in young adults, but even more in pediatric patients, for which it is very difficult to treat because only a few cases have been reported in the literature, the survival varies from weeks to months and the chances of treatment are limited. Recently, the usefulness of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation or umbilical cord cells has been demonstrated, achieving a 2-year survival. The therapeutic possibilities in these patients are under study. In the near future, we hope to achieve the complete remission of the disease and a 5-year survival.","['Rey-Helo, Elianneth', 'Perez-Velasquez, Ruben D', 'Cortes-Alva, Deyanira']","['Rey-Helo E', 'Perez-Velasquez RD', 'Cortes-Alva D']",,"['Servicio de Oncologia Pediatrica.

However, administration of Mog before allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been reported to be a risk factor for severe acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The etiological hypothesis is Mogamulizumab may eradicate CCR4-positive regulatory T cells (Tregs). Theoretically, Treg homeostasis and course of GVHD can be affected by plasma exchange (PE) with decreasing plasma Mog concentration. Here, we present a case of severe acute GVHD after pretransplantation Mog, in which PE was performed for liver failure. As a result, plasma Mog concentration was decreased but it did not lead to the prompt elevation of Treg levels in peripheral blood and clinical responses of GVHD were limited to partial remission. Our case suggests that recovery of donor-derived Treg in the acute phase after HSCT is multifactorial and the single procedure of PE-based Mog depletion does not necessarily warrant the quick restoration of Treg homeostasis.","['Sugiura, Hiroyuki', 'Matsuoka, Ken-Ichi', 'Sando, Yasuhisa', 'Meguri, Yusuke', 'Ikegawa, Shuntaro', 'Nakamura, Makoto', 'Iwamoto, Miki', 'Yoshioka, Takanori', 'Asano, Takeru', 'Kondo, Eisei', 'Fujii, Keiko', 'Fujii, Nobuharu', 'Maeda, Yoshinobu']","['Sugiura H', 'Matsuoka KI', 'Sando Y', 'Meguri Y', 'Ikegawa S', 'Nakamura M', 'Iwamoto M', 'Yoshioka T', 'Asano T', 'Kondo E', 'Fujii K', 'Fujii N', 'Maeda Y']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Okayama University Graduate School of Medicine, Dentistry and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Okayama, Japan.

A few ATL cases have been reported in HTLV-1-positive recipients after living donor liver transplantation. A 57-year-old HTLV-1-positive Japanese male suffered acute liver failure due to hepatitis B infection. He was transferred to our department to undergo deceased donor liver transplantation (DDLT). Tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil were induced for immunosuppression. His clinical outcome was satisfactory. However, he visited his physician 3 years after DDLT reporting abdominal pain and fever. A computed tomography scan showed multiple lymph node enlargement. Lymph node biopsy and his blood sample led to a diagnosis of ATL. He was transferred to the Department of Hematology and Oncology and underwent chemotherapy. To our knowledge, this is the first report of ATL development after DDLT from an HTLV-1-positive recipient. As is the case with our previous report, the current patient had undergone liver transplant for acute liver failure. Unlike living donor liver transplantation, however, DDLT needs no hepatic growth factor for liver regeneration.

However, distress experienced by patients scheduled for HLA-haploidentical HSCT vs that of patients scheduled for other types of matched HSCT is unknown. We conducted a retrospective study to clarify whether the type of HSCT influences the appearance of psychological distress in patients anticipating HSCT. METHODS: One hundred fifty-seven patients who had undergone any of 4 types of HSCT at Tokyo Metropolitan Komagome Hospital between October 2013 and September 2016 and had completed the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire within 2 weeks before the procedure were included. We computed T-scores for the tension-anxiety (TA) and depression (D) subscales, took scores >/= 60 to represent mood disturbance of clinical concern, and examined scores and other clinical variables in relation to each procedure. RESULTS: Twenty-two (14.0%) patients had a POMS-TA score >/= 60, and 26 (16.6%) had a POMS-D score >/= 60. The numbers of POMS-TA and POMS-D scores >/= 60 did not differ significantly with respect to age, sex, leukemia type, number of previous transplants, disease status, comorbidity index, or transplant type. A multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed the absence of an influence of the type of HSCT on the incidence of POMS-TA or POMS-D scores >/=60. CONCLUSION: Attention should be paid to the matter of psychological distress in patients with leukemia who will be treated by HSCT, even HLA-haploidentical HSCT. Such patients need psychological support, especially during the waiting period immediately prior to the transplantation procedure.","['Akaho, Rie', 'Otsu, Akiko', 'Igarashi, Aiko', 'Aoki, Yuko', 'Takemura, Takaubu', 'Kobayashi, Sayaka', 'Ohashi, Kazuteru', 'Nishimura, Katsuji']","['Akaho R', 'Otsu A', 'Igarashi A', 'Aoki Y', 'Takemura T', 'Kobayashi S', 'Ohashi K', 'Nishimura K']",,"[""Department of Psychiatry, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan.

The inhibition of the anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family leads to the apoptosis of cancer. BH3 mimetics have been developed targeting anti-apoptotic proteins of Bcl-2 family as small molecular drugs. It has been proved that BH3 mimetics has effect on apoptosis and proliferation in leukemia and some of them has been used in phase one or two clinical trials. Besides, with the development of the research on autophagic cell death, the antagonism and the synergism of autophagy and apoptosis is significant in cell death. As a hub of these two pathways of cell death, Bcl-2 protein is a potential target in basic research and clinical applications. In our studies, we found 32 potential BH3 mimetics compounds from 140,000 small molecular compounds via pharmacophore-based virtual screening. Furthermore, we demonstrated SM3, one of the 32 potential BH3 mimetics, induced autophagy and apoptosis simultaneously in dose-time dependence in A549cell. SM3 induced apoptosis by intrinsic apoptosis pathway and induced autophagy by weakening the interaction between Beclin-1 and Bcl-2 complex.

In order to target the TKI-insensitive leukemia stem cells (LSCs) in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) by CAR T cells, we chose CD26 as a cell surface tumor-associated antigen due to preferentially expression on LSCs. Additionally, CD26 has also been suggested to be a multipurpose therapeutic target for other cancer. Therefore, developing the CD26-targeting CAR T cells may be a promising therapy for not only LSCs but also other CD26+ cancer cells. Methods: We designed the second-generation CD26-targeting CAR utilizing 4-1BB (CD137) as costimulatory domain, and transduced T cells with CD26-CAR containing lentiviral. Then we evaluated the transduction efficiency and expansion ability, and demonstrated the existence of self-antigen-driven fratricide by cytokine assay and cytotoxicity assay. Results: Anti-CD26-4-1BB-CAR T cells exhibited poor viability, multiple cytokine secretion, down-regulation of CD26 and direct cytotoxicity against themselves, indicating self-antigen-driven fratricide. Conclusion: Eradicating CML-LSCs via anti-CD26-4-1BB-CAR T cells is not applicable, and optimized design or alternative target is needed.","['Zhou, Shu', 'Zhu, Xiaoying', 'Shen, Na', 'Li, Qing', 'Wang, Na', 'You, Yong', 'Zhong, Zhaodong', 'Cheng, Fanjun', 'Zou, Ping', 'Zhu, Xiaojian']","['Zhou S', 'Zhu X', 'Shen N', 'Li Q', 'Wang N', 'You Y', 'Zhong Z', 'Cheng F', 'Zou P', 'Zhu X']",,"['Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'Department of Hematology, Wuhan No. 1 Hospital , Wuhan , China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'Institute of Hematology, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology , Wuhan , China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol,Immunopharmacology and immunotoxicology,8800150,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Chimeric Antigen)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (DPP4 protein, human)', 'EC 3.4.14.5 (Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4)']",IM,,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cytokines/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/immunology', 'Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4/*immunology', 'Down-Regulation/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy/methods', 'Receptors, Chimeric Antigen/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Superfamily, Member 9/immunology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['CD26', 'Chimeric antigen receptor T cells', 'cancer', 'chronic myeloid leukemia', 'fratricide', 'leukemia stem cells']",2019/07/16 06:00,2020/01/16 06:00,['2019/07/16 06:00'],"['2019/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/16 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08923973.2019.1637889 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunopharmacol Immunotoxicol. 2019 Aug;41(4):490-496. doi: 10.1080/08923973.2019.1637889.

Neoplasms are usually accompanied by changes in haemostatic processes but reports on changes in blood coagulation following exposure to an ELF-MF are scarce and rather fragmentary. The aim of the present work was to determine whether any global or partial coagulation variables are modified after such long-term exposure. A parental generation of six week-old OF1 mice was exposed to an artificial ELF-MF for 14 weeks. Mating was then allowed, and the resulting filial generation raised until the age of 31-35 weeks within the same ELF-MF. Control animals were subjected only to the magnetic field of the Earth. Whole blood samples were extracted from the anesthetised filial generation of mice by cardiac puncture. White blood cells (WBC) were counted, the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and prothrombin time (PT) determined, and plasma fibrinogen, reptilase time (RT), and factor VIII activity examined. The similarity between the results for the present control animals and those recorded in the literature for human blood render OF1 mice a suitable study model. The differences in the studied coagulation variables were largely owed simply to sex. However, the females showed a very significant shortening of the PT time associated with ELF-MF exposure. Exposure also caused significant increases in the female APTT and RT values, and in general reduced the differences between the sexes.","['Vallejo, D', 'Hidalgo, M A', 'Hernandez, J M']","['Vallejo D', 'Hidalgo MA', 'Hernandez JM']",,"['Department of Biology of Systems, University of Alcala , Alcala de Henares , Spain.', 'Department of Physics and Mathematics, University of Alcala , Alcala de Henares , Spain.', 'Department of Biology of Systems, University of Alcala , Alcala de Henares , Spain.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Electromagn Biol Med,Electromagnetic biology and medicine,101133002,['9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)'],IM,,"['Animals', '*Blood Coagulation', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/metabolism', 'Magnetic Fields/*adverse effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Partial Thromboplastin Time', 'Prothrombin Time', 'Time Factors']",,['NOTNLM'],"['ELF magnetic field.

METHODS: A total of 81 acute myeloid leukemia patients were recruited, which included 36 cases of CBF-AML and 45 cases of cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) . Mutations of FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, NPM1, c-KIT, NRAS, KRAS, TET2, IDH1/2, RUNX1, DNMT3A, GATA2, ASjXL1, TP53, PTPN11, JAK2V617F, SETBP1 and CEBPA genes were simultaneously detected by DNA-based PCR and Sanger sequencing. RESULTS: Over all, mutations were detected in 68 patients (83.9%), with the most common ones including double CEBPA mutations (n=17), followed by NPM1 (n=15), c-KIT (n=11), NRAS (n=10), TET2 (n=9), FLT3-TKD (n=9), FLT3-ITD (n=8), IDH1 (n=7), RUNX1 (n=7), KRAS (n=7), DNMT3A (n=6), IDH2 (n=4), and GATA2 (n=4) mutations. AML1-ETO and CBFbeta-MYH11 fusions were present in 21 and 15 patients, respectively. Coexistence of >/=2 mutations was more common in CN-AML comparing with CBF-AML. The mutation rate of NPM1, FLT3-ITD, DNMT3A, IDH1 and CEBPA double mutations were higher in patients with CN-AML. NRAS, c-KIT and KRAS mutations were identified more frequently in patients with CBF-AML (P<0.05). Based on the function, aberration of genes involved in DNA methylation, NPM1 proteins and transcription predominated in CN-AML, while tyrosine kinase receptor signaling and RAS pathways have predominated in CBF-AML. CONCLUSION: The genomic landscape of CBF-AML patients has differed from that of CN-AML patients. Synergy of fusion genes with particular mutations may impact the clinical phenotype and prognosis of patients.","['He, Jinyuan', 'Chao, Hongying', 'Zhou, Min', 'Lu, Xuzhang', 'Chen, Tao', 'Yang, Jianhe', 'Jiang, Naike', 'Zhang, Ri']","['He J', 'Chao H', 'Zhou M', 'Lu X', 'Chen T', 'Yang J', 'Jiang N', 'Zhang R']",,"[""The Affiliated Changzhou No.2 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Changzhou, Jiangsu 213003, China. chaohy2006@126.com.""]",['chi'],['Journal Article'],China,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi,Zhonghua yi xue yi chuan xue za zhi = Zhonghua yixue yichuanxue zazhi = Chinese journal of medical genetics,9425197,"['0 (Core Binding Factors)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,,"['Core Binding Factors/*genetics', '*DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Prognosis']",,,,2019/07/16 06:00,2019/09/12 06:00,['2019/07/15 06:00'],"['2019/07/15 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/16 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/09/12 06:00 [medline]']","['940636134 [pii]', '10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2019.07.001 [doi]']",ppublish,Zhonghua Yi Xue Yi Chuan Xue Za Zhi. 2019 Jul 10;36(7):657-661. doi: 10.3760/cma.j.issn.1003-9406.2019.07.001.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

X/P-MLVs use the XPR1 receptor for cell entry, and tropism differences are due to polymorphisms in XPR1 and the viral envelope. To characterize these receptor variants and identify blocks to cross-species transmission, we examined the XPR1 receptors in six mammalian species that restrict different subsets of X/P-MLVs. These restrictive receptors have replacement mutations in regions implicated in receptor function, and some entry restrictions can be relieved by glycosylation inhibitors. Mutation of the cow and hamster XPR1 genes identified a shared, previously unrecognized receptor-critical site. This G/Q503N replacement dramatically improves receptor function. While this substitution introduces an N-linked glycosylation site, XPR1 receptors are not glycosylated indicating that this replacement alters the virus-receptor interface independently of glycosylation. Our data also suggest that an unidentified glycosylated cofactor may influence X/P-MLV entry.","['Lu, Xiaoyu', 'Kassner, Joshua', 'Skorski, Matthew', 'Carley, Samuel', 'Shaffer, Esther', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Lu X', 'Kassner J', 'Skorski M', 'Carley S', 'Shaffer E', 'Kozak CA']",,"['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD, 20854, USA.', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD, 20854, USA.', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD, 20854, USA.', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD, 20854, USA.', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD, 20854, USA.', 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, MD, 20854, USA.

Not only the presence but also the size, localization and the rate of this variant or the presence of multiple ITDs has prognostic information. The traditional PCR based diagnostic methods cannot provide information about all of these parameters in one assay, however the application of next generation sequencing (NGS) technique can be a reliable solution for this diagnostic problem. In order to evaluate the analytical properties of an NGS-based FLT3-ITD detection assay a quality control sample was prepared from DNA of AML patients containing 19 different FLT3-ITD variants identified by NGS. The higher the total read count was in a certain sample of the NGS run, the more ITD variant types could be detected. The maximal sensitivity of FLT3-ITD detection by NGS technique was as low as 0.007% FLT3-ITD/total allele rate, however, below 0.1% rate, the reproducibility of the quantitation was poor (CV>25%). DNA pools with several FLT3-ITDs can be used efficiently for analytical evaluation of NGS-based FLT3-ITD quantitation testing several different ITD sequences and rates, simultaneously.","['Mezei, Zoltan A', 'Tornai, David', 'Foldesi, Roza', 'Madar, Laszlo', 'Sumegi, Andrea', 'Papp, Maria', 'Antal-Szalmas, Peter']","['Mezei ZA', 'Tornai D', 'Foldesi R', 'Madar L', 'Sumegi A', 'Papp M', 'Antal-Szalmas P']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, H-4032, Nagyerdei str. 98., Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, H-4032, Nagyerdei str. 98., Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, H-4032, Nagyerdei str. 98., Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, H-4032, Nagyerdei str. 98., Hungary.', 'HAS-UD Vascular Biology and Myocardial Pathophysiology Research Group, Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Debrecen, H-4032, Nagyerdei str. 98., Hungary.', 'Division of Gastroenterology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, H-4032, Nagyerdei str. 98., Hungary.', 'Department of Laboratory Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, H-4032, Nagyerdei str. 98., Hungary.

Typhaneoside (TYP) is a major flavonoid in the extract of Pollen Typhae, showing significant biological and pharmacological effects. In the present study, we explored the effects of TYP on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression. The results indicated that TYP markedly reduced the cell viability of AML cells and arrested the cell cycle at the G2/M phase by regulating the expression of associated proteins. In addition, TYP significantly induced apoptosis in AML cells by promoting the activation of Caspase-3. Intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation were highly detected in AML cells after treatment with TYP. Moreover, TYP clearly induced ferroptosis in AML cells, and this process was iron-dependent and attendant with mitochondrial dysfunction. We also found that TYP significantly triggered autophagy in AML cells by promoting the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling, contributing to ferritin degradation, ROS accumulation and ferroptotic cell death ultimately. In conclusion, the findings above provided solid evidences that TYP could be a promising therapeutic agent to prevent AML progression by inducing apoptosis, ROS production, autophagy and ferroptosis.","['Zhu, Hai-Yan', 'Huang, Zong-Xuan', 'Chen, Guo-Qi', 'Sheng, Fen', 'Zheng, Yin-Suo']","['Zhu HY', 'Huang ZX', 'Chen GQ', 'Sheng F', 'Zheng YS']",,"['Department of the Frist Paediatrics, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang, 725000, China.', 'Department of Paediatrics, Affiliated Hospital of Jining Medical University, Jining, 272029, China.', 'Department of Rehabilitation, Ankang Central Hospital, Ankang, 725000, China.', ""Department of Intensive Care Unit, First People's Hospital of Jining, Shandong province, 272000, China."", 'Department of Hematology, Central Hospital of Baoji, Shaanxi Province, 721008, China.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: To investigate the clinicopathological features of patients with metastatic tumours of the thyroid gland, we reviewed autopsy records and pathological features of 36 cases with thyroidal secondary tumours from 266 cases of malignant neoplasias (excluding cases of primary thyroid cancer), over a 16-year period. RESULTS: There were 19 men and 17 women in the study, ranging in age from 37 to 95 years (mean 70.4 years). The incidence of metastasis in thyroid gland was 0.9% in all autopsy cases, and 13.53% of the malignant tumours. The majority were carcinomas of epithelial origin. The lung was the most common primary tumour site (33.3%), followed by the breast (8.33%) and the kidney (8.33%). The most common non-epithelial malignancy was lymphoma, followed by leukaemia (total of both 25%). As for the microscopic morphological observations, diffuse infiltration pattern of tumour cells was noted in 63.89% of the cases, the formation of nodules in 33.33% of the cases and contiguous invasion in 2.79% of the cases. There were 35.71% cases of metastases associated with multinodular goitre and 28.57% cases associated with papillary microcarcinoma. CONCLUSION: Our study indicates that thyroid secondary malignancies are not infrequent and may constitute a diagnostic problem. Lung cancer is the most common neoplasm that metastasizes to the thyroid gland in north-western Greek population.","['Mistelou, Antigony', 'Papadatos, Stamatis S', 'Kousi, Chrysavgi', 'Lampri, Evangeli', 'Mitsis, Michael', 'Vougiouklakis, Theodoros', 'Galani, Vasiliki']","['Mistelou A', 'Papadatos SS', 'Kousi C', 'Lampri E', 'Mitsis M', 'Vougiouklakis T', 'Galani V']",,"['Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.', 'Third Department of Internal Medicine, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece.', 'Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Surgery, University Hospital of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.', 'Department of Anatomy, Histology, and Embryology, University of Ioannina, Ioannina, Greece.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Bulgaria,Folia Med (Plovdiv),Folia medica,2984761R,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Autopsy', 'Bile Duct Neoplasms/pathology', 'Breast Neoplasms/pathology', 'Carcinoma/epidemiology/*secondary', 'Carcinoma, Hepatocellular/epidemiology/secondary', 'Cholangiocarcinoma/epidemiology/secondary', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/pathology', 'Female', 'Greece/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Kidney Neoplasms/pathology', 'Leukemic Infiltration/epidemiology', 'Liver Neoplasms/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/pathology', 'Lymphoma/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/epidemiology/*secondary', 'Thyroid Nodule/epidemiology/pathology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['autopsy', 'goiter', 'malignancy', 'metastatic disease', 'thyroid', 'thyroid nodule']",2019/07/14 06:00,2020/01/18 06:00,['2019/07/14 06:00'],"['2018/09/08 00:00 [received]', '2018/12/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.2478/folmed-2018-0077 [doi]', '/j/folmed.2018.61.issue-2/folmed-2018-0077/folmed-2018-0077.xml [pii]']",ppublish,Folia Med (Plovdiv). 2019 Jun 1;61(2):277-288. doi: 10.2478/folmed-2018-0077.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs fail to eradicate leukemia stem cells, which becomes the root of drug resistance and disease recurrence. Hence, new therapeutic strategies targeting LSCs are supposed to be critical for patients with AML. Here we report that combination of Bcl-2 inhibitor AT-101 and chemotherapeutic drug idarubicin (IDA) results in synergistic lethality in CD34(+)CD38(-) leukemia stem-like cells sorted from KG-1alpha and Kasumi-1 AML cell lines and primary CD34(+) AML cells in vitro while sparing the normal counterparts. In addition, combinatorial treatment also significantly inhibits the growth of patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models generated from FLT3-ITD(mut) AML patient in vivo. Mechanistically, the synergistic effects of AT-101 with IDA to induce cell death are closely associated with blockage of DNA damage repair and thus activates the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In summary, these findings suggest that combinatorial therapy with AT-101 and IDA selectively eliminates leukemia stem-like cells both in vitro and in vivo, representing a potent and alternative salvage therapy for the treatment of relapsed and refractory patients with AML.","['Yang, Qianying', 'Chen, Kai', 'Zhang, Leisi', 'Feng, Liying', 'Fu, Guofeng', 'Jiang, Shan', 'Bi, Silei', 'Lin, Chunjie', 'Zhou, Yong', 'Zhao, Haijun', 'Chen, Xiao Lei', 'Fu, Guo', 'Xu, Bing']","['Yang Q', 'Chen K', 'Zhang L', 'Feng L', 'Fu G', 'Jiang S', 'Bi S', 'Lin C', 'Zhou Y', 'Zhao H', 'Chen XL', 'Fu G', 'Xu B']",,"['Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, China; State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.', ""The First People's Hospital of Foshan (The Affiliated Foshan Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University), Foshan, Guangdong, 528000, China; Department of Hematology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, 510515, China."", 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, 215000, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361003, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Innovation Center for Cell Signaling Network, School of Life Sciences, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361102, China.

Bufalin, a natural digoxin-like ingredient isolated from a traditional Chinese medicine Chan Su, has been shown to downregulate MCL-1 in NSCLC cells. However, whether bufalin reverses this acquired resistance to osimertinib in NSCLC cells remains unclear. In this study, bufalin reduced cell viability and promoted apoptosis in osimertinib-resistant cells. Moreover, co-treatment with bufalin and osimertinib restored the sensitivity of osimertinib-resistant cells to osimertinib-induced growth regression and apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, MEK/ERK-dependent MCL-1 phosphorylation and Ku70-mediated MCL-1 overexpression confer osimertinib resistance in EGFR-mutant NSCLC cells. In osimertinib-resistant cells, bufalin modulates Ku70-mediated MCL-1 degradation, but not MEK/ERK/MCL-1 signaling. In conclusion, our study suggests that bufalin eliminates resistance to osimertinib by inhibiting Ku70-mediated MCL-1 overexpression, indicating that a combination of osimertinib and bufalin could be an effective additional treatment to overcome acquired resistance to osimertinib in NSCLC cells.","['Cao, Fei', 'Gong, Ya-Bin', 'Kang, Xiao-Hong', 'Lu, Zhi-Hong', 'Wang, Ying', 'Zhao, Ke-Lei', 'Miao, Zhan-Hui', 'Liao, Ming-Juan', 'Xu, Zhen-Ye']","['Cao F', 'Gong YB', 'Kang XH', 'Lu ZH', 'Wang Y', 'Zhao KL', 'Miao ZH', 'Liao MJ', 'Xu ZY']",,"['Department of Oncology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, 88 JianKang Road, Xinxiang 453003, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Yueyang Hospital, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, No.110 Ganhe Road, Shanghai 200437, China.', 'Department of Oncology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinxiang Medical University, 88 JianKang Road, Xinxiang 453003, China.

Chemotherapy of T-ALL usually consists of induction, consolidation, and long-term maintenance. Diacetyl hexamethylene diamine (CAHB) is a newly developed agent that induces the differentiation of malignant cells and deprives their clonal growth ability. Since its effect on T-ALL has not been previously determined, we evaluated its potential function in the Jurkat cell line. MATERIAL AND METHODS MTT assay was conducted to evaluate the cytotoxicity and anti-proliferative effect of CAHB. The apoptosis level of CAHB-treated Jurkat cells was evaluated using flow cytometry via staining with Annexin V/PI or cleaved-caspase-3. The alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential was determined by flow cytometry. The expression of Bax and Bcl-2 was evaluated by RT-PCR and Western blot. Western blot was also used to assess the activation of Akt. RESULTS CAHB inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of Jurkat cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner by decreasing activation of Akt, reducing the mitochondrial membrane potential, and downregulating the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggest that CAHB might be regarded as a novel treatment agent for T-ALL since it can induce apoptosis and inhibit proliferation of the T-ALL cell line at a relatively low level.","['Hong, Ye', 'Zhang, Jia', 'Guo, Qunyi', 'Zhu, Min', 'Chen, Baoguo', 'Luo, Wenda']","['Hong Y', 'Zhang J', 'Guo Q', 'Zhu M', 'Chen B', 'Luo W']",,"['Department of Hematology and Oncology, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, Zhejiang, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, Zhejiang, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, Zhejiang, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, Zhejiang, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, Zhejiang, China (mainland).', 'Department of Hematology and Oncology, Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Wenzhou Medical University, Taizhou, Zhejiang, China (mainland).']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Sci Monit,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,9609063,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Diamines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)', 'K324J5K4HM (Diacetyl)', 'ZRA5J5B2QW (1,6-diaminohexane)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Cell Proliferation/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Diacetyl', 'Diamines/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Jurkat Cells', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases/metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction/drug effects']",PMC6647926,,,2019/07/14 06:00,2020/02/14 06:00,['2019/07/14 06:00'],"['2019/07/14 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/14 06:00 [medline]']","['915840 [pii]', '10.12659/MSM.915840 [doi]']",epublish,Med Sci Monit. 2019 Jul 13;25:5211-5218. doi: 10.12659/MSM.915840.,,20190713,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Metastasis is the leading cause of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAC) death. However, the contributions of circRNA to the metastasis of LUAC remain largely unknown. Based on circBase data and our biobank tissues, we identified circCRIM1 (a circRNA derived from exons 2, 3 and 4 of the CRIM1 gene, hsa_circ_0002346) as having a significantly decreased expression in LUAC samples compared with matched normal control samples. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that circCRIM1 suppresses the invasion and metastasis of LUAC. In vitro precipitation of circRNAs, luciferase reporter assay, and biotin-coupled microRNA capture were carried out to investigate the Ago2-dependent interaction of circCRIM1 and microRNA (miR)-93/miR-182. Mechanistically, we found that circCRIM1 could promote the expression of leukemia inhibitory factor receptor, a well-known tumor suppressor, by sponging miR-93 and miR-182. In the clinical and pathological analyses, the downregulation of circCRIM1 in LUAC was significantly correlated with lymphatic metastasis and TNM stage, which served as an independent risk factor for the overall survival of patients with LUAC. Our study showed that circCRIM1 inhibits the invasion and metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma cancer cells, which makes it a potential therapeutic target.","['Wang, Lin', 'Liang, Yingkuan', 'Mao, Qixing', 'Xia, Wenjie', 'Chen, Bing', 'Shen, Hongyu', 'Xu, Lin', 'Jiang, Feng', 'Dong, Gaochao']","['Wang L', 'Liang Y', 'Mao Q', 'Xia W', 'Chen B', 'Shen H', 'Xu L', 'Jiang F', 'Dong G']",['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6490-1471'],"['Department of Thoracic Surgery, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Translational Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Department of Geriatric Lung Cancer Laboratory, The Affiliated Geriatric Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Translational Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Translational Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Translational Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Translational Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Oncology, Department of Geriatric Lung Cancer Laboratory, The Affiliated Geriatric Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Translational Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Translational Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Thoracic Surgery, Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular and Translational Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital, Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Sci,Cancer science,101168776,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (CRIM1 protein, human)', '0 (LIFR protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit)', '0 (MIRN93 microRNA, human)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Mirn182 microRNA, human)', '0 (RNA, Circular)', '0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '63231-63-0 (RNA)', 'EC 2.7.11.30 (Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors)']",IM,,"['Adenocarcinoma of Lung/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Animals', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*metabolism', 'Bone Morphogenetic Protein Receptors', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor Receptor alpha Subunit/*genetics/metabolism', 'Lung/pathology', 'Lung Neoplasms/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Membrane Proteins/genetics', 'Mice, Nude', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Invasiveness/genetics/pathology', 'Prognosis', 'RNA/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Circular', 'RNA, Small Interfering/metabolism', 'Survival Analysis', 'Tissue Array Analysis', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",PMC6726696,['NOTNLM'],"['circCRIM1', 'has-miR-93 and has-miR-182', 'invasion and metastasis', 'leukemia inhibitory factor receptor', 'lung adenocarcinoma']",2019/07/14 06:00,2019/10/01 06:00,['2019/07/14 06:00'],"['2019/03/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/cas.14131 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Sci. 2019 Sep;110(9):2960-2972. doi: 10.1111/cas.14131.

Nonetheless, pharmaceutical products based on polymersomes are not available in the market, yet. Here, using commercially available copolymers, we investigated the encapsulation of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) L-asparaginase, an enzyme used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in polymersomes through a quality-by-design (QbD) approach. This allows for streamlining of processes required for improved bioavailability and pharmaceutical activity. Polymersomes were prepared by bottom-up (temperature switch) and top-down (film hydration) methods employing the diblock copolymers poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(lactic acid) (PEG45-PLA69, PEG114-PLA153, and PEG114-PLA180) and the triblock Pluronic((R)) L-121 (poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide), PEG5-PPO68-PEG5). Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP), Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs), Critical Process Parameters (CPPs), and the risk assessment were discussed for the early phase of polymersome development. An Ishikawa diagram was elaborated focusing on analytical methods, raw materials, and processes for polymersome preparation and L-asparaginase encapsulation. PEG-PLA resulted in diluted polymersomes systems. Nonetheless, a much higher yield of Pluronic((R)) L-121 polymersomes of 200 nm were produced by temperature switch, reaching 5% encapsulation efficiency. Based on these results, a risk estimation matrix was created for an initial risk assessment, which can help in the future development of other polymersome systems with biological APIs nanoencapsulated.","['Apolinario, Alexsandra Conceicao', 'Ferraro, Rafael Bertelli', 'de Oliveira, Camila Areias', 'Pessoa, Adalberto Jr', 'de Oliveira Rangel-Yagui, Carlota']","['Apolinario AC', 'Ferraro RB', 'de Oliveira CA', 'Pessoa A Jr', 'de Oliveira Rangel-Yagui C']",,"['Department of Biochemical and Pharmaceutical Technology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Sao Paulo, Av.

However, the role of oral voriconazole (VRCZ) in such patients has not been established. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of oral VRCZ compared to that of first-generation azoles prescribed within 7 days after the onset of chemotherapy in adult patients with AML/MDS using the Japanese administrative database. METHODS: This nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination/Per-Diem Payment System. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who switched to intravenous antifungal agents. Analyses using the instrumental variable method were performed to address unmeasured confounding. RESULTS: In total, data on 5517 inpatients from 142 hospitals were analyzed. An oral VRCZ prescription was significantly associated with a reduction in the proportion of patients switching to intravenous antifungal agents compared to first-generation azole prescription (21.0% (95% confidence interval [CI] - 33.4 to - 8.6)). The impact of oral VRCZ in reducing the proportion of patients switching to intravenous antifungal agents was stronger in patients aged < 65 years than in those aged >/= 65 years (- 40.6%, 95% CI - 63.2 to - 17.9; - 21.9%, 95% CI - 35.8 to - 8.1, respectively) and in patients prescribed oral azole within 3 days from the onset of chemotherapy than in those prescribed the same later (- 32.9%, 95% CI - 46.7 to - 19.2; - 9.0%, 95% CI - 33.7 to 15.7, respectively). CONCLUSION: Oral VRCZ administration may benefit adult patients with AML/MDS undergoing chemotherapy.","['Tsutsumi, Ikuyo', 'Kunisawa, Susumu', 'Yoshida, Chikashi', 'Seki, Masanori', 'Komeno, Takuya', 'Fushimi, Kiyohide', 'Morita, Satoshi', 'Imanaka, Yuichi']","['Tsutsumi I', 'Kunisawa S', 'Yoshida C', 'Seki M', 'Komeno T', 'Fushimi K', 'Morita S', 'Imanaka Y']",,"['Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Mito Medical Center, 280 Sakuranosato, Ibarakimachi, Higashiibarakigun, 311-3193, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Mito Medical Center, 280 Sakuranosato, Ibarakimachi, Higashiibarakigun, 311-3193, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Mito Medical Center, 280 Sakuranosato, Ibarakimachi, Higashiibarakigun, 311-3193, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Hematology, National Hospital Organization Mito Medical Center, 280 Sakuranosato, Ibarakimachi, Higashiibarakigun, 311-3193, Ibaraki, Japan.', 'Department of Health Policy and Informatics, Tokyo Medical and Dental University Graduate School of Medicine, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo, 113-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Biomedical Statistics and Bioinformatics, Kyoto University Graduate School of Medicine, 54 Kawaharacho, Syogoin, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8507, Japan.', 'Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Yoshida Konoe-cho, Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, 606-8501, Japan. heqm-office@umin.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Clin Oncol,International journal of clinical oncology,9616295,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', 'JFU09I87TR (Voriconazole)']",IM,,"['Administration, Intravenous', 'Administration, Oral', 'Aged', 'Antifungal Agents/*administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality', 'Humans', 'Invasive Fungal Infections/mortality/*prevention & control', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Length of Stay/statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Voriconazole/*administration & dosage']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Cytoreductive chemotherapy', 'Invasive fungal infections', 'Myelodysplastic syndrome', 'Oral voriconazole']",2019/07/14 06:00,2020/01/08 06:00,['2019/07/14 06:00'],"['2019/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s10147-019-01506-x [doi]', '10.1007/s10147-019-01506-x [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Clin Oncol. 2019 Nov;24(11):1449-1458. doi: 10.1007/s10147-019-01506-x.

We screened a library of clinical drugs on a cohort of primary human AML specimens and identified the BCL2 inhibitor ABT-199 as a selective agent against NPM1c+ AML. Mutational analysis of ABT-199-sensitive and -resistant specimens identified mutations in NPM1, RAD21, and IDH1/IDH2 as predictors of ABT-199 sensitivity. Comparative transcriptome analysis further uncovered BCL2A1 as a potential mediator of ABT-199 resistance in AML. In line with our observation that RAD21 mutation confers sensitivity to ABT-199, we provide functional evidence that reducing RAD21 levels can sensitize AML cells to BCL2 inhibition. Moreover, we demonstrate that ABT-199 is able to produce selective anti-AML activity in vivo toward AML with mutations associated with compound sensitivity in PDX models. Overall, this study delineates the contribution of several genetic events to the response to ABT-199 and provides a rationale for the development of targeted therapies for NPM1c+ AML.","['Bisaillon,

We compared the transcriptomes of primary CLL cells cocultured or not with protective bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) and found that oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial function, and hypoxic signaling undergo most significant dysregulation in non-protected CLL cells, with the changes peaking at 6-8 h, directly before induction of apoptosis. A subset of CLL patients displayed a gene expression signature resembling that of cocultured CLL cells and had significantly worse progression-free and overall survival. To identify drugs blocking BMSC-mediated support, we compared the relevant transcriptomic changes to the Connectivity Map database. Correlation was found with the transcriptomic signatures of the cardiac glycoside ouabain and of the ipecac alkaloids emetine and cephaeline. These compounds were highly active against protected primary CLL cells (relative IC50's 287, 190, and 35 nM, respectively) and acted by repressing HIF-1alpha and disturbing intracellular redox homeostasis. We tested emetine in a murine model of CLL and observed decreased CLL cells in peripheral blood, spleen, and bone marrow, recovery of hematological parameters and doubling of median survival (31.5 vs. 15 days, P = 0.0001). Pathways regulating redox homeostasis are thus therapeutically targetable mediators of microenvironmental support in CLL cells.","['Yosifov, Deyan Yordanov', 'Idler, Irina', 'Bhattacharya, Nupur', 'Reichenzeller, Michaela', 'Close, Viola', 'Ezerina, Daria', 'Scheffold, Annika', 'Jebaraj, Billy Michael Chelliah', 'Kugler, Sabrina', 'Bloehdorn, Johannes', 'Bahlo, Jasmin', 'Robrecht, Sandra', 'Eichhorst, Barbara', 'Fischer, Kirsten', 'Weigel, Anja', 'Busch, Hauke', 'Lichter, Peter', 'Dohner, Hartmut', 'Dick, Tobias P', 'Stilgenbauer, Stephan', 'Mertens, Daniel']","['Yosifov DY', 'Idler I', 'Bhattacharya N', 'Reichenzeller M', 'Close V', 'Ezerina D', 'Scheffold A', 'Jebaraj BMC', 'Kugler S', 'Bloehdorn J', 'Bahlo J', 'Robrecht S', 'Eichhorst B', 'Fischer K', 'Weigel A', 'Busch H', 'Lichter P', 'Dohner H', 'Dick TP', 'Stilgenbauer S', 'Mertens D']","['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-5473-4398', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4763-4521', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-1367-973X', 'ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-0227-7188']","['Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"", German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"", German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, CA, USA.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"", German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"", German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Redox Regulation, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"", German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne Bonn, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne Bonn, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne Bonn, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department I of Internal Medicine, Center of Integrated Oncology Cologne Bonn, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Systems Biology of the Cellular Microenvironment Group, Institute of Molecular Medicine and Cell Research (IMMZ), Albert-Ludwigs-University (ALU), Freiburg, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK), Freiburg, Germany.', 'Division of Molecular Genetics, German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Division of Redox Regulation, DKFZ-ZMBH Alliance, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany.', 'Department of Internal Medicine III, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany. daniel.mertens@uniklinik-ulm.de.', 'Cooperation Unit ""Mechanisms of Leukemogenesis"", German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Heidelberg, Germany. daniel.mertens@uniklinik-ulm.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['X8D5EPO80M (Emetine)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Coculture Techniques', 'Emetine/pharmacology', 'Heterografts', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/drug effects/*physiology']",,,,2019/07/14 06:00,2020/07/02 06:00,['2019/07/14 06:00'],"['2017/08/18 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/18 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/01/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/02 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1038/s41375-019-0513-x [doi]', '10.1038/s41375-019-0513-x [pii]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 2020 Jan;34(1):115-127. doi: 10.1038/s41375-019-0513-x.

However, immune recognition of the murine scFv may render subsequent infusion(s) ineffective. Also, nonselective expansion of both CAR-transduced and nontransduced T cells during the production stage affects the yield and purity of final products. Here, we aim to develop a humanized selective (hs) CD19 CAR to solve the above problems.Experimental Design: A CD19 hsCAR was designed, which incorporated a short selective domain between the humanized heavy chain and light chain. The CAR was examined for its property, and then trialed in 5 highly treated B-ALL patients. RESULTS: hsCAR possessed around 6-fold higher affinity to CD19 versus murine CAR (mCAR). Incubation with selective domain-specific mAbs (SmAb) selectively expanded CAR-transduced T cells, and led to a higher proportion of central memory T cells in the final products. SmAb-stimulated CD19 hsCAR-T cells exhibited superior antitumor cytotoxic functions in vitro and in vivo. Autologous (n = 2) and allogeneic donor (n = 3, with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation) hsCAR-T cells were infused into 5 patients who had relapsed after receiving mCAR-T treatments. Two patients received mCAR-T treatments twice previously but the second treatments were ineffective. In contrast, subsequent hsCAR-T treatments proved effective in all 5 patients and achieved complete molecular remission in four, including one with extramedullary disease with central nervous system involvement. CONCLUSIONS: hsCD19 CAR-T treatment shows efficacy in highly treated B-ALL patients who have relapsed after receiving CD19 mCAR-T therapies.","['Zhao, Yu', 'Liu, Zhongfeng', 'Wang, Xuan', 'Wu, Huantong', 'Zhang, Jianping', 'Yang, Junfang', 'Zhang, Fayou', 'Liu, Lining', 'Long, Jiafu', 'Lu, Peihua', 'Chen, Zhiguo']","['Zhao Y', 'Liu Z', 'Wang X', 'Wu H', 'Zhang J', 'Yang J', 'Zhang F', 'Liu L', 'Long J', 'Lu P', 'Chen Z']",,"['Cell Therapy Center, Beijing Institute of Geriatrics, Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University, and Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.', 'Center of Neural Injury and Repair, Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'Cell Therapy Center, Beijing Institute of Geriatrics, Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University, and Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.', 'Center of Neural Injury and Repair, Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'Cell Therapy Center, Beijing Institute of Geriatrics, Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University, and Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.', 'Center of Neural Injury and Repair, Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'Cell Therapy Center, Beijing Institute of Geriatrics, Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University, and Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.', 'Center of Neural Injury and Repair, Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders, Beijing, China.', 'Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei, China.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China.', 'Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei, China.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China.', 'Cell Therapy Center, Beijing Institute of Geriatrics, Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University, and Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Medicinal Chemical Biology and College of Life Sciences, Nankai University, Tianjin, China. chenzhiguo@gmail.com peihua_lu@126.com jflong@nankai.edu.cn.', 'Lu Daopei Hospital, Langfang, Hebei, China. chenzhiguo@gmail.com peihua_lu@126.com jflong@nankai.edu.cn.', 'Lu Daopei Institute of Hematology, Beijing, China.', 'Cell Therapy Center, Beijing Institute of Geriatrics, Xuanwu Hospital Capital Medical University, and Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Ministry of Education, Beijing, China. chenzhiguo@gmail.com peihua_lu@126.com jflong@nankai.edu.cn.', 'Center of Neural Injury and Repair, Beijing Institute for Brain Disorders, Beijing, China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic', 'Cytokines/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy, Adoptive', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Precursor B-Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/*therapy', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism', 'Recurrence', 'Retreatment', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/*metabolism', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,,,2019/07/14 06:00,2020/09/08 06:00,['2019/07/14 06:00'],"['2019/03/21 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/15 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/08 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-0916 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0916 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Sep 15;25(18):5595-5607. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0916.

However, unlike other members of this complex such as Gata1, Fli1, and Runx1, mutations of Scl have not been observed as a cause of inherited thrombocytopenia. We postulated that functional redundancy with its closely related family member, lymphoblastic leukemia 1 (Lyl1) might explain this observation. To determine whether Lyl1 can substitute for Scl in megakaryopoiesis, we examined the platelet phenotype of mice lacking 1 or both factors in megakaryocytes. Conditional Scl knockout (KO) mice crossed with transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of the mouse platelet factor 4 (Pf4) promoter generated megakaryocytes with markedly reduced but not absent Scl These Pf4Sclc-KO mice had mild thrombocytopenia and subtle defects in platelet aggregation. However, Pf4Sclc-KO mice generated on an Lyl1-null background (double knockout [DKO] mice) had severe macrothrombocytopenia, abnormal megakaryocyte morphology, defective pro-platelet formation, and markedly impaired platelet aggregation. DKO megakaryocytes, but not single-knockout megakaryocytes, had reduced expression of Gata1, Fli1, Nfe2, and many other genes that cause inherited thrombocytopenia. These gene expression changes were significantly associated with shared Scl and Lyl1 E-box binding sites that were also enriched for Gata1, Ets, and Runx1 motifs. Thus, Scl and Lyl1 share functional roles in platelet production by regulating expression of partner proteins including Gata1. We propose that this functional redundancy provides one explanation for the absence of Scl and Lyl1 mutations in inherited thrombocytopenia.","['Chiu, Sung K', 'Orive, Stephanie L', 'Moon, Mitchell J', 'Saw, Jesslyn', 'Ellis, Sarah', 'Kile, Benjamin T', 'Huang, Yizhou', 'Chacon, Diego', 'Pimanda, John E', 'Beck, Dominik', 'Hamilton, Justin R', 'Tremblay, Cedric S', 'Curtis, David J']","['Chiu SK', 'Orive SL', 'Moon MJ', 'Saw J', 'Ellis S', 'Kile BT', 'Huang Y', 'Chacon D', 'Pimanda JE', 'Beck D', 'Hamilton JR', 'Tremblay CS', 'Curtis DJ']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-5772-6051', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-8836-8947', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-0509-8962', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7554-6727', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2396-776X', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-9497-0996']","['Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, Melbourne, Australia.', 'The Walter Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Anatomy and Development Biology, Monash Biomedicine Discovery Institute, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.', 'Lowy Cancer Research Centre.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, and.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.', 'Lowy Cancer Research Centre.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, and.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.', 'Lowy Cancer Research Centre.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, and.', 'Department of Pathology, School of Medical Sciences, University of New South Wales Sydney, Sydney, Australia; and.', 'Department of Haematology, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia.', 'School of Biomedical Engineering, University of Technology, Sydney, Australia.', 'Lowy Cancer Research Centre.', 'Prince of Wales Clinical School, and.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Australian Centre for Blood Diseases, Central Clinical School, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia.', 'Department of Clinical Haematology, Alfred Health, Melbourne, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors)', '0 (GATA1 Transcription Factor)', '0 (Gata1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Lyl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1)', '0 (Tal1 protein, mouse)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors/genetics/*physiology', 'Blood Platelets/*physiology', 'GATA1 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'T-Cell Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia Protein 1/genetics/*physiology', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/genetics', 'Thrombopoiesis/*genetics']",,,,2019/07/14 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/07/14 06:00'],"['2019/01/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/11 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/14 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)72315-3 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019896175 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Sep 5;134(10):826-835. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019896175.

Ivosidenib is an oral, targeted inhibitor of mutant IDH1 (mIDH1) approved in the USA for the treatment of mIDH1 acute myeloid leukaemia in newly diagnosed patients ineligible for intensive chemotherapy and patients with relapsed or refractory disease. Ivosidenib is under clinical evaluation in a phase 1 study that aims to assess its safety and tolerability in patients with mIDH1 solid tumours. Here we report data for the mIDH1-cholangiocarcinoma cohort. METHODS: We did a phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study of ivosidenib monotherapy in mIDH1 solid tumours at 12 clinical sites in the USA and one in France. The primary outcomes were safety, tolerability, maximum tolerated dose, and recommended phase 2 dose. Eligible patients had a documented mIDH1 tumour based on local testing, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, one or more previous lines of therapy, and evaluable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. During dose escalation, ivosidenib was administered orally at 200-1200 mg daily in 28-day cycles in a standard 3 + 3 design; during expansion, patients received the selected dose on the basis of pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, safety, and activity data from dose escalation. Safety and clinical activity analyses were reported for all patients with mIDH1-cholangiocarcinoma who were enrolled and received at least one dose of study treatment. Enrolment is complete, and the study is ongoing. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02073994. FINDINGS: Between March 14, 2014 and May 12, 2017, 73 patients with mIDH1-cholangiocarcinoma were enrolled and received ivosidenib. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported and maximum tolerated dose was not reached; 500 mg daily was selected for expansion. Common (>/=20%) adverse events, regardless of cause, were fatigue (31 [42%]; two [3%] grade >/=3), nausea (25 [34%]; one [1%] grade >/=3), diarrhoea (23 [32%]), abdominal pain (20 [27%]; two [3%] grade >/=3), decreased appetite (20 [27%]; one [1%] grade >/=3), and vomiting (17 [23%]). Common grade 3 or worse adverse events were ascites (four [5%]) and anaemia (three [4%]); the only treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse event in more than one patient was fatigue (two [3%]). Two (3%) patients had serious adverse events leading to on-treatment death (Clostridioides difficile infection and procedural haemorrhage); neither was assessed by the investigator as related to treatment. 46 (63%) patients had adverse events deemed related to ivosidenib, of which four (5%) were grade 3 or higher (two [3%] for fatigue; one [1%] each for decreased blood phosphorus and increased blood alkaline phosphatase). One serious adverse event was considered possibly related to treatment (grade 2 supraventricular extrasystoles). Four (5%; 95% CI 1.5-13.4) patients had a partial response. Median progression-free survival was 3.8 months (95% CI 3.6-7.3), 6-month progression-free survival was 40.1% (28.4-51.6), and 12-month progression-free survival was 21.8% (12.3-33.0). Median overall survival was 13.8 months (95% CI 11.1-29.3); however, data were censored for 48 patients (66%). INTERPRETATION: Ivosidenib might offer a well tolerated option for patients with mIDH1-cholangiocarcinoma. An ongoing, global phase 3 study is evaluating ivosidenib versus placebo in patients with previously treated nonresectable or metastatic mIDH1-cholangiocarcinoma.

The human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) oncoprotein Tax activates NF-kappaB-signaling and induces DNA-damage and aberrant chromosomal segregation through diverse mechanisms which contribute to viral carcinogenesis. Intriguingly, Stathmin/oncoprotein-18 (Op-18) depolymerizes tubulin and interacts with the p65(RelA) subunit and functions as a cofactor for NF-kappaB-dependent transactivation. We thus hypothesized that the dissociation of p65(RelA)-Stathmin/Op-18 complexes by Tax could lead to the catastrophic destabilization of microtubule (MT) spindle fibers during mitosis and provide a novel mechanistic link between NF-kappaB-signaling and genomic instability. Here we report that the inhibition of Stathmin expression by the retroviral latency protein, p30(II), or knockdown with siRNA-stathmin, dampens Tax-mediated NF-kappaB transactivation and counters Tax-induced genomic instability and cytotoxicity. The Tax-G148V mutant, defective for NF-kappaB activation, exhibited reduced p65(RelA)-Stathmin binding and diminished genomic instability and cytotoxicity. Dominant-negative inhibitors of NF-kappaB also prevented Tax-induced multinucleation and apoptosis. Moreover, cell clones containing the infectious HTLV-1 ACH. p30(II) mutant provirus, impaired for p30(II) production, exhibited increased multinucleation and the accumulation of cytoplasmic tubulin aggregates following nocodozole-treatment. These findings allude to a mechanism whereby NF-kappaB-signaling regulates tubulin dynamics and mitotic instability through the modulation of p65(RelA)-Stathmin/Op-18 interactions, and support the notion that p30(II) enhances the survival of Tax-expressing HTLV-1-transformed cells.","['Malu, Aditi', 'Hutchison, Tetiana', 'Yapindi, Lacin', 'Smith, Katie', 'Nelson, Katherine', 'Bergeson, Rachel', 'Pope, Jordan', 'Romeo, Megan', 'Harrod, Carolyn', 'Ratner, Lee', 'Van Lint, Carine', 'Harrod, Robert']","['Malu A', 'Hutchison T', 'Yapindi L', 'Smith K', 'Nelson K', 'Bergeson R', 'Pope J', 'Romeo M', 'Harrod C', 'Ratner L', 'Van Lint C', 'Harrod R']",,"['Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, 75275-0376, United States.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, 75275-0376, United States.', 'Departments of Medicine and Molecular Microbiology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, 63110, United States.', 'Service of Molecular Virology, Department of Molecular Biology, Universite Libre de Bruxelles, 6041, Gosselies, Belgium.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Virology, Department of Biological Sciences, The Dedman College Center for Drug Discovery, Design & Delivery, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, TX, 75275-0376, United States.

However, oral administration of IMT is challenged by its high oral dose, low intestinal solubility and adverse reactions. This work aimed to investigate the effect of galactose ligand on polymeric nanoparticles-facilitated oral absorption of IMT. N-oleoyl-D-galactosamine was synthesized for fabricating biomimetic galactose-modified nanoparticles (GNPs) in an attempt to improve the oral bioavailability of IMT. IMT-loaded GNPs (IMT-GNPs) were prepared using a solvent diffusion technique and characterized by particle size, morphology, and entrapment efficiency (EE). The in vitro release and in vivo oral bioavailability of IMT-GNPs were comparatively studied with bulk IMT and IMT-loaded nanoparticles (IMT-NPs), respectively. The resultant IMT-GNPs were 122.0nm around in particle size with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.201. IMT-GNPs possessed a high EE (93.06%) and exhibited a sustained effect on drug release. After oral administration, IMT-GNPs significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of IMT, up to 152.3% relative to IMT suspensions, whereas IMT-NPs merely resulted in an increase to 115.2%. Cellular uptake and ex vivo intestinal transport imaging demonstrated that GNPs were armed with higher cellular affinity and intestinal epithelial permeability compared with galactose-free IMT-NPs. These results provide solid evidence that galactose modification has great potential to ulteriorly promote the oral absorption of IMT on the base of nanoparticles, which may be conducive to achieve the synergy and attenuation of IMT.","['Li, Yan', 'Yang, Baohui', 'Zhang, Xingwang']","['Li Y', 'Yang B', 'Zhang X']",,"['Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.', 'Department of Pharmacy, Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Jinan 250014, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Pharmaceutics, School of Pharmacy, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China.

The JAK2 T875N somatic mutation has been detected in about 5.2% of AML patients. But the structural basis and mechanism of JAK2 T875N mutation in the pathology of AML is still unclear. Our results suggested that JAK2 T875N mutation disrupted the T875 and D873 interaction which destroyed the compact structure of JH1 domain, forced it into the active conformation, facilitated the entrance of substrate and thus led to JAK2 hyperactivation. Mutations (T875N, T875A, D873A and D873G) disrupted the T875 and D873 interaction enhanced JAK2's activity, decreased its structural stability and JH2 domain's activity which further enhanced JAK2's activity, while mutations (T875R, D873E, T875R/D873E) repaired this interaction displayed opposite results. Moreover, JAK2 T875N mutation enhanced the activity of JAK2-STAT5 pathway, promoted the proliferation and transformation of OCI-AML3 cells.

Deregulation in the BCR signaling is associated with B-cell transformation. Contrariwise to B-2 cells, BCR engagement in B-1 cells results in low proliferation rate and increased apoptosis population, whereas overactivation may be associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. It has been demonstrated that several transcription factors that are involved in the B cell development play a role in the regulation of BCR function. Among them, Ikaros is considered an essential regulator of lymphoid differentiation and activation. Several reports suggest that Ikaros expression is deregulated in different forms of leukemia. Herein, we demonstrated that CLL cells show decreased Ikaros expression and abnormal cytoplasmic cell localization. These alterations were also observed in radioresistant B-1 cells, which present high proliferative activity, suggesting that abnormal localization of Ikaros could determine its loss of function. Furthermore, Ikaros knockdown increased the expression of BCR pathway components in murine B-1 cells, such as Lyn, Blnk, and CD19. Additionally, in the absence of Ikaros, B-1 cells become responsive to BCR stimulus, increasing cell proliferation even in the absence of antigen stimulation. These results suggested that Ikaros is an important controller of B-1 cell proliferation by interfering with the BCR activity. Therefore, altered Ikaros expression in CLL or radioresistant B-1 cells could determine a responsive status of BCR to self-antigens, which would culminate in the clonal expansion of B-1 cells.","['Oliveira, Vivian Cristina de', 'Lacerda, Marcelo Pitombeira de', 'Moraes, Barbara Bomfim Muniz', 'Gomes, Caio Perez', 'Maricato, Juliana Terzi', 'Souza, Olivia Fonseca', 'Schenkman, Sergio', 'Pesquero, Joao Bosco', 'Moretti, Nilmar Silvio', 'Rodrigues, Celso Arrais', 'Popi, Ana Flavia']","['Oliveira VC', 'Lacerda MP', 'Moraes BBM', 'Gomes CP', 'Maricato JT', 'Souza OF', 'Schenkman S', 'Pesquero JB', 'Moretti NS', 'Rodrigues CA', 'Popi AF']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9814-4181'],"['Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Disciplina de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Biologia Molecular, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Disciplina de Hematologia e Hemoterapia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Departamento de Microbiologia, Imunologia e Parasitologia, Escola Paulista de Medicina, Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Leukoc Biol,Journal of leukocyte biology,8405628,"['0 (IKZF1 protein, human)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Zfpn1a1 protein, mouse)', '148971-36-2 (Ikaros Transcription Factor)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics/pathology', 'Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Ikaros Transcription Factor/*genetics/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Protein Binding', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/metabolism', 'Signal Transduction']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-1 and CLL cells', '*BCR signaling', '*Ikaros']",2019/07/13 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/02/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/JLB.MA1118-454R [doi]'],ppublish,J Leukoc Biol. 2019 Sep;106(3):581-594. doi: 10.1002/JLB.MA1118-454R.

However, little is known about ICU utilization and post-ICU outcomes in this population. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective analysis for 330 patients who were 60 years old or older and were diagnosed with AML between 2005 and 2013 at 2 hospitals in Boston.They used descriptive statistics to examine the proportion of patients admitted to the ICU as well as their mortality and functional recovery. They used logistic regression to identify risk factors for in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Ninety-six patients (29%) were admitted to the ICU, primarily because of respiratory failure (39%), septic shock (28%), and neurological compromise (9%). The proportions of patients who survived to hospital discharge, 90 days, and 1 year were 47% (45 of 96), 35% (34 of 96), and 30% (29 of 96), respectively. At 90 days, 76% of the patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1, and 86% were in complete remission (CR) and/or continued to receive AML-directed therapy. In a multivariate analysis, a poorer baseline ECOG PS score (odds ratio, 2.76; P = .013) and the need for 2 or more life-sustaining therapies (ie, vasopressors, invasive ventilation, and/or renal replacement therapy; odds ratio, 12.4; P < .001) were associated with increased odds of in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Although almost one-third of older patients with AML are admitted to an ICU, nearly half survive to hospital discharge with good functional outcomes. The baseline performance status and the need for 2 or more life-sustaining therapies predict hospital mortality. These data support the judicious use of ICU resources for older patients with AML.","['Slavin, Samuel D', 'Fenech, Alyssa', 'Jankowski, Amanda L', 'Abel, Gregory A', 'Brunner, Andrew M', 'Steensma, David P', 'Fathi, Amir T', 'DeAngelo, Daniel J', 'Wadleigh, Martha', 'Hobbs, Gabriela S', 'Amrein, Philip C', 'Stone, Richard M', 'Temel, Jennifer S', 'El-Jawahri, Areej']","['Slavin SD', 'Fenech A', 'Jankowski AL', 'Abel GA', 'Brunner AM', 'Steensma DP', 'Fathi AT', 'DeAngelo DJ', 'Wadleigh M', 'Hobbs GS', 'Amrein PC', 'Stone RM', 'Temel JS', 'El-Jawahri A']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7208-1351', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5130-9284', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-4907-6447', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3556-1495']","['Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Department of Medical Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts.', 'Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Boston', 'Female', 'Hospital Mortality/*trends', 'Hospitalization/*statistics & numerical data', 'Humans', 'Intensive Care Units/*statistics & numerical data', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Logistic Models', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Outcome Assessment, Health Care', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies']",PMC6788935,['NOTNLM'],"['*activities of daily living', '*acute myeloid leukemia', '*critical care', '*in-hospital mortality']",2019/07/13 06:00,2020/05/27 06:00,['2019/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/04/03 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/16 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/27 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cncr.32397 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 2019 Nov 1;125(21):3845-3852. doi: 10.1002/cncr.32397.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We herein, present the data of 27 pregnancy associated acute leukemia [18 acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 9 acute lymphatic leukemia (ALL)]. Their data were compared to an age matched group of 75 non-pregnant acute leukemia patients admitted and treated during the same period [53 AML and 22 ALL]. RESULTS: Complete remission rates, induction failure and induction deaths showed insignificant differences in pregnant versus non pregnant patients in both types of acute leukemia. Similarly, OS and DFS showed no significant difference between pregnant versus non pregnant patients in both types of acute leukemia. Cox regression analysis was conducted for prediction of OS and DFS in all the studied patients applying age, WBCs, BM blasts, LDH, cytogenetic abnormalities and pregnancy as covariates, Pregnancy was not considered as a risk factor for OS or PFS in univariate or multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION: Our report to the best of our knowledge is the first to present direct evidence that pregnancy has no significant impact on outcome of acute leukemia compared to non-pregnant patients. These results are limited by the small number of cases and should be confirmed in a prospectively larger cohort of patients.","['Mabed, Mohamed', 'Eisa, Noha', 'El-Ashwah, Shaimaa', 'Talaab, Mona']","['Mabed M', 'Eisa N', 'El-Ashwah S', 'Talaab M']",,"['The Hematology Unit, Oncology Center, Mansoura University, Egypt.

After initial therapy with purine nucleoside analogs, up to 50% of patients relapse after several years of remission. The number of relapsed patients is increasing and, until recently, there was no approved therapy with durable responses for hairy cell leukemia patients in the relapsed setting, thus the need for new non-chemotherapy approach with significant efficacy and less myelosuppression. Areas covered: Moxetumomab pasudotox is a recombinant immunotoxin containing a Fv fragment of an anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody and truncated Pseudomonas exotoxin (PE38). The authors reviewed pre-clinical and clinical studies that led to the FDA approval of the drug in patients with relapsed and/or refractory hairy cell leukemia, who received at least two prior therapies, including at least one purine nucleoside analog. Expert opinion: Moxetumomab pasudotox demonstrated a durable complete remission rate of 30% in heavily pretreated patients with hairy cell leukemia, and MRD eradication in 85% of responding patients. Moxetumomab pasudotox got a global FDA approval in September 2018. The US prescribing information carries boxed warnings regarding the risk of capillary leak syndrome and hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Long-term use has inhibitory effects on other tyrosine kinase pathways causing off-target complications such as growth impairment. Our aim was to evaluate impact of long-term use on longitudinal growth in children with CML in Kerala. We hypothesized that the impact would be lesser compared to Northern India as Kerala has the lowest rates of underweight and stunting, with a high literacy rate and per capita income. Children </=14 years of age, diagnosed with CML and received imatinib for at least 1 year were included. Girls >9 years of age and boys >11 years were considered pubertal. Height Z scores were derived using WHO AnthroPlus. Paired t test compared difference of Z scores in prepubertal and postpubertal age groups. Height Z scores were compared with mid-parental height and sibling height Z scores. Thirty-six children were included (M = 21; F = 15). Median duration of imatinib exposure was 84 months. Decrease in longitudinal growth affected children in both prepubertal and postpubertal age groups. Decrease in height Z scores was more in prepubertal age group when imatinib therapy was initiated (p = .0018).

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression of microRNA-34b in the bone marrow of 72 children with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was detected by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). The relationship between microRNA-34b expression and pathological characteristics was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier curve was introduced for evaluating the prognostic value of microRNA-34b in pediatric AML. The regulatory effects of microRNA-34b on proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of leukemia cells were accessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Bioinformatics prediction and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay were conducted to evaluate the binding between microRNA-34b and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). LDHA expression after overexpression of microRNA-34b was determined by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Rescue experiments were conducted to verify whether microRNA-34b could regulate proliferative and apoptotic behaviors of leukemia cells by suppressing LDHA expression. RESULTS: MicroRNA-34b was markedly downregulated in AML children. Low expression of microRNA-34b was correlated to FAB typing, cytogenetic abnormality, and day 7 response to the treatment of pediatric AML. By collecting the follow-up data, it was found that low expression of microRNA-34b was correlated to the poor prognosis of AML. Overexpression of microRNA-34b inhibited proliferative ability and cell cycle progression, but accelerated apoptosis of AML cells. Dual-luciferase reporter gene assay verified that microRNA-34b could bind to LDHA, thereafter inhibiting LDHA expression. Overexpression of LDHA reversed the regulatory effects of microRNA-34b on proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis of AML cells. CONCLUSIONS: We found that microRNA-34b is lowly expressed in pediatric AML patients, and low expression of microRNA-34b may serve as an indicator of malignant progression and poor prognosis of pediatric AML. MicroRNA-34b may affect the proliferation and apoptosis of leukemia cells by regulating the expression of LDHA.","['Qi, H-X', 'Cao, Q', 'Zhou, G-P', 'Sun, X-Z', 'Zhou, W-D', 'Hong, Z', 'Hu, J', 'Juan, C-X', 'Li, S', 'Kuai, W-X']","['Qi HX', 'Cao Q', 'Zhou GP', 'Sun XZ', 'Zhou WD', 'Hong Z', 'Hu J', 'Juan CX', 'Li S', 'Kuai WX']",,"[""Department of Pediatrics, The Affiliated Huaian No. 1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Huaian, China. kwx9743@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Observational Study']",Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (MIRN34 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (LDHA protein, human)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/genetics', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Disease Progression', 'Down-Regulation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'MicroRNAs/*metabolism', 'Prognosis']",,,,2019/07/13 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2019/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201906_18202 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Jun;23(12):5351-5359. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201906_18202.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Expression levels of lncRNA SNHG1 and miR-488-5p in AML cell lines pAML and THP-1 were determined by quantitative Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Proliferative potential and cell cycle progression of pAML and THP-1 cells were detected after SNHG1 knockdown. Potential binding sites of SNHG1 and miR-488-5p were predicted by bioinformatics. Through RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay and luciferase reporter gene assay, we evaluated the binding condition between SNHG1 and miR-488-5p. MiR-488-5p expression in pAML and THP-1 cells with SNHG1 knockdown was detected by qRT-PCR to further verify their interaction. Subsequently, binding sites of NUP205 and miR-488-5p were predicted. Both mRNA and protein levels of NUP205 in pAML and THP-1 cells were examined. The regulatory effects of overexpressed NUP205 on proliferative potential and cell cycle progression of pAML and THP-1 cells transfected with si-SNHG1 were explored by gain-of-function experiments. RESULTS: LncRNA SNHG1 was highly expressed in pAML and THP-1 cells, while miR-488-5p was lowly expressed. SNHG1 knockdown in pAML and THP-1 cells inhibited proliferative ability and arrested cell cycle in G0/G1 phase. Knockdown of SNHG1 markedly upregulated the miR-488-5p expression in pAML and THP-1 cells. Furthermore, RIP and luciferase reporter gene assay confirmed the binding between SNHG1 and miR-488-5p. NUP205 was highly expressed in pAML and THP-1 cells at both mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, luciferase reporter gene assay indicated that NUP205 could bind to miR-488-5p. More importantly, the overexpression of NUP205 in pAML and THP-1 cells reversed the inhibitory effect of SNHG1 knockdown on proliferative ability and cell cycle progression. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNA SNHG1 promotes the development of AML through miR-488-5p/NUP205 axis.","['Bao, X-L', 'Zhang, L', 'Song, W-P']","['Bao XL', 'Zhang L', 'Song WP']",,"['Department of Neonatology, Weinan Maternal and Child Health Hospital, Weinan, China. songwenping12354@163.com.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,9717360,"['0 (MIRN488 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins)', '0 (Nup205 protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Long Noncoding)', '0 (long non-coding RNA SNHG1, human)']",IM,,"['Cell Proliferation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Pore Complex Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'RNA, Long Noncoding/genetics/*metabolism']",,,,2019/07/13 06:00,2020/10/02 06:00,['2019/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/10/02 06:00 [medline]']",['10.26355/eurrev_201907_18334 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci. 2019 Jul;23(13):5896-5903. doi: 10.26355/eurrev_201907_18334.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Herein we intended to study the effects of miR-153-3p/MCL1 axis in OVC. Web-based bioinformatics algorithms including DIANA TarBase 8.0, PicTar, and TargetScan Human 7.2 were used to predict the microRNAs (miRNAs) that could target MCL1 mRNA. Patient characteristics data collection and tissue sample immunohistochemical staining were used to determine the expression level of miR-153-3p and MCL1. We determined to unravel the effects of the pairing-up of miR-153-3p and MCL1 mRNA in OVC cell lines (OVCAR3 cell line and A2780) and xenografts (immunodeficient(immunodeficient Rag(-/-) mice) using several methods including real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, westernWestern blot, colony formation assay, wound healing assay, Transwell invasion assay, flow cytometry assay, and xenograft assay. These experiments were performed to study OVC cellular activities such as cell growth and death and so forth in vitro and in vivo. Plenty of miRNAs that can target MCL1 mRNA have been identified, and we have narrowed them down to miR-153-3p. MCL1 gene was found overexpressed in OVC tissues and OVC cell lines at RNA and protein levels, whereas miR-153-3p was found under-expressed in OVC tissues and cells. miR-153-3p was found to target MCL1 mRNA and interfered OVC progression. The repression of MCL1 gene expression caused by either miR-153-3p or small interfering RNA technique led to significantly reduced OVC cell growth and invasion in vitro. Lastly, the engraftment of transfected human OVC cells into Rag(-/-) mice confirmed the in vitro results. MCL1 gene acts as a cancer facilitator in OVC. In this study, we revealed the role of miR-153-3p on OVC progression by targeting MCL1 gene. Our work could comprehend the current understanding of OVC progression and contribute to the underlying aggression mechanism of this cancer.","['Li, Cui', 'Zhang, Yinmin', 'Zhao, Wei', 'Cui, Shoubin', 'Song, Yuchun']","['Li C', 'Zhang Y', 'Zhao W', 'Cui S', 'Song Y']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-0505-3569'],"['Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Yantai Affiliated Hospital, Binzhou Medical College, Yantai, Shandong, China.', ""Department of Gynaecology, The People's Hospital of Rizhao, Rizhao, Shandong, China."", ""Department of Reproduction, Dezhou People's Hospital, Dezhou, Shandong, China."", 'Department of Gynaecology, Yantai Affiliated Hospital, Binzhou Medical College, Yantai, Shandong, China.', 'Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Yantai Affiliated Hospital, Binzhou Medical College, Yantai, Shandong, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (MIRN153 microRNA, human)', '0 (MicroRNAs)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Female', 'HEK293 Cells', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Knockout', 'MicroRNAs/genetics/*metabolism', 'Middle Aged', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/genetics/*metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/*metabolism', 'Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*MCL1', '*miR-153-3p', '*ovarian carcinoma', '*tumor growth']",2019/07/13 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2019/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/03/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.29244 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 2019 Nov;120(11):19147-19158. doi: 10.1002/jcb.29244.

Hope is a positive psychology construct associated with better quality of life (QOL) that focuses on goal-oriented thinking. We developed and tested Achieving Wellness After Kancer in Early life (AWAKE), a scalable 8-week app-based program consisting of educational videos, mood/activity tracking, and telephone-based coaching to promote hope and QOL in young adult cancer survivors (YACS, 18-40 years old). A two-arm RCT was used to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of AWAKE (n = 38) versus attention control (AC; n = 18) among YACS within 2 years of completing treatment and recruited from two NCI-designated cancer centers. Outcomes including hope (Trait Hope Scale), QOL (36-Item Short Form Health Survey; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General), depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), and substance use were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6 months. Participants were an average of 32.55 (SD = 5.45) years old; 75.0% were female, and 80.4% White. The most common cancers were breast cancer (28.6%), melanoma (16.1%), and leukemia/lymphoma (12.5%). High retention, engagement, and satisfaction rates were documented in both conditions; AWAKE versus AC participants rated video content as more relevant (p = 0.007) and reported greater likelihood of talking positively about the program (p = 0.005).

However, the role and mechanism of histone methylation in the development and differentiation of iNKT cells in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) mice have yet to be deciphered. The DBA/1 mouse RA model was established by using a modified GPI mixed peptide. We demonstrated that total peripheral blood, thymus, and spleen iNKT cells in RA mice decreased significantly, while iNKT1 in the thymus and spleen was increased significantly. PLZF protein and PLZF mRNA levels were significantly decreased in thymus DP T cells, while T-bet protein and mRNA were significantly increased in thymus iNKT cells. We found a marked accumulation in H3K27me3 around the promoter regions of the signature gene Zbtb16 in RA mice thymus DP T cells, and an accumulation of H3K4me3 around the promoters of the Tbx21 gene in iNKT cells. The expression levels of UTX in the thymus of RA mice were significantly reduced. The changes in the above indicators were particularly significant in the progressive phase of inflammation (11 days after modeling) and the peak phase of inflammation (14 days after modeling) in RA mice. Developmental and differentiation defects of iNKT cells in RA mice were associated with abnormal methylation levels (H3K27me3 and H3K4me3) in the promoters of key genes Zbtb16 (encoding PLZF) and Tbx21 (encoding T-bet). Decreased UTX of thymus histone demethylase levels resulted in the accumulation of H3K27me3 modification.","['Meng, Ming', 'Liu, Huifang', 'Chen, Shengde', 'Zhao, Huijuan', 'Gao, Xiang', 'Zhang, Jingnan', 'Chen, Dongzhi']","['Meng M', 'Liu H', 'Chen S', 'Zhao H', 'Gao X', 'Zhang J', 'Chen D']",,"[""Medical School of Hebei University, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis mechanism and control of inflammatory-autoimmune diseases in Hebei Province, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical School of Hebei University, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis mechanism and control of inflammatory-autoimmune diseases in Hebei Province, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical School of Hebei University, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis mechanism and control of inflammatory-autoimmune diseases in Hebei Province, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical School of Hebei University, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis mechanism and control of inflammatory-autoimmune diseases in Hebei Province, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical School of Hebei University, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis mechanism and control of inflammatory-autoimmune diseases in Hebei Province, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical School of Hebei University, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis mechanism and control of inflammatory-autoimmune diseases in Hebei Province, Baoding, People's Republic of China."", ""Medical School of Hebei University, Baoding, People's Republic of China. chenddzz@163.com."", ""Key Laboratory of Pathogenesis mechanism and control of inflammatory-autoimmune diseases in Hebei Province, Baoding, People's Republic of China. chenddzz@163.com."", ""Department of Immunology, School of Medicine, Hebei University, Baoding, Hebei Province, People's Republic of China. chenddzz@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,"['0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein)', '0 (T-Box Domain Proteins)', '0 (T-box transcription factor TBX21)', '0 (Zbtb16 protein, mouse)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Histone Demethylases)', 'EC 1.14.11.- (Utx protein, mouse)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Experimental/pathology', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Histone Demethylases/genetics/metabolism', 'Lysine/*metabolism', 'Methylation', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Natural Killer T-Cells/*pathology', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Zinc Finger Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Spleen/pathology', 'T-Box Domain Proteins/genetics/metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/*physiology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Epigenetic', '*H3K27me3', '*H3K4me3', '*RA', '*UTX', '*iNKT']",2019/07/13 06:00,2019/10/29 06:00,['2019/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/04/13 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/29 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s00251-019-01124-x [doi]', '10.1007/s00251-019-01124-x [pii]']",ppublish,Immunogenetics. 2019 Jul;71(7):489-499. doi: 10.1007/s00251-019-01124-x.

For comparison, the commercial fungal l-asparaginase was also studied. Both commercial and l-asparaginase from Aspergillus oryzae CCT 3940 showed optimum activity and stability in the pH range from 5 to 8 and the asparaginase from Aspergillus niger LBA 02 was stable in a more alkaline pH range. About the kinetic parameters, the denaturation constant increased with the heating temperature for all l-asparaginases, indicating that the l-asparaginase activity decreased at higher temperatures, especially above 60 degrees C. Moreover, l-asparaginase from A. oryzae CCT 3940 remained stable after 60 min at 50 degrees C. None of the l-asparaginases were inhibited by high NaCl concentrations, which are highly desirable for food industry application. The catalytic activities of all the l-asparaginases were enhanced by the presence of Mn(2+) and inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoate and iodoacetamide. The l-asparaginase from the Aspergillus strains and the commercial enzyme had similar K m when l-asparagine was used as substrate. None of the l-asparaginases, except the l-asparaginase from A. niger LBA 02, could hydrolyze the substrate l-glutamine, which is of interest for medical proposes, since the glutaminase activity is usually related to adverse reaction during the leukemia treatment. This study showed that these new three non-recombinant l-asparaginases studied have potential application in the food and pharmaceutical industries, especially due to their good thermostability.","['Dias, Fernanda Furlan Goncalves', 'Santos Aguilar, Jessika Goncalves Dos', 'Sato, Helia Harumi']","['Dias FFG', 'Santos Aguilar JGD', 'Sato HH']",,"['Department of Food Science, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas, Rua Monteiro Lobato 80, Campinas, SP Brazil.0000 0001 0723 2494grid.411087.b', 'Department of Food Science, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas, Rua Monteiro Lobato 80, Campinas, SP Brazil.0000 0001 0723 2494grid.411087.b', 'Department of Food Science, School of Food Engineering, University of Campinas, Rua Monteiro Lobato 80, Campinas, SP Brazil.0000 0001 0723 2494grid.411087.b']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,3 Biotech,3 Biotech,101565857,,,,,PMC6597663,['NOTNLM'],"['Aspergillus niger', 'Aspergillus oryzae', 'Characterization', 'l-Asparaginase']",2019/07/13 06:00,2019/07/13 06:01,['2019/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/05/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/14 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/13 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1007/s13205-019-1814-5 [doi]', '1814 [pii]']",ppublish,3 Biotech. 2019 Jul;9(7):289. doi: 10.1007/s13205-019-1814-5.

The metabolic extracts exhibited cytotoxicity with IC50 values ranging from 0.030mg/mL to 4.4mg/mL. The Streptomyces bingchenggensis ULS14 extract was cytotoxic against all the cell lines tested. The bioactivity-guided extraction and purification of the metabolic extracts from this strain yielded two purified anticancer compounds: ULDF4 and ULDF5. The structures of the extracted compounds were determined using spectroscopic analyses, including electrospray ionization mass spectrophotometer and nuclear magnetic resonance (1 Dimensional and 2 Dimensional), and were shown to be structurally similar to staurosporine and kigamicin.

Here we show that Leukemia Inhibitory Factor (LIF) expression is induced specifically by oncogenic KRAS in PDAC and that LIF depletion by genetic means or by neutralizing antibodies prevents engraftment in pancreatic xenograft models. Moreover, LIF-neutralizing antibodies synergize with gemcitabine to eradicate established pancreatic tumors in a syngeneic, Kras(G12D)-driven, PDAC mouse model. The related cytokine IL-6 cannot substitute for LIF, suggesting that LIF mediates KRAS-driven malignancies through a non-STAT-signaling pathway. Unlike IL-6, LIF inhibits the activity of the Hippo-signaling pathway in PDACs. Depletion of YAP inhibits the function of LIF in human PDAC cells. Our data suggest a crucial role of LIF in KRAS-driven pancreatic cancer and that blockade of LIF by neutralizing antibodies represents an attractive approach to improving therapeutic outcomes.","['Wang, Man-Tzu', 'Fer, Nicole', 'Galeas, Jacqueline', 'Collisson, Eric A', 'Kim, Sung Eun', 'Sharib, Jeremy', 'McCormick, Frank']","['Wang MT', 'Fer N', 'Galeas J', 'Collisson EA', 'Kim SE', 'Sharib J', 'McCormick F']",,"['Tumor Microenvironment Center, UPMC Hillman Cancer Center; Department of Pharmacology and Chemical Biology, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, 15213, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.', 'NCI RAS Initiative, Cancer Research Technology Program, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD, 21702, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.', 'Department of Medicine/Hematology and Oncology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.', 'Department of Surgery, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94143, USA.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, CA, 94158, USA.

As an important regulator of cell proliferation and a key player in dNTP homeostasis, mutations to SAMHD1 are implicated in hypermutated cancers, and germline mutations are associated with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia and the inflammatory disorder Aicardi-Goutieres Syndrome. By limiting the supply of dNTPs for viral DNA synthesis, SAMHD1 also restricts the replication of several retroviruses, such as HIV-1, and some DNA viruses in dendritic and myeloid lineage cells and resting T-cells. SAMHD1 activity is regulated throughout the cell cycle, both at the level of protein expression and post-translationally, through phosphorylation. In addition, allosteric regulation further fine-tunes the catalytic activity of SAMHD1, with a nucleotide-activated homotetramer as the catalytically active form of the protein. In cells, GTP and dATP are the likely physiological activators of two adjacent allosteric sites, AL1 (GTP) and AL2 (dATP), that bridge monomer-monomer interfaces to stabilise the protein homotetramer. This review summarises the extensive X-ray crystallographic, biophysical and molecular dynamics experiments that have elucidated important features of allosteric regulation in SAMHD1. We present a comprehensive mechanism detailing the structural and protein dynamics components of the allosteric coupling between nucleotide-induced tetramerization and the catalysis of dNTP hydrolysis by SAMHD1.","['Morris, Elizabeth R', 'Taylor, Ian A']","['Morris ER', 'Taylor IA']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-1893-7515'],"['Macromolecular Structure Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, U.K. liz.morris@crick.ac.uk.', 'Macromolecular Structure Laboratory, The Francis Crick Institute, 1 Midland Road, London NW1 1AT, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Biochem Soc Trans,Biochemical Society transactions,7506897,"['0 (Antiviral Agents)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (Nucleotides)', 'EC 3.1.5.- (SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1)']",IM,,"['Allosteric Regulation', '*Antiviral Agents', 'Catalysis', 'Cell Proliferation/physiology', 'DNA, Viral/biosynthesis', 'Homeostasis', 'Humans', 'Mutation', 'Nucleotides/metabolism', 'SAM Domain and HD Domain-Containing Protein 1/genetics/metabolism/*physiology', 'Virus Replication/*physiology']",PMC7045340,['NOTNLM'],"['*HD domain', '*HIV', '*SAMHD1', '*allosteric regulation', '*hydrolase', '*oligomerization']",2019/07/13 06:00,2020/01/01 06:00,['2019/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/05/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['BST20180348 [pii]', '10.1042/BST20180348 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Soc Trans. 2019 Aug 30;47(4):1013-1027. doi: 10.1042/BST20180348.

As both factors play a role in mortality after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), we retrospectively evaluated the impact of pre-transplant testosterone levels on outcome in male patients undergoing alloSCT. In the discovery cohort (n=346), an impact on outcome was observed only in the subgroup of patients allografted for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (n=176, hereafter termed 'training cohort'). In the training cohort, lower pre-transplant testosterone levels were significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) for a decrease of 100 ng/dL: 1.11, P=0.045]. This was based on a higher hazard of non-relapse mortality (NRM) (cause-specific HR: 1.25, P=0.013), but not relapse (cause-specific HR: 1.06, P=0.277) in the multivariable models. These findings were replicated in a confirmation cohort of 168 male patients allografted for AML in a different center (OS, HR: 1.15, P=0.012 and NRM, cause-specific HR: 1.23; P=0.008). Next, an optimized cut-off point for pre-transplant testosterone was derived from the training set and evaluated in the confirmation cohort. In multivariable models, low pre-transplant testosterone status (<250 ng/dL) was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio 1.95, P=0.021) and increased NRM (cause-specific HR 2.68, P=0.011) but not with relapse (cause-specific HR: 1.28, P=0.551).

Daratumumab (Darzalex) is a first-in-class anti-CD38 antibody approved for the treatment of relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM). It has also demonstrated clinical activity in Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia and amyloidosis. Here, we have evaluated the activity and mechanism of action of daratumumab in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), as monotherapy or in combination with standard chemo-immunotherapy. In vitro, daratumumab engages Fc-mediated cytotoxicity by antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis in all lymphoma subtypes. In the presence of human serum, complement-dependent cell cytotoxicity was marginally engaged. We demonstrated by Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy that daratumumab fully penetrated a three-dimensional (3D) lymphoma organoid and decreased organoid volume. In vivo, daratumumab completely prevents tumor outgrowth in models of MCL and FL, and shows comparable activity to rituximab in a disseminated in vivo model of blastic MCL. Moreover, daratumumab improves overall survival (OS) in a mouse model of transformed CD20(dim) FL, where rituximab showed limited activity. Daratumumab potentiates the antitumor activity of CHOP and R-CHOP in MCL and FL xenografts. Furthermore, in a patient-derived DLBCL xenograft model, daratumumab anti-tumor activity was comparable to R-CHOP and the addition of daratumumab to either CHOP or R-CHOP led to full tumor regression.

Myc expression can also be seen in aggressive lymphomas that are observed in the context of CLL, and we sought to develop a mouse model that could be used to study therapeutic strategies for aggressive lymphoma in the context of CLL. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We crossed the Emu-TCL1 mouse model with the Emu-Myc mouse model to investigate the clinical phenotype associated with B-cell-restricted expression of these oncogenes. The resulting malignancy was then extensively characterized, from both a clinical and biologic perspective. RESULTS: Emu-TCL1xMyc mice uniformly developed highly aggressive lymphoid disease with histologically, immunophenotypically, and molecularly distinct concurrent CLL and B-cell lymphoma, leading to a significantly reduced lifespan. Injection of cells from diseased Emu-TCL1xMyc into WT mice established a disease similar to that in the double-transgenic mice. Both Emu-TCL1xMyc mice and mice with disease after adoptive transfer failed to respond to ibrutinib. Effective and durable disease control was, however, observed by selective inhibition of nuclear export protein exportin-1 (XPO1) using a compound currently in clinical development for relapsed/refractory malignancies, including CLL and lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: The Emu-TCL1xMyc mouse is a new preclinical tool for testing experimental drugs for aggressive B-cell lymphoma, including in the context of CLL.","['Lucas, Fabienne', 'Rogers, Kerry A', 'Harrington, Bonnie K', 'Pan, Alexander', 'Yu, Lianbo', 'Breitbach, Justin', 'Bundschuh, Ralf', 'Goettl, Virginia M', 'Hing, Zachary A', 'Kanga, Parviz', 'Mantel, Rose', 'Sampath, Deepa', 'Smith, Lisa L', 'Wasmuth, Ronni', 'White, Danielle K', 'Yan, Pearlly', 'Byrd, John C', 'Lapalombella, Rosa', 'Woyach, Jennifer A']","['Lucas F', 'Rogers KA', 'Harrington BK', 'Pan A', 'Yu L', 'Breitbach J', 'Bundschuh R', 'Goettl VM', 'Hing ZA', 'Kanga P', 'Mantel R', 'Sampath D', 'Smith LL', 'Wasmuth R', 'White DK', 'Yan P', 'Byrd JC', 'Lapalombella R', 'Woyach JA']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-5557-5619', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6699-8614', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1965-4920']","['Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Center for Biostatistics, Department of Bioinformatics, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Veterinary Biosciences, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Department of Physics, Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Medical Scientist Training Program, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio.', 'Division of Hematology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. jennifer.woyach@osumc.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Cancer Res,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9502500,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Karyopherins)', '0 (Myc protein, mouse)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear)', '0 (Tcl1 protein, mouse)', '0 (exportin 1 protein)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Btk protein, mouse)']",IM,,"['Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/methods', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyopherins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/drug therapy/*genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*genetics/pathology', 'Proof of Concept Study', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'Receptors, Cytoplasmic and Nuclear/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/transplantation']",PMC6801062,,,2019/07/13 06:00,2020/09/22 06:00,['2019/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/01/22 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/23 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/22 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [entrez]']","['1078-0432.CCR-19-0273 [pii]', '10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0273 [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Cancer Res. 2019 Oct 15;25(20):6260-6273. doi: 10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-19-0273.

An international shortage of erwinia asparaginase has limited the therapeutic options for those experiencing pegaspargase hypersensitivity. Here, we report pegaspargase can be safely administered, while maintaining sustained levels of asparaginase activity, to patients who have had a prior hypersensitivity reaction to pegaspargase by using a standard rapid desensitization protocol. Ten patients with prior hypersensitivity reactions to pegaspargase were treated by using a standardized rapid desensitization protocol. Eight patients had therapeutic asparaginase levels between days 4 and 7 of >/=0.05 IU/mL, and seven patients continued to have sustained levels above >/=0.1 IU/mL between days 10 and 14.

Fifth Report].,1-208,10.19191/EP19.2-3.S1.032 [doi],"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: This volume provides an update of the health status of the populations living in the National Priority Contaminated Sites (NPCSs) included in the SENTIERI Project. This update is part of an epidemiological surveillance programme carried out in NPCSs, promoted by the Italian Ministry of Health as a further step of a project started in 2006, when the health status of residents in contaminated sites was first addressed within the National Strategic Program ""Environment and Health"". The Report focuses on five health outcomes: mortality, cancer incidence, hospital discharges, congenital anomalies, and children, adolescents and young adults' health. A key element of SENTIERI project is the a priori evaluation of the epidemiological evidence of a causal association between the considered cause of disease and the exposure. When an a priori evidence is identified, it is given a greater importance in the comment of the study findings. METHODS: The present update of the SENTIERI Project concerns 45 NPCSs including in all 319 Italian Municipalities (out of over 8,000 Municipalities), with an overall population of 5,900,000 inhabitants at the 2011 Italian Census. Standardized Mortality Ratios (SMRs) and Standardized Hospitalization Ratios (SHRs), referring to a time window of 2006-2013, were computed for all the 45 NPCSs, using as a reference the corresponding mortality and hospitalization rates of the Regions where each NCPS is located. Standardized Incidence Ratios (SIRs) were computed by the Italian Association of Cancer Registries (AIRTUM) for the 22 NPCSs served by a Cancer Registry. AIRTUM covers about 56% of Italy, with partly different time-windows. SIRs have been estimated using as reference population the 4 macroareas in which Italy is divided (North-West, North-East, Centre, South). Prevalence of congenital anomalies was computed for 15 NPCSs. RESULTS: An all-cause excess of 5,267 and 6,725 deaths was observed, respectively, in men and women; the cancer death excess was of 3,375 in men and 1,910 in women. It was estimated an excess of cancer incidence of 1,220 case in men and 1,425 in women over a five-year time window. With regard to the diseases with an a priori environmental aetiological validity, an excess for malignant mesothelioma, lung, colon, and gastric cancer, and for non-malignant respiratory diseases was observed. Cancer excess mainly affected NPCSs with presence of chemical and petrochemical plants, oil refineries, and dumping hazardous wastes. An excess of non-malignant respiratory disease was also detected in NPCSs in which steel industries and thermoelectric plants were present. An excess of mesothelioma was observed in NPCSs characterized by presence of asbestos and fluoro-edenite; it was also observed where the presence of asbestos was not reported in the legislative national decrees which define the NPCS areas. It is worth noting that, even if the presence of asbestos is not reported in many NPCSs legislative decrees, petrochemical plants and steel industries, for instance, are often characterized by the presence of a large amount of this mineral that, in the past, was extensively used as an insulating material. For the first time, the present Report includes a focus on the health status of children and adolescents (1,160,000 subjects, aged 0-19 years), and young adults (660,000 subjects, aged 20-29 years). Among infants (0-1 year), an excess of 7,000 hospitalizations was observed, 2,000 of which due to conditions of perinatal origin. In the age class 0-14, an excess of 22,000 hospitalizations for all causes was observed; 4,000 of them were due to acute respiratory diseases, and 2,000 to asthma. Data on cancer incidence for subjects aged 0-24 years were derived from general population cancer registries for twenty NPCSs, and from children cancer registries (age group: 0-19 years) for six NPCSs; 666 cases where diagnosed in the age group 0-24 years, corresponding to an excess of 9%. The main contributions to this excess are from soft tissue sarcomas in children (aged 0-14 years), acute myeloid leukaemia in children (aged 0-14 years) and in the age group 0-29 years, non-Hodgkin lymphoma and testicular cancer in young adults (aged 20-29 years). In seven out of 15 NPCSs, an excess prevalence rate of overall congenital anomalies at birth was observed. Congenital anomalies excesses included the following sites: genital organs, heart, limbs, nervous system, digestive system, and urinary system. CONCLUSIONS: The main findings of SENTIERI Project have been the detection of excesses for the diseases which showed an a priori epidemiological evidence of a causal association with the environmental exposures specific for each considered NPCS. These observations are valuable within public health, because they contribute to priority health promotion activities. Looking ahead, the health benefits of an improved environmental quality might be appreciated in terms of reduction of the occurrence of adverse health effects attributable to each Site major pollutant agents. Due to the methodological approach of the present study, it was not possible to adjust for several confounding factors reported to be risk factors for the studied diseases (e.g., smoking, alcohol consumption, obesity). Even if excesses of mortality, hospitalization, cancer incidence, and prevalence of congenital anomalies were found in several NPCSs, the study design and the multifactorial aetiology of the considered diseases do not permit, for all of them, to draw conclusions in terms of causal links with environmental contamination. Moreover, it must be taken into consideration that economic factors and the availability of health services may also play a relevant role in a diseases outcome. A few observations regarding some methodological limitations of SENTIERI Project should be made. There is not a uniform environmental characterisation of the studied NPCSs in term of quality and detection of the pollutants, because this information is present in different databases which at present are not adequately connected. Moreover, the recognition of a contaminated site as a National Priority Site is based on soil and groundwater pollution, and the available information on air quality is currently sparse and not homogenous. Another limitation, in term of statistical power, is the small population size of many NPCSs and the low frequency of several health outcomes. A special caution must be paid in data interpretation when considering the correspondence between the contaminated areas and the municipality boundaries, as they do not always coincide perfectly: in some cases, a small municipality with a large industrial site, while in other settings only a part of the municipality is exposed to the sources of pollution. Furthermore, all available health information systems are currently accessible at municipality level. The real breakthrough is essentially comprised of the development and fostering of a networking system involving all local health authorities and regional environmental protection agencies operating in the areas under study. The possibility to integrate the geographic approach of SENTIERI Project with a set of ad hoc analytic epidemiological investigations, such as residential cohort studies, case control studies, children health surveys, biomonitoring surveys, and with socioepidemiological studies, might greatly contribute to the identification of health priorities for environmental remediation activities. Finally, as discussed in the last section of the report, there is a need to adopt, in each NPCS, a two-way oriented communication plan involving public health authorities, scientific community, and resident population, taking into account that the history, the cultural frame and the network of relationships specific of each local context play a major role in the risk perception perspective.","['Zona, Amerigo', 'Iavarone, Ivano', 'Buzzoni, Carlotta', 'Conti, Susanna', 'Santoro, Michele', 'Fazzo, Lucia', 'Pasetto, Roberto', 'Pirastu, Roberta', 'Bruno, Caterina', 'Ancona, Carla', 'Bianchi, Fabrizio', 'Forastiere, Francesco', 'Manno, Valerio', 'Minelli, Giada', 'Minerba, Aldo', 'Minichilli, Fabrizio', 'Stoppa, Giorgia', 'Pierini, Anna', 'Ricci, Paolo', 'Scondotto, Salvatore', 'Bisceglia, Lucia', 'Cernigliaro, Achille', 'Ranzi, Andrea', 'Comba, Pietro']","['Zona A', 'Iavarone I', 'Buzzoni C', 'Conti S', 'Santoro M', 'Fazzo L', 'Pasetto R', 'Pirastu R', 'Bruno C', 'Ancona C', 'Bianchi F', 'Forastiere F', 'Manno V', 'Minelli G', 'Minerba A', 'Minichilli F', 'Stoppa G', 'Pierini A', 'Ricci P', 'Scondotto S', 'Bisceglia L', 'Cernigliaro A', 'Ranzi A', 'Comba P']",,"['Dipartimento Ambiente e Salute, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma; amerigo.zona@iss.it.', 'Dipartimento Ambiente e Salute, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma.', 'Registro Tumori Toscano, Istituto per lo Studio, la Prevenzione e la Rete Oncologica (ISPRO), Firenze.', 'Servizio Tecnico Scientifico di Statistica, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma.', 'Unita di Epidemiologia Ambientale e Registri di Patologia, Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pisa.', 'Dipartimento Ambiente e Salute, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma.', 'Dipartimento Ambiente e Salute, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma.', 'Dipartimento di Biologia e Biotecnologie Charles Darwin, Sapienza Universita di Roma.', 'Dipartimento Ambiente e Salute, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma.', 'Dipartimento di Epidemiologia del Servizio Sanitario Regionale, Regione Lazio, Roma.', 'Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pisa.', 'Dipartimento di Epidemiologia del Servizio Sanitario Regionale, Regione Lazio, Roma.', 'Servizio Tecnico Scientifico di Statistica, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma.', 'Servizio Tecnico Scientifico di Statistica, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma.', 'Struttura Complessa Statistica ed Epidemiologia, ASL Taranto.', 'Unita di Epidemiologia Ambientale e Registri di Patologia, Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pisa.', 'Registro Tumori Toscano, Istituto per lo Studio, la Prevenzione e la Rete Oncologica (ISPRO), Firenze.', 'Unita di Epidemiologia Ambientale e Registri di Patologia, Istituto di Fisiologia Clinica, Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Pisa.', 'UOC Osservatorio Epidemiologico, ATS Val Padana, Mantova.', 'Dipartimento Attivita sanitarie e Osservatorio epidemiologico, Assessorato Salute Regione Siciliana, Palermo.', 'Agenzia Regionale Strategica per la Salute e il Sociale, Regione Puglia, Bari.', 'Dipartimento Attivita sanitarie e Osservatorio epidemiologico, Assessorato Salute Regione Siciliana, Palermo.', 'Direzione Tecnica, Centro Tematico Regionale Ambiente Salute, ARPAE Emilia-Romagna, Modena.', 'Dipartimento Ambiente e Salute, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Roma.']",['ita'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Epidemiol Prev,Epidemiologia e prevenzione,8902507,"['0 (Endocrine Disruptors)', '0 (Industrial Waste)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Congenital Abnormalities/epidemiology/etiology', 'Endocrine Disruptors/toxicity', 'Environmental Exposure/adverse effects', 'Environmental Pollution/*adverse effects', 'Environmental Restoration and Remediation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Industrial Waste/adverse effects', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Italy/epidemiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Young Adult']",,,,2019/07/13 06:00,2020/01/14 06:00,['2019/07/13 06:00'],"['2019/07/13 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/13 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/14 06:00 [medline]']","['10.19191/EP19.2-3.S1.032 [doi]', '4433 [pii]']",ppublish,Epidemiol Prev. 2019 Mar-Jun;43(2-3 Suppl 1):1-208. doi: 10.19191/EP19.2-3.S1.032.,,,,,,,,,SENTIERI: Studio epidemiologico nazionale dei territori e degli insediamenti esposti a rischio da inquinamento.

We selected 273 patients chosen from a single internal medicine department. To determine clinical utility and adverse consequences, we interviewed attending physicians and reviewed patients' charts. There were 12 (4.4%) patients hospitalised because of the CBC test result, six referred appropriately with a low haemoglobin concentration found in outpatient clinics and six (2.2%) patients (95% confidence interval 0.8-4.7%) inappropriately hospitalised because of incidental findings. In the hospital, according to the physicians, nearly all treatment changes made were for blood transfusions that were not indicated in 18 (6.6%) patients (95% confidence interval 4.0-10.2%). The only unexpected findings were in four patients with an indication for a blood transfusion admitted with an acute coronary syndrome and haemoglobin values 8-9.9 g/dL, and in one bedridden patient with dementia with acute myeloid leukaemia. There were 290 follow-up CBC tests not resulting in differential treatment. We conclude that admission CBC tests commonly lead to adverse consequences, due to physician errors in judgement. Incidental findings of anaemia justify CBC testing in patients with an acute coronary event. The rare patient with an incidental finding resulting in appropriate differential treatment might justify non-selective admission CBC counts, if physician education reduces the rate of inappropriate blood transfusions.","['Shimoni, Zvi', 'Amit, Leeor', 'Rosenberg, Michal', 'Froom, Paul']","['Shimoni Z', 'Amit L', 'Rosenberg M', 'Froom P']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5126-8590'],"['Department of Internal Medicine B, Sanz Medical Center, Laniado Hospital, Netanya, Israel.', 'Ruth and Bruce Rappaport School of Medicine, Haifa, Israel.', 'Ruth and Bruce Rappaport School of Medicine, Haifa, Israel.', 'Ruth and Bruce Rappaport School of Medicine, Haifa, Israel.', 'Department of Clinical Utility, Sanz Medical Center, Laniado Hospital, Netanya, Israel.', 'School of Public Health, University of Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv-Yafo, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Intern Med J,Internal medicine journal,101092952,['0 (Hemoglobins)'],IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia/blood/diagnosis/therapy', 'Blood Cell Count/standards/trends', 'Blood Transfusion/trends', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hemoglobins/*analysis', 'Hospitalization/*trends', 'Humans', 'Internal Medicine/standards/*trends', 'Male', 'Medical Overuse/*trends', 'Middle Aged']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*clinical utility', '*complete blood count', '*hospitalised patients', '*internal medicine', '*physician errors']",2019/07/12 06:00,2020/02/15 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/06/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/04 00:00 [revised]', '2019/04/28 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/15 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1111/imj.14353 [doi]'],ppublish,Intern Med J. 2019 Jul;49(7):915-918. doi: 10.1111/imj.14353.,['(c) 2019 Royal Australasian College of Physicians.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the precise cause of sudden sensorineural hearing loss has not been identified, several pathophysiological mechanisms have been proposed. However, a variety of hematologic diseases are among the causes of sudden onset deafness. This article represents the first reported case of Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) which presented with acute unilateral profound sensorineural hearing loss as an inital mainfestation. PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 41-year-old man presented with unilateral sudden hearing loss for one day's duration was found to have HCL during a worked up for his hearing loss. The disease worsened, and there was no improvement in his hearing. DISCUSSION: Sudden sensorineural hearing loss can rarely be seen as a paraneoplastic occurrence.Very few cases have been reported in the literature. It has been reported as a presenting symptom of leukemia in numerous clinical and histopathological reports concerning the hearing loss in hematologic diseases. Our case is an example of such a rare incidence. CONCLUSION: The purpose of this study is to draw physicians' attention to the possible association between acute sensorineural hearing loss to HCL, and to highlights permanent deafness as a complication secondary to HCL. Furthermore, it is important to increase awareness on early diagnosis and treatment that may improve treatment outcomes.","['AlEnazi, Abdulaziz', 'Alhedaithy, Riyadh', 'Alfayez, Abdulrhman', 'Alghonaim, Yazeed']","['AlEnazi A', 'Alhedaithy R', 'Alfayez A', 'Alghonaim Y']",,"['Department of Otorhinolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery , Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University, King Fahd Hospital of the University (KFHU), Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia.

To clarify the molecular mechanisms of suppression of NDRG2 expression, we initially determined the expression pattern of NDRG2 in various types of T-cells and ATLL cells. NDRG2 expression was significantly upregulated in HTLV-1/Tax-immortalized T-cells, which was mediated by NF-kappaB activation through Tax expression. On the other hand, NDRG2 expression was suppressed in HTLV-1-infected cell lines and various types of ATLL cells, which was dependent on the DNA methylation of the NDRG2 promoter. We found that the expression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), a member of the polycomb family, is increased in ATLL, and that EZH2 directly binds to the NDRG2 promoter and induces DNA methylation of the NDRG2 promoter. Since the expression of EZH2 were anti-parallelly regulated with the NDRG2 expression, EZH2 might be one of the most important regulators of the downregulation of NDRG2, contributing to enhanced activation of signaling pathways during ATLL development.","['Ichikawa, Tomonaga', 'Nakahata, Shingo', 'Fujii, Masahiro', 'Iha, Hidekatsu', 'Shimoda, Kazuya', 'Morishita, Kazuhiro']","['Ichikawa T', 'Nakahata S', 'Fujii M', 'Iha H', 'Shimoda K', 'Morishita K']",,"['Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Virology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata University, Niigata 951-8510, Japan.', 'Department of Microbiology, Faculty of Medicine, Oita University, Yufu, Oita 879-5593, Japan.', 'Division of Gastroenterology and Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.', 'Division of Tumor and Cellular Biochemistry, Department of Medical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Miyazaki, 5200 Kihara, Kiyotake, Miyazaki 889-1692, Japan.

Here we define roles for the transcription factor Oct1/Pou2f1 in AML and normal hematopoiesis. Inappropriate reactivation of the CDX2 gene is widely observed in leukemia patients and in leukemia mouse models. We show that Oct1 associates with the CDX2 promoter in both normal and AML primary patient samples, but recruits the histone demethylase Jmjd1a/Kdm3a to remove the repressive H3K9me2 mark only in malignant specimens. The CpG DNA immediately adjacent to the Oct1 binding site within the CDX2 promoter exhibits variable DNA methylation in healthy control blood and bone marrow samples, but complete demethylation in AML samples. In MLL-AF9-driven mouse models, partial loss of Oct1 protects from myeloid leukemia. Complete Oct1 loss completely suppresses leukemia but results in lethality from bone marrow failure. Loss of Oct1 in normal hematopoietic transplants results in superficially normal long-term reconstitution; however, animals become acutely sensitive to 5-fluorouracil, indicating that Oct1 is dispensable for normal hematopoiesis but protects blood progenitor cells against external chemotoxic stress. These findings elucidate a novel and important role for Oct1 in AML.","['Jafek, Jillian L', 'Shakya, Arvind', 'Tai, Pei-Yi', 'Ibarra, Andrea', 'Kim, Heejoo', 'Maddox, Jessica', 'Chumley, Jeffrey', 'Spangrude, Gerald J', 'Miles, Rodney R', 'Kelley, Todd W', 'Tantin, Dean']","['Jafek JL', 'Shakya A', 'Tai PY', 'Ibarra A', 'Kim H', 'Maddox J', 'Chumley J', 'Spangrude GJ', 'Miles RR', 'Kelley TW', 'Tantin D']",,"['Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Division of Hematology & Hematologic Malignancies, Department of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.', 'Department of Pathology, University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, UT.

This proposed cancer-screening package included a DNA sensor and an aptasensor as two main types of biosensors. The biosensors were used simultaneously. This combination of sensors can detect not only the presence of mutant genes but also the biomarkers of cancer. At current work, the combination of sensors were used to detect the presence of BCR-ABL1 as a mutant gene and CEA as a biomarkers of cancer, such a capability makes the package liable for early and certain detection of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. To construct both the DNA sensor and the aptasensor, a nanocomposite consisting of electrosynthesis carbon quantum dots and biosynthesized gold nanoparticles was applied. The construction of these biosensors was characterized using four different electrochemical methods including DPV (Differential Pulse Voltammetry), EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy), CV (Cyclic Voltammetry) and chronoamperometry. The peak current of a catechol solution that was used as an electroactive probe on the biosensor was linearly related to the logarithm of the concentrations of the target DNA and the target antigen in the range of 10 pM to 100muM and 1pgmL(-1) to 0.001gmL(-1) with the detection limits of 1.5 pM and 0.26pgmL(-1) respectively, which are quite good results.","['Mazloum-Ardakani, Mohammad', 'Barazesh, Behnaz', 'Moshtaghiun, Seyed Mohammad']","['Mazloum-Ardakani M', 'Barazesh B', 'Moshtaghiun SM']",,"['Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Science, Yazd University, Yazd, Iran.

Subsequently, extensive studies revealed multiple functions of H2 by exhibiting the efficacies of H2 in various animal models and clinical studies. Here, we investigated the effect of H2 on free-radical-induced cytotoxicity using tert-butyl hydroperoxide in a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. Cell membrane permeability was determined using lactate dehydrogenase release assay and Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide staining. Fatty acid peroxidation and mitochondrial viability were measured using 2 kinds of fluorescent dyes, Liperfluo and C11-BODIPY, and using the alamarBlue assay based on the reduction of resazurin to resorufin by mainly mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase, respectively. Mitochondrial membrane potential was evaluated using tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester. As a result, H2 protected the cultured cells against the cytotoxic effects induced by tert-butyl hydroperoxide; H2 suppressed cellular fatty acid peroxidation and cell membrane permeability, mitigated the decline in mitochondrial oxidoreductase activity and mitochondrial membrane potential, and protected cells against cell death evaluated using propidium iodide staining. These results suggested that H2 suppresses free-radical-induced cell death through protection against fatty acid peroxidation and mitochondrial dysfunction.","['Iuchi, Katsuya', 'Nishimaki, Kiyomi', 'Kamimura, Naomi', 'Ohta, Shigeo']","['Iuchi K', 'Nishimaki K', 'Kamimura N', 'Ohta S']",,"['Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School, 1-396 Kosugi-machi, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki-city, Kanagawa 211-8533, Japan.', 'Department of Materials and Life Science, Faculty of Science and Technology, Seikei University, 3-3-1 Kichijojikitamachi, Musashino-shi, Tokyo, 180-8633, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School, 1-396 Kosugi-machi, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki-city, Kanagawa 211-8533, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School, 1-396 Kosugi-machi, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki-city, Kanagawa 211-8533, Japan.', 'Department of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Graduate School of Medicine, Nippon Medical School, 1-396 Kosugi-machi, Nakahara-ku, Kawasaki-city, Kanagawa 211-8533, Japan.', 'Department of Neurology Medicine, Juntendo University Graduate School of Medicine, 2-1-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8421, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Canada,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,0372712,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '7YNJ3PO35Z (Hydrogen)', '955VYL842B (tert-Butylhydroperoxide)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Atherosclerosis/drug therapy', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Lipid Peroxidation/drug effects', 'Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial/drug effects', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Oxidation-Reduction/drug effects', 'Oxidative Stress/drug effects', 'tert-Butylhydroperoxide/*toxicity']",,['NOTNLM'],"['THP-1 cells', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'cell death', 'cellules THP-1', 'dysfonctionnement des mitochondries', 'fatty acid peroxidation', 'hydrogene moleculaire', 'maladies cardiovasculaires', 'mitochondrial dysfunction', 'molecular hydrogen', 'mort cellulaire', 'oxidative stress', 'peroxydation des acides gras', 'stress oxydatif', 'tert-butyl hydroperoxide', 'tert-butyl hydroperoxyde']",2019/07/12 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1139/cjpp-2018-0741 [doi]'],ppublish,Can J Physiol Pharmacol. 2019 Oct;97(10):999-1005. doi: 10.1139/cjpp-2018-0741.

Long-term data are not available for patients receiving 9-14.4Gy as part of Total Body Irradiation in childhood. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. DATA COLLECTION: notes review, laboratory results, prescription of testosterone. PATIENTS: Forty-two of 96 boys who received Total Body Irradiation (9-14.4Gy) and Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for childhood leukaemia at Great Ormond Street Hospital between 1981-2011 and survived >5 years. MEASUREMENTS: The serum concentrations of testosterone and gonadotrophins and the prescription of testosterone were recorded. RESULTS: Of the 42 boys included, 37 (88%) entered puberty spontaneously and 5 required induction. Median length of follow-up was 19.4 years (range 5-33.1). At last follow-up, 23 of the 37 (62%) with spontaneous puberty were receiving testosterone replacement and 4 of the 5 (80%) with induced puberty. CONCLUSION: This study with the benefit of long follow-up indicates that Leydig cell failure occurs with radiation doses <20Gy.

METHODS: Cross-sectional study of children diagnosed with JIA or ALL, treated with low-dose MTX, aged 9 years or above, and cognitively intact. The patient's parents completed the MISS. MTX intolerance was defined as a total MISS score above 6. RESULTS: We enrolled 120 children with JIA and 23 children with ALL. The MISS had a good internal consistency in the JIA group. The median MISS score was higher in the JIA group than in the ALL group (JIA: 8; ALL: 1; p<0.0001); and the JIA group had a larger proportion of MTX intolerant children than the ALL group (JIA: 73/120; ALL: 4/23; p<0.001). Within both the JIA group and the ALL group, the MISS total score was not significantly correlated with age, MTX dose or the duration of low-dose MTX treatment. CONCLUSION: In the JIA group the level of MTX intolerance was higher and more attributed to anticipatory, associative and behavioural symptoms than in the ALL group. The MISS may help to uncover whether MTX intolerance is present and which aspects are affected in the individual patient, thus guiding intervention. The MISS may also be applicable within leukaemia care.","['Kyvsgaard, Nini', 'Mikkelsen, Torben Stamm', 'Thastum, Mikael', 'Christensen, Anne Estmann', 'Wehner, Peder Skov', 'Nysom, Karsten', 'Herlin, Troels']","['Kyvsgaard N', 'Mikkelsen TS', 'Thastum M', 'Christensen AE', 'Wehner PS', 'Nysom K', 'Herlin T']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9490-1333'],"['Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Department of Clinical Medicine, Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark.', 'Department of Psychology and Behavioural Sciences, Aarhus BSS, Aarhus University, Aarhus, Denmark.', ""Department of Paediatric Rheumatology, H.C.

Both significantly improve survival in CLL and replace chemoimmunotherapy for many patients. However, individually, they rarely lead to eradication of measurable residual disease (MRD) and usually are taken indefinitely or until progression. We present the CLARITY trial that combined ibrutinib with venetoclax to eradicate detectable CLL with the intention of stopping therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: CLARITY is a phase II trial that combined ibrutinib with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. The primary end point was eradication of MRD after 12 months of combined therapy. Key secondary end points were response by International Workshop on CLL criteria, safety, and progression-free and overall survival. RESULTS: In 53 patients after 12 months of ibrutinib plus venetoclax, MRD negativity (fewer than one CLL cell in 10,000 leukocytes) was achieved in the blood of 28 (53%) and the marrow of 19 (36%). Forty-seven patients (89%) responded, and 27 (51%) achieved a complete remission. After a median follow-up of 21.1 months, one patient progressed, and all patients were alive. A single case of biochemical tumor lysis syndrome was observed. Other adverse effects were mild and/or manageable and most commonly were neutropenia or GI events. CONCLUSION: The combination of ibrutinib plus venetoclax was well tolerated in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. There was a high rate of MRD eradication that led to the cessation of therapy in some patients. The progression-free and overall survival rates are encouraging for relapsed and refractory CLL.","['Hillmen, Peter', 'Rawstron, Andy C', 'Brock, Kristian', 'Munoz-Vicente, Samuel', 'Yates, Francesca J', 'Bishop, Rebecca', 'Boucher, Rebecca', 'MacDonald, Donald', 'Fegan, Christopher', 'McCaig, Alison', 'Schuh, Anna', 'Pettitt, Andrew', 'Gribben, John G', 'Patten, Piers E M', 'Devereux, Stephen', 'Bloor, Adrian', 'Fox, Christopher P', 'Forconi, Francesco', 'Munir, Talha']","['Hillmen P', 'Rawstron AC', 'Brock K', 'Munoz-Vicente S', 'Yates FJ', 'Bishop R', 'Boucher R', 'MacDonald D', 'Fegan C', 'McCaig A', 'Schuh A', 'Pettitt A', 'Gribben JG', 'Patten PEM', 'Devereux S', 'Bloor A', 'Fox CP', 'Forconi F', 'Munir T']",,"[""Leeds Institute of Medical Research at St James's, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom."", ""St James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds, United Kingdom."", ""St James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds, United Kingdom."", 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Research UK Clinical Trials Unit, Birmingham, United Kingdom.', 'Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Vale University Health Board, Cardiff, United Kingdom.', 'Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre, Glasgow, United Kingdom.', 'Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom.', 'Barts Health NHS Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', ""King's College London, School of Cancer & Pharmaceutical Sciences, London, United Kingdom."", 'Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom.', 'Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Nottingham, United Kingdom.', 'University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust, Southampton, United Kingdom.', 'Cancer Sciences Unit, Cancer Research UK and NIHR Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres, University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom.', ""St James's Institute of Oncology, Leeds, United Kingdom.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase II', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,"['0 (Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic)', '0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'N54AIC43PW (venetoclax)']",IM,,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Bridged Bicyclo Compounds, Heterocyclic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Recurrence', 'Sulfonamides/pharmacology/*therapeutic use']",PMC6879312,,,2019/07/12 06:00,2020/06/11 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/11 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.19.00894 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 2019 Oct 20;37(30):2722-2729. doi: 10.1200/JCO.19.00894.

Inhibitors targeting MCL1 are in clinical development, however numerous cancer models are intrinsically resistant to this approach. To discover mechanisms underlying resistance to MCL1 inhibition, we performed multiple flow-cytometry based genome-wide CRISPR screens interrogating two drugs that directly (MCL1i) or indirectly (CDK9i) target MCL1. Remarkably, both screens identified three components (CUL5, RNF7 and UBE2F) of a cullin-RING ubiquitin ligase complex (CRL5) that resensitized cells to MCL1 inhibition. We find that levels of the BH3-only pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Noxa are proteasomally regulated by the CRL5 complex. Accumulation of Noxa caused by depletion of CRL5 components was responsible for re-sensitization to CDK9 inhibitor, but not MCL1 inhibitor. Discovery of a novel role of CRL5 in apoptosis and resistance to multiple types of anticancer agents suggests the potential to improve combination treatments.","['Kabir, Shaheen', 'Cidado, Justin', 'Andersen, Courtney', 'Dick, Cortni', 'Lin, Pei-Chun', 'Mitros, Therese', 'Ma, Hong', 'Baik, Seung Hyun', 'Belmonte, Matthew A', 'Drew, Lisa', 'Corn, Jacob E']","['Kabir S', 'Cidado J', 'Andersen C', 'Dick C', 'Lin PC', 'Mitros T', 'Ma H', 'Baik SH', 'Belmonte MA', 'Drew L', 'Corn JE']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9035-1124', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-2064-2273', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7798-5309']","['Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', 'Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, United States.', 'Bioscience Oncology, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Waltham, United States.', 'Bioscience Oncology, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Waltham, United States.', 'Bioscience Oncology, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Waltham, United States.', 'Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', 'Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', 'Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', 'Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', 'Bioscience Oncology, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Waltham, United States.', 'Bioscience Oncology, IMED Biotech Unit, AstraZeneca, Waltham, United States.', 'Innovative Genomics Institute, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.', 'Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, United States.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Elife,eLife,101579614,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (BCL2 protein, human)', '0 (Bcl-2-Like Protein 11)', '0 (CUL5 protein, human)', '0 (Cullin Proteins)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (PMAIP1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2)', 'EC 2.3.2.23 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (RNF7 protein, human)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (CDK9 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.22 (Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects', 'Bcl-2-Like Protein 11/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cullin Proteins/*genetics', 'Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lung Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/antagonists & inhibitors/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2/genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligase Complexes/genetics', 'Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases/genetics']",PMC6701926,['NOTNLM'],"['*CDK9 inhibitor', '*CUL5-RNF7-UBE2F ubiquitin ligase complex', '*MCL1 inhibitor', '*bim', '*cancer biology', '*cell biology', '*genome-wide CRISPRi screens', '*human', '*noxa']",2019/07/12 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/12/15 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.7554/eLife.44288 [doi]', '44288 [pii]']",epublish,Elife. 2019 Jul 11;8. pii: 44288. doi: 10.7554/eLife.44288.,"['(c) 2019, Kabir et al.']",20190711,,['DISC1-08776/California Institute for Regenerative Medicine/International'],"['SK, PL, TM, HM, SB, JC No competing interests declared, JC, CA, CD, MB, LD', 'employed by AstraZeneca, from whom funded research support was received.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We reported on a phenotype associated with very poor prognosis (RAM) in children enrolled in the Children's Oncology Group trial AAML0531 (Brodersen et al. Leukemia 30 (2016) 2077-2080). RAM is also characterized in part by high-intensity expression of the CD56 antigen. Herein, we investigate underlying biological and clinical differences among CD56-positive AMLs for patients in AAML0531. METHODS: For 769 newly diagnosed pediatric patients with de novo AML enrolled in AAML0531, bone marrow specimens were submitted for flow cytometric analysis. For each patient, an immunophenotypic expression profile (IEP) was defined by mean fluorescent intensities of assayed surface antigens. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) was completed to group patients with similar immunophenotypes. Clusters were then evaluated for CD56 expression. Principal component analysis (PCA) was subsequently applied to determine whether CD56-positive patient groups were nonoverlapping. RESULTS: HCA of IEPs revealed three unique phenotypic clusters of patients with CD56-positive AML, and PCA showed that these three cohorts are distinct. Cohort 1 (N = 77) showed a prevalence of t(8;21) patients (72%), Cohort 2 (N = 52) a prevalence of 11q23 patients (69%), and Cohort 3 (RAM) (N = 16) a prevalence of patients with co-occurrence of the CBFA2T3-GLIS2 fusion transcript (63%). The 5-year event-free survival (EFS) for Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 were 69, 39, and 19%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: When leukemia is considered by its multidimensional immunophenotype and not by the expression of a single antigen, correlations are seen between genotype and there are significant differences in patient outcomes.

On the other hand, drug-induced kidney proximal tubular injury, electrolytes disturbances, and renal failure is a clinical complication associated with imatinib therapy. There is no precise cellular mechanism(s) for imatinib-induced renal injury. The current investigation aimed to evaluate the role of mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of imatinib nephrotoxicity. Rats received imatinib (50 and 100 mg/kg, oral, 14 consecutive days). Serum and urine biomarkers of renal injury and markers of oxidative stress in the kidney tissue were assessed. Moreover, kidney mitochondria were isolated, and mitochondrial indices, including mitochondrial depolarization, dehydrogenases activity, mitochondrial permeabilization, lipid peroxidation (LPO), mitochondrial glutathione levels, and ATP content were determined. A significant increase in serum (Creatinine; Cr and blood urea nitrogen; BUN) and urine (Glucose, protein, gamma-glutamyl transferase; gamma-GT, and alkaline phosphatase; ALP) biomarkers of renal injury, as well as serum electrolytes disturbances (hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia), were evident in imatinib-treated animals. On the other hand, imatinib (100 mg/kg) caused an increase in kidney ROS and LPO. Renal tubular interstitial nephritis, tissue necrosis, and atrophy were evident as tissue histopathological changes in imatinib-treated rats. Mitochondrial parameters were also adversely affected by imatinib administration. These data represent mitochondrial impairment, renal tissue energy crisis, and oxidative stress as possible mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of imatinib-induced renal injury and serum electrolytes disturbances.","['Emadi, Ehsan', 'Abdoli, Narges', 'Ghanbarinejad, Vahid', 'Mohammadi, Hamid Reza', 'Mousavi Mobarakeh, Khadijeh', 'Azarpira, Negar', 'Mahboubi, Zahra', 'Niknahad, Hossein', 'Heidari, Reza']","['Emadi E', 'Abdoli N', 'Ghanbarinejad V', 'Mohammadi HR', 'Mousavi Mobarakeh K', 'Azarpira N', 'Mahboubi Z', 'Niknahad H', 'Heidari R']",,"['Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Iran Food and Drug Administration (IFDA), Ministry of Health, Tehran, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Transplant Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmacy, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Heliyon,Heliyon,101672560,,,,,PMC6595238,['NOTNLM'],"['ATP', 'Electrolyte imbalance', 'Energy crisis', 'Fanconi syndrome', 'Mitochondria', 'Oxidative stress', 'Pharmaceutical science', 'Pharmacology', 'Renal injury', 'Renal system', 'Toxicology']",2019/07/12 06:00,2019/07/12 06:01,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/04/24 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/10 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/19 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:01 [medline]']","['10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01996 [doi]', 'S2405-8440(19)35628-2 [pii]', 'e01996 [pii]']",epublish,Heliyon. 2019 Jun 22;5(6):e01996. doi: 10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01996. eCollection 2019 Jun.,,20190622,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, these catheters are responsible for severe complications. Methods: In this context, we aimed to analyze all patients receiving a CVAD in the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology of the University hospital of Mainz over a period of 9 years, focused on CVAD related complications. Data on demographics, as well as intraoperative and postoperative complications were extracted. Results: A total of 296 patients with a mean age 93.2 +/- 62.4 months were analyzed. The majority suffered from leukemia (n = 91, 30.7%), lymphomas (n = 50, 16.9%), and brain tumors (n = 48, 16.2%). In 63 (21.3) patients, complications were observed. No death caused by complications of CVADs was found in our series. Catheter-related blood stream infections (BSI) (7.4%) were most prevalent, followed by dislodgements (5.4%), occlusions (2.7%), thrombosis (2.4%), and catheter leakage (2.4%). Insertion site infections were observed in three patients (1.0%). Fifty-nine percent of all patients with catheter-related BSI suffered from Leukemia. In patients with Catheter-related BSIs we detected the condition leukemia as the underlying disease as a risk factor compared to solid tumors as the underlying disease. Overall, totally implanted devices (ports) have a lower complication rate than tunneled catheter. Conclusion: Implantation of CVADs seems to be safe and reliable in this large pediatric patient cohort. Even if complications occur in the long-term management of CVADs, they can be treated successfully and long-term catheter survival rates are excellent.","['Beck, Olaf', 'Muensterer, Oliver', 'Hofmann, Sarah', 'Rossmann, Heidi', 'Poplawski, Alicia', 'Faber, Jorg', 'Godeke, Jan']","['Beck O', 'Muensterer O', 'Hofmann S', 'Rossmann H', 'Poplawski A', 'Faber J', 'Godeke J']",,"[""Children's Hospital, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Hemostaseology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany."", ""Children's Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany."", ""Children's Hospital, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Hemostaseology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany."", 'Institute of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', 'Institute of Medical Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.', ""Children's Hospital, Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Hemostaseology, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany."", ""Children's Hospital, Pediatric Surgery, University Medical Center of the Johannes Gutenberg University Mainz, Mainz, Germany.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Pediatr,Frontiers in pediatrics,101615492,,,,,PMC6603206,['NOTNLM'],"['cancer', 'catheter-related complications', 'catheter-related infections', 'children', 'support care', 'vascular access devices']",2019/07/12 06:00,2019/07/12 06:01,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/09/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fped.2019.00260 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pediatr. 2019 Jun 25;7:260. doi: 10.3389/fped.2019.00260. eCollection 2019.,,20190625,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent research demonstrated that several BCR/ABL1-independent mechanisms can sustain resistance, but the relationship between these mechanisms and the outcome has not yet been fully understood. This study was designed to evaluate in a ""real-life"" setting if a change of expression of several genes involved in the WNT/BETA-CATENIN, JAK-STAT, and POLYCOMB pathways might condition the outcome of CML patients receiving TKIs. Thus, the expression of 255 genes, related to the aforementioned pathways, was measured by quantitative PCR after 6 months of therapy and compared with levels observed at diagnosis in 11 CML patients, in order to find possible correlations with quality of response to treatment and event-free-survival (EFS). These results were then re-analyzed by the principal component method (PCA) for tempting to better cluster resistant cases. After 12 months of therapy, 6 patients achieved an optimal response and 5 were ""resistant;"" after application of both statistical methods, it was evident that in all pathways a significant overall up-regulation occurred, and that WNT was the pathway mostly responsible for the TKIs resistance. Indeed, 100% of patients with a ""low"" up-regulation of this pathway achieved an optimal response vs. 33% of those who showed a ""high"" gene over-expression (p = 0.016). Analogously, the 24-months EFS resulted significantly influenced by the degree of up-regulation of the WNT signaling: all patients with a ""low"" up-regulation were event-free vs. 33% of those who presented a ""high"" gene expression (p = 0.05). In particular, the PCA analysis confirmed the role of WNT pathway and showed that the most significantly up-regulated genes with negative prognostic value were DKK, WNT6, WISP1, and FZD8. In conclusion, our results sustain the need of a wide and multitasking approach in order to understand the resistance mechanisms in CML.","['Grassi, Susanna', 'Palumbo, Sara', 'Mariotti, Veronica', 'Liberati, Diego', 'Guerrini, Francesca', 'Ciabatti, Elena', 'Salehzadeh, Serena', 'Barate, Claudia', 'Balducci, Serena', 'Ricci, Federica', 'Buda, Gabriele', 'Iovino, Lorenzo', 'Mazziotta, Francesco', 'Ghio, Francesco', 'Ercolano, Giacomo', 'Di Paolo, Antonello', 'Cecchettini, Antonella', 'Baldini, Chiara', 'Mattii, Letizia', 'Pellegrini, Silvia', 'Petrini, Mario', 'Galimberti, Sara']","['Grassi S', 'Palumbo S', 'Mariotti V', 'Liberati D', 'Guerrini F', 'Ciabatti E', 'Salehzadeh S', 'Barate C', 'Balducci S', 'Ricci F', 'Buda G', 'Iovino L', 'Mazziotta F', 'Ghio F', 'Ercolano G', 'Di Paolo A', 'Cecchettini A', 'Baldini C', 'Mattii L', 'Pellegrini S', 'Petrini M', 'Galimberti S']",,"['Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Department of Surgical, Medical and Molecular Pathology and Critical Care, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'National Research Council of Italy, Milan, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Medical Biotechnologies, University of Siena, Siena, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Pharmacology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Rheumatology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.', 'Hematology Division, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Front Oncol,Frontiers in oncology,101568867,,,,,PMC6601352,['NOTNLM'],"['BCR/ABL1-independent resistance', 'CML', 'JAK/STAT', 'PCA', 'PcGs', 'WNT/beta-catenin']",2019/07/12 06:00,2019/07/12 06:01,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/01/25 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/31 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fonc.2019.00532 [doi]'],epublish,Front Oncol. 2019 Jun 24;9:532. doi: 10.3389/fonc.2019.00532. eCollection 2019.,,20190624,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, recent advances highlight swine as an ideal large animal model to demonstrate the safety of murine proof of concept studies prior to their implementation clinically. The availability of the MHC defined MGH miniature swine herd has been key for the development of novel approaches for hematopoietic cell and solid organ transplantation. New spontaneously arising hematological malignancies in these swine, specifically myeloid leukemias and B cell lymphomas, resemble human malignancies, which has allowed for development of immortalized tumor cell lines and has implications for the development of a large animal transplantable tumor model. The novel development of a SCID swine model has further advanced the field of large animal cancer models, allowing for engraftment of human tumor cells in a large animal model. Here, we will highlight the advantages of the swine pre-clinical model for the study of hematological malignancies.

Venetoclax (ABT-199/GDC-0199) is a highly selective bioavailable inhibitor of BCL-2 protein, which is more effective and less valid against BCL-xL in BCL2-dependent leukemia and lymphoma cell. Method: We searched PubMed database using retrieval keyword venetoclax, ABT-199, or GDC-0199 and investigated the data of the involved articles. Considering variability in different studies, the overall response rate was collected to assess the efficacy. Meanwhile, adverse events (AEs) were summarized, and event rates were calculated to assess the safety. Results: When patients were treated with venetoclax monotherapy, the most common AEs were nausea, diarrhea, neutropenia, fatigue and thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. In addition, thrombocytopenia, anemia, febrile neutropenia, and leukopenia appeared more common and are considered as the severe AEs (defined as grade >/= 3 AEs). Although the occurrence of thrombocytopenia was relatively high, it was not the most severe type. When compared with patients treated with venetoclax and other drugs, nausea, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia were still the most common AEs occurrence in the patients of all the grade. The overall event rate was 73%, which is quite satisfactory. Conclusion: Venetoclax is a mild and efficient drug in treating advanced hematological malignancy, which can be specially fit for the chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with del[17p], and AEs are well tolerable. Few tumor lysis syndrome occurred after taking the drugs. The AEs aroused by venetoclax, and the combination is well tolerable. Therefore, the use of venetoclax monotherapy or its combination with other therapies is desirable in hematological malignancy.","['Li, Qingfang', 'Cheng, Li', 'Shen, Kai', 'Jin, Hongyu', 'Li, Hui', 'Cheng, Yuan', 'Ma, Xuelei']","['Li Q', 'Cheng L', 'Shen K', 'Jin H', 'Li H', 'Cheng Y', 'Ma X']",,"['Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Oral Diseases & National Clinical Research Center for Oral Diseases & Department of Preventive Dentistry, West China Hospital of Stomatology, Sichuan University, Sichuan, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.', 'Department of Biotherapy, Cancer Center, State Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China.']",['eng'],['Systematic Review'],Switzerland,Front Pharmacol,Frontiers in pharmacology,101548923,,,,,PMC6598635,['NOTNLM'],"['Bcl-2 inhibitor', 'chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'deletion of chromosome 17p', 'hematological malignancy', 'venetoclax']",2019/07/12 06:00,2019/07/12 06:01,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/03/26 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/29 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/12 06:01 [medline]']",['10.3389/fphar.2019.00697 [doi]'],epublish,Front Pharmacol. 2019 Jun 21;10:697. doi: 10.3389/fphar.2019.00697. eCollection 2019.,,20190621,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This new profile is part of the implementation of the epidemiological surveillance system within the new Programme of care intervention for health protection in these populations and in the new Regional Prevention Plan. DESIGN: geographic population survey providing, for each NPCS considered in this study, a comparison between the local population and the populations of the neighbouring areas. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the study population included the residents in the municipalities residing in the NPCSs of Augusta-Priolo, Gela, Milazzo, and Biancavilla. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: the standardized mortality ratio (SMR), morbidity (SHR), and tumour incidence (SIR), with the respective 95% confidence intervals, were estimated using the Mortality Registry as source for the mortality index, the database of the hospital discharged as source for the morbidity index, and the data from the Regional Network of Tumour Registers as source for the incidence index. RESULTS: in the local comparison, excess of hospitalization in both sexes was reported in Augusta-Priolo for liver cirrhosis, mental disorders, and digestive tract disease, and an excess of incidence and mortality for leukaemia in women and prostate cancer in men. In the NPCS of Gela, there was an excess of hospitalization in both sexes for blood and hematopoietic diseases, circulatory and nervous system diseases, coupled with the same excess of mortality. Excess of incidence and mortality of stomach tumours in men and incidence of lung cancer in women were observed. The area of Milazzo was characterized by an excess of incidence and mortality for melanoma in men. In the municipality of Biancavilla, there is evidence of excess of hospitalization for respiratory diseases and endocrine glands diseases in both sexes, while a mortality excess for circulatory system diseases was highlighted. The excess of incidence of mesothelioma in both men and women was confirmed. CONCLUSION: data from the new surveillance system help to define the health profile in the NPCSs of Sicily. Even using the local level of comparison, that was added to the traditional approach in geographic studies for the NPCSs available to date, the particular impact of some chronic diseases in these populations has been confirmed also in recent years.","['Cernigliaro, Achille', 'Santangelo, Omar Enzo', 'Maniglia, Marialuisa', 'Pollina Addario, Sebastiano', 'Usticano, Antonella', 'Marras, Antonello', 'Ciranni, Paolo', 'Dardanoni, Gabriella', 'Saporito, Laura', 'Tavormina, Elisa', 'Fantaci, Giovanna', 'Scondotto, Salvatore']","['Cernigliaro A', 'Santangelo OE', 'Maniglia M', 'Pollina Addario S', 'Usticano A', 'Marras A', 'Ciranni P', 'Dardanoni G', 'Saporito L', 'Tavormina E', 'Fantaci G', 'Scondotto S']",,"['Dipartimento per le attivita sanitarie e Osservatorio epidemiologico, Assessorato della salute, Regione Siciliana, Palermo; achille.cernigliaro@regione.sicilia.it.', 'Dipartimento di scienze per la promozione della salute e materno-infantile ""G.

Mutational profiling at diagnosis and/or relapse may help to identify APL patients needing frequent molecular monitoring and early treatment intervention. Using an NGS approach including a 31 myeloid gene-panel, we tested BM samples of 44 APLs at the time of diagnosis, and of 31 at relapse. Mutations in PML and RARA genes were studied using a customized-NGS-RNA panel. Patients relapsing after ATRA-chemotherapy rarely had additional mutations (P = .009). In patients relapsing after ATRA/ATO, the PML gene was a preferential mutation target. We then evaluated the predictive value of mutations at APL diagnosis. A median of two mutations was detectable in 9/11 patients who later relapsed, vs one mutation in 21/33 patients who remained in CCR (P = .0032). This corresponded to a significantly lower risk of relapse in patients with one or less mutations (HR 0.046; 95% CI 0.011-0.197; P < .0001). NGS-analysis at the time of APL diagnosis may inform treatment decisions, including alternative treatments for cases with an unfavorable mutation profile.","['Iaccarino, Licia', 'Ottone, Tiziana', 'Alfonso, Valentina', 'Cicconi, Laura', 'Divona, Mariadomenica', 'Lavorgna, Serena', 'Travaglini, Serena', 'Ferrantini, Aleandra', 'Falconi, Giulia', 'Baer, Constance', 'Usai, Monica', 'Forghieri, Fabio', 'Venditti, Adriano', 'Del Principe, Maria Ilaria', 'Arcese, William', 'Voso, Maria Teresa', 'Haferlach, Torsten', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco']","['Iaccarino L', 'Ottone T', 'Alfonso V', 'Cicconi L', 'Divona M', 'Lavorgna S', 'Travaglini S', 'Ferrantini A', 'Falconi G', 'Baer C', 'Usai M', 'Forghieri F', 'Venditti A', 'Del Principe MI', 'Arcese W', 'Voso MT', 'Haferlach T', 'Lo-Coco F']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1936-3592', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3958-0669', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-6164-4761']","['Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Neuro-Oncohematology, Santa Lucia Foundation, I.R.C.C.S., Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Medical Sciences and Public Health, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Section of Hematology, Department of Surgical and Medical Sciences, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'MLL Munich Leukemia Laboratory, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Biomedicine and Prevention, University of Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins, Fusion)', '0 (Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein)', '0 (RARA protein, human)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha)', '0 (promyelocytic leukemia-retinoic acid receptor alpha fusion oncoprotein)', '143220-95-5 (PML protein, human)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'S7V92P67HO (Arsenic Trioxide)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arsenic Trioxide/administration & dosage/pharmacology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Clone Cells', 'Disease Progression', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*genetics', '*Mutation', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', 'Oncogene Proteins, Fusion/*genetics', 'Promyelocytic Leukemia Protein/*genetics', 'Protein Domains/genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Reproducibility of Results', 'Retinoic Acid Receptor alpha/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage']",,,,2019/07/12 06:00,2020/04/09 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/07 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.25573 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 2019 Oct;94(10):1091-1097. doi: 10.1002/ajh.25573.

The ability of Thpo signaling to stimulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal has led to the development and utilization of Thpo mimetic drugs to treat hematopoietic diseases with restricted function of HSCs, such as aplastic anemia.

Overall mortality following invasive mould disease (IMD) is high; adequate and timely antifungal treatment seems to ameliorate the outcome, yet early diagnosis in the haematological patient remains a challenge for most clinicians. Prophylaxis and the empiric addition of antifungal therapy to neutropaenic patients with fever persisting or recurring during broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment is therefore standard of care in many institutions. However, aside from the potential for overtreatment and important side effects, the emergence of resistance to medical triazoles in Aspergillus fumigatus poses a risk for inadequate initial treatment. Initial voriconazole therapy in patients with azole-resistant invasive aspergillosis was recently shown to be associated with a 23% increased mortality rate compared to the patients with azole-susceptible infection, despite changing to appropriate antifungal therapy once resistance was detected. Moreover, fever is not always present with IMD; therefore, cases may be missed when relying solely on this symptom for starting diagnostic procedures and antifungal treatment. At our institution, a diagnostic-driven treatment approach for IMD was implemented relying on clinical but also laboratory markers to start antifungal treatment. We describe the basis and clinical implementation of our diagnostic-driven approach in this review.","['de Kort, E A', 'Maertens, J', 'Verweij, P E', 'Rijnders, B J A', 'Blijlevens, N M A']","['de Kort EA', 'Maertens J', 'Verweij PE', 'Rijnders BJA', 'Blijlevens NMA']",,"['Department of Haematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Universitaire Ziekenhuizen Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.', 'Department of Medical Microbiology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Center of Expertise in Mycology Radboudumc/CWZ, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Microbiology, Erasmus university medical center, Rotterdam, the Netherlands.', 'Department of Haematology, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Med Mycol,Medical mycology,9815835,,IM,,"['Drug Resistance, Fungal', 'Hematology/*trends', 'Humans', 'Mycoses/blood/*diagnosis/*prevention & control']",,['NOTNLM'],"['acute leukemia', 'azole resistance', 'diagnostic driven management', 'haematopoietic stem cell transplantation', 'invasive fungal disease']",2019/07/12 06:00,2019/10/28 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/11 00:00 [received]', '2019/02/06 00:00 [revised]', '2019/02/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/10/28 06:00 [medline]']","['5530949 [pii]', '10.1093/mmy/myz026 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Mycol. 2019 Jun 1;57(Supplement_3):S267-S273. doi: 10.1093/mmy/myz026.,"['(c) The Author(s) 2019.

However, a comprehensive virome analysis across PTCLs has not previously been reported. Here we utilized published whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data sets from seven different PTCL studies and new RNA-seq data from our laboratory to screen for virus association, to analyze viral gene expression, and to assess B- and T-cell receptor diversity paradigms across PTCL subtypes. In addition to identifying EBV in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma (ENKTL), two PTCL subtypes with well-established EBV associations, we also detected EBV in several cases of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL), and we found evidence of infection by the oncogenic viruses Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 in isolated PTCL cases. In AITLs, EBV gene expression analysis showed expression of immediate early, early, and late lytic genes, suggesting either low-level lytic gene expression or productive infection in a subset of EBV-infected B-lymphocyte stromal cells. Deconvolution of immune cell subpopulations demonstrated a greater B-cell signal in AITLs than in other PTCL subtypes, consistent with a larger role for B-cell support in the pathogenesis of AITL. Reconstructed T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR) repertoires demonstrated increased BCR diversity in AITLs, consistent with a possible EBV-driven polyclonal response. These findings indicate potential alternative roles for EBV in PTCLs, in addition to the canonical oncogenic mechanisms associated with EBV latent infection. Our findings also suggest the involvement of other viruses in PTCL pathogenesis and demonstrate immunological alterations associated with these cancers.IMPORTANCE In this study, we utilized next-generation sequencing data from 7 different studies of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) patient samples to globally assess viral associations, provide insights into the contributions of EBV gene expression to the tumor phenotype, and assess the unique roles of EBV in modulating the immune cell tumor microenvironment. These studies revealed potential roles for EBV replication genes in some PTCL subtypes, the possible role of additional human tumor viruses in rare cases of PTCLs, and a role for EBV in providing a unique immune microenvironmental niche in one subtype of PTCLs. Together, these studies provide new insights into the understudied role of tumor viruses in PTCLs.","['Nakhoul, Hani', 'Lin, Zhen', 'Wang, Xia', 'Roberts, Claire', 'Dong, Yan', 'Flemington, Erik']","['Nakhoul H', 'Lin Z', 'Wang X', 'Roberts C', 'Dong Y', 'Flemington E']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-9229-053X'],"['Department of Pathology, Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Structural and Cellular Biology, Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA.', 'Department of Pathology, Tulane Cancer Center, Tulane University School of Medicine, New Orleans, Louisiana, USA erik@tulane.edu.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,mSphere,mSphere,101674533,,IM,,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cellular Microenvironment', 'Epstein-Barr Virus Infections/complications/immunology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Viral', 'Herpesvirus 4, Human/*genetics', 'Herpesvirus 8, Human/genetics', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral/*immunology/*virology', 'Sequence Analysis, RNA', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Microenvironment/*genetics/immunology']",PMC6620372,['NOTNLM'],"['*B-cell receptor diversity', '*EBV', '*Epstein-Barr virus', ""*Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus"", '*T cell', '*human T-cell leukemia virus', '*immune microenvironment', '*lymphoma', '*murine leukemia virus', '*sequencing']",2019/07/12 06:00,2020/02/07 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/07 06:00 [medline]']","['4/4/e00248-19 [pii]', '10.1128/mSphere.00248-19 [doi]']",epublish,mSphere. 2019 Jul 10;4(4). pii: 4/4/e00248-19. doi: 10.1128/mSphere.00248-19.,['Copyright (c) 2019 Nakhoul et al.'],20190710,,"['U54 GM104940/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'R21 CA236549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 AI106676/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA243793/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P20 GM121288/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA214091/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A sustained deep molecular response on long-term TKI is critical prior to attempting treatment-free remission. Reproducible results from several studies reported recently, failed to identify robust and reproducible predictive factors for the selection of the best candidates for successful TKI cessation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective national phase II study evaluating the cessation of imatinib after at least 2 years of MR4.5 obtained on imatinib first-line in patients with chronic phase CML. RESULTS: A total of 218 patients with de novo chronic phase CML were involved in the study. The median follow-up after imatinib cessation was 23.5 (1-64) months, 2 patients died from unrelated causes, and 107 experienced a confirmed increase in BCR-ABL1 levels defined as molecular recurrence. The molecular recurrence-free survival was 52% [95% confidence interval (CI), 45%-59%] at 6 months, and 50% (95% CI, 43%-57%) at 24 months. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to evaluate more accurately low levels of BCR-ABL1 in 175 of 218 patients at imatinib cessation. To apply positive BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratios on the international scale (IS), a conversion factor was calculated for ddPCR and the significant cut-off point was established at 0.0023%(IS). In a multivariate analysis, the duration of TKI (>/=74.8 months) and ddPCR (>/=0.0023%(IS)) were the two identified predictive factors of molecular recurrence, with P = 0.0366 (HR, 0.635; 95% CI, 0.415-0.972] and P = 0.008 (HR, 0.556; 95% CI, 0.360-0.858), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the duration of TKI and residual leukemic cell load as determined by ddPCR are key factors for predicting successful treatment-free remission for patients with de novo chronic phase CML.See related commentary by Yan et al., p. 6561.","['Nicolini, Franck Emmanuel', 'Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Boureau, Lisa', 'Cony-Makhoul, Pascale', 'Charbonnier, Aude', 'Escoffre-Barbe,

In this article, we describe the biological evaluation of a new CXCR4-targeting and -antagonizing molecule (BAT1) that we designed and show that, when incorporated into a liposomal drug delivery system, it can be used to deliver cancer therapeutics at high levels to chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. CXCR4 targeting and antagonism by BAT1 were demonstrated alone and following its incorporation into liposomes (BAT1-liposomes). Antagonism of BAT1 against the CXCR4/CXCL12 interaction was demonstrated through signaling inhibition and function blocking: BAT1 reduced ERK phosphorylation and cell migration to levels equivalent to those seen in the absence of CXCL12 stimulation (P < .001). Specific uptake of BAT1-liposomes and delivery of a therapeutic cargo to the cell nucleus was seen within 3 hours of incubation and induced significantly more CLL cell death after 24 hours than control liposomes (P = .004). The BAT1 drug-delivery system is modular, versatile, and highly clinically relevant, incorporating elements of proven clinical efficacy. The combined capabilities to block CXCL12-induced migration and intracellular signaling while simultaneously delivering therapeutic cargo mean that the BAT1-liposome drug-delivery system could be a timely and relevant treatment of a range of hematological disorders, particularly because the therapeutic cargo can be tailored to the disease being treated.","['McCallion, Catriona', 'Peters, Anna D', 'Booth, Andrew', 'Rees-Unwin, Karen', 'Adams, Julie', 'Rahi, Raisa', 'Pluen, Alain', 'Hutchinson, Claire V', 'Webb, Simon J', 'Burthem, John']","['McCallion C', 'Peters AD', 'Booth A', 'Rees-Unwin K', 'Adams J', 'Rahi R', 'Pluen A', 'Hutchinson CV', 'Webb SJ', 'Burthem J']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-9793-8748'],"['School of Chemistry.', 'Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, and.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'School of Chemistry.', 'Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, and.', 'School of Chemistry.', 'Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, and.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Division of Pharmacy and Optometry, School of Health Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Faculty of Dentistry and Medicine, Peninsula Medical School, University of Plymouth, Plymouth, United Kingdom; and.', 'University Hospitals Plymouth NHS Trust, Plymouth, United Kingdom.', 'School of Chemistry.', 'Manchester Institute of Biotechnology, and.', 'Division of Cancer Sciences, School of Medical Sciences, University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom.', 'Department of Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, Manchester, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood Adv,Blood advances,101698425,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (CXCL12 protein, human)', '0 (Chemokine CXCL12)', '0 (Drug Carriers)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Receptors, CXCR4)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (DDX39B protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.13 (DEAD-box RNA Helicases)']",IM,,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/chemistry', 'Cell Survival', 'Chemokine CXCL12/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DEAD-box RNA Helicases/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage/chemistry', '*Drug Carriers/chemistry', '*Drug Delivery Systems', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/drug therapy/metabolism/pathology', '*Liposomes/chemistry', 'Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Protein Binding', 'Receptors, CXCR4/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism']",PMC6650733,,,2019/07/12 06:00,2020/07/08 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/08 06:00 [medline]']","['bloodadvances.2019000098 [pii]', '10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000098 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Adv. 2019 Jul 23;3(14):2069-2081. doi: 10.1182/bloodadvances.2019000098.,['(c) 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) risk stratification studies typically focus on time to first treatment (TTFT), time to progression (TTP) after treatment, and overall survival (OS). Whereas TTFT risk stratification remains similar over time, TTP and OS have changed dramatically with the introduction of targeted therapies, such as the Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib. We have shown that genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in CLL are strongly associated with phenotypic differentiation and patient outcomes. Here, we developed a novel assay, termed methylation-iPLEX (Me-iPLEX), for high-throughput quantification of targeted panels of single cytosine guanine dinucleotides from multiple independent loci. Me-iPLEX was used to classify CLL samples into 1 of 3 known epigenetic subtypes (epitypes). We examined the impact of epitype in 1286 CLL patients from 4 independent cohorts representing a comprehensive view of CLL disease course and therapies. We found that epitype significantly predicted TTFT and OS among newly diagnosed CLL patients. Additionally, epitype predicted TTP and OS with 2 common CLL therapies: chemoimmunotherapy and ibrutinib. Epitype retained significance after stratifying by biologically related biomarkers, immunoglobulin heavy chain mutational status, and ZAP70 expression, as well as other common prognostic markers. Furthermore, among several biological traits enriched between epitypes, we found highly biased immunogenetic features, including IGLV3-21 usage in the poorly characterized intermediate-programmed CLL epitype. In summary, Me-iPLEX is an elegant method to assess epigenetic signatures, including robust classification of CLL epitypes that independently stratify patient risk at diagnosis and time of treatment.","['Giacopelli, Brian', 'Zhao, Qiuhong', 'Ruppert, Amy S', 'Agyeman, Akwasi', 'Weigel, Christoph', 'Wu, Yue-Zhong', 'Gerber, Madelyn M', 'Rabe, Kari G', 'Larson, Melissa C', 'Lu, Junyan', 'Blachly, James S', 'Rogers, Kerry A', 'Wierda, William G', 'Brown, Jennifer R', 'Rai, Kanti R', 'Keating, Michael', 'Rassenti, Laura Z', 'Kipps, Thomas J', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Shanafelt, Tait D', 'Kay, Neil E', 'Abruzzo, Lynne V', 'Coombes, Kevin R', 'Woyach, Jennifer A', 'Byrd, John C', 'Oakes, Christopher C']","['Giacopelli B', 'Zhao Q', 'Ruppert AS', 'Agyeman A', 'Weigel C', 'Wu YZ', 'Gerber MM', 'Rabe KG', 'Larson MC', 'Lu J', 'Blachly JS', 'Rogers KA', 'Wierda WG', 'Brown JR', 'Rai KR', 'Keating M', 'Rassenti LZ', 'Kipps TJ', 'Zenz T', 'Shanafelt TD', 'Kay NE', 'Abruzzo LV', 'Coombes KR', 'Woyach JA', 'Byrd JC', 'Oakes CC']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7313-1875', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9211-0746', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5748-7874', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-5951-5055', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-7630-2123']","['Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'Division of Biomedical Statistics and Informatics, Department of Health Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN.', 'European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Division of Hematologic Malignancies, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA.', 'Division of Hematology-Oncology, North Shore-Long Island Jewish Medical System, New Hyde Park, NY.', 'Department of Leukemia, University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA.', 'Department of Medical Oncology and Hematology, University Hospital and University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Department of Medicine-Hematology, Stanford School of Medicine, Stanford, CA.', 'Division of Hematology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; and.', 'Department of Pathology, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Division of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.', 'Division of Hematology, Department of Internal Medicine, and.', 'Department of Biomedical Informatics and.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)']",IM,,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/genetics', '*DNA Methylation', 'Disease Progression', 'Epigenesis, Genetic', 'Genetic Loci', 'Genetic Testing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Prognosis']",PMC6706807,,,2019/07/12 06:00,2020/01/28 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/03/07 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/01/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['S0006-4971(20)46170-1 [pii]', '10.1182/blood.2019000490 [doi]']",ppublish,Blood. 2019 Aug 22;134(8):688-698. doi: 10.1182/blood.2019000490.

Based on fms-like tyrosine kinase-3-internal tandem duplication mutational status; the DeltaNp73/TAp73 expression ratio; and ID1, BAALC, ERG, and KMT2E gene expression levels, we modeled ISAPL in 159 patients (median ISAPL score, 3; range, 0-10). ISAPL modeling identified 2 distinct groups of patients, with significant differences in early mortality (P < .001), remission (P = .004), overall survival (P < .001), cumulative incidence of relapse (P = .028), disease-free survival (P = .03), and event-free survival (P < .001). These data were internally validated by using a bootstrap resampling procedure. At least for patients treated with ATRA and anthracycline-based chemotherapy, ISAPL modeling may identify those who need to be treated differently to maximize their chances for a cure.","['Lucena-Araujo, Antonio R', 'Coelho-Silva, Juan L', 'Pereira-Martins, Diego A', 'Silveira, Douglas R', 'Koury, Luisa C', 'Melo, Raul A M', 'Bittencourt, Rosane', 'Pagnano, Katia', 'Pasquini, Ricardo', 'Nunes, Elenaide C', 'Fagundes, Evandro M', 'Gloria, Ana B', 'Kerbauy, Fabio', 'de Lourdes Chauffaille, Maria', 'Bendit, Israel', 'Rocha, Vanderson', 'Keating, Armand', 'Tallman, Martin S', 'Ribeiro, Raul C', 'Dillon, Richard', 'Ganser, Arnold', 'Lowenberg, Bob', 'Valk, P J M', 'Lo-Coco, Francesco', 'Sanz, Miguel A', 'Berliner, Nancy', 'Rego, Eduardo M']","['Lucena-Araujo AR', 'Coelho-Silva JL', 'Pereira-Martins DA', 'Silveira DR', 'Koury LC', 'Melo RAM', 'Bittencourt R', 'Pagnano K', 'Pasquini R', 'Nunes EC', 'Fagundes EM', 'Gloria AB', 'Kerbauy F', 'de Lourdes Chauffaille M', 'Bendit I', 'Rocha V', 'Keating A', 'Tallman MS', 'Ribeiro RC', 'Dillon R', 'Ganser A', 'Lowenberg B', 'Valk PJM', 'Lo-Coco F', 'Sanz MA', 'Berliner N', 'Rego EM']","['ORCID: 0000-0003-1694-8958', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8384-6551', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3302-4311', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5298-9592', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7629-7144', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7975-0805', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-4751-1428', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-0094-619X', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9956-5647', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-8982-5217', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1489-1177', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-7502-6895', 'ORCID: 0000-0003-1567-4086']","['Department of Genetics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, and.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, and.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Department of Genetics, Federal University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, and.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Hematology Division, Faculdade de Medicina, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, Medical School of Ribeirao Preto, and.', 'Department of Internal Medicine, University of Pernambuco, Recife, Brazil.', 'Hematology Division, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil.', 'Hematology and Hemotherapy Center, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil.', 'Hematology Division, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Hematology Division, Federal University of Parana, Curitiba, Brazil.', 'Hematology Division, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Hematology Division, Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil.', 'Department of Hematology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Hematology, Federal University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Hematology Division, Faculdade de Medicina, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Center for Cell Based Therapy, University of Sao Paulo, Ribeirao Preto, Brazil.', 'Hematology Division, Faculdade de Medicina, University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil.', 'Department of Haematology, Churchill Hospital, Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom.', 'Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto, ON, Canada.', 'Leukemia Service, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY.', ""Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN."", ""Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Faculty of Life Sciences and Medicine, King's College London, London, United Kingdom."", 'Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology, and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Hematology, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.', 'Department of Biopathology, University Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.', 'Unit of Neuro-oncohematology, Santa Lucia Foundation, Rome, Italy.', 'Department of Hematology, Valencia University Medical School, Valencia, Spain.', 'Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red de Cancer (CIBERONC), Instituto Carlos III, Madrid, Spain;

Although dominant in mediating T cell dysfunction in cancer, it is now well-accepted that interruption of PD-1/PD-L1 axes alone does not always completely restore T cell function, indicating the involvement of additional negative regulatory pathways, such as TIM-3/Gal-9, in promoting T cell exhaustion.Here, we characterized these pathways in AML patients enrolled in a phase I dose escalation trial that combined Selinexor, a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE), with high-dose cytarabine (HiDAC) and mitoxantrone (Mito) (NCT02573363) as induction therapy.To monitor changes in expression of immune checkpoint receptors, multi-parameter flow cytometry was performed on peripheral blood and bone marrow biopsy specimens at diagnosis and following induction therapy in 26 AML patients. Expression of CD47, PD-L1, PD-L2 and Gal9 was assessed on CD34(+) AML blasts, as well as on CD34(-) cell populations. In parallel, we evaluated expression of inhibitory (PD1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIM-3) and stimulatory (CD28, ICOS, CD137, OX40, CD40L, HLA-DR) co-receptors on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell subsets.Compared to baseline, the frequency of Gal9(+) CD34(-) cells was significantly higher in patients with treatment failure (TF) than in those in complete remission (CR), and this finding correlated with increased TIM-3 expression on marrow-resident T cells in TF patients. Moreover, when we measured the expression level of PD-1 and TIM-3 in bone marrow samples compared to peripheral blood, TIM-3 was significantly higher in BM specimens.Our results suggest that targeting the Gal9/Tim-3 axis could be effective in combination with induction chemotherapy to increase the likelihood of complete remission in AML patients.","['Dama, Paola', 'Tang, Marshall', 'Fulton, Noreen', 'Kline, Justin', 'Liu, Hongtao']","['Dama P', 'Tang M', 'Fulton N', 'Kline J', 'Liu H']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5716-9665'],"['University of Chicago Medicine Hematology/Oncology Section, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA. dmapla@gmail.com.', 'University of Chicago Medicine Hematology/Oncology Section, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'University of Chicago Medicine Hematology/Oncology Section, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'University of Chicago Medicine Hematology/Oncology Section, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.', 'University of Chicago Medicine Hematology/Oncology Section, 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago, IL, 60637, USA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial, Phase I', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Immunother Cancer,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,101620585,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Galectins)', '0 (HAVCR2 protein, human)', '0 (Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2)', '0 (Hydrazines)', '0 (LGALS9 protein, human)', '0 (Triazoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '31TZ62FO8F (selinexor)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Cells/drug effects/immunology', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Galectins/*immunology', 'Hepatitis A Virus Cellular Receptor 2/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Hydrazines/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitoxantrone/*therapeutic use', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets/drug effects/immunology', 'Treatment Failure', 'Triazoles/*therapeutic use']",PMC6621946,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Beyond PD-1', '*Chemotherapy', '*Exhaustion', '*Immune checkpoint', '*T-cell', '*TIM-3', '*Treatment failure']",2019/07/12 06:00,2020/07/28 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/12/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/06 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/28 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s40425-019-0611-3 [doi]', '10.1186/s40425-019-0611-3 [pii]']",epublish,J Immunother Cancer. 2019 Jul 10;7(1):175. doi: 10.1186/s40425-019-0611-3.,,20190710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we have attempted to understand the role of RNA binding proteins, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) and Moloney Leukemia Virus 10 (MOV10) protein in N-Methyl-D-Aspartate Receptor (NMDAR) mediated translation regulation. We show that FMRP is required for translation downstream of NMDAR stimulation and MOV10 is the key specificity factor in this process. In rat cortical synaptoneurosomes, MOV10 in association with FMRP and Argonaute 2 (AGO2) forms the inhibitory complex on a subset of NMDAR responsive mRNAs. On NMDAR stimulation, MOV10 dissociates from AGO2 and promotes the translation of its target mRNAs. FMRP is required to form MOV10-AGO2 inhibitory complex and to promote translation of MOV10 associated mRNAs. Phosphorylation of FMRP appears to be the potential switch for NMDAR mediated translation and in the absence of FMRP, the distinct translation response to NMDAR stimulation is lost. Thus, FMRP and MOV10 have an important regulatory role in NMDAR mediated translation at the synapse.","['Kute, Preeti Madhav', 'Ramakrishna, Sarayu', 'Neelagandan, Nagammal', 'Chattarji, Sumantra', 'Muddashetty, Ravi S']","['Kute PM', 'Ramakrishna S', 'Neelagandan N', 'Chattarji S', 'Muddashetty RS']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-1373-6194'],"['Centre for Brain Development and Repair (CBDR), Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine (inStem), Bangalore, 560065, India.', 'School of Chemical and Biotechnology, Shanmugha Arts, Science and Technology & Research Academy (SASTRA) University, Thanjavur, 613401, India.', 'Centre for Brain Development and Repair (CBDR), Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine (inStem), Bangalore, 560065, India.', 'The University of Trans-Disciplinary Health Sciences and Technology, Bangalore, 560064, India.', 'Centre for Brain Development and Repair (CBDR), Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine (inStem), Bangalore, 560065, India.', 'Centre for Brain Development and Repair (CBDR), Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine (inStem), Bangalore, 560065, India.', 'National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore, 560065, India.', 'Centre for Discovery Brain Sciences, Deanery of Biomedical Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, EH89XD, UK.', 'Centre for Brain Development and Repair (CBDR), Institute for Stem Cell Science and Regenerative Medicine (inStem), Bangalore, 560065, India. ravism@instem.res.in.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Brain,Molecular brain,101468876,"['0 (Ago2 protein, rat)', '0 (Argonaute Proteins)', '0 (Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein)', '0 (Dlg4 protein, rat)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate)', '139135-51-6 (Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (MOV10 protein, rat)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Argonaute Proteins/metabolism', 'DNA Helicases/*metabolism', 'Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein/genetics/metabolism', 'Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Polyribosomes/metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Protein Binding', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Rats, Sprague-Dawley', 'Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate/*metabolism', 'Synapses/*metabolism/ultrastructure', 'Up-Regulation']",PMC6617594,['NOTNLM'],['*FMRP/MOV10/NMDAR mediated translation'],2019/07/12 06:00,2020/06/02 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/02/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/08 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/02 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13041-019-0473-0 [doi]', '10.1186/s13041-019-0473-0 [pii]']",epublish,Mol Brain. 2019 Jul 10;12(1):65. doi: 10.1186/s13041-019-0473-0.,,20190710,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The influence of R882 allele ratio on drug response and prognosis of AML is unknown yet. Besides, it is obscure whether anthracyclines are involved in chemoresistance resulted from R882 mutations. METHODS: DNMT3A R882 mutations in 870 adult AML patients receiving standard induction therapy were detected by pyrosequencing. Associations of the mutants with responses to induction therapy and disease prognosis were analyzed. RESULTS: DNMT3A R882 mutations were detected in 74 (8.51%) patients and allele ratio of the mutations ranged from 6 to 50% in the cohort. After the first and second courses of induction therapy including aclarubicin, complete remission rates were significantly lower in carriers of the DNMT3A R882 mutants as compared with R882 wildtype patients (P = 0.022 and P = 0.038, respectively). Compared with R882 wild-type patients, those with the R882 mutations showed significantly shorter overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 1.92 x 10(-4) and P = 0.004, respectively). Patients with higher allele ratio of R882 mutations showed a significantly shorter OS as compared with the lower allele ratio group (P = 0.035). CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the impact of DNMT3A R882 mutations on AML prognosis was determined by the mutant-allele ratio and higher allele ratio could predict a worse prognosis, which might improve AML risk stratification. In addition, DNMT3A R882 mutations were associated with an inferior response to induction therapy with aclarubicin in Chinese AML patients.","['Yuan, Xiao-Qing', 'Chen, Peng', 'Du, Yin-Xiao', 'Zhu,

Studies have shown that sustained phosphorylation of AKT1 plays a crucial role in the proliferation of CML cells. Evidence indicates that in tongue cancer cells, FAM168A, also known as tongue cancer resistance-associated protein (TCRP1), can directly bind to AKT1 and regulate AKT1/NFkappaB signaling pathways. This study aimed to investigate the role of FAM168A in regulation of AKT1/NFkappaB signaling pathway and cell cycle in CML. METHODS: FAM168A interference was performed, and the expression and phosphorylation of FAM168A downstream proteins were measured in K562 CML cell line. The possible roles of FAM168A in the proliferation of CML cells were investigated using in vitro cell culture, in vivo animal models and clinical specimens. RESULTS: We found that the expression of FAM168A significantly increased in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of CML patients, compared with normal healthy controls. FAM168A interference did not change AKT1 protein expression, but significantly decreased AKT1 phosphorylation, significantly increased IkappaB-alpha protein level, and significantly reduced nuclear NFkappaB protein level. Moreover, there was a significant increase of G2/M phase cells and Cyclin B1 level. Immunoprecipitation results showed that FAM168A interacts with breakpoint cluster region (BCR) -Abelson murine leukemia (ABL1) fusion protein and AKT1, respectively. Animal experiments confirmed that FAM168A interference prolonged the survival and reduced the tumor formation in mice inoculated with K562 cells. The results of clinical specimens showed that FAM168A expression and AKT1 phosphorylation were significantly elevated in CML patients. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that FAM168A may act as a linker protein that binds to BCR-ABL1 and AKT1, which further mediates the downstream signaling pathways in CML. Our findings demonstrate that FAM168A may be involved in the regulation of AKT1/NFkappaB signaling pathway and cell cycle in CML.","['Liu, Xiaorong', 'Mai, Huirong', 'Jiang, Hanfang', 'Xing, Zhihao', 'Peng, Dong', 'Kong, Yuan', 'Zhu, Chunqing', 'Chen, Yunsheng']","['Liu X', 'Mai H', 'Jiang H', 'Xing Z', 'Peng D', 'Kong Y', 'Zhu C', 'Chen Y']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-8520-9852'],"[""Clinical laboratory, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, No. 7019, Yitian Road, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518038, People's Republic of China."", ""Division of Hematology and Oncology, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518038, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical laboratory, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, No. 7019, Yitian Road, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518038, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical laboratory, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, No. 7019, Yitian Road, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518038, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical laboratory, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, No. 7019, Yitian Road, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518038, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical laboratory, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, No. 7019, Yitian Road, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518038, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical laboratory, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, No. 7019, Yitian Road, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518038, People's Republic of China."", ""Clinical laboratory, Shenzhen Children's Hospital, No. 7019, Yitian Road, Shenzhen, Guangdong, 518038, People's Republic of China. chenyunshenglw@163.com.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (BCR-ABL1 fusion protein, human)', '0 (CCNB1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin B1)', '0 (NF-kappa B p50 Subunit)', '0 (NFKB1 protein, human)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (tongue cancer resistance-associated protein 1, human)', '139874-52-5 (NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (AKT1 protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle Checkpoints', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Child', 'Cyclin B1/metabolism', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Female', 'Fusion Proteins, bcr-abl/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred NOD', 'Mice, SCID', 'NF-KappaB Inhibitor alpha/metabolism', 'NF-kappa B p50 Subunit/*metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt/*metabolism', 'Survival Rate', 'Tumor Burden']",PMC6617578,['NOTNLM'],"['AKT1', 'BCR-ABL1', 'Cell proliferation', 'Chronic myeloid leukemia', 'FAM168A']",2019/07/12 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2018/10/30 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5898-4 [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5898-4 [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Jul 10;19(1):679. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5898-4.,,20190710,,"['JCYJ20150403100317057/Shenzhen City Funding for Basic Research Innovation Project', 'SZSM201512033/Sanming Project of Medicine in Shenzhen']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of preexisting DM in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Materials and Methods: Six hundred and thirty-three subjects with newly-diagnosed CLL between 2007 and 2016 were recruited. Propensity score-matched method was performed to balance baseline characteristics and eliminate possible bias. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses screened the independent risk indicators for time-to-first-treatment (TTFT) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) of CLL. Receiver operator characteristic curves and the corresponding areas under the curve assessed the predictive accuracy of CLL-International Prognostic Index (IPI) together with DM. RESULTS: The results showed that 111 patients had pre-existing DM. In the propensity-matched cohort, DM was correlated with inferior TTFT and CSS in CLL patients, and it was an independent prognostic factor for both CSS and TTFT. Pre-diabetics also shared undesirable prognostic outcome compared with patients with no diabetic tendency, and a positive association between longer diabetic duration and poorer prognosis of CLL was identified. DM as one additional point to CLL-IPI had larger area under the curve compared with CLL-IPI alone in CSS prediction and could improve the prognostic capacity of CLL-IPI. CONCLUSION: Pre-existing DM was found to be a valuable prognostic predictor and could help predict life expectancy and build refined prognostication models for CLL.","['Gao, Rui', 'Man, Tian-Shuo', 'Liang, Jin-Hua', 'Wang, Li', 'Zhu, Hua-Yuan', 'Wu, Wei', 'Fan, Lei', 'Li, Jian-Yong', 'Yang, Tao', 'Xu, Wei']","['Gao R', 'Man TS', 'Liang JH', 'Wang L', 'Zhu HY', 'Wu W', 'Fan L', 'Li JY', 'Yang T', 'Xu W']",,"['Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Endocrinology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Nanjing, China.', 'Department of Hematology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Jiangsu Province Hospital, Collaborative Innovation Center for Cancer Personalized Medicine, Nanjing, China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Korea (South),Cancer Res Treat,Cancer research and treatment,101155137,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Glycated Hemoglobin A)', '0 (hemoglobin A1c protein, human)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Area Under Curve', 'Biomarkers', 'Diabetes Complications/*epidemiology', 'Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Glycated Hemoglobin A/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kaplan-Meier Estimate', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*complications/diagnosis/epidemiology/*mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Prognosis', 'Propensity Score', 'Proportional Hazards Models']",PMC6962470,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Prognosis']",2019/07/12 06:00,2020/09/09 06:00,['2019/07/12 06:00'],"['2019/03/04 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/09 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/12 06:00 [entrez]']","['crt.2019.122 [pii]', '10.4143/crt.2019.122 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Res Treat. 2020 Jan;52(1):189-206. doi: 10.4143/crt.2019.122.

The identification of endogenous mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration or neuroprotection helps to understand the response of the retina to stress and provides essential information not only for basic retinal physiology but also for defining molecular targets for neuroprotective strategies. Here we used excessive light exposure as a model system to study mechanisms of photoreceptor degeneration in mice. Using one wild type and four genetically modified mouse strains, we demonstrate that light exposure resulted not only in the degeneration of rods but also in an early but transient repression of several cone-specific genes, in a reversible hyperreflectivity of the outer retina including the outer plexiform layer, and in the loss of horizontal cells. The effects on cones, horizontal cells and the inner retina depended on light absorption by rhodopsin and, at least partially, on leukemia inhibitory factor. This demonstrates the existence of intercellular communication routes that transduce rod stress to other cells, likely to provide support for photoreceptors and increase cell survival in the injured retina.","['Samardzija, Marijana', 'Todorova, Vyara', 'Gougoulakis, Laura', 'Barben, Maya', 'Notzli, Sarah', 'Klee, Katrin', 'Storti, Federica', 'Gubler, Andrea', 'Imsand, Cornelia', 'Grimm, Christian']","['Samardzija M', 'Todorova V', 'Gougoulakis L', 'Barben M', 'Notzli S', 'Klee K', 'Storti F', 'Gubler A', 'Imsand C', 'Grimm C']",,"['Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Neuroscience Center Zurich (ZNZ), University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Center for Integrative Human Physiology (ZIHP), University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.', 'Lab for Retinal Cell Biology, Department of Ophthalmology, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Neuroscience Center Zurich (ZNZ), University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Center for Integrative Human Physiology (ZIHP), University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has common recurrent mutations shared between patients in addition to private mutations specific to individuals. We hypothesized that neoantigens derived from recurrent shared mutations would be attractive targets for future immunotherapeutic approaches. Here we sought to study the HLA Class I and II immunopeptidome of thirteen primary AML tumor samples and two AML cell lines (OCI-AML3 and MV4-11) using mass spectrometry to evaluate for endogenous mutation-bearing HLA ligands from common shared AML mutations. We identified two endogenous, mutation-bearing HLA Class I ligands from nucleophosmin (NPM1). The ligands, AVEEVSLRK from two patient samples and C(cys)LAVEEVSL from OCI-AML3, are predicted to bind the common HLA haplotypes, HLA-A*03:01 and HLA-A*02:01 respectively. Since NPM1 is mutated in approximately one-third of patients with AML, the finding of endogenous HLA ligands from mutated NPM1 supports future studies evaluating immunotherapeutic approaches against this shared target, for this subset of patients with AML.","['Narayan, Rupa', 'Olsson, Niclas', 'Wagar, Lisa E', 'Medeiros, Bruno C', 'Meyer, Everett', 'Czerwinski, Debra', 'Khodadoust, Michael S', 'Zhang, Lichao', 'Schultz, Liora', 'Davis, Mark M', 'Elias, Joshua E', 'Levy, Ron']","['Narayan R', 'Olsson N', 'Wagar LE', 'Medeiros BC', 'Meyer E', 'Czerwinski D', 'Khodadoust MS', 'Zhang L', 'Schultz L', 'Davis MM', 'Elias JE', 'Levy R']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-7104-1163', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-9746-0542']","['Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Hematology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Pediatrics, Division of Hematology/Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Microbiology & Immunology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Chemical and Systems Biology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.', 'Department of Medicine, Division of Oncology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', '0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)']",IM,,"['Antigen Presentation/*genetics', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Frameshift Mutation/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*immunology', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Proteomics/methods']",PMC6619824,,,2019/07/11 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/07/11 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/20 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0219547 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-11595 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jul 10;14(7):e0219547. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0219547. eCollection 2019.,,20190710,,"['P30 CA124435/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R35 CA197353/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'UL1 TR001085/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States', 'TL1 TR001084/TR/NCATS NIH HHS/United States']",['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some of these MLV ERVs produce infectious virus and/or contribute to the generation of intersubgroup recombinants. Analyses of selected mouse strains have linked the appearance of MLVs and virus-induced disease to the strain complement of MLV E-ERVs and to host genes that restrict MLVs, particularly Fv1. Here we screened inbred strain DNAs and genome assemblies to describe the distribution patterns of 45 MLV ERVs and Fv1 alleles in 58 classical inbred strains grouped in two ways: by common ancestry to describe ERV inheritance patterns, and by incidence of MLV-associated lymphomagenesis. Each strain carries a unique set of ERVs, and individual ERVs are present in 5-96% of the strains, often showing lineage-specific distributions. Two ERVs are alternatively present as full-length proviruses or solo long terminal repeats. High disease incidence strains carry the permissive Fv1n allele, tested strains have highly expressed E-ERVs and most have the Bxv1 X-ERV; these three features are not present together in any low-moderate disease strain. The P-ERVs previously implicated in P-MLV generation are not preferentially found in high leukemia strains, but the three Fv1 alleles that restrict inbred strain E-MLVs are found only in low-moderate leukemia strains. This dataset helps define the genetic basis of strain differences in spontaneous lymphomagenesis, describes the distribution of MLV ERVs in strains with shared ancestry, and should help annotate sequenced strain genomes for these insertionally polymorphic and functionally important proviruses.","['Skorski, Matthew', 'Bamunusinghe, Devinka', 'Liu, Qingping', 'Shaffer, Esther', 'Kozak, Christine A']","['Skorski M', 'Bamunusinghe D', 'Liu Q', 'Shaffer E', 'Kozak CA']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-5863-6915'],"['Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.', 'Laboratory of Molecular Microbiology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Bethesda, Maryland, United States of America.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural']",United States,PLoS One,PloS one,101285081,"['0 (Fv1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Proteins)']",IM,,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'Carcinogenesis/genetics', 'Datasets as Topic', 'Endogenous Retroviruses/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia Virus, Murine/genetics/*isolation & purification', 'Lymphoma/genetics/veterinary/*virology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/genetics/*virology', 'Proteins/*genetics']",PMC6619830,,,2019/07/11 06:00,2020/02/27 06:00,['2019/07/11 06:00'],"['2019/04/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/26 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/27 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1371/journal.pone.0219576 [doi]', 'PONE-D-19-10374 [pii]']",epublish,PLoS One. 2019 Jul 10;14(7):e0219576. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0219576. eCollection 2019.,,20190710,,,['The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pristimerin, a quinone methide triterpenoid isolated from the Celastraceae and Hippocrateaceae families, is well-known to exert potential anticancer activities. In this study, we investigated the effects and the mechanisms of action on CML. We found that pristimerin inhibited cell proliferation of K562 CML cells by causing G1 phase arrest. Furthermore, we demonstrated that pristimerin triggered autophagy and apoptosis. Intriguingly, pristimerin-induced cell death was restored by an autophagy inhibitor, suggesting that autophagy is cross-linked with pristimerin-induced apoptosis. Further studies revealed that pristimerin could produce excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), which then induce JNK activation. These findings provide clear evidence that pristimerin might be clinical benefit to patients with CML.","['Liu, Yingxiang', 'Ren, Ziting', 'Li, Xiang', 'Zhong, Jing', 'Bi, Yun', 'Li, Rui', 'Zhao, Qun', 'Yu, Xianjun']","['Liu Y', 'Ren Z', 'Li X', 'Zhong J', 'Bi Y', 'Li R', 'Zhao Q', 'Yu X']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0003-4440-1386'],"['Laboratory of Inflammation and Molecular Pharmacology, School of Basic Medical Sciences & Biomedical Research Institute, Hubei University of Medicine, Shiyan, 442000, P.

Myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MYD88) mutations are frequently reported in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and confer a worse prognosis. The objective of the present study was to assess the value of HRM analysis for the rapid screening of MYD88 mutations in patients with CLL. Genomic DNA samples were extracted from the bone marrow of 129 newly diagnosed patients with CLL. A plasmid with an MYD88-L265P mutation was constructed, and the p.L265P substitution, which is the predominant MYD88 mutation in CLL, was detected using HRM analysis and direct sequencing. The plasmid pCMV-MYD88-L265P-Mu was successfully constructed as a positive control, and was verified by direct sequencing. The normalized and shifted melting curves of 6/129 (4.65%) samples were clearly different from those of other patients by HRM analysis. In addition, the 794T>C mutation in MYD88 was identified in 6 (4.65%) patients by direct sequencing. Sensitivity evaluation revealed that the HRM assay had a higher sensitivity (to 1% dilution) than direct sequencing, in addition to being convenient and time-saving. The MYD88 p.L256P mutation has been implicated to be associated with adverse prognosis in CLL. HRM analysis has the potential to be a routine prescreening technique to identify the MYD88 p.L256P mutation and may facilitate the clinical treatment of CLL.","['Jiang, Min', 'Li, Jie', 'Zhou, Jun', 'Xing, Chao', 'Xu, Jing-Jing', 'Guo, Feng']","['Jiang M', 'Li J', 'Zhou J', 'Xing C', 'Xu JJ', 'Guo F']",,"['Department of Blood Transfusion, The First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu 215006, P.R.

Primary leukemic cells were isolated from patients with refractory drug-resistant acute leukemia. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay was used to detect the proliferation of cells treated with a range of doses of Adriamycin, quercetin and a combination of the two drugs. Non-irradiated mice were used to establish a T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) model, which was subsequently treated with Adriamycin, quercetin and a combination of the two drugs. The survival time was recorded, and white and red blood cells and platelets in mouse peripheral blood were counted. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of cardiac tissues were measured as indicators of oxidative stress and damage. Proliferation of primary leukemic cells was reduced by Adriamycin depending on the dose (0.06, 0.6 or 6 microg/ml) and treatment duration (24, 48 or 72 h) compared with the vehicle treated group. Co-treatment with quercetin achieved a similar suppression of leukemic cell proliferation when a lower dose of Adriamycin (0.03, 0.3 or 3 microg/ml) was administered for the same duration. The survival of non-irradiated mice with T-ALL was improved by co-treatment with a high dose of Adriamycin and quercetin compared with either treatment alone. Compared with treatment with Adriamycin alone, the combined treatment with Adriamycin and quercetin significantly enhanced the SOD activity and reduced the MDA content in the heart. Therefore, quercetin may enhance the effects of Adriamycin on refractory acute leukemia.","['Shi, Yingxu', 'Su, Xiaotian', 'Cui, Hongwei', 'Yu, Lei', 'Du, Hua', 'Han, Yanqiu']","['Shi Y', 'Su X', 'Cui H', 'Yu L', 'Du H', 'Han Y']",,"['Department of Laboratory Medicine, The Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region 010050, P.R.

It has been previously suggested that numerous biological factors, including cytokines, may be involved in the proliferation of malignant cells. For example, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-2, interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor serve roles as inhibitors of cellular apoptosis; whereas IL-5 and IL-10 are inducers of cellular apoptosis. In the present study, the results demonstrated that the phosphorylation and activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) was induced by IL-4 in a time-dependent manner. Notably, the expression level of microRNA (miR)-155 was increased in MEC-1 cells following treatment with IL-4; however, this effect was attenuated following STAT6 knockdown via RNA interference. In addition, STAT6 knockdown promoted cell apoptosis, which was partly attenuated by treatment with IL-4. Inhibition of miR-155 expression significantly increased cell apoptosis despite the presence of IL-4. The results of the present study suggested that treatment with IL-4 enhanced the expression of miR-155, which regulated CLL cell survival via the enhanced phosphorylation of STAT6.","['Chen, Na', 'Feng, Lili', 'Lu, Kang', 'Li, Peipei', 'Lv, Xiao', 'Wang, Xin']","['Chen N', 'Feng L', 'Lu K', 'Li P', 'Lv X', 'Wang X']",,"['Department of Hematology, Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong 250021, P.R.

TP53 is a critical tumor suppressor and plays an essential role in leukemogenesis. Although TP53 is relatively unusual in de novo AML, inactivation of wild-type p53 (WT-p53) is a common event. Murine double minute 2 (MDM2) is a key negative regulator of p53 and its expression; inhibition of MDM2 is postulated to reactivate WT-p53 and its tumor suppressor functions. Nutlins were the first small molecule inhibitors that bind to MDM2 and target its interaction with p53. RG7388 (idasanutlin), a second-generation nutlin, was developed to improve upon the potency and toxicity profile of earlier nutlins. Preliminary data from early phase trials and ongoing studies suggest clinical response with RG7388 (idasanutlin) both in monotherapy and combination strategies in AML. We herein briefly discuss currently approved therapies in AML and review the clinical data for RG7388 (idasanutlin) and MDM2 inhibition as novel treatment strategies in AML. We further describe efficacy and toxicity profile data from completed and ongoing trials of RG7388 (idasanutlin) and other MDM2-p53 inhibitors in development. Many targeted therapies have been approved recently in AML, with a focus on the older and unfit population for intensive induction therapy and in relapsed/refractory disease.

In this study, we demonstrate that CLL cells from TP53-disrupted (TP53 (dis)) patients have constitutively higher expression levels of the alpha-subunit of HIF-1 (HIF-1alpha) and increased HIF-1 transcriptional activity compared to the wild-type counterpart. In the TP53 (dis) subset, HIF-1alpha upregulation is due to reduced expression of the HIF-1alpha ubiquitin ligase von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL). Hypoxia and stromal cells further enhance HIF-1alpha accumulation, independently of TP53 status. Hypoxia acts through the downmodulation of pVHL and the activation of the PI3K/AKT and RAS/ERK1-2 pathways, whereas stromal cells induce an increased activity of the RAS/ERK1-2, RHOA/RHOA kinase and PI3K/AKT pathways, without affecting pVHL expression. Interestingly, we observed that higher levels of HIF-1A mRNA correlate with a lower susceptibility of leukemic cells to spontaneous apoptosis, and associate with the fludarabine resistance that mainly characterizes TP53 (dis) tumor cells. The HIF-1alpha inhibitor BAY87-2243 exerts cytotoxic effects toward leukemic cells, regardless of the TP53 status, and has anti-tumor activity in Em-TCL1 mice. BAY87-2243 also overcomes the constitutive fludarabine resistance of TP53 (dis) leukemic cells and elicits a strongly synergistic cytotoxic effect in combination with ibrutinib, thus providing preclinical evidence to stimulate further investigation into use as a potential new drug in CLL.","['Griggio, Valentina', 'Vitale, Candida', 'Todaro, Maria', 'Riganti, Chiara', 'Kopecka, Joanna', 'Salvetti, Chiara', 'Bomben, Riccardo', 'Bo, Michele Dal', 'Magliulo, Daniela', 'Rossi, Davide', 'Pozzato, Gabriele', 'Bonello, Lisa', 'Marchetti, Monia', 'Omede, Paola', 'Kodipad, Ahad Ahmed', 'Laurenti, Luca', 'Del Poeta, Giovanni', 'Mauro, Francesca Romana', 'Bernardi, Rosa', 'Zenz, Thorsten', 'Gattei, Valter', 'Gaidano, Gianluca', 'Foa, Robin', 'Massaia, Massimo', 'Boccadoro, Mario', 'Coscia, Marta']","['Griggio V', 'Vitale C', 'Todaro M', 'Riganti C', 'Kopecka J', 'Salvetti C', 'Bomben R', 'Bo MD', 'Magliulo D', 'Rossi D', 'Pozzato G', 'Bonello L', 'Marchetti M', 'Omede P', 'Kodipad AA', 'Laurenti L', 'Del Poeta G', 'Mauro FR', 'Bernardi R', 'Zenz T', 'Gattei V', 'Gaidano G', 'Foa R', 'Massaia M', 'Boccadoro M', 'Coscia M']",,"['Division of Hematology, A.O.U.

We examined the effect of direct overexpression of the human p210 (BCR/ABL1) oncoprotein in zebrafish. Humanized p210 (BCR/ABL1) protein was detectable in Tg(hsp70: p210(BCR/ABL1) ) transgenic zebrafish embryos and adult kidney marrow. Transgenic zebrafish developed CML, which could be induced via cells transplanted into recipients. The expression of human BCR/ABL1 promoted myeloid lineages in Tg(hsp70:p210(BCR/ABL1)) transgenic embryos. A total of 77 of 101 (76.24%) Tg(hsp70:p210(BCR/ABL1)) adult transgenic zebrafish (age 6 months-1 year) developed CML. CML in zebrafish showed a triphasic phenotype, similar to that in humans, involving a chronic phase predominantly characterized by neutrophils in various degrees of maturation, an accelerated phase with an increase in blasts and immature myeloid elements, and a blast phase with >90% blasts in both the peripheral blood and kidney marrow. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as the standard drug treatment for human CML, effectively reduced the expanded myeloid population in Tg(hsp70:p210(BCR/ABL1)) transgenic embryos. Moreover, we screened a library of 171 compounds and identified ten new drugs against BCR/ABL1 kinase-dependent or -independent pathways that could also reduce lcp1(+) myeloid cell numbers in Tg(hsp70:p210(BCR/ABL1)) transgenic embryos. In summary, we generated the first humanized zebrafish CML model that recapitulates many characteristics of human CML.

Therefore, it is mandatory to refine the characteristics of these cells to monitor their survival and develop adapted therapies. This is of particular interest in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), for which the 5-year survival rate only reaches 30%, regardless of the prognosis. The role of the microenvironment is increasingly reported to be a key regulator for blast survival. In this context, we demonstrate that contact with mesenchymal stromal cells promotes a better survival of blasts in culture in the presence of anthracycline through the activation of ABC transporters. Stroma-dependent ABC transporter activation leads to the induction of a Side Population (SP) phenotype in a subpopulation of primary leukemia blasts through alpha (alpha)4 engagement. The stroma-promoting effect is reversible and is observed with stromal cells isolated from either healthy donors or leukemia patients. Blasts expressing an SP phenotype are mostly quiescent and are chemoresistant in vitro and in vivo in patient-derived xenograft mouse models. At the transcriptomic level, blasts from the SP are specifically enriched in the drug metabolism program. This detoxification signature engaged in contact with mesenchymal stromal cells represents promising ways to target stroma-induced chemoresistance of AML cells.","['Boutin, Laetitia', 'Arnautou, Pierre', 'Trignol, Aurelie', 'Segot, Amandine', 'Farge, Thomas', 'Desterke, Christophe', 'Soave, Sabrina', 'Clay, Denis', 'Raffoux, Emmanuel', 'Sarry, Jean-Emmanuel', 'Malfuson, Jean-Valere', 'Lataillade, Jean-Jacques', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles, Marie-Caroline', 'Anginot, Adrienne']","['Boutin L', 'Arnautou P', 'Trignol A', 'Segot A', 'Farge T', 'Desterke C', 'Soave S', 'Clay D', 'Raffoux E', 'Sarry JE', 'Malfuson JV', 'Lataillade JJ', 'Le Bousse-Kerdiles MC', 'Anginot A']",,"['CTSA, IRBA, Clamart.', 'Inserm UMR-S-MD1197, Paul Brousse Hospital, Paris 11 University, Villejuif.', 'Hematology Department, HIA Percy, Clamart.', 'CTSA, IRBA, Clamart.', 'Hematology Department, HIA Percy, Clamart.', 'Inserm U1037, Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, University of Toulouse, Toulouse.', 'Inserm UMS33, Paul Brousse Hospital, Paris 11 University, Villejuif.', 'Inserm UMR-S-MD1197, Paul Brousse Hospital, Paris 11 University, Villejuif.', 'Inserm UMS33, Paul Brousse Hospital, Paris 11 University, Villejuif.', 'Adult Hematology Department, Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France.', 'Inserm U1037, Cancer Research Center of Toulouse, University of Toulouse, Toulouse.', 'Inserm UMR-S-MD1197, Paul Brousse Hospital, Paris 11 University, Villejuif.', 'Hematology Department, HIA Percy, Clamart.', 'CTSA, IRBA, Clamart.', 'Inserm UMR-S-MD1197, Paul Brousse Hospital, Paris 11 University, Villejuif.', 'Inserm UMR-S-MD1197, Paul Brousse Hospital, Paris 11 University, Villejuif.', 'Inserm UMR-S-MD1197, Paul Brousse Hospital, Paris 11 University, Villejuif adrienne.anginot@inserm.fr.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,['0 (ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters)'],IM,,"['ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters/genetics', 'Animals', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/genetics', '*Mesenchymal Stem Cells', 'Mice', 'Stromal Cells', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",PMC7109715,,,2019/07/11 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/07/11 06:00'],"['2018/12/14 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2018.214379 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2018.214379 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Apr;105(4):987-9998. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2018.214379.

Mortality was associated with high-risk cytogenetics (hazard ratio, 1.88; P=0.01) and high Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Comorbidity Index (score >/=4: hazard ratio, 1.99; P=0.01). High overall mutation burden (>/=10 mutations: hazard ratio, 3.4; P=0.02), and >/=4 mutated epigenetic regulatory genes (hazard ratio 5.4; P=0.003) were linked to relapse. Unsupervised clustering of the correlation matrix revealed distinct high-risk groups with unique associations of mutations and clinical features. CMML with a high mutation burden appeared to be distinct from high-risk groups defined by complex cytogenetics. New transplant strategies must be developed to target specific disease subgroups, stratified by molecular profiling and clinical risk factors.","['Woo, Janghee', 'Choi, Dae Ro', 'Storer, Barry E', 'Yeung, Cecilia', 'Halpern, Anna B', 'Salit, Rachel B', 'Sorror, Mohamed L', 'Woolston, David W', 'Monahan, Tim', 'Scott, Bart L', 'Deeg, H Joachim']","['Woo J', 'Choi DR', 'Storer BE', 'Yeung C', 'Halpern AB', 'Salit RB', 'Sorror ML', 'Woolston DW', 'Monahan T', 'Scott BL', 'Deeg HJ']",,"['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', 'Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center jdeeg@fredhutch.org.', 'University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Italy,Haematologica,Haematologica,0417435,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Cytogenetic Analysis', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation', 'Humans', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/diagnosis/genetics/therapy', '*Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Juvenile', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Young Adult']",PMC7049334,,,2019/07/11 06:00,2021/04/28 06:00,['2019/07/11 06:00'],"['2019/02/08 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/05 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2021/04/28 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']","['haematol.2019.218677 [pii]', '10.3324/haematol.2019.218677 [doi]']",ppublish,Haematologica. 2020 Mar;105(3):652-660. doi: 10.3324/haematol.2019.218677.

The aim of this study was to analyze apoptosis induced by knockdown of DGKZ and its mechanism in human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells. qRT-PCR was carried out to detect the expression of DGKZ in HL-60, THP-1, Jurkat, K562, and CD34 cell lines. Additionally the expression of DGKZ in AML cells obtained from patients were detected by qRT-PCR. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to determine the viability of HL-60 cells DGKZ knocked down. Apoptosis and cell cycle phase of HL-60 cells after DGKZ knockdown were evaluated by flow cytometry. Western blot analysis was performed to investigate expressions of the proteins related to apoptosis and cell cycle. Results showed that expression of DGKZ was significantly higher in HL-60 and AML cells obtained from patients than those of Jurkat, THP-1, K562 and human CD34 cell. Compared with the shCtrl group, DGKZ was markedly knocked down in HL-60 cells transfected with lentivirus encoding shRNA. DGKZ knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and induced cycle arrest at the G2/M phase in HL-60 cells. The expressions of MAPK, caspase-3, caspase-8, cytochrome C markedly increased and p-MAPK and survivin decreased in HL-60 cells after DGKZ knockdown. The results suggest that knockdown of DGKZ can induce apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest in human acute myeloid leukemia HL-60 cells through the MAPK/survivin/caspase pathway.","['Li, Hong', 'Dong, Changhu', 'Tian, Yanning', 'Li, Xiang', 'Wang, Bing', 'Zhai, Dongzhi', 'Bai, Yingying', 'Chao, Xu']","['Li H', 'Dong C', 'Tian Y', 'Li X', 'Wang B', 'Zhai D', 'Bai Y', 'Chao X']",,,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Pharmazie,Die Pharmazie,9800766,"['0 (RNA, Small Interfering)', '0 (Survivin)', 'EC 2.7.1.107 (DGKZ protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.1.107 (Diacylglycerol Kinase)', 'EC 3.4.22.- (Caspases)']",IM,,"['Apoptosis/*genetics', 'Caspases/metabolism', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/genetics', 'Diacylglycerol Kinase/*genetics', 'G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'Gene Knockdown Techniques', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'M Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints/genetics', 'MAP Kinase Signaling System/genetics', 'RNA, Small Interfering/genetics', 'Survivin/metabolism']",,,,2019/07/11 06:00,2020/05/19 06:00,['2019/07/11 06:00'],"['2019/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/05/19 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1691/ph.2019.9386 [doi]'],ppublish,Pharmazie. 2019 Jul 1;74(7):418-422. doi: 10.1691/ph.2019.9386.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The expression of this cluster consists of a complex mechanism involving DNA hub formation through DNA-CCTC binding factor (CTCF) interaction. Methylation alterations can affect this interaction, leading to transcriptional dysregulation. In cancer, clustered PCDHs undergo a mechanism of long-range epigenetic silencing by hypermethylation. RESULTS: In this study, we detected frequent methylation alterations at CpG islands associated to these clustered PCDHs in all the solid tumours analysed (colorectal, gastric and biliary tract cancers, pilocytic astrocytoma), but not hematologic neoplasms such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Importantly, several altered CpG islands were associated with CTCF binding sites. Interestingly, our analysis revealed a hypomethylation event in pilocytic astrocytoma, suggesting that in neuronal tissue, where PCDHs are highly expressed, these genes become hypomethylated in this type of cancer. On the other hand, in tissues where PCDHs are lowly expressed, these CpG islands are targeted by DNA methylation. In fact, PCDH-associated CpG islands resulted hypermethylated in gastrointestinal tumours. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlighted a strong alteration of the clustered PCDHs methylation pattern in the analysed solid cancers and suggested these methylation aberrations in the CpG islands associated with PCDH genes as powerful diagnostic biomarkers.","['Vega-Benedetti, Ana Florencia', 'Loi, Eleonora', 'Moi, Loredana', 'Blois, Sylvain', 'Fadda, Antonio', 'Antonelli, Manila', 'Arcella, Antonella', 'Badiali, Manuela', 'Giangaspero, Felice', 'Morra, Isabella', 'Columbano, Amedeo', 'Restivo, Angelo', 'Zorcolo, Luigi', 'Gismondi, Viviana', 'Varesco, Liliana', 'Bellomo, Sara Erika', 'Giordano, Silvia', 'Canale, Matteo', 'Casadei-Gardini, Andrea', 'Faloppi, Luca', 'Puzzoni, Marco', 'Scartozzi, Mario', 'Ziranu, Pina', 'Cabras, Giuseppina', 'Cocco, Pierluigi', 'Ennas, Maria Grazia', 'Satta, Giannina', 'Zucca, Mariagrazia', 'Canzio, Daniele', 'Zavattari, Patrizia']","['Vega-Benedetti AF', 'Loi E', 'Moi L', 'Blois S', 'Fadda A', 'Antonelli M', 'Arcella A', 'Badiali M', 'Giangaspero F', 'Morra I', 'Columbano A', 'Restivo A', 'Zorcolo L', 'Gismondi V', 'Varesco L', 'Bellomo SE', 'Giordano S', 'Canale M', 'Casadei-Gardini A', 'Faloppi L', 'Puzzoni M', 'Scartozzi M', 'Ziranu P', 'Cabras G', 'Cocco P', 'Ennas MG', 'Satta G', 'Zucca M', 'Canzio D', 'Zavattari P']",['ORCID: 0000-0002-0481-092X'],"['Department of Biomedical Sciences, Unit of Biology and Genetics, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Unit of Biology and Genetics, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Unit of Biology and Genetics, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Unit of Biology and Genetics, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Biomedical Sciences, Unit of Biology and Genetics, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy.', 'Department of Radiological, Oncological and Anatomo-Pathological Sciences, University Sapienza of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Italy.', ""Genetic and Genomic Laboratory, Microcitemico Children's Hospital, Cagliari, Italy."", 'Department of Radiological, Oncological and Anatomo-Pathological Sciences, University Sapienza of Rome, Rome, Italy.', 'IRCCS Neuromed, Pozzilli, Italy.', 'Department of Pathology OIRM-S, Anna Hospital, A.O.U.

However, the incidence of secondary tumors increases every year after the diagnosis of chronic lymphotcytic leukemia. One of the induced secondary tumors is prostate cancer. For high-risk prostate cancer in particular, the standard therapy is radical prostatectomy and extended lymphadenectomy, which carries high risks of lymphatic leakage and reduced quality of life. Currently, there has been no study reporting the necessity of extended lymphadenectomy for high-risk prostate cancer in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported two cases with concomitant high-risk prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The first patient was a 60-year-old male diagnosed with synchronous prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The second patient was a 70-year-old male initially presented with chronic lymphocytic leukemia alone but was then diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer nine years later. Both patients received neoadjuvant androgen deprivation therapy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. The first patient underwent extended lymphadenectomy and developed prolonged postoperative lymphatic cyst. Histology showed chronic lymphocytic leukemia infiltration in resected lymph nodes. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels at one and 13 months post-operation were both 0.01 ng/ml. The second patient received positron emission tomography/computed tomography before androgen deprivation therapy, which showed mild fluorodeoxyglucose-avidity in lymph nodes across the entire body. Lymph node biopsy showed only chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The patient experienced no postoperative complication. Serum prostate-specific antigen levels at one and nine months post-operation were both 0.02 ng/ml. CONCLUSIONS: Extended lymphadenectomy may not be necessary for patients with concomitant high-risk prostate cancer and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but such patients must undergo thorough preoperative assessment and mindful postoperative follow-up. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography may be valuable in detecting nodal metastases. A lymph node biopsy is necessary for patients with an ambiguous positron emission tomography/computed tomography in the metastatic involvement of lymph node.","['Zhu, Yinjie', 'Wang, Yanqing', 'Qian, Zhiyu', 'Pan, Jiahua', 'Liu, Qiang', 'Dong, Baijun', 'Xue, Wei']","['Zhu Y', 'Wang Y', 'Qian Z', 'Pan J', 'Liu Q', 'Dong B', 'Xue W']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1926-3746'],"[""Department of Urology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Pudong District, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", ""Department of Urology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Pudong District, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", 'David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA.', ""Department of Urology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Pudong District, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China."", 'Department of Pathology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China.', ""Department of Urology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Pudong District, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China. dongbaijun@163.com."", ""Department of Urology, Renji Hospital, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 1630 Dongfang Road, Pudong District, Shanghai, 200127, People's Republic of China. uroxuewei@163.com.""]",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,BMC Cancer,BMC cancer,100967800,"['0 (Androgen Antagonists)', 'EC 3.4.21.77 (Prostate-Specific Antigen)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Androgen Antagonists/therapeutic use', 'Biopsy', 'Drainage', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*surgery', 'Lymph Node Excision/*adverse effects', 'Lymph Nodes/diagnostic imaging/pathology', 'Lymphatic Metastasis/diagnostic imaging', 'Lymphocele/etiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoadjuvant Therapy', 'Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography', 'Postoperative Care', 'Postoperative Complications', 'Prostate-Specific Antigen/blood', '*Prostatectomy', 'Prostatic Neoplasms/*secondary/*surgery', 'Quality of Life', 'Robotic Surgical Procedures', 'Treatment Outcome']",PMC6617590,['NOTNLM'],"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia', 'Lymphadenectomy', 'Positron emission tomography/computed tomography', 'Prostate neoplasms']",2019/07/11 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/11 06:00'],"['2018/08/20 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s12885-019-5876-x [doi]', '10.1186/s12885-019-5876-x [pii]']",epublish,BMC Cancer. 2019 Jul 9;19(1):676. doi: 10.1186/s12885-019-5876-x.,,20190709,,"['81572536/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81672850/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '81772742/National Natural Science Foundation of China', '14140901700/Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality', '16411969800/Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality', '19XD1402300/Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality', '19YF1428400/Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality', 'SHDC12015125/the Joint Research Foundation for Innovative Medical Technology of', 'Shanghai Shenkang Hospital Development Center', '15ZZ058/Shanghai Municipal Education Commission', '201640247/Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning (CN)', '20152215/Shanghai Municipal Education Commission-Gaofeng Clinical Medicine Grant', 'Support', 'PWZxq2014-05/Key Disciplines Group Construction Project of Pudong Health Bureau', 'of Shanghai', '15ZH4002/Innovation Fund for Translational Research of Shanghai Jiao Tong', 'University School of Medicine', 'PYZY 16-008/Incubating Program for clinical Research and Innovation of Renji', 'Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine', 'PYXJS16-015/Incubating Program for clinical Research and Innovation of Renji', 'Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine', 'PYII-17-005/Incubating Program for clinical Research and Innovation of Renji', 'Hospital Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We demonstrate that many MLL3 variant calls made by exome sequencing are false positives due to misalignment to homologous regions, including a region on chr21, and can only be validated by long-range PCR. Numerous other recurrently mutated genes reported in COSMIC and TCGA databases have pseudogenes and cannot also be validated by conventional short read-based sequencing approaches. Genome-wide identification of pseudogene regions demonstrates that frequency of these homologous regions is increased with sequencing read lengths below 200 bps. To enable identification of poor quality sequencing variants in prospective studies, we generated novel genome-wide maps of regions with poor mappability that can be used in variant calling algorithms. Taken together, our findings reveal that pseudogene regions are a source of false-positive mutations in cancers.","['Bowler, Timothy G', 'Pradhan, Kith', 'Kong, Yu', 'Bartenstein, Matthias', 'Morrone, Kerry A', 'Sridharan, Ashwin', 'Kessel, Rachel M', 'Shastri, Aditi', 'Giricz, Orsi', 'Bhagat, Tushar D', 'Gordon-Mitchell, Shanisha', 'Rohanizadegan, Mersedeh', 'Hooda, Lauren', 'Datt, Ishan', 'Przychodzen, Bartlomiej P', 'Parmar, Simrit', 'Maqbool, Shahina', 'Maciejewski, Jaroslaw P', 'Steidl, Ulrich', 'Greally, John M', 'Verma, Amit']","['Bowler TG', 'Pradhan K', 'Kong Y', 'Bartenstein M', 'Morrone KA', 'Sridharan A', 'Kessel RM', 'Shastri A', 'Giricz O', 'Bhagat TD', 'Gordon-Mitchell S', 'Rohanizadegan M', 'Hooda L', 'Datt I', 'Przychodzen BP', 'Parmar S', 'Maqbool S', 'Maciejewski JP', 'Steidl U', 'Greally JM', 'Verma A']",['ORCID: 0000-0001-7592-7693'],"['Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', 'Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Leuk Lymphoma,Leukemia & lymphoma,9007422,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (KMT2C protein, human)']",IM,,"['Algorithms', 'Chromosome Mapping/methods', 'DNA Mutational Analysis/*statistics & numerical data', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Databases, Genetic/*statistics & numerical data', 'Exons/genetics', 'False Positive Reactions', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Pseudogenes/genetics', '*Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Whole Exome Sequencing/statistics & numerical data']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*MLL3', '*pseudogenes']",2019/07/11 06:00,2020/09/10 06:00,['2019/07/11 06:00'],"['2019/07/11 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/10 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/11 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/10428194.2019.1630620 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Lymphoma. 2019 Dec;60(13):3132-3137. doi: 10.1080/10428194.2019.1630620.

TAMs are activated by an abnormal malignant microenvironment, polarizing into a specific phenotype and participating in tumor progression. TAMs that exist in the microenvironment of different types of leukemia are called leukemia-associated macrophages (LAMs), which are reported to be associated with the progression of leukemia. This review describes the role of LAMs in different leukemia subtypes.","['Li, Yueyang', 'You, M James', 'Yang, Yaling', 'Hu, Dongzhi', 'Tian, Chen']","['Li Y', 'You MJ', 'Yang Y', 'Hu D', 'Tian C']",,"['Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematopathology, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China.', 'Department of Hematology, Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, National Clinical Research Center for Cancer, Key Laboratory of Cancer Prevention and Therapy, Tianjin, China, tcgirl2001@sina.com.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Switzerland,Acta Haematol,Acta haematologica,0141053,,IM,,"['Disease Progression', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology/immunology/*metabolism', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/pathology', 'Tumor Microenvironment']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Leukemia-associated macrophages', '*Leukemic cell growth', '*Nurse-like cells', '*Polarization', '*Tumor-associated macrophages']",2019/07/10 06:00,2020/04/24 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/01/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/04/10 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/24 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['000500315 [pii]', '10.1159/000500315 [doi]']",ppublish,Acta Haematol. 2020;143(2):112-117. doi: 10.1159/000500315.

In support of this supposition, a large number of studies have shown protective effects of antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) against cadmium induced cytotoxicity. Here, we describe the cytotoxic effects of Cd(2+) on human leukemia U937 and K562 cells that were not mediated by oxidative stress. Surprisingly, we observed that addition of low concentrations of NAC can drastically potentiate cadmium cytotoxicity solely via ROS production. However, all adverse effects of the metal were prevented by NAC at high concentrations. Detailed analysis indicated that the protective effect of NAC was mediated by its ability to form stable complex with cadmium [Cd(NAC)2]. In conclusion, NAC exhibits dual and antagonistic effects on Cd(2+) cytotoxicity in human leukemia cells.","['Mlejnek, P', 'Dolezel, P', 'Maier, V', 'Kikalova, K', 'Skoupa, N']","['Mlejnek P', 'Dolezel P', 'Maier V', 'Kikalova K', 'Skoupa N']",,"['Department of Anatomy, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacky University Olomouc, Hnevotinska 3, Olomouc 77515, Czech Republic.

PR has also been used in multiple protocols to detect cellular hydrogen peroxide as well as peroxidase activity from human peroxidase enzymes. The majority of promyelocytic leukemia cell lines (e.g. HL-60cells) express myeloperoxidase (MPO), which may react with PR, especially as the latter is present in cell culture media at sufficient concentrations (~15muM) to partake in redox reactions. Moreover, phenolic molecules are often efficient donor substrates for peroxidase enzymes. In this study, we hypothesized that MPO metabolism of PR via MPO-expressing HL-60cells could result in PR metabolite(s) that could modulate cell viability. We used purified human MPO for UV-visible spectrophotometry, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and LC-MS analyses to investigate PR peroxidation. 2-chloro-5,5-dimethyl-1,3-cyclohexanedione (monochloro-dimedone, MCD) was used to assess the effect of PR on MPO-catalyzed chlorination activity, and we assessed PR uptake by HL-60cells using LC-MS analysis. Lastly, we investigated the impact of PR metabolism by intracellular MPO on cell viability (ATP, using CellTiter-Glo((R))), cytotoxicity (using trypan blue), and on reduced and oxidized glutathione (using GSH/GSSG-Glo). Our results demonstrate that PR undergoes oxidative halogenation via MPO, resulting in its UV-vis spectral changes due to the formation of mono- and di-halogenated products. Moreover, a significant increase in MPO-catalyzed chlorination of MCD and an increase in glutathionyl radical detection (using EPR) were observed in the presence of PR. Our in-vitro studies revealed that PR is readily taken up by HL-60cells and its metabolism by intracellular MPO leads to a significant decrease in cellular glutathione as well as a significant increase in glutathione disulphide formation. In spite of the latter, PR had no considerable effect on HL-60cell viability. These results provide evidence that while no overt decrease in cell viability may be observed, PR does impart redox activity, which investigators should be wary of in experimental protocols.","['Morgan, Andrew', 'Babu, Dinesh', 'Reiz, Bela', 'Whittal, Randy', 'Suh, Lindsey Y K', 'Siraki, Arno G']","['Morgan A', 'Babu D', 'Reiz B', 'Whittal R', 'Suh LYK', 'Siraki AG']",,"['Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.', 'Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada.

Mubritinib, a known ERBB2 inhibitor, elicited strong anti-leukemic effects in vitro and in vivo. In the context of AML, mubritinib functions through ubiquinone-dependent inhibition of electron transport chain (ETC) complex I activity. Resistance to mubritinib characterized normal CD34(+) hematopoietic cells and chemotherapy-sensitive AMLs, which displayed transcriptomic hallmarks of hypoxia. Conversely, sensitivity correlated with mitochondrial function-related gene expression levels and characterized a large subset of chemotherapy-resistant AMLs with oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) hyperactivity. Altogether, our work thus identifies an ETC complex I inhibitor and reveals the genetic landscape of OXPHOS dependency in AML.","['Baccelli, Irene', 'Gareau, Yves', 'Lehnertz, Bernhard', 'Gingras, Stephane', 'Spinella, Jean-Francois', 'Corneau, Sophie', 'Mayotte, Nadine', 'Girard, Simon', 'Frechette, Melanie', 'Blouin-Chagnon, Valerie', 'Leveille, Koryne', 'Boivin, Isabel', 'MacRae, Tara', 'Krosl, Jana', 'Thiollier, Clarisse', 'Lavallee, Vincent-Philippe', 'Kanshin, Evgeny', 'Bertomeu, Thierry', 'Coulombe-Huntington, Jasmin', 'St-Denis, Corinne', 'Bordeleau, Marie-Eve', 'Boucher, Genevieve', 'Roux, Philippe P', 'Lemieux, Sebastien', 'Tyers, Mike', 'Thibault, Pierre', 'Hebert, Josee', 'Marinier, Anne', 'Sauvageau, Guy']","['Baccelli I', 'Gareau Y', 'Lehnertz B', 'Gingras S', 'Spinella JF', 'Corneau S', 'Mayotte N', 'Girard S', 'Frechette M', 'Blouin-Chagnon V', 'Leveille K', 'Boivin I', 'MacRae T', 'Krosl J', 'Thiollier C', 'Lavallee VP', 'Kanshin E', 'Bertomeu T', 'Coulombe-Huntington J', 'St-Denis C', 'Bordeleau ME', 'Boucher G', 'Roux PP', 'Lemieux S', 'Tyers M', 'Thibault P', 'Hebert J', 'Marinier A', 'Sauvageau G']",,"['The Leucegene Project at Institute for Research in Immunology (IRIC) and Cancer, Universite de Montreal, 2950 Chemin de Polytechnique Pavillon, Marcelle-Coutu, Montreal, QC H3T 1J4, Canada.

The aim of this study was to compare the cardiorespiratory fitness and physical activity levels of survivors and control participants. Methods: A total of 221 childhood ALL survivors (114 males and 107 females), diagnosed between 1987 and 2010 and treated according to Dana Farber Cancer Institute-ALL 87-01 to 05-01 protocols at Sainte-Justine University Health Center (SJUHC), Montreal (Canada), and 825 control participants (364 males and 461 females), recruited in the Canadian Health Measures Survey (cycle 2) during 2009 to 2011 by Statistics Canada, were included in our analyses. In both survivors and controls, cardiorespiratory fitness and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were assessed. Results: Survivors' VO2 peak was found to be 22% lower than that of controls. Cardiorespiratory fitness was different between the survivors (32.4 +/- 8.3 mL/(kg.min); beta = 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07-0.14) and the controls (41.6 +/- 9.4 mL/(kg.min); beta = 0.16; 95% CI 0.13-0.18), despite a clinically equivalent level of MVPA [survivors (27.5 +/- 27.4 min/day) and controls (33.4 +/- 24.2 min/day)]. Status (being survivor) and the age of the participants were negatively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness, whereas MVPA and male gender were positively associated with cardiorespiratory fitness. Conclusion: We observed that for a clinically equivalent level of MVPA, cardiorespiratory fitness was significantly lower in survivors compared with controls. Our findings showed that female survivors were most affected, compared with male survivors. These findings allow further understanding of the physiological differences between childhood ALL survivors and control participants and have important implications for this high-risk population of survivors.","['Caru, Maxime', 'Samoilenko, Mariia', 'Drouin, Simon', 'Lemay, Valerie', 'Kern, Laurence', 'Romo, Lucia', 'Bertout, Laurence', 'Lefebvre, Genevieve', 'Andelfinger, Gregor', 'Krajinovic, Maja', 'Laverdiere, Caroline', 'Sinnett, Daniel', 'Curnier, Daniel']","['Caru M', 'Samoilenko M', 'Drouin S', 'Lemay V', 'Kern L', 'Romo L', 'Bertout L', 'Lefebvre G', 'Andelfinger G', 'Krajinovic M', 'Laverdiere C', 'Sinnett D', 'Curnier D']",,"['Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratoire EA 4430-Clinique Psychanalyse Developpement (CliPsyD), University of Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Mathematics, Universite du Quebec a Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratoire EA 4430-Clinique Psychanalyse Developpement (CliPsyD), University of Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France.', 'Laboratoire EA 4430-Clinique Psychanalyse Developpement (CliPsyD), University of Paris Nanterre, Nanterre, France.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.', 'Department of Pediatrics, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Laboratory of Pathophysiology of EXercise (LPEX), School of Kinesiology and Physical Activity Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, University of Montreal, Montreal, Canada.', 'Sainte-Justine University Health Center, Research Center, Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,101543508,,IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Canada/epidemiology', 'Cancer Survivors/*statistics & numerical data', '*Cardiorespiratory Fitness', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', '*Exercise Therapy', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/physiopathology/*rehabilitation', 'Prognosis', 'Survival Rate', 'Young Adult']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*acute lymphoblastic leukemia', '*cardiorespiratory fitness', '*cardiovascular health', '*healthy subjects', '*pediatric cancer survivorship', '*physical activity']",2019/07/10 06:00,2020/07/01 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/07/01 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/jayao.2019.0024 [doi]'],ppublish,J Adolesc Young Adult Oncol. 2019 Dec;8(6):674-683. doi: 10.1089/jayao.2019.0024.

The detection of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor gene rearrangements by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for this evaluation. However, more accessible methods also show satisfactory performance. This study aimed to compare MRD analysis by four-color flow cytometry (FC) and qualitative standard PCR on days 35 and 78 of chemotherapy and to correlate these data with patients' clinical characteristics. Forty-two children with a recent diagnosis of ALL, admitted to a public hospital in Brazil for treatment in accordance with the Brazilian Childhood Cooperative Group for ALL Treatment (GBTLI LLA-2009), were included. Bone marrow samples collected at diagnosis and on days 35 and 78 of treatment were analyzed for the immunophenotypic characterization of blasts by FC and for the detection of clonal rearrangements by standard PCR. Paired analyses were performed in 61/68 (89.7%) follow-up samples, with a general agreement of 88.5%. Disagreements were resolved by RT-PCR, which evidenced one false-negative and four false-positive results in FC, as well as two false-negative results in PCR. Among the prognostic factors, a significant association was found only between T-cell lineage and MRD by standard PCR. These results show that FC and standard PCR produce similar results in MRD detection of childhood ALL and that both methodologies may be useful in the monitoring of disease treatment, especially in regions with limited financial resources.","['Rocha, Juliana Maria Camargos', 'Xavier, Sandra Guerra', 'Souza, Marcelo Eduardo de Lima', 'Murao, Mitiko', 'de Oliveira, Benigna Maria']","['Rocha JMC', 'Xavier SG', 'Souza MEL', 'Murao M', 'de Oliveira BM']",['ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0001-8573-6313'],"['Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) , Belo Horizonte , MG , Brazil.', 'Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) , Belo Horizonte , MG , Brazil.', 'Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) , Belo Horizonte , MG , Brazil.', 'Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) , Belo Horizonte , MG , Brazil.', 'Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG) , Belo Horizonte , MG , Brazil.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study']",England,Pediatr Hematol Oncol,Pediatric hematology and oncology,8700164,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasm, Residual', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/drug therapy/genetics', '*Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/blood/genetics']",,['NOTNLM'],"['Acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'IG/TR gene rearrangements', 'flow cytometry', 'minimal residual disease', 'polymerase chain reaction']",2019/07/10 06:00,2019/12/18 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/12/18 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/08880018.2019.1636168 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 2019 Aug;36(5):287-301. doi: 10.1080/08880018.2019.1636168.

Such a cytotoxicity depends on various receptors. Killer immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) belong to these receptors and are involved in maturation process, then in the activation abilities of NK cells. METHODS: We investigated the prognostic impact of the KIR2DL5B genotype in 240 CML patients included in two clinical trials investigating tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) discontinuation: STIM and STIM2. RESULTS: After adjustment for standard risk factors in CML, we found that the inhibitory receptor KIR2DL5B-positive genotype was independently related to a delayed second deep molecular remission (HR 0.54, 95% CI [0.32-0.91], P = 0.02) after TKI rechallenge but not to time to first deep molecular remission or treatment-free remission rates. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that KIR2DL5B could carry a role in lymphocyte-mediated control of leukemic residual disease control in patient with CML relapse.","['Dumas, Pierre-Yves', 'Berard, Emilie', 'Breal, Claire', 'Dulucq, Stephanie', 'Rea, Delphine', 'Nicolini, Franck', 'Forcade, Edouard', 'Dufossee, Melody', 'Pasquet, Jean-Max', 'Turcq, Beatrice', 'Bidet, Audrey', 'Milpied, Noel', 'Dechanet-Merville, Julie', 'Lafarge, Xavier', 'Etienne, Gabriel', 'Mahon, Francois-Xavier']","['Dumas PY', 'Berard E', 'Breal C', 'Dulucq S', 'Rea D', 'Nicolini F', 'Forcade E', 'Dufossee M', 'Pasquet JM', 'Turcq B', 'Bidet A', 'Milpied N', 'Dechanet-Merville J', 'Lafarge X', 'Etienne G', 'Mahon FX']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0119-3548', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5379-7461']","[""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Bordeaux, F-33000, Bordeaux, France."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1035, Bordeaux, France.', ""Service d'Epidemiologie, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Toulouse, Toulouse, France."", 'UMR 1027, INSERM-Universite de Toulouse III, Toulouse, France.', ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Bordeaux, F-33000, Bordeaux, France."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1035, Bordeaux, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Bordeaux, F-33000, Bordeaux, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie and INSERM U590, CRCL, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Bordeaux, F-33000, Bordeaux, France."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1035, Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1035, Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1218, Bordeaux, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Hematologie, CHU Bordeaux, F-33000, Bordeaux, France."", ""Service d'Hematologie Clinique et Therapie Cellulaire, CHU Bordeaux, F-33000, Bordeaux, France."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1035, Bordeaux, France.', 'Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, ImmunoConcEpT, UMR 5164, Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1035, Bordeaux, France.', ""Laboratoire d'Immunogenetique, Etablissement Francais du Sang, Bordeaux, France."", 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1218, Bordeaux, France.', 'Centre de Lutte contre le Cancer, Institute Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.', 'Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale INSERM U1218, Bordeaux, France.', 'Centre de Lutte contre le Cancer, Institute Bergonie, Bordeaux, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Med,Cancer medicine,101595310,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (KIR2DL5B protein, human)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (Receptors, KIR)', '0 (Receptors, KIR2DL5)', '8A1O1M485B (Imatinib Mesylate)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers', 'Female', '*Genetic Variation', '*Genotype', 'Haplotypes', 'Humans', 'Imatinib Mesylate/therapeutic use', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors/therapeutic use', 'Receptors, KIR/*genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, KIR2DL5/genetics', 'Remission Induction', 'Treatment Outcome', 'Withholding Treatment']",PMC6718597,['NOTNLM'],"['chronic myeloid leukemia', 'imatinib', 'killer immunoglobulin-like receptors', 'natural killer', 'treatment-free remission']",2019/07/10 06:00,2020/09/04 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/05/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/12 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/09/04 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cam4.2371 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Med. 2019 Sep;8(11):4976-4985. doi: 10.1002/cam4.2371.

Recently, functional assays such as high-content screening together with genomic analysis have been shown to be effective for predicting drug susceptibility, but their clinical applicability is poor since they are time-consuming (several days long), labor-intensive, and costly. Here we present a highly simple, rapid, and cost-effective liquid biopsy for ex vivo drug-susceptibility testing of leukemia. The method is based on an extreme-throughput (>1 million cells per second), label-free, whole-blood imaging flow cytometer with a deep convolutional autoencoder, enabling image-based identification of the drug susceptibility of every single white blood cell in whole blood within 24 hours by simply flowing a drug-treated whole blood sample as little as 500 muL into the imaging flow cytometer without labeling. Our results show that the method accurately evaluates the drug susceptibility of white blood cells from untreated patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our method holds promise for affordable precision medicine.","['Kobayashi, Hirofumi', 'Lei, Cheng', 'Wu, Yi', 'Huang, Chun-Jung', 'Yasumoto, Atsushi', 'Jona, Masahiro', 'Li, Wenxuan', 'Wu, Yunzhao', 'Yalikun, Yaxiaer', 'Jiang, Yiyue', 'Guo, Baoshan', 'Sun, Chia-Wei', 'Tanaka, Yo', 'Yamada, Makoto', 'Yatomi, Yutaka', 'Goda, Keisuke']","['Kobayashi H', 'Lei C', 'Wu Y', 'Huang CJ', 'Yasumoto A', 'Jona M', 'Li W', 'Wu Y', 'Yalikun Y', 'Jiang Y', 'Guo B', 'Sun CW', 'Tanaka Y', 'Yamada M', 'Yatomi Y', 'Goda K']",,"['Department of Chemistry, University of Tokyo, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan. leicheng@chem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp goda@chem.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Lab Chip,Lab on a chip,101128948,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,,"['Adult', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Child', 'Doxorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Female', '*Flow Cytometry/economics', 'Humans', 'K562 Cells', 'Leukocytes/drug effects/pathology', 'Male', 'Optical Imaging', 'Precision Medicine', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/*drug therapy/pathology']",,,,2019/07/10 06:00,2020/06/23 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/23 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1039/c8lc01370e [doi]'],ppublish,Lab Chip. 2019 Aug 6;19(16):2688-2698. doi: 10.1039/c8lc01370e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FLT3(ITD) triggers the proliferation of the quiescent hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) pool but fails to directly transform HSCs. While the inflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T-cells 2 (NFAT2, NFATC1) is overexpressed in AML, it is unknown whether it plays a role in FLT3(ITD)-induced HSC transformation. METHODS: We generated a triple transgenic mouse model, in which tamoxifen-inducible Cre-recombinase targets expression of a constitutively nuclear transcription factor NFATC1 to FLT3(ITD) positive HSC. Emerging genotypes were phenotypically, biochemically, and also transcriptionally characterized using RNA sequencing. We also retrospectively analyzed the overall survival of AML patients with different NFATC1 expression status. RESULTS: We find that NFATC1 governs FLT3(ITD)-driven precursor cell expansion and transformation, causing a fully penetrant lethal AML. FLT3(ITD)/NFATC1-AML is re-transplantable in secondary recipients and shows primary resistance to the FLT3(ITD)-kinase inhibitor quizartinib. Mechanistically, NFATC1 rewires FLT3(ITD)-dependent signaling output in HSC, involving augmented K-RAS signaling and a selective de novo recruitment of key HSC-transforming signaling pathways such as the Hedgehog- and WNT/B-Catenin signaling pathways. In human AML, NFATC1 overexpression is associated with poor overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: NFATC1 expression causes FLT3(ITD)-induced transcriptome changes, which are associated with HSC transformation, quizartinib resistance, and a poor prognosis in AML.","['Solovey, Maria', 'Wang, Ying', 'Michel, Christian', 'Metzeler, Klaus H', 'Herold, Tobias', 'Gothert, Joachim R', 'Ellenrieder, Volker', 'Hessmann, Elisabeth', 'Gattenlohner, Stefan', 'Neubauer, Andreas', 'Pavlinic, Dinko', 'Benes, Vladimir', 'Rupp, Oliver', 'Burchert, Andreas']","['Solovey M', 'Wang Y', 'Michel C', 'Metzeler KH', 'Herold T', 'Gothert JR', 'Ellenrieder V', 'Hessmann E', 'Gattenlohner S', 'Neubauer A', 'Pavlinic D', 'Benes V', 'Rupp O', 'Burchert A']",,"['Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Marburg, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Marburg, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Marburg, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Laboratory for Leukemia Diagnostics, Department of Medicine III, University Hospital, LMU Munich, Munich, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, University Hospital Essen, Essen, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Department of Gastroenterology, University Hospital Goettingen, Goettingen, Germany.', 'Institute of Pathology, Justus-Liebig-University, Giessen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Marburg, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg, Germany.', 'Genomics Core Facility, EMBL Heidelberg , Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Genomics Core Facility, EMBL Heidelberg , Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Bioinformatics and Systems Biology, University Giessen, Giessen, Germany.', 'Department of Hematology, Oncology and Immunology, University Hospital Giessen and Marburg, Campus Marburg, Philipps University Marburg, Marburg, Germany. burchert@staff.uni-marburg.de.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Hematol Oncol,Journal of hematology & oncology,101468937,"['0 (NFATC Transcription Factors)', '0 (Nfatc1 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Flt3 protein, mouse)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/metabolism/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'NFATC Transcription Factors/*metabolism', 'Prognosis', 'fms-Like Tyrosine Kinase 3/*metabolism']",PMC6615262,['NOTNLM'],"['*Acute myeloid leukemia', '*Drug resistance', '*FLT3ITD', '*Hematopoietic stem cells', '*NFATC1']",2019/07/10 06:00,2020/06/17 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/06/30 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/06/17 06:00 [medline]']","['10.1186/s13045-019-0765-y [doi]', '10.1186/s13045-019-0765-y [pii]']",epublish,J Hematol Oncol. 2019 Jul 8;12(1):72. doi: 10.1186/s13045-019-0765-y.,,20190708,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Illness cognition refers to persistent positive or negative thoughts an individual has towards illness. Evidence has shown that patients with chronic conditions who possess negative illness cognitions experience greater social, emotional, and physical difficulties than patients with positive illness cognitions. This study aims to measure the prevalence of health anxiety in a population of parents of children with cancer, and investigate the association between positive and negative illness cognitions and health anxiety. Methods: We interviewed 105 parents of children with cancer and administered Arabic versions of the Illness Cognition Questionnaire - Parent Version and the Short Health Anxiety Inventory. Results: The mean parental age was 37.7 years with the majority of participants being mothers (78.1%) and married (94.3%) and with 35.2% having completed university education. The average age of the child with cancer was 8.4 years, with the largest proportion of children suffering from leukemia. The prevalence of health anxiety among parents of children with cancer was 21%. The following two dimensions of illness cognition were significantly associated with health anxiety: Helplessness (B = 0.222, p = 0.021) and lower Acceptance (B = -0.242, p = 0.008). Other variables associated with health anxiety were perceived inadequate income (B = -0.238, p = 0.021) and personal illness or illness of a family member/close friend (B = 0.251, p = 0.013). Conclusions: Parents of children with cancer may experience health anxiety. Predictors of health anxiety include feelings of helplessness, lower acceptance, inadequate income, and extended family illnesses.","['Bilani, Nadeem', 'Jamali, Sarah', 'Chahine, Anastasia', 'Zorkot, Maya', 'Homsi, Mouafak', 'Saab, Michael', 'Saab, Raya', 'Nabulsi, Mona', 'Chaaya, Monique']","['Bilani N', 'Jamali S', 'Chahine A', 'Zorkot M', 'Homsi M', 'Saab M', 'Saab R', 'Nabulsi M', 'Chaaya M']","['ORCID: 0000-0001-7618-1520', 'ORCID: 0000-0001-5776-2303', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-2695-8079']","['Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut , Beirut , Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut , Beirut , Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut , Beirut , Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut , Beirut , Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut , Beirut , Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut , Beirut , Lebanon.', 'Faculty of Medicine, American University of Beirut , Beirut , Lebanon.', 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut , Beirut , Lebanon.', ""Lebanon Children's Cancer Center of Lebanon, American University of Beirut , Beirut , Lebanon."", 'Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, American University of Beirut , Beirut , Lebanon.', 'Department of Epidemiology and Population Health, American University of Beirut , Beirut , Lebanon.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Psychosoc Oncol,Journal of psychosocial oncology,8309337,,IM,,"['Adult', 'Anxiety/*psychology', '*Attitude to Health', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*psychology/therapy', 'Parents/*psychology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*Cancer', '*health anxiety', '*hypochondriasis', '*illness cognition', '*oncology', '*parents', '*pediatrics']",2019/07/10 06:00,2020/02/25 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/07347332.2019.1600629 [doi]'],ppublish,J Psychosoc Oncol. 2019 Nov-Dec;37(6):713-728. doi: 10.1080/07347332.2019.1600629.

Genome-wide association studies, followed by functional studies, have identified a role for numerous autophagy genes in IBD, especially in Crohn disease. Studies using in vitro and in vivo models, in addition to human clinical studies have revealed that autophagy is pivotal for intestinal homeostasis maintenance, gut ecology regulation, appropriate intestinal immune responses and anti-microbial protection. This review describes the latest researches on the mechanisms by which dysfunctional autophagy leads to disrupted intestinal epithelial function, gut dysbiosis, defect in anti-microbial peptide secretion by Paneth cells, endoplasmic reticulum stress response and aberrant immune responses to pathogenic bacteria. A better understanding of the role of autophagy in IBD pathogenesis may provide better sub-classification of IBD phenotypes and novel approaches for disease management.Abbreviations: AIEC: adherent-invasive Escherichia coli; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ATF6: activating transcription factor 6; ATG: autophagy related; Atg16l1[DeltaIEC] mice: mice with Atg16l1 depletion specifically in intestinal epithelial cells; Atg16l1[HM] mice: mice hypomorphic for Atg16l1 expression; BCL2: B cell leukemia/lymphoma 2; BECN1: beclin 1, autophagy related; CALCOCO2: calcium binding and coiled-coil domain 2; CASP: caspase; CD: Crohn disease; CGAS: cyclic GMP-AMP synthase; CHUK/IKKA: conserved helix-loop-helix ubiquitous kinase; CLDN2: claudin 2; DAPK1: death associated protein kinase 1; DCs: dendritic cells; DSS: dextran sulfate sodium; EIF2A: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A; EIF2AK: eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase; ER: endoplasmic reticulum; ERBIN: Erbb2 interacting protein; ERN1/IRE1A: ER to nucleus signaling 1; FNBP1L: formin binding protein 1-like; FOXP3: forkhead box P3; GPR65: G-protein coupled receptor 65; GSK3B: glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; IBD: inflammatory bowel disease; IECs: intestinal epithelial cells; IFN: interferon; IL: interleukin; IL10R: interleukin 10 receptor; IRGM: immunity related GTPase M; ISC: intestinal stem cell; LAMP1: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1; LAP: LC3-associated phagocytosis; MAP1LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; LPS: lipopolysaccharide; LRRK2: leucine-rich repeat kinase 2; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; MHC: major histocompatibility complex; MIF: macrophage migration inhibitory factor; MIR/miRNA: microRNA; MTMR3: myotubularin related protein 3; MTOR: mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase; MYD88: myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88; NLRP3: NLR family, pyrin domain containing 3; NOD2: nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2; NPC: Niemann-Pick disease type C; NPC1: NPC intracellular cholesterol transporter 1; OMVs: outer membrane vesicles; OPTN: optineurin; PI3K: phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PRR: pattern-recognition receptor; PTPN2: protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 2; PTPN22: protein tyrosine phosphatase, non-receptor type 22 (lymphoid); PYCARD/ASC: PYD and CARD domain containing; RAB2A: RAB2A, member RAS oncogene family; RELA: v-rel reticuloendotheliosis viral oncogene homolog A (avian); RIPK2: receptor (TNFRSF)-interacting serine-threonine kinase 2; ROS: reactive oxygen species; SNPs: single nucleotide polymorphisms; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TAX1BP1: Tax1 binding protein 1; Th: T helper 1; TIRAP/TRIF: toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain-containing adaptor protein; TLR: toll-like receptor; TMEM173/STING: transmembrane protein 173; TMEM59: transmembrane protein 59; TNF/TNFA: tumor necrosis factor; Treg: regulatory T; TREM1: triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1; UC: ulcerative colitis; ULK1: unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; WT: wild-type; XBP1: X-box binding protein 1; XIAP: X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis.","['Larabi, Anais', 'Barnich, Nicolas', 'Nguyen, Hang Thi Thu']","['Larabi A', 'Barnich N', 'Nguyen HTT']",,"['M2iSH, UMR 1071 Inserm, INRA USC 2018, CRNH, University of Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'M2iSH, UMR 1071 Inserm, INRA USC 2018, CRNH, University of Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.', 'M2iSH, UMR 1071 Inserm, INRA USC 2018, CRNH, University of Clermont Auvergne, Clermont-Ferrand, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Autophagy,Autophagy,101265188,['0 (Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins)'],IM,,"['Animals', 'Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins/metabolism', 'Autophagy/*physiology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress/*physiology', 'Gastrointestinal Microbiome/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Inflammation/*metabolism', 'Intestines/pathology']",PMC6984609,['NOTNLM'],"['*Autophagy', '*immune responses', '*inflammatory bowel diseases', '*intestinal homeostasis', '*intestinal microbiota', '*microbial infection']",2019/07/10 06:00,2020/11/25 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/11/25 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1080/15548627.2019.1635384 [doi]'],ppublish,Autophagy. 2020 Jan;16(1):38-51. doi: 10.1080/15548627.2019.1635384.

In AML, CLEC12A is expressed on blasts and leukaemic stem cells. Methods: The functional capacity of MCLA-117 to redirect resting T cells to eradicate CLEC12A(POS) tumor cells was studied using human samples, including primary AML samples. Results: Within the normal hematopoietic compartment, MCLA-117 binds to cells expressing CD3 and CLEC12A but not to early myeloid progenitors or hematopoietic stem cells. MCLA-117 induces T cell activation (EC50 = 44 ng/mL), T cell proliferation, mild pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and redirects T cells to lyse CLEC12A(POS) target cells (EC50 = 68 ng/mL). MCLA-117-induced targeting of normal CD34(POS) cells co-cultured with T cells spares erythrocyte and megakaryocyte differentiation as well as preserves mono-myelocytic lineage development. In primary AML patient samples with autologous T cells, MCLA-117 robustly induced AML blast killing (23-98%) at low effector-to-target ratios (1:3-1:97). Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that MCLA-117 efficiently redirects T cells to kill tumour cells while sparing the potential of the bone marrow to develop the full hematological compartment and support further clinical evaluation as a potentially potent treatment option for AML.","['van Loo, Pieter Fokko', 'Hangalapura, Basav N', 'Thordardottir, Soley', 'Gibbins, John D', 'Veninga, Henrike', 'Hendriks, Linda J A', 'Kramer, Arjen', 'Roovers, Rob C', 'Leenders, Marij', 'de Kruif, John', 'Doornbos, Robert P', 'Sirulnik, Andres', 'Throsby, Mark', 'Logtenberg, Ton', 'Dolstra, Harry', 'Bakker, Alexander B H']","['van Loo PF', 'Hangalapura BN', 'Thordardottir S', 'Gibbins JD', 'Veninga H', 'Hendriks LJA', 'Kramer A', 'Roovers RC', 'Leenders M', 'de Kruif J', 'Doornbos RP', 'Sirulnik A', 'Throsby M', 'Logtenberg T', 'Dolstra H', 'Bakker ABH']","['ORCID: 0000-0002-9715-2136', 'ORCID: 0000-0002-3998-687X']","['a Merus N.V ., Utrecht , The Netherlands.', 'b Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology , Radboud University Medical Center and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences , Nijmegen , The Netherlands.', 'b Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology , Radboud University Medical Center and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences , Nijmegen , The Netherlands.', 'b Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology , Radboud University Medical Center and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences , Nijmegen , The Netherlands.', 'a Merus N.V ., Utrecht , The Netherlands.', 'a Merus N.V ., Utrecht , The Netherlands.', 'a Merus N.V ., Utrecht , The Netherlands.', 'a Merus N.V ., Utrecht , The Netherlands.', 'b Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology , Radboud University Medical Center and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences , Nijmegen , The Netherlands.', 'a Merus N.V ., Utrecht , The Netherlands.', 'a Merus N.V ., Utrecht , The Netherlands.', 'a Merus N.V ., Utrecht , The Netherlands.', 'a Merus N.V ., Utrecht , The Netherlands.', 'a Merus N.V ., Utrecht , The Netherlands.', 'b Department of Laboratory Medicine, Laboratory of Hematology , Radboud University Medical Center and Radboud Institute for Molecular Life Sciences , Nijmegen , The Netherlands.', 'a Merus N.V ., Utrecht , The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Expert Opin Biol Ther,Expert opinion on biological therapy,101125414,"['0 (Antibodies, Bispecific)', '0 (CD3 Complex)', '0 (CLEC12A protein, human)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Lectins, C-Type)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)']",IM,,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Bispecific/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'CD3 Complex/immunology', 'CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Proliferation', 'Cytokines/analysis/metabolism', 'HL-60 Cells', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Lectins, C-Type/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Mitogen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/metabolism']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*AML', '*CLEC12A', '*T cell engager', '*T cells', '*bispecific antibody']",2019/07/10 06:00,2020/04/14 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/04/14 06:00 [medline]']",['10.1080/14712598.2019.1623200 [doi]'],ppublish,Expert Opin Biol Ther. 2019 Jul;19(7):721-733. doi: 10.1080/14712598.2019.1623200.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recent data have shown that ibrutinib also blocks IgE-dependent activation and histamine release in human basophils (BAs) and mast cells (MCs). The aim of this study was to investigate whether BTK serves as a novel therapeutic target in canine mast cell tumours (MCTs). We evaluated the effects of ibrutinib on two canine MC lines, C2 and NI-1 and on primary MCs obtained from canine MCTs (n = 3). Using flow cytometry, we found that ibrutinib suppresses phosphorylation of BTK and of downstream STAT5 in both MC lines. In addition, ibrutinib decreased proliferation of neoplastic MCs, with IC50 values ranging between 0.1 and 1 muM in primary MCT cells and between 1 and 3 muM in C2 and NI-1 cells. In C2 cells, the combination ""ibrutinib + midostaurin"" produced synergistic growth-inhibitory effects. At higher concentrations, ibrutinib also induced apoptosis in both MC lines. Finally, ibrutinib was found to suppress IgE-dependent histamine release in primary MCT cells, with IC50 values ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 muM in NI-1 cells, and from 0.05 to 1 muM in primary MCT cells. In summary, ibrutinib exerts anti-proliferative effects in canine neoplastic MCs and counteracts IgE-dependent histamine release in these cells. Based on our data, ibrutinib may be considered as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of canine MCT. The value of BTK inhibition in canine MCT patients remains to be elucidated in clinical trials.","['Gamperl, Susanne', 'Stefanzl, Gabriele', 'Peter, Barbara', 'Smiljkovic, Dubravka', 'Bauer, Karin', 'Willmann, Michael', 'Valent, Peter', 'Hadzijusufovic, Emir']","['Gamperl S', 'Stefanzl G', 'Peter B', 'Smiljkovic D', 'Bauer K', 'Willmann M', 'Valent P', 'Hadzijusufovic E']","['ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6509-2810', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6759-4662', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5701-5412', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4016-4259', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9927-042X', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4260-1491', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0456-5095', 'ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0001-7409-4204']","['Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department/Hospital for Companion Animals and Horses, University Clinic for Small Animals, Internal Medicine Small Animals, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department of Internal Medicine I, Division of Hematology & Hemostaseology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Hematology and Oncology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.', 'Department/Hospital for Companion Animals and Horses, University Clinic for Small Animals, Internal Medicine Small Animals, University of Veterinary Medicine, Vienna, Austria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Vet Comp Oncol,Veterinary and comparative oncology,101185242,"['0 (Piperidines)', '0 (Pyrazoles)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (STAT5 Transcription Factor)', '1X70OSD4VX (ibrutinib)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '820484N8I3 (Histamine)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",IM,,"['Adenine/analogs & derivatives', 'Agammaglobulinaemia Tyrosine Kinase/genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cell Proliferation/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Dog Diseases/*drug therapy', 'Dogs', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/drug effects', 'Histamine/*metabolism', 'Immunoglobulin E/pharmacology', 'Mastocytoma/drug therapy/*veterinary', 'Piperidines', 'Pyrazoles/*pharmacology', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'STAT5 Transcription Factor/genetics/metabolism']",PMC6900099,['NOTNLM'],"['BTK', 'IgE', 'canine neoplastic mast cells', 'histamine release', 'ibrutinib']",2019/07/10 06:00,2020/03/07 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/04/01 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/02 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/03/07 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/vco.12520 [doi]'],ppublish,Vet Comp Oncol. 2019 Dec;17(4):553-561. doi: 10.1111/vco.12520.

Antimitotic agents, such as paclitaxel, are frontline drugs for the treatment of ovarian cancer. They inhibit microtubule dynamics and their efficiency relies on a prolonged mitotic arrest and the strong activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Although ovarian cancers respond well to paclitaxel, the clinical efficacy is limited due to an early onset of drug resistance, which may rely on a compromised mitosis exit associated with weakend intrinsic apoptosis. Accordingly, we aimed at overcoming SAC silencing that occurs rapidly during paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest. To do this, we used a specific anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) inhibitor to prevent a premature mitotic exit upon paclitaxel treatment. Furthermore, we investigated the role of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family member MCL-1 in determining the fate of ovarian cancer cells lines with CCNE1 amplification that are challenged with clinically relevant dose of paclitaxel. Using time-laps microscopy, we demonstrated that APC/C and MCL-1 inhibition under paclitaxel prevents mitotic slippage in ovarian cancer cell lines and restores death in mitosis. Consistent with this, the combinatorial treatment reduced the survival of ovarian cancer cells in 2D and 3D cell models. Since a therapeutic ceiling has been reached with taxanes, it is of utmost importance to develop alternative strategies to improve the patient's survival. Thus, our study provides not only elements to understand the causes of taxane resistance in CCNE1-amplified ovarian cancers but also suggests a new combinatorial strategy that may improve paclitaxel-based efficacy in this highly lethal gynecological disease.","['Raab, Monika', 'Kobayashi, Nene F', 'Becker, Sven', 'Kurunci-Csacsko, Elisabeth', 'Kramer, Andrea', 'Strebhardt, Klaus', 'Sanhaji, Mourad']","['Raab M', 'Kobayashi NF', 'Becker S', 'Kurunci-Csacsko E', 'Kramer A', 'Strebhardt K', 'Sanhaji M']",['ORCID: 0000-0003-2173-9763'],"['Department of Gynecology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.', 'German Cancer Consortium (DKTK)/German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany.', 'Department of Gynecology, Goethe-University, Frankfurt, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (CCNE1 protein, human)', '0 (Cyclin E)', '0 (MCL1 protein, human)', '0 (Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein)', '0 (Oncogene Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome)', 'P88XT4IS4D (Paclitaxel)']",IM,,"['Anaphase-Promoting Complex-Cyclosome/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/pharmacology', 'Apoptosis/drug effects/genetics', 'Cell Line, Tumor', 'Cyclin E/*genetics/metabolism', 'Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Drug Resistance, Neoplasm', 'Female', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Myeloid Cell Leukemia Sequence 1 Protein/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Grading', 'Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Paclitaxel/*pharmacology']",,['NOTNLM'],"['*APC/C', '*APC/C inhibitor proTAME', '*CCNE1 amplification', '*MCL-1', '*MCL-1 inhibitor A1210477', '*apoptosis', '*combination therapy', '*high grade serous ovarian cancer', '*mitotic slippage', '*paclitaxel', '*spindle assembly checkpoint']",2019/07/10 06:00,2020/02/20 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/01/23 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/06/24 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/20 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.32559 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 2020 Feb 15;146(4):1086-1098. doi: 10.1002/ijc.32559.

The acidic environment inside lysosomes of target cells is an important intracellular determinant of the cytocidal action of GO, as the linker is hydrolyzed under acidic conditions. However, lysosomal activity in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts in GO therapy has been insufficiently evaluated. It has been suggested that lysosome activity is suppressed in AML due to hyperactivation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway. We therefore hypothesized that agents which activate lysosomal function would potentiate the cytotoxicity of GO. Here, we found that a clinically useful mTORC1/2 dual inhibitor, AZD2014, reduced pH in the acidic organelles, including lysosomes, as shown by increased LysoTracker fluorescent intensity, and synergistically enhanced the cytotoxic effect of GO in primary leukemia cells. GO-induced cytotoxicity appeared to be enhanced with the increase in lysosomal activity by AZD2014. These results indicate that AZD2014 activated lysosomal function in primary leukemia cells, which in turn enhanced the cytotoxicity of GO. Enhancement of lysosomal activity may represent a new therapeutic strategy in the treatment of GO and other ADCs, particularly in cases with low lysosomal activity.","['Mizutani, Yu', 'Inase, Aki', 'Maimaitili, Yimamu', 'Miyata, Yoshiharu', 'Kitao, Akihito', 'Matsumoto, Hisayuki', 'Kawaguchi, Koji', 'Higashime, Ako', 'Goto, Hideaki', 'Kurata, Keiji', 'Yakushijin, Kimikazu', 'Minami, Hironobu', 'Matsuoka, Hiroshi']","['Mizutani Y', 'Inase A', 'Maimaitili Y', 'Miyata Y', 'Kitao A', 'Matsumoto H', 'Kawaguchi K', 'Higashime A', 'Goto H', 'Kurata K', 'Yakushijin K', 'Minami H', 'Matsuoka H']",,"['Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Department of Clinical Laboratory, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan.', 'Cancer Center, Kobe University Hospital, Kobe, Japan.', 'Division of Medical Oncology/Hematology, Department of Medicine, Kobe University Graduate School of Medicine, 7-5-2 Kusunoki-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, 650-0017, Japan. matsuoh@med.kobe-u.ac.jp.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Int J Hematol,International journal of hematology,9111627,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological)', '0 (Benzamides)', '0 (Morpholines)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '0BSC3P4H5X (vistusertib)', '93NS566KF7 (Gemtuzumab)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2)']",IM,,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Immunological/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Apoptosis/*drug effects', 'Benzamides/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Gemtuzumab/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Lysosomes/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Male', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 2/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Middle Aged', 'Molecular Targeted Therapy', 'Morpholines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",,['NOTNLM'],"['AZD2014', 'Acute myeloid leukemia', 'Gemtuzumab ozogamicin', 'Lysosomal function', 'Primary leukemia cells']",2019/07/10 06:00,2020/02/26 06:00,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/02/17 00:00 [received]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/03 00:00 [revised]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2020/02/26 06:00 [medline]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]']","['10.1007/s12185-019-02701-2 [doi]', '10.1007/s12185-019-02701-2 [pii]']",ppublish,Int J Hematol. 2019 Oct;110(4):490-499. doi: 10.1007/s12185-019-02701-2.

The defective DNA repair due to functional polymorphisms in DNA repair genes, might act as an etiological factor for leukemia progression. The study was carried out to understand the role of DNA repair genes (XRCC1, XPD) polymorphisms in Imatinib mesylate (IM) resistant CML patients. The study was carried out in total 87 CML patients (43 nonresponders-cases and 44 responders) who were treated with Imatinib. The treatment and follow-up was done according to European LeukemiaNet guidelines. The genotyping of selected SNPs were studied using RFLP and confirmed with Sanger sequencing (20%). The statistical analysis was performed using online tools (Socscistatistics and GraphPad InStat software). In our study no significant association was inferred between genotypes of DNA repair genes (XRCC1; rs1799782, rs25487, and XPD; rs13181) and complete cytogenetic response as well as molecular response. However there might be a possibility of association between XRCC1 Arg399Gln genotype AA/GA and cytogenetic response though it is statistically insignificant (p > 0.05). Though none of the genotypes of the DNA repair genes showed association with IM response, near association between XRCC1Arg399Gln genotype and cytogenetic response observed in our study. Hence, large sample size should be studied to establish the association of SNPs of DNA repair genes and IM response.

SUMMARY ANSWER: We have demonstrated an effective protocol for decellularization of human ovarian tissues and successful recellularization with isolated human ovarian cells and pre-antral follicles. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Survivors of leukemia or ovarian cancer run a risk of reintroducing malignancy when cryopreserved ovarian tissue is transplanted to restore fertility. A reconstructed ovary free of malignant cells could provide a safe alternative. Decellularization of ovarian tissue removes all cells from the extracellular matrix (ECM) including possible malignancies and leaves behind a physiological scaffold. The ECM offers the complex milieu that facilitates the necessary interaction between ovarian follicles and their surroundings to ensure their growth and development. Previous studies have shown that decellularized bovine ovarian scaffolds supported murine follicle growth and restoration of ovarian function in ovariectomized mice. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Optimizing a decellularization protocol for human ovarian tissues and testing biofunctionality of the decellularized scaffolds in vitro and in vivo by reseeding with both murine and human pre-antral follicles and ovarian cells. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Donated human ovarian tissue and isolated pre-antral follicles were obtained from women undergoing ovarian tissue cryopreservation for fertility preservation. Ovarian cortical and medullary tissues were decellularized using 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for 3, 6, 18 and 24 hours followed by 24 hours of 1 mg/mL DNase treatment and washing. Decellularization of ovarian tissues and preservation of ECM were characterized by morphological evaluation using Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, DNA quantification, histochemical quantification of collagen content and immunofluorescence analysis for collagen IA, laminin, fibronectin and DNA. Human ovarian stromal cells and isolated human pre-antral follicles were reseeded on the DCT and cultured in vitro. Isolated murine (N = 241) and human (N = 20) pre-antral follicles were reseeded on decellularized scaffolds and grafted subcutaneously to immunodeficient mice for 3 weeks. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Incubation in 0.1% SDS for 18-24 hours adequately decellularized both human ovarian medullary and cortical tissue by eliminating all cells and leaving the ECM intact. DNA content in DCT was decreased by >90% compared to native tissue samples. Histological examination using PAS staining confirmed that the cortical and medullary tissues were completely decellularized, and no visible nuclear material was found within the decellularized sections. DCT also stained positive for collagen I and collagen quantities in DCT constituted 88-98% of the individual baselines for native samples. Human ovarian stroma cells were able to recellularize the DCT and isolated human pre-antral follicles remained viable in co-culture. Xenotransplantation of DCT reseeded with human or murine pre-antral follicles showed, that the DCT was able to support survival of human follicles and growth of murine follicles, of which 39% grew to antral stages. The follicular recovery rates after three weeks grafting were low but similar for both human (25%) and murine follicles (21%). LARGE SCALE DATA: N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Further studies are needed to increase recovery and survival of the reseeded follicles. Longer grafting periods should be evaluated to determine the developmental potential of human follicles. Survival of the follicles might be impaired by the lack of stroma cells. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first time that isolated human follicles have survived in a decellularized human scaffold. Therefore, this proof-of-concept could be a potential new strategy to eliminate the risk of malignant cell re-occurrence in former cancer patients having cryopreserved ovarian tissue transplanted for fertility restoration.

We present a report of two patients who developed ALL following complete remission of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The first case is more consistent with a therapy- related ALL as a PCR analysis of bone marrow aspirate revealed a distinct clone and the mixed-lineage leukemia gene rearrangement, commonly associated with exposure to topoisomerase II inhibitors. The second case is more consistent with clonal evolution given positive MYC and BCL2 fusion signals in the original diagnosis of DLBCL and the secondary ALL.","['Gaut, Daria', 'Bejjani, Anthony', 'Sasine, Joshua', 'Schiller, Gary']","['Gaut D', 'Bejjani A', 'Sasine J', 'Schiller G']",,"['Department of Medicine.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, CA, USA.', 'Division of Hematology/Oncology, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, CA, USA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Hematol Rep,Hematology reports,101556723,,,,,PMC6589539,['NOTNLM'],"['acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'diffuse large B-cell lymphoma', 'secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'secondary malignancy', 'therapy-related acute lymphoblastic leukemia']",2019/07/10 06:00,2019/07/10 06:01,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/03/02 00:00 [received]', '2019/05/13 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4081/hr.2019.8100 [doi]'],epublish,Hematol Rep. 2019 Jun 14;11(2):8100. doi: 10.4081/hr.2019.8100. eCollection 2019 May 23.,,20190614,,,['Conflict of interest: the authors declare no potential conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cytogenetic abnormality is caused by a novel mechanism; breakage-fusion-bridge cycles followed by chromothripsis along with major gross rearrangements in chromosome 21. Charts of B-ALL diagnosed at King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed. iAMP is a rare entity occurring at around 2.4% of all pediatrics BALL. No statistically significant difference was found among patients with iAMP21, patients with extra copies of 21 and other patients with B-ALL. The reported adverse prognostic effect of iAMP21 could be due to other coexistent adverse factors, including older age at the time of diagnosis. The most common associated abnormality in our population in addition to the hyperdiploidy was ETV6/RUNX1.","['Al-Sweedan, Suleimman', 'Altahan, Rahaf']","['Al-Sweedan S', 'Altahan R']",,"['Department of Pediatrics, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan.', 'Hematology Unit, Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Hematol Rep,Hematology reports,101556723,,,,,PMC6589538,['NOTNLM'],"['B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia', 'Outcome', 'intrachromosomal amplification of chromosome 21']",2019/07/10 06:00,2019/07/10 06:01,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2018/08/12 00:00 [received]', '2019/03/25 00:00 [accepted]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:01 [medline]']",['10.4081/hr.2019.7826 [doi]'],epublish,Hematol Rep. 2019 Jun 14;11(2):7826. doi: 10.4081/hr.2019.7826. eCollection 2019 May 23.,,20190614,,,['Conflict of interest: the authors declare no potential conflict of interest.'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Objectives: To evaluate the expression of the CD28 and CTLA-4 molecules in 62 adults with de novo AML and its correlation with the development of acute graft vs host disease (GVHD) after hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation. Methods: The relative expression of CD28 and CTLA-4 was measured by quantitative SYBR Green real-time PCR method in a group of patients and controls as well as different risk groups (high, intermediate and favorite risk), M3 vs non-M3 and GVHD vs non-GVHD patients. Results: The mRNA expression of CD28 (7.9-fold) and CTLA-4 (5.7-fold) was significantly increased in AML patients compared with healthy controls (p=0.006 and 0.02, respectively). Although the mean expression of both CD28 and CTLA-4 was increased in high-risk group compared with low-risk and intermediate-risk groups, the difference was not statistically significant. Also, the mean expression of the CTLA-4, but not CD28, was significantly higher in M3 patients compared with non-M3 ones (p<0.001). The expression of CD28 was upregulated in GVHD patients, while the expression of CTLA-4 was slightly lower in GVHD patients compared with non-GVHD patients, though the difference was not statistically significant. There was no significant correlation between the expression of CD28 and CTLA-4 and laboratory parameters like white blood cells and platelets counts, and hemoglobin and lactate dehydrogenase level in AML patients. Conclusions: CD28 and CTLA-4 molecules are aberrantly expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes of AML patients and might contribute to the development of aGVHD after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","['Ramzi, M', 'Iravani Saadi, M', 'Yaghobi, R', 'Arandi, N']","['Ramzi M', 'Iravani Saadi M', 'Yaghobi R', 'Arandi N']",,"['Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Shiraz Transplant Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.', 'Hematology Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Iran,Int J Organ Transplant Med,International journal of organ transplantation medicine,101535773,,,,,PMC6604755,['NOTNLM'],"['AML', 'Acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD)', 'Co-stimulatory molecules', 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)']",2019/07/10 06:00,2019/07/10 06:01,['2019/07/10 06:00'],"['2019/07/10 06:00 [entrez]', '2019/07/10 06:00 [pubmed]', '2019/07/10 06:01 [medline]']",,ppublish,Int J Organ Transplant Med. 2019;10(2):84-90.
