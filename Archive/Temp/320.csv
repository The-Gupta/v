For such a purpose, we studied the effects of the recombinant human IL-3 (rhIL-3) on the mitotic index and the karyotype of bone marrow cells from 14 patients with myelodysplastic (MDS) and myeloproliferative syndromes (MPS). The mitotic response to IL-3 of normal bone marrow samples was also evaluated. Total bone marrow cells were cultured for 24 to 72 hours either in presence or absence of rhIL-3. In most cases, IL-3--stimulated samples showed a considerably higher (4-70 times) mitotic index than unstimulated controls. Although a great patient-to-patient variability was observed, a common pattern of mitogenic response to IL-3 emerged among MPS, MDS, and normal cases. At 48 hours of incubation, the mean mitotic index from MPS and MDS cases stimulated with IL-3 was significantly higher (p less than 0.01) than unstimulated controls, whereas the mean mitotic increase from normal samples did not reach statistical significance (p greater than 0.1). Even though not statistically evaluable, a similar trend of response was observed at 24 and 72 hours of culture. Chromosome studies of MPS and MDS cases showed the same karyotype either in stimulated and unstimulated samples.","['Kerim, S', 'Rege-Cambrin, G', 'Scaravaglio, P', 'Carozzi, F', 'Saglio, G', 'Aglietta, M']","['Kerim S', 'Rege-Cambrin G', 'Scaravaglio P', 'Carozzi F', 'Saglio G', 'Aglietta M']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, Universita di Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/pathology', '*Mitotic Index', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/pathology', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*genetics/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(91)90083-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(91)90083-7 [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1991 Sep;55(2):235-41. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(91)90083-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nephrotoxic antibiotics probably contributed to renal damage in individual cases. Young age did not appear to be a risk factor. Our data indicate that combined treatment with BEAC and TBI should be used with caution and that renal function should be monitored in all patients after bone marrow transplantation to detect any new toxicity patterns of the various conditioning regimens currently used.","['Lonnerholm, G', 'Carlson, K', 'Bratteby, L E', 'Backlund, L', 'Hagberg, H', 'Rikner, G', 'Smedmyr, B', 'Oberg, G', 'Simonsson, B']","['Lonnerholm G', 'Carlson K', 'Bratteby LE', 'Backlund L', 'Hagberg H', 'Rikner G', 'Smedmyr B', 'Oberg G', 'Simonsson B']","['Dept. of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*adverse effects/physiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Glomerular Filtration Rate', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Kidney/injuries/*physiopathology/radiation effects', 'Leukemia/physiopathology/surgery', 'Lymphoma/physiopathology/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiation Injuries/etiology/physiopathology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Aug;8(2):129-34.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clones obtained were exclusively CD3+ CD56-, carried the alpha/beta form of the T cell receptor for antigen, and were mostly (88% of 138) CD4+. None of 143 clones, including CD8+ clones, convincingly lysed host pretransplant cells, although 35 (24.5%) manifested lytic potential in lectin-mediated cytotoxicity assays. Measuring the proliferative responses of 118 of these clones in the presence of exogenous IL-2 revealed that a small number of clones reacted more strongly to host leukaemia than to unrelated leukaemias or B lymphoblastoid cell lines. In the two cases tested, the donor's untransplanted lymphocytes cloned under the same conditions as post-transplant cells did not generate any clones reacting preferentially with host leukaemia cells. These results may suggest that some T cells appearing shortly after allogeneic BMT could potentially mediate anti-leukaemia activity not associated with cytolysis of target cells.","['Hamann, W', 'Bruserud, O', 'Patel, S', 'Schmidt, H', 'Ehninger, G', 'Pawelec, G']","['Hamann W', 'Bruserud O', 'Patel S', 'Schmidt H', 'Ehninger G', 'Pawelec G']","['Second Department of Internal Medicine, Medical Clinic of the University of Tubingen, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Bone Marrow Transplant,Bone marrow transplantation,8702459,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/immunology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Bone Marrow Transplant. 1991 Aug;8(2):113-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Complete response (CR) rates were also similar. Although the remission duration tended to be longer with p190 (P = .08), the differences were minor (median duration 29 v 20 weeks) and not paralleled by differences in survival rate. In 10 patients studied by karyotypic analysis in remission, two of four patients with p190 and two of six patients with p210 showed 100% normal metaphases.

However, cellular events associated with this transition are poorly understood. To examine the possible participation of hematopoietic growth factors in this process, we studied growth factor expression in adherent layers of bone marrows derived from CML Ph1 patients in various stages of the disease. Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-6 mRNA were expressed in five of six patients, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in one of six patients with myeloid/undifferentiated blast crisis. In addition, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) expression was increased in four of six patients with myeloid/undifferentiated blast crisis phase of the disease. IL-1 beta was also detected in bone marrow adherent layer conditioned medium from two of these patients. These results were in sharp contrast to the lack of detectable levels of uninduced IL-1 beta, IL-6, and GM-CSF mRNA, in samples derived from 4 patients in lymphoid blastic crisis, 3 in accelerated, and 11 in chronic phases of the disease, or from normal controls. The possibility of a paracrine loop formation, whereby the adherent layers representing the bone marrow stroma are induced to express hematopoietic growth factors, was supported by our finding IL-1 beta mRNA expression in the leukemic blast cells in three of four studied patients in blast crisis and IL-1 beta protein production in seven of eight patients studied. Finally, coculturing CML blast crisis cells onto pre-established adherent layers induced the expression of both IL-1 beta and IL-6 genes. From this preliminary study, it appears that abnormal expression of growth factors is a common event with CML Ph1 progression. We hypothesize that IL-1 beta generated by the transformed malignant clone stimulates the marrow stroma to produce various growth factors, and that this process may play a role in disease progression.","['Wetzler, M', 'Kurzrock, R', 'Lowe, D G', 'Kantarjian, H', 'Gutterman, J U', 'Talpaz, M']","['Wetzler M', 'Kurzrock R', 'Lowe DG', 'Kantarjian H', 'Gutterman JU', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)']",IM,"['Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/genetics', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82212-5 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Nov 1;78(9):2400-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) in these responses was investigated by using several approaches of enzyme activity regulation. Direct activation of the PKC was achieved by short-term exposure of the cells to the PKC-specific activator phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). Inhibition of PKC activity was obtained by either prolonged treatment of the cells with PMA or by exposure of the cells to the PKC inhibitors H-7 and staurosporine. The results showed the following: (1) Short-term exposure of mast cells to PMA was sufficient to induce inhibition of proliferation. (2) An increase in PKC activity was associated with a decrease in the proliferation of IgE-dinitrophenol (DNP) or calcium ionophore A23187-stimulated cells. (3) A direct correlation was found between the increase in PKC activity and the increase in the level of the mRNAs of the jun proto-oncogenes in cells activated by both stimuli mentioned. (4) While an increase in PKC activity was associated with the upregulation of the level of c-fos mRNA during calcium ionophore A23187 stimulation, it showed the opposite effect on the expression of the mRNA of this proto-oncogene when the cells were triggered by IgE-DNP. Therefore, we concluded that PKC plays various roles in the expression of the mRNA of c-fos in activated mast cells depending on the stimulus involved. In addition, the expression of the mRNA of c-jun and junB proto-onogenes is not coordinately regulated with that of c-fos during immunologic stimulation. This discordancy, which is associated with the increase in PKC activity in mast cells, may play a role in the regulation of the transcription of AP-1-responsive genes, and therefore could be associated with the regulation of proliferation of these cells.","['Baranes, D', 'Razin, E']","['Baranes D', 'Razin E']","['Institute of Biochemistry, Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical School, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Dinitrophenols/immunology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes, fos/*genetics', 'Genes, jun/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin E/immunology', 'Leukemia, Basophilic, Acute', 'Liver/cytology', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Rats', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82206-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Nov 1;78(9):2354-64.,,,"['fos', 'jun']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hematologic remissions can be induced in about 60% of patients. Moreover, in a small number of patients loss of the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome and of the BCR-ABL rearrangement is observed. We have used genomic Southern blotting as well as a two-step polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method to score for BCR-ABL messenger RNA (mRNA) in patients with hematologic remission induced by treatment with IFN alpha-2b alone or in combination with IFN gamma. Concomitantly, cytogenetic analysis was performed. In 11 of 115 patients reported here, a complete loss of rearranged BCR fragments was observed in Southern blots of peripheral blood (PB) and/or bone marrow (BM) cell samples. Malignant marker bands disappeared first in the PB. In six patients, this genotype remained stable, whereas in five patients, low-intensity, rearranged bands reappeared despite continuation of treatment.

Cancer, exclusive of nonmelanoma skin cancer, was identified in 19 females and 12 males under 15 years of age. The incidence rate among twins was 7.9 cancers per 100,000 person-years (PY) overall, and 9.7 and 6.1 per 100,000 PYs for females and males, respectively. Four of 13 leukemias occurred in two female twin pairs, representing concordance rates of 18 percent overall and 29 percent for like-sex pairs, which are somewhat higher than values reported previously. The number of cancers expected was computed on the assumption that twins experienced the same sex-, age-, and calendar time-specific cancer rates as recorded for all Connecticut-born children. Because active follow-up of individuals was not conducted, an adjustment to person-years of observation was made to account for childhood mortality, including the high perinatal mortality characteristic of twins. Childhood cancer was 30 percent less frequent than expected (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] = 0.7; 95 percent confidence interval [CI] = 0.5-0.9), a deficit that is marginally greater than those found in previous studies. Both leukemia (SIR = 0.8; CI = 0.4-1.4), and all other cancers combined (SIR = 0.6; CI = 0.3-0.9) occurred less often than expected. The deficit was greater among males (SIR = 0.5; CI = 0.2-0.8) than among females (SIR = 0.9; CI = 0.5-1.4) and was especially pronounced among males younger than five years (SIR = 0.2; CI = 0.0-0.7). The data support the view that twins, particularly male twins, have a lower risk of childhood cancer than single-born children. Any added risk for twins associated with their greater frequency of exposure to prenatal X-rays appears to have been insufficient to offset an 'effect' of twinning per se. Possible explanations for this finding include (i) the low birthweight distribution of twins, or (ii) selective early mortality of twin fetuses or neonates who would otherwise have developed a clinical cancer.","['Inskip, P D', 'Harvey, E B', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Stone, B J', 'Matanoski, G', 'Flannery, J T', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Inskip PD', 'Harvey EB', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Stone BJ', 'Matanoski G', 'Flannery JT', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Causes Control,Cancer causes & control : CCC,9100846,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Connecticut/epidemiology', 'Diseases in Twins/*epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Male', 'Medical Record Linkage', 'Neoplasms/*epidemiology/mortality', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors']",1991/09/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/09/11 19:15'],"['1991/09/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/09/11 19:15 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00051671 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Causes Control. 1991 Sep;2(5):315-24. doi: 10.1007/BF00051671.,61,['N01-CPO-1047/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight of 16 patients were negative by two-step PCR 1-39 months after BMT, suggesting an elimination of Ph-positive cells or a decrease below the threshold of detection. Although five patients showed negative results by the one-step PCR only, they were tested positive when nested primers were used, indicating a substantial decrease in the amount of BCR/ABL target mRNA compared with earlier pre- or post-transplant analyses. One patient who was still PCR positive 27 months after BMT became negative 12 months later. Persistence of BCR/ABL mRNA-expressing cells correlated with subsequent clinical relapse only when the transplantation was performed during blast crisis. All patients who underwent transplantation in chronic phase, including those with BCR rearrangement by PCR, are in clinical and hematological remission between 24 and 95 months after BMT. We conclude that aggressive chemotherapy combined with total body irradiation is unable to completely eradicate the malignant clone in all CML patients, and it might be speculated that other mechanisms (e.g., graft versus host reaction [GVHD] or graft versus leukemia effect [GVL]) may effectively eliminate residual leukemic cells.","['Lange, W', 'Herkert, R', 'Finke, J', 'Ragoczy, U', 'Siegert, W', 'Mertelsmann, R', 'Dolken, G']","['Lange W', 'Herkert R', 'Finke J', 'Ragoczy U', 'Siegert W', 'Mertelsmann R', 'Dolken G']","['Medizinische Universitatsklinik Freiburg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Ann Hematol,Annals of hematology,9107334,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Base Sequence', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes, abl', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics/surgery', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01703441 [doi]'],ppublish,Ann Hematol. 1991 Oct;63(4):189-94. doi: 10.1007/BF01703441.,,,"['ABL', 'BCR']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, the association between a higher incidence of unfavorable cytogenetic abnormalities in elderly patients and poor prognosis has been well documented. Low treatment response may be due to the specific biology of AML in this patient group, but also to host-specific factors such as higher treatment-related morbidity and mortality. Treatment tolerance cannot be judged on grounds of chronological age alone; risk factor analysis with regard to performance status, organ function, and underlying systemic disease need to be considered as well. For effective induction treatment in elderly patients, instant and intensive chemotherapy appears to be necessary, while delayed treatment or administration of supportive care alone provide unsatisfactory results.

Recently, in vitro studies suggested a role of the Ku protein in the activation of gene transcription. We studied the expression of these proteins during cell proliferation by Northern blot hybridizations using specific cDNA probes and by immunofluorescence and immunoblot analysis using specific monoclonal antibodies. The genes coding for both subunits were activated during late G1-phase in the transition of human PHA-stimulated lymphocytes from quiescent (G0 phase) to proliferative (S phase) state. These genes were inactivated when human leukemia cells HL60 were differentiated into monocytes upon treatment with the phorbol ester TPA. Changes at the protein level were significantly smaller than changes at the mRNA levels in both cell systems, suggesting a high stability of the Ku protein. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrated nucleolar as well as nuclear localization of the Ku protein in quiescent lymphocytes and during the early G1-phase; during the late G1, S and G2 phases, the Ku protein was only localized in discrete structures in the nucleoplasm. These results demonstrate that the gene expression for the Ku protein is associated with the proliferative state of the cells and that the nucleolar localization of the Ku protein is cell-cycle-dependent.","['Yaneva, M', 'Jhiang, S']","['Yaneva M', 'Jhiang S']","['Department of Pharmacology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.6.4.- (DNA Helicases)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (XRCC5 protein, human)', 'EC 3.6.4.12 (Xrcc6 protein, human)', 'EC 4.2.99.- (Ku Autoantigen)']",IM,"['*Antigens, Nuclear', 'Cell Division', '*DNA Helicases', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Ku Autoantigen', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Nuclear Proteins/*biosynthesis', 'Phytohemagglutinins', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/10/08 00:00,1991/10/08 00:01,['1991/10/08 00:00'],"['1991/10/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/08 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/08 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4781(91)90099-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4781(91)90099-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1991 Oct 8;1090(2):181-7. doi: 10.1016/0167-4781(91)90099-8.,,"['CA-100893/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GMA-1AR39308-01/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two distinct elements have been implicated in function of the HTLV-I enhancer. One is the 21-base-pair (bp) core element that is responsible for trans-activation by the HTLV-I trans-activator p40tax and that has the ability to bind to cyclic-AMP responsive element binding factor (CREB)-like factor(s). The other is a region interposed between the 21-bp elements. In this study we demonstrate that a subfragment (C26) in the region between the 21-bp elements is involved in trans-activation by p40tax, possibly through binding to an NF-kappa B-like nuclear factor or factors. Formation of the protein-DNA complex with the C26 subfragment was positively affected by p40tax. The C26 element conferred partial responsiveness to p40tax when linked to one copy of the 21-bp element that, by itself, showed little activation in response to p40tax. However, the C26 element alone, even when repeated, could not be activated by p40tax, unlike other NF-kappa B-binding elements. In contrast, the C26 element itself was profoundly activated upon stimulation with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. These findings therefore suggest that the HTLV-I enhancer contains multiple functional elements, including binding sites for at least CREB- and NF-kappa B-like factors, which synergistically cooperate in activation of the HTLV-I enhancer in response to p40tax. Our results also demonstrate that TPA-dependent activation of the HTLV-I enhancer may be mediated through the C26 element.","['Numata, N', 'Ohtani, K', 'Niki, M', 'Nakamura, M', 'Sugamura, K']","['Numata N', 'Ohtani K', 'Niki M', 'Nakamura M', 'Sugamura K']","['Department of Microbiology, Tohoku University School of Medicine, Sendai, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,New Biol,The New biologist,9000976,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Viral/drug effects', 'Gene Products, tax/genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/drug effects/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,New Biol. 1991 Sep;3(9):896-906.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interferon alpha (IFN alpha) has limited antitumour activity in this disease. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated that both the response rate and the survival time of patients with advanced colorectal cancer can be significantly improved by the addition of leucovorin (CF) to FUra. In a randomized phase III trial, the median response to FUra and CF was about 30% with a range of 20-55%, dependent on the dose and schedule of administration of CF. Due to multiplicity of mechanisms of action postulated for IFN alpha, the role of IFN alpha in the modulation of the cytotoxicity and therapeutic efficacy of FUra alone and in combination with CF has been evaluated in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and also in a variety of human cell lines in culture, including human colorectal cell lines, HCT-8, human bladder cell line RT-4 and leukaemia CEM cells. The results obtained in patients demonstrated that indeed the antitumour activity of FUra can be improved by the addition of IFN alpha with a response range from 26% to 76%. The initial clinical use of this combination, however, has been limited in some cases by the severe host toxicity. In vitro results demonstrated that: (1) in vitro cytotoxicity potentiation by IFN alpha is cell-type dependent; (2) in these cells where modulation was possible, alpha IFN was used as a low and noncytotoxic doses (10-50 micrograms/ml for 3-5 d exposure), and (3) the cytotoxicity of IFN alpha was dose dependent, indicating a direct antiproliferative cellular effect.","['Rustum, Y M']",['Rustum YM'],"['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colorectal Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leucovorin/*therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08120.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Oct;79 Suppl 1:52-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08120.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore, the best-studied example of translocation-mediated gene activation occurs in leukaemia patients bearing this abnormality (reviewed by Kurzrock et al, 1988). In these individuals, the Ph translocation (t(9;22)(q34;q11)) results in transposition of the ABL proto-oncogene from chromosome 9q34 to 22q11, where it is fused with part of the BCR gene. It is now known that as a result of the Ph translocation, p160BCR and p145ABL (the normal BCR and ABL gene products) are replaced by p210BCR-ABL. This aberrant protein constitutes the molecular fingerprint of CML. The enhanced tyrosine phosphokinase enzymatic activity (a property possessed by some growth factor receptors and transformation-inducing oncogenes) of p210BCR-ABL implicates a direct role for this molecule in the pathogenesis of CML. Because the Ph translocation is present in the early chronic phase, the union of the BCR and ABL genes is probably involved in the initiation of the leukaemic process. The secondary molecular forces driving progression of CML to blast crisis are however unknown, and may differ from patient to patient. Approximately 10% of CML patients lack a Ph chromosome. One-half of these individuals have bcr rearrangement and express p210BCR-ABL. Ph+ and Ph- bcr+ (p210+) CML are identical and should be treated the same. Molecular follow-up of diploid bcr+ CML patients is essential for detection of persistent malignancy after therapy. The presence of a specific marker--the BCR-ABL message--permits the development of new diagnostic approaches for CML. For instance, detection of a BCR-ABL message with the use of the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction, a technique capable of detecting up to one leukaemia cell amongst one million normal cells, yields important information about minimal residual disease. Finally, the use of therapy directed against the BCR-ABL product may be a worthwhile strategy which deserves investigation, and may prompt a new era of tumour-specific treatment.","['Kurzrock, R', 'Talpaz, M']","['Kurzrock R', 'Talpaz M']","['Department of Clinical Immunology and Biological Therapy, M.

Subsequently, we performed the present study randomizing 34 Binet stage AI, B-CLL patients who were not previously treated (eight controls and 26 who were to receive interferon alfa-2b (IFN alpha-2b) (Intron-A) according to a randomized schedule as follows: 1.5 MU/d in eight patients, 1.5 MU three times a week in 10 patients and 3.0 MU three times a week in eight patients). At 3 months complete response (CR) was obtained in one, partial haematologic response (PHR) in nine and minor haematologic response (MHR) in seven patients with an overall response rate 17/26 or 65%. No bone marrow changes regarding the pattern or degree of infiltration was noticed in any of the responding patients except for the complete responder. Treatment was continued in 15 patients (reduced to two-thirds of the initial dose in the PHR and to one third of the initial dose in the MHR) while in 11 patients it was discontinued because of no response, negative response or toxicity. At 6 months sustained response was observed in 10 patients, while in the remaining five an increase of blood lymphocytes was seen at numbers similar or higher to those noted prior to interferon alfa-2b therapy. Two of the 10 patients in whom blood lymphocytes were still reduced to less than 50% of the pretreatment values, developed gradual lymph node enlargement and therapy had to be discontinued. During the following 6 months the interferon alfa-2b dose was further reduced in all remaining responders to 1.5 MU once or twice a week and their counts remained at the same level as at 6 months of therapy. At 12 months, 18 of our patients were still in stage A while seven had progressed (five to stage B and two to stage C). The overall response after 12 months of therapy was sustained in 8/17 responders. We conclude from our study that interferon alfa-2b is effective in untreated B-CLL patients in early stages and therefore should be investigated in combination with conventional chemotherapy.

Incubation with TNF in vitro has been shown to increase viability, DNA synthesis and the expression of the protooncogenes myc, fos and jun in the tumour cells from these patients. TNF in vitro also increases expression of TNF-mRNA, suggesting the existence of an autocrine growth loop for TNF in these cells. Current experiments are compatible with the hypothesis that interferon alpha (IFN) interferes with this autocrine growth loop in HCL and B-CLL by stimulating degradation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for a number of cytokines including that of TNF. This RNA degradation may be mediated through induction of the enzyme 2,5 oligo-A synthetase with consequent increased synthesis of 2,5 oligo-A which is known to stimulate the activity of a latent ribonuclease capable of degrading cytokine mRNAs. Circulating tumour-derived TNF may also contribute to the pancytopenia in HCL and B-CLL. Whether cytokine autocrine growth loops are important in other B-cell malignancies, e.g. myeloma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and subject to IFN-stimulated breakdown needs further study.","['Heslop, H E', 'Brenner, M K', 'Ganeshaguru, K', 'Hoffbrand, A V']","['Heslop HE', 'Brenner MK', 'Ganeshaguru K', 'Hoffbrand AV']","[""Department of Hematology/Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', 'Interferon-alpha/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*therapy', 'Pancytopenia/etiology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/physiology']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08111.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Oct;79 Suppl 1:14-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08111.x.,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The quality of life was evaluated in seven long term survivors who are currently alive more than 1 year after hospital discharge using three validated methods: the Nottingham Health Profile, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Perceived Quality of Life Scale. Patients were also asked whether they had returned to work, whether their daily activities were limited and whether they would be willing to undergo intensive care again under the same circumstances. The in-hospital mortality rate was 77%. Median duration of long term survival was 23 months (range 6 weeks to 8 years). Long term survival did not appear to be related to either the aetiology or the severity of the acute illness, but seemed to be determined solely by the nature and progress of the underlying malignancy. The quality of life of six of the seven long term survivors is good, while that of the other is acceptable. None of the patients reported any increased limitation of their daily activities, five had returned to full time employment and all seven stated that they would be willing to undergo intensive care again under the same circumstances.","['Yau, E', 'Rohatiner, A Z', 'Lister, T A', 'Hinds, C J']","['Yau E', 'Rohatiner AZ', 'Lister TA', 'Hinds CJ']","[""Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, St Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anxiety/etiology', '*Critical Care/psychology', 'Depression/etiology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications/mortality/*psychology', 'Lymphoma/complications/mortality/*psychology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', '*Quality of Life']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1991.430 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1991 Nov;64(5):938-42. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1991.430.,,,,,,,PMC1977486,,,,,,,,

These included: prolymphocytic leukaemia (T-PLL), 31, HTLV-1 + adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL), 20, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), comprising mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome, 13, and large granular lymphocytic leukaemia, four. Two-thirds of patients were refractory to previous therapy, which included four drug combinations. DCF was given intravenously at 4 mg m-2 weekly for the first 4 weeks and then every 2 weeks until maximal response. Toxicity was very low with only one death resulting from prolonged neutropenia. Overall response rates, partial (PR) and complete. (CR), were 38%, with variations according to diagnosis. Best responses, 54%, were seen in CTCL but limited to Sezary patients, one CR, six PR, whilst none of the mycosis fungoides responded. Responses in T-PLL were recorded in 48% including three CR (of 8-12 months' duration unmaintained) and 12 PR. Fifteen per cent of responses were seen in ATLL. The only ATLL responders - two CR, one PR - were those patients who received combination chemotherapy prior to DCF, with reduction of tumour bulk but short of PR. When results were analysed according to membrane phenotypes it was apparent that responses were seen mainly in cases with CD4+, CD8- T cells -22 of 47 (47%) - contrasting with only three of 19 (16%) with other T-cell phenotypes. We conclude that DCF is a useful therapy for the treatment of T-cell leukaemias, in particular Sezary syndrome and T-PLL, and should play a part in strategies to improve the natural history of this group of lymphoid malignancies.","['Dearden, C', 'Matutes, E', 'Catovsky, D']","['Dearden C', 'Matutes E', 'Catovsky D']","['Academic Department of Haematology and Cytogenetics, Royal Marsden Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/drug therapy', 'Pentostatin/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Sezary Syndrome/drug therapy']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1991.423 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1991 Nov;64(5):903-6. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1991.423.,,,,,,,PMC1977476,,,,,,,,

Since alterations in gene expression may play a critical role in multistage hepatocarcinogenesis, the present studies examined the expression of the c-myc, c-H-ras, epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor and ODC (ornithine decarboxylase) genes, as well as endogenous retrovirus-like sequences, in F344 rat liver during the first 8 weeks of feeding a 0.16% Br931 diet and in liver tumours induced by chronic feeding of this diet. Northern blot analysis of poly A + liver RNA samples showed an increase in the level of RNAs homologous to rat leukaemia virus (RaLV) but no significant change in the level of 30S-retrovirus related RNAs in the liver RNA samples obtained from rats during the first 8 weeks of feeding the diet containing BR931. An increase in the levels of c-myc, c-H-ras and ODC transcripts was also seen in the liver RNA samples from the treated rats. Of particular interest was a decrease in the abundance of EGF receptor transcripts in the liver RNA samples from rats fed the BR931 diet. Increased levels of RaLV, c-myc, and ODC RNAs were also seen in the tumours induced by BR931, but this was not the case for 30S and c-H-ras. The liver tumour samples also showed a decrease in EGF receptor RNA. These changes in cellular levels of specific RNAs resemble, in several respect, those we previously described in rodent liver during regeneration and tumour promotion, and also those seen in rodent hepatomas induced by other agents. Therefore, they may reflect a common profile of gene expression relevant to liver proliferation and carcinogenesis.","['Hsieh, L L', 'Shinozuka, H', 'Weinstein, I B']","['Hsieh LL', 'Shinozuka H', 'Weinstein IB']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, School of Public Health, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Pyrimidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '969LVT6GJ2 (pirinixil)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (ErbB Receptors)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'ErbB Receptors/genetics', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Genes, ras/*genetics', 'Liver Neoplasms, Experimental/chemically induced/*genetics', 'Male', 'Microbodies/drug effects', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogenes/*genetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1991.406 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1991 Nov;64(5):815-20. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1991.406.,,"['CA021111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA26556/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40062/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']","['30S', 'RaLV', 'c-H-ras', 'c-myc']",,,,PMC1977482,,,,,,,,

Mice of group 1 were younger than the others, had a rapidly progressive disease, normal to elevated packed cell volume (PCV), and plasma erythropoietin (Epo) was normal or increased. Mice of group 2 were usually anaemic with high plasma Epo estimates and often elevated reticulocyte counts. Group 4 was the oldest group. Some of these mice were severely affected haematologically. Overall there was an inverse relation between PCV and plasma Epo estimate, indicating a normal Epo response to anaemia. In all groups increasing spleen size was associated with increased severity of anaemia and increased reticulocyte counts. The association between anaemia, elevated reticulocyte counts and spleen enlargement suggests haemolysis as a mechanism for anaemia, and also raises the question of compensatory spleen erythropoiesis.","['Hellebostad, M', 'Ostbye, K M', 'Halvorsen, S']","['Hellebostad M', 'Ostbye KM', 'Halvorsen S']","['Department of Paediatrics, Ulleval Hospital, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Denmark,APMIS,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica",8803400,['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Anemia/*blood', 'Animals', 'Erythropoietin/analysis', 'Female', 'Hematologic Tests', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood', 'Lymphoma/*blood', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*blood', 'Spleen/pathology', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Thymoma/blood', 'Thymus Gland/pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/pathology']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,APMIS. 1991 Oct;99(10):869-78.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-eight parents of children entered on one of four protocols for the treatment of newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and the University of California San Francisco were asked to complete two questionnaires within 48 hours after consenting to treatment: the State-Trait Anxiety Index and the Parent Informed Consent Questionnaire. Results of the study confirmed clinical experience that parents are given complex information and asked to make decisions about their child's life in a highly anxious state. Although participants were generally satisfied with the informed consent process 48 hours after signing a consent form, further research is needed to document how well parents understand and remember key information, as well as the influence of time, experience, and changes in state anxiety on their perceptions of the adequacy of the consent process.

All cases were initially immunotyped by conventional methods. Genotyping by Southern blot hybridization was also done in 54 cases. Seventy-four of 79 malignant lymphomas and both of two hairy cell leukemias were of B-cell origin; and five lymphomas were defined as T-cell lineage. Lineage assignment was identical for paraffin section immunohistology and conventional immunotyping in 73 of 76 B cell and all of five T-cell tumors. CD20 was reactive with 73 of 76 B-cell tumors. CD43 was reactive with 12 of 74 B-cell lymphomas, and CD20/CD43 coexpression was seen in 11 of these cases. CD43 and CD45RO marked all of five and three of five T-cell lymphomas, respectively. Lineage assignment was identical for paraffin immunohistology and genotyping in 48 of 50 cases with identifiable gene rearrangements. Twenty-four nonneoplastic and five Hodgkin's disease cases that were studied also showed similar immunoreactivity patterns by both paraffin and conventional immunotypic methods. This panel of three monoclonal antibodies is an efficient, cost-effective approach for immunotyping most lymphoid proliferations in paraffin sections.

These cells can be induced to undergo macrophage differentiation by phorbol esters, which results in suppression of c-myc expression and cessation of cell proliferation. The nuclear matrix (NM), a nuclear skeleton resistant to DNase I digestion and high salt extraction, is proposed to be involved in DNA replication, gene regulation, and the correct distribution of DNA at mitosis. We have previously identified a nuclear-matrix-associated region (MAR) of the c-myc protooncogene to reside in a 1.4-kb region between Cla I and Eco RI restriction sites at the 3'-end of the gene. A 172-bp Dra I/Dra I subfragment of the 1.4-kb region was shown to be a major component of the MAR (myc-MAR), and this subfragment was demonstrated to be recognized by a nuclear protein (p25). In this report we demonstrate that phi X174 DNA, or the synthetic copolymers poly[d(G.C)] and poly[d(A.T)], are not effective suppressors of the binding of the myc-MAR to isolated NM, indicating that the binding sequence(s) are unique. We find that the addition of partially purified protein p25 increases the relative affinity of the myc-MAR for HL-60 NM in an in vitro assay system. NM isolated from HL-60 macrophages induced by phorbol esters retains significantly more myc-MAR DNA fragment in the presence of an excess amount of competitor DNA than does NM from untreated HL-60 cells. These data suggest that a change of the myc-MAR association with the NM occurs after monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.","['Chou, R H', 'Churchill, J R', 'Mapstone, D E', 'Flubacher, M M']","['Chou RH', 'Churchill JR', 'Mapstone DE', 'Flubacher MM']","['Department of Anatomy, Hahnemann University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Anat,The American journal of anatomy,0376312,['0 (Phorbol Esters)'],IM,"['Base Composition', 'Binding Sites/drug effects', 'Binding, Competitive', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Nuclear Matrix/*metabolism', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Restriction Mapping']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/aja.1001910311 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Anat. 1991 Jul;191(3):312-20. doi: 10.1002/aja.1001910311.,,['2S07RR-50412/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy regimens, including intrathecal methotrexate, were similar in all patients, but CNS treatment differed, in that one group received 2400 cGy cranial irradiation, while the other received 1800 cGy. There was a significant decrease in height SDS during prepuberty, which was equivalent in both sexes, whereas there was a much greater decrease in pubertal growth in girls than in boys. Girls treated with the lower dose regimen of cranial irradiation had their onset of pubertal maturation significantly advanced, to a mean of 9.9 years (p less than 0.001). Previous studies have indicated that the duration of puberty is shortened by GH treatment in patients with idiopathic multiple pituitary hormone deficiency or isolated GH deficiency (GHD). To determine whether an increase in the dose of GH administered during the adolescent growth spurt would improve final height, a prospective randomized trial was performed in 32 children (25 boys, 7 girls) with isolated GHD treated with a GH dose regimen of 15 IU/m2/week as daily s.c. injections. At the onset of the pubertal growth spurt, the patients were randomized either to an unchanged dose or to 30 IU/m2/week. There was no significant change in height velocity with the doubled dose of GH, but there was a trend in the advancement of pubertal maturation which was considered to be dose related. It is suggested that these findings are of relevance to the treatment of GHD in puberty, especially in girls with early or precocious puberty occurring as a consequence of low-dose cranial irradiation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Stanhope, R', 'Uruena, M', 'Hindmarsh, P', 'Leiper, A D', 'Brook, C G']","['Stanhope R', 'Uruena M', 'Hindmarsh P', 'Leiper AD', 'Brook CG']","['Kabi International Growth Research Centre, Institute of Child Health, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Sweden,Acta Paediatr Scand Suppl,Acta paediatrica Scandinavica.

The monocyte-derived cytokines tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6 are molecules central to immune functions. Moreover, they may be involved in graft-versus-host disease and in graft-versus-leukemia reaction. Hence, we have studied the reappearance of these CKs after BMT by analyzing whole blood cultures stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide for 6 hr, followed by testing for the secretion of TNF in the WEHI 164/actinomycin D cytotoxicity bioassay and for IL-6 in the 7 TD 1 proliferation assay. We performed sequential studies in 6 children who were transplanted for aplastic anemia or leukemia with allogeneic bone marrow. We found that the production of both CKs can be induced as early as 10-14 days post BMT at the very beginning of engraftment, indicating that the regenerating monocyte system is recovering rapidly after BMT. Depletion and neutralization experiments confirmed that monocytes are the cellular source of the LPS-induced CK secretion after BMT. Control levels were reached 3 to 4 weeks post BMT. When analyzing the endotoxin-induced CK production in a larger panel of BMT patients after complete reconstitution, we could not detect any impact of acute or chronic GvHD, or of allogeneic or autologous BMT, nor did treatment with cyclosporine A (CsA) show any suppressive effect. Thus, our data show that the CK production of the monocyte/macrophage lineage is quite resistant to factors that do influence other cell lineages of the immune system during BMT. The coincident appearance of monocyte-derived cytokines and of GvHD suggests a role for these cytokines in GvHD in man.","['Pechumer, H', 'Leinisch, E', 'Bender-Gotze, C', 'Ziegler-Heitbrock, H W']","['Pechumer H', 'Leinisch E', 'Bender-Gotze C', 'Ziegler-Heitbrock HW']","['Pediatric Outpatient Clinic, University of Munich, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Endotoxins/pharmacology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/blood/physiopathology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00007890-199110000-00022 [doi]'],ppublish,Transplantation. 1991 Oct;52(4):698-704. doi: 10.1097/00007890-199110000-00022.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A four-phase preclinical sequence in the induction of ML has been described: (1) suppression, (2) recovery, (3) accommodation, and (4) preleukemic transition. Within this sequence, a critical ""early""-occurring hematopoietic target cell event that promotes progression of preclinical phases I and II has been identified and characterized by an acquisition of increased radioresistance to low-LET gamma rays by granulocyte/monocyte lineage-committed progenitor cells (CFU-GM). To gain further insight into the basis of this critical event, the acquired survival response of preleukemic progenitor cells has been probed in vitro with high-LET fission neutrons. For these studies, marrow CFU-GM were isolated from chronically irradiated preleukemic dogs, as well as from nonirradiated controls, subjected to graded doses (0-300 cGy) of either JANUS fission neutrons or 60Co gamma rays, and assayed for survival by a standard cloning assay. Major observations resulting from these assays include the following. First, the acquired radioresistance of preleukemic CFU-GM to low-LET gamma rays noted previously extends to high-LET fission neutrons as well. Relative to control CFU-GM exhibited small but significant increases in radioresistance of about 10 cGy with an average D0 value of 38 (+/- 2.3) cGy for preleukemic CFU-GM, and 28 (+/- 1.3) cGy for the control levels, the CFU-GM irradiated within a marrow dose range of 10-75 cGy. Second, at higher neutron doses (150-600 cGy), fractional survival of both control and preleukemic CFU-GM declined nonexponentially, suggesting the existence of a small, radioresistant subpopulation constituting about 2% of the total marrow CFU-GM within normal nonirradiated dogs, and a 15% fraction of the progenitor cell population in preleukemic marrow (preclinical phases II-IV). The latter is most likely the result of a normally minor subpopulation gaining a growth advantage due to its inherent radioresistance and clonally expanding in the strong selective pressure of chronic marrow irradiation in vivo. We speculate that these qualitative/quantitative changes in the function of progenitor cells foster the initiation of aberrant regenerative hematopoiesis characteristic of early evolving radiation leukemogenesis.","['Seed, T M', 'Kaspar, L V']","['Seed TM', 'Kaspar LV']","['Biological and Medical Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois 60439-4833.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,['0 (Cobalt Radioisotopes)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Cobalt Radioisotopes', 'Dogs', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', '*Neutrons', 'Nuclear Reactors', 'Preleukemia/*pathology']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1991 Oct;128(1 Suppl):S81-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experimental results on tumor induction have already been published and are here summarized with emphasis on the dependence on radiation quality, age at irradiation, and sex. These data indicate that the bone marrow, liver, and ovaries of the mice tested have an appreciable susceptibility to radiation carcinogenesis. However, the shape of the dose-response relationship depends on the tissue exposed. The data also confirm that a linear relationship is adequate for a conservative description of the dose-effect curves after exposure to low dose of neutrons, while a purely quadratic dependence is not inconsistent with the experimental data obtained using low-LET radiation. Other information which stems from the present analysis is that the susceptibility to radiation induction of liver tumor by fission neutrons decreases in old age. Finally, the experimental data on induction of ovarian tumors suggest a threshold-like dose response.","['Covelli, V', 'Di Majo, V', 'Coppola, M', 'Rebessi, S']","['Covelli V', 'Di Majo V', 'Coppola M', 'Rebessi S']","['Environmental Biomedicine Division, ENEA, C.R.E.

The resistance conferred by the H-2b haplotype is recessive in this cross, since heterozygous F1 mice are as susceptible as parental strain H-2d homozygotes. However, H-2b-associated resistance is not an intrinsically recessive trait, since H-2b/H-2dm1 heterozygotes resemble H-2b homozygotes in their relative resistance to FV; the mutant H-2dm1 haplotype lacks the entire D region of the parental haplotype except for a single class I gene formed by the fusion of its terminal D-region genes to produce a class I gene differing from both parental genes, and thus this finding indicates that one or more D-region genes of the H-2d haplotype can actively suppress H-2b-associated resistance. Unlike H-2dm1, the mutant H-2dm2 haplotype, which retains only the class IDd gene in the D region of the H-2d haplotype, strongly suppresses resistance in H-2b/H-2dm2 heterozygotes, and the presence of Dd as a transgene significantly reduces the resistance of H-2b homozygotes. Since H-2b-associated resistance to FV appears to be due mainly to the capacity of Lb (also called Db), the only class I molecule encoded in the D region of the H-2b haplotype, to present viral epitopes for recognition by FV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes, suppression of resistance to FV by the Dd molecule implies that the presence of one class I molecule of the major histocompatibility complex can interfere with either the presentation of viral epitopes by another class I molecule or the generation of T cells that recognize viral epitopes so presented.","['Polsky, D', 'Lilly, F']","['Polsky D', 'Lilly F']","['Department of Molecular Genetics, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY 10461.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,['0 (H-2 Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology/*pathogenicity', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'H-2 Antigens/*genetics', 'Haplotypes', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mice, Mutant Strains', 'Species Specificity', 'Splenomegaly/immunology']",1991/10/15 00:00,1991/10/15 00:01,['1991/10/15 00:00'],"['1991/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.20.9243 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Oct 15;88(20):9243-7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.20.9243.,,"['CA19931/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P30-CA13330/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC52690,,,,,,,,

To investigate the pathogenesis of the thymic atrophy caused by ts1, we constructed a chimeric virus, ts1-Cas(NS), in which a major portion of the U3 region of the long terminal repeat of ts1, a T-lymphotropic and neurovirulent murine leukemia virus, was replaced by the corresponding U3 region of Cas-Br-E, a B-lymphotropic and neurovirulent murine leukemia virus. In FVB/N mice, ts1-Cas(NS) induced paralytic and wasting disease with incidence, severity, and latency similar to that induced by ts1, but it failed to cause thymic atrophy as severe as that observed in ts1-infected mice. Furthermore, thymocytes cultured from ts1-Cas(NS)-infected mice died at a much slower rate than those of ts1-infected mice. The U3 substitution in ts1-Cas(NS) specifically diminished the ability of the virus to replicate in the thymus, whereas viral replication in the spinal cord was not significantly affected; thus, neurovirulence was not changed. The correlation of reduced thymic atrophy with decreased thymic viral titers and the decreased ability of ts1-Cas(NS) to cause thymocyte death in mice suggest strongly that the marked thymic atrophy in ts1-infected mice is not an indirect effect occurring secondary to neurodegenerative and wasting disease but is a direct cytopathic effect of high-level viral replication in the thymus.","['Wong, P K', 'Szurek, P F', 'Floyd, E', 'Saha, K', 'Brooks, B R']","['Wong PK', 'Szurek PF', 'Floyd E', 'Saha K', 'Brooks BR']","['University of Texas M.

Reconstitution of wild-type p53 in the p53-nonproducer, Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B-cell line L12 gave rise to stably growing clones. Wild-type p53-producer derived cell lines exhibit an altered cell cycle, however. More cells with an extended G0/G1 phase were found than in the p53-nonproducer parental cell line. Furthermore, when injected into syngeneic mice, these cells induced a lower incidence of tumors and these tumors were less aggressive. Analysis of immunoglobulin expression revealed that wild-type p53 induced the expression of cytoplasmic immunoglobulin mu heavy chain. In addition, these derived cells lines exhibited increased levels of a B-cell-specific surface marker, B220. These results suggest that wild-type p53 may function as a cell differentiation factor that can induce development of pre-B cells into a more advanced stage in the pathway of B-cell maturation.

With radiation measurement, only one--the energy per unit mass D--is called dose. The other--the total energy in the irradiated system--is here distinguished from D by assigning it the name collective energy, epsilon. The collective energy is a more complete statement of dose because it is the product of the energy concentration D and the mass irradiated m. Especially in radioepidemiology, in which epsilon is the total energy imparted to all persons irradiated, the quantity m must be specified because it is situation specific and thus highly variable. At present, radioepidemiological dose-response curves are given only in terms of the toxicological model--i.e., the fraction (probability) of radiation-attributable cancers occurring as a function of D. Because this relation does not involve the number of persons at each value of D, it fosters the illusion that any dose, no matter how small, can result in cancer. However, we show that if the dose-response relationship is expressed in terms of the absolute number of attributable cancers as a function of epsilon, cancer occurs, on average, only if the collective energy exceeds a relatively large minimum value, the magnitude of which will be estimated. Therefore, we conclude that the nonthreshold aspect of the linear hypothesis is misleading and quite probably invalid. For example, in or around a facility in which exposure of humans to relatively low values of D occurs, attributable cancers are most unlikely to appear unless the epsilon to the irradiated population exceeds this minimum value.","['Bond, V P', 'Benary, V', 'Sondhaus, C A']","['Bond VP', 'Benary V', 'Sondhaus CA']","['Medical Department, Brookhaven National Laboratory, Upton, NY 11973.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,,IM,"['*Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Radiation Dosage', 'Radiation Monitoring']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.19.8666 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Oct 1;88(19):8666-70. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.19.8666.,,,,,,,PMC52570,,,,,,,,

The premature induction of apoptosis in cells harboring a deregulated c-myc gene suggests that apoptosis may be an important mechanism in the elimination of hematopoietic cells harboring mutations, such as constitutive c-myc expression, which imbalance normal cell cycle regulatory controls.","['Askew, D S', 'Ashmun, R A', 'Simmons, B C', 'Cleveland, J L']","['Askew DS', 'Ashmun RA', 'Simmons BC', 'Cleveland JL']","[""Department of Biochemistry, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tennessee 38105.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'EC 4.1.1.17 (Ornithine Decarboxylase)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Death', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Down-Regulation/*genetics', 'Enzyme Induction/genetics', 'G1 Phase', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/*genetics', 'Genes, myc/drug effects/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/pathology', 'Ornithine Decarboxylase/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Transfection']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1991 Oct;6(10):1915-22.,,['P30 CA21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Two new and 10 previously identified translocations all mapped within 25 kb on 11p13, the 11p13 T-cell translocation cluster (11p13 ttc). A search for expressed sequences surrounding the breakpoint cluster region on 11p13 identified a gene telomeric of all breakpoints which is overexpressed in three T-ALL samples with a t(11;14). The gene T-cell translocation gene (TTG-2) encodes a small cysteine-rich protein. Forty-eight per cent of the amino acids are identical with another translocation-deregulated gene, TTG-1 (T-cell translocation gene 1 or rhombotin) in 11p15. There are two copies of a cysteine-rich motif in both proteins. Two tandem copies of the same cysteine-rich motif are also present in the recently described lin-11, isl-1 and mec-3 gene products, and one motif is found in the CRIP protein. Therefore the proteins encoded by these two translocation-deregulated genes belong to this new class of cysteine-rich proteins with the 'LIM' motif, which are important in normal development.","['Royer-Pokora, B', 'Loos, U', 'Ludwig, W D']","['Royer-Pokora B', 'Loos U', 'Ludwig WD']","['Institut fur Humangenetik und Anthropologie, Heidelberg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Consensus Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1991 Oct;6(10):1887-93.,,,['TTG-2'],,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S59631', 'GENBANK/S59635', 'GENBANK/S59842', 'GENBANK/S62275', 'GENBANK/S74923', 'GENBANK/S74924', 'GENBANK/S74925', 'GENBANK/S74926', 'GENBANK/X57687', 'GENBANK/X59065']",,,

Mean amplitude of inward K+ currents was smaller with larger (1-10 microM) internal Ca2+ than with low (less than or equal to 100 nM) internal Ca2+, indicating that high concentrations of internal Ca2+ suppress channel activity. Single channel currents and the conductance of channels were not changed by high internal Ca2+ concentrations, but the open probability of the channels was decreased in these conditions.

To determine the magnitude of this risk and identify possible risk factors for the development of second neoplasms, we studied a large cohort of children treated for ALL. METHODS AND RESULTS. We undertook a retrospective cohort study of 9720 children who had been given a diagnosis of ALL between June 1972 and August 1988 and had been treated according to the therapeutic protocols of the Children's Cancer Study Group. The median follow-up was 4.7 years (range, 2 months to 16 years). We found that 43 second neoplasms occurred among the children in the cohort, including 24 neoplasms of the central nervous system, 10 new leukemias and lymphomas, and 9 other neoplasms. This represented a 7-fold excess of all cancers and a 22-fold excess of neoplasms of the central nervous system. The estimated cumulative proportion of children in whom a second neoplasm developed was 2.53 percent 15 years after diagnosis (95 percent confidence limits, 1.74 percent and 3.38 percent). An even higher risk, particularly of central nervous system tumors, was evident in children five years of age or less at the time of the diagnosis of ALL (P = 0.012). All central nervous system neoplasms developed in children who had previously undergone irradiation. There was no association with exposure to cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines. CONCLUSIONS: There is a substantial excess of second neoplasms, especially of the central nervous system, among children treated for ALL. Children five years old or younger and those receiving radiation are at higher risk, especially for second tumors arising in the central nervous system.","['Neglia, J P', 'Meadows, A T', 'Robison, L L', 'Kim, T H', 'Newton, W A', 'Ruymann, F B', 'Sather, H N', 'Hammond, G D']","['Neglia JP', 'Meadows AT', 'Robison LL', 'Kim TH', 'Newton WA', 'Ruymann FB', 'Sather HN', 'Hammond GD']","[""Children's Cancer Study Group, Arcadia, CA 91066-6012.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Central Nervous System Neoplasms/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', '*Neoplasms, Second Primary', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/mortality/*therapy', 'Radiotherapy/adverse effects', 'Time Factors']",1991/11/07 00:00,1991/11/07 00:01,['1991/11/07 00:00'],"['1991/11/07 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/07 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/07 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199111073251902 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1991 Nov 7;325(19):1330-6. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199111073251902.,,['CA 01240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have studied the implication of the PKC signaling pathway in the process of T cell activation by generating TPA resistant mutants of Jurkat. These mutants were obtained by recovery of cells that survived a growth arrest induced by TPA. Several cellular phenomena dependent on TPA were dramatically altered in the mutated cells. The mutants were unable to form homoaggregates upon TPA stimulation. Moreover, they did not produce interleukin-2 after activation through engagement of the T cell receptor, in the presence of TPA. These results suggest that the PKC signaling pathway activated by TPA is defective in these cells.

To target tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to tumor cells, recombinant antibody techniques were used to generate F(ab')2-like antibody-TNF fusion proteins. At the gene level, an antitransferrin receptor antibody heavy chain gene was linked to a synthetic gene coding for human TNF. The chimeric heavy chain-TNF genes were introduced into a light chain secreting transfectoma cell line, which was producing the light chain of the same antibody. Cell lines were isolated which secreted antibody-TNF fusion proteins of expected size and composition. Culture supernatant of these cell lines contained TNF cytotoxic activity towards murine L929 cells and human MCF-7 cells, indicating that TNF is still active in the fusion protein constructs. These results illustrate the feasibility of the antibody engineering technology to create and produce chimeric mouse-human immunotoxin-like molecules.

B. Leslie and J. W. Schrader, Mol. Cell. Biol. 9:2414-2423, 1989). The three classes of cell clones were characterized by distinct patterns of growth in vitro, the production of cytokines, and the presence of cytokine gene rearrangements. However, all three classes of WEHI-274 clones bore a common rearrangement of the c-myb gene, suggesting that all were derived from the one ancestral cell and that at least three distinct and independent autostimulatory events were involved in the progression of a single myeloid leukemic disease. In this article, we demonstrate that the autocrine growth factor production by the WEHI-274 leukemic clones resulted from cytokine gene activations mediated by the insertion of an intracisternal A-type particle (IAP) sequence 5' to the interleukin-3 (IL-3) gene, in the case of the class I clone, or 5' to the gene for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), in the case of the class II clones. IAPs are defective murine retroviruses encoded by endogenous genetic elements which may undergo transpositions and act as endogenous mutagens. The functional IL-3 and GM-CSF mRNAs were generated by mechanisms in which the splice donor apparatus of the IAP sequence has been used in IAP gag-to-IL-3 or -GM-CSF splicing events.","['Leslie, K B', 'Lee, F', 'Schrader, J W']","['Leslie KB', 'Lee F', 'Schrader JW']","['Biomedical Research Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)', '0 (Oligonucleotides, Antisense)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Exons', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes, Intracisternal A-Particle', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides', 'Oligonucleotides, Antisense', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.11.5562-5570.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Nov;11(11):5562-70. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.11.5562-5570.1991.,,,"['&lgr;-IAP81', 'IAP-IL3', 'IAP274', 'MIA14', 'XRPC24', 'igk-1']",,,,PMC361926,,,,,"['GENBANK/M64827', 'GENBANK/S43620', 'GENBANK/S59394', 'GENBANK/S59956', 'GENBANK/S59957', 'GENBANK/S59963', 'GENBANK/S59966', 'GENBANK/S59969', 'GENBANK/S59977', 'GENBANK/S59984']",,,

A 1.1-kb region of DNA surrounding the I epsilon promoter endows inducible transcription to a heterologous reporter gene stably transfected into these cells; such inducible expression depends on combined treatment with LPS and IL-4. Analyses of constructs transiently introduced into a B-cell lymphoma line demonstrated that LPS-plus-IL-4-inducible expression can be conferred by a 179-bp segment of DNA spanning the I epsilon transcriptional initiation site. Mutational analyses demonstrated that this expression depended on DNA sequences within a conserved region directly upstream from the I epsilon transcriptional initiation region. One nuclear protein that is constitutively expressed in normal B cells binds to the downstream end of the conserved sequence; its binding specificity correlates with the functional effect of several mutations.

To address the mechanism of mutagenesis, we reintroduced a cloned and therefore demethylated version of the Mov13 mutant allele into mouse fibroblasts.

Rather, this result strongly suggests that the mutation is due to the displacement or disruption of cis-acting regulatory DNA sequences within the first intron.

Using bacteriophage M13 single-strand DNA as a template, S6dGTP substituted efficiently for dGTP and stimulated DNA synthesis in reactions without dGTP, with DNA polymerases alpha, delta, and gamma from the human leukemia cell line K562. The apparent Km values for dGTP and S6dGTP were very similar, i.e., 1.2 microM each for polymerase alpha, 2.8 and 3.6 microM, respectively, for polymerase delta, and 0.8 microM each for polymerase gamma; however, the relative Vmax values for the modified nucleotide were 25-50% lower than those of the corresponding natural substrate. Using a highly sensitive electrophoretic assay of chain elongation across M13mp9 (+)-strand DNA by the aforementioned human DNA polymerases, S6dGTP was shown to be incorporated at the 3' end of the nascent growing DNA chain, and the patterns of chain extension with S6dGTP as substrate were identical to those obtained in the presence of dGTP. There were no major differences using S6dGTP in place of dGTP with these DNA polymerases; however, at higher concentrations (1-10 microM) the analog stimulated primer elongation in reactions without dATP, indicating some misincorporation at sites of S6G.T base pairs during DNA synthesis. Using p(dA)12-18 as the initiator for calf thymus terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase, S6dGTP inhibited the incorporation of all four natural deoxyribonucleoside 5'-triphosphates into the primer, in a competitive manner. The apparent Ki values for the analog were 6-20 times lower than the Km values for the four endogenous substrates. As a substrate, S6dGTP was added to the 3'-hydroxyl termini of primer, although tailing efficiency with the analog was lower than that in the presence of the natural substrate. These findings indicate that S6dGTP is a relatively good substrate for several mammalian DNA polymerases, including terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase.","['Ling, Y H', 'Nelson, J A', 'Cheng, Y C', 'Anderson, R S', 'Beattie, K L']","['Ling YH', 'Nelson JA', 'Cheng YC', 'Anderson RS', 'Beattie KL']","['Department of Experimental Pediatrics, University of Texas M.

Thus, individual 14-day CFU-GM colonies, obtained by growth of bone marrow cells from CML patients were removed from methylcellulose cultures and total RNA from each colony was isolated. First-strand complementary DNAs (cDNA) corresponding to all mRNAs in the sample were obtained by using random hexamers in a reverse transcription (RT) reaction. cDNA then served as the substrate in the PCR. To ensure the integrity of the RNA extracted from each colony, beta-actin and bcr/abl cDNA sequences were amplified in the same reaction vessel. Using this method, we have examined the colonies grown from three CML patients and found that 5 out of 5, 9 out of 9 and 8 out of 9 colonies contained a bcr/abl transcript.

We have studied B-CLL T-cell activation pathways in the rigorous absence of leukemic cells and with controlled numbers of accessory cells present. The responsiveness to added recombinant IL-1 and IL-2 was assessed. We have found that under optimal culture conditions B-CLL T cells had a normal PHA-induced proliferative response in terms of incorporated 3H-thymidine per T cell. Also the capacity of mitomycin-C treated B-CLL monocytes to support autologous T-cell mitogenesis was normal. However, a subtle difference between normal and B-CLL T cells emerged with respect to cytokine responsiveness. While the PHA response of purified normal T cells in the absence of monocytes was augmented by rIL-1, this could not be demonstrated for B-CLL T cells. A much greater degree of augmentation occurred with added rIL-2 in the case of both normal and B-CLL T cells. In the presence of 20% autologous monocytes rIL-1 and rIL-2 had no effect on mitogenesis. We conclude that B-CLL T cells have an abnormal profile of cytokine responsiveness which is consistent with observed abnormalities of subset distribution, and which may contribute to the clinical immunodeficiency in B-CLL.","['Briggs, P G', 'Kraft, N', 'Atkins, R C']","['Briggs PG', 'Kraft N', 'Atkins RC']","[""Department of Nephrology, Prince Henry's Hospital, Melbourne, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '50SG953SK6 (Mitomycin)']",IM,"['Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*drug therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mitomycin/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'Phytohemagglutinins/biosynthesis', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90470-e [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(9):859-65. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90470-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the S-phase DNA content of immunophenotypically defined BM subpopulations (CD2+; CD19+; CD2/CD19+; glycophorin-A+; CD14+; CD13+; CD33+ and CD13/CD33+) in 18 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), including three patients with M6 AML. The results were compared with the findings in twelve normal BM aspirates. The measurements were performed using a special protocol for bivariate FCM of DNA content and surface immunofluorescence (s-IF). In patients with AML the proportion of BM cells expressing the myelomonocytic and monocytic markers (M1-M5 AML) or erythroid marker (M6 AML) was expanded. However, in many patients other subpopulations were 4% or higher permitting the calculation of their S-phase DNA. No essential differences in median S-phase DNA percentages of the distinct subpopulations were observed between normal and leukemic bone marrow though the ranges in AML patients were much wider. These data suggest that AML is not characterized by an increased nor a decreased proliferation activity, but rather by a situation of cell growth independent to the normal regulatory mechanisms. Additional information was obtained upon DNA aneuploidy using CD2+ or CD2/CD19+ cells as an intrinsic DNA standard which allowed us to define differences in the DNA index as small as 2% as aneuploid. This approach appeared suitable for detecting small-degree numerical chromosomal aberrencies, as found by cytogenetics, in 4/6 cases.","['Brons, P', 'Pennings, A', 'Haanen, C', 'Wessels, H', 'Boezeman, J']","['Brons P', 'Pennings A', 'Haanen C', 'Wessels H', 'Boezeman J']","['Department of Hematology, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Glycophorins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', '*Aneuploidy', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Division', 'DNA/*biosynthesis', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Glycophorins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'S Phase/*physiology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90467-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(9):827-35. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90467-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We, therefore, conclude that the autocrine production of GM-CSF by leukaemia blasts is not dependent on gene rearrangement.","['Falcinelli, F', 'Onorato, M', 'Falzetti, F', 'Ciurnelli, R', 'Gabert, J', 'Mannoni, P', 'Martelli, M F', 'Tabilio, A']","['Falcinelli F', 'Onorato M', 'Falzetti F', 'Ciurnelli R', 'Gabert J', 'Mannoni P', 'Martelli MF', 'Tabilio A']","['Institute of Haematology, University of Perugia, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Genes', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'RNA, Neoplasm/metabolism']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90173-q [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(10):957-61. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90173-q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Changes in the antigen expression, immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion and the production of TNF and lymphotoxin (LT) were investigated. TNF induced expression of CD4 and CD71, increased the intensity of HLA-DR, CD25, CD11c and CD13 expression and decreased both the intensity and frequency of sIg and cIg positivity. alpha-IFN decreased CD25 expression, the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity (TRAP), reduced the TNF-induced CD4 and CD71 expression and antagonized the TNF effect on the Ig expression. Spontaneous TNF or LT production could not be detected in culture supernatants. However, TNF was found to induce LT production, an effect which alpha-IFN antagonized and IL-2 augmented. The reduction of CD25, TNF-induced CD71 and TRAP caused by alpha-IFN seems to represent a deactivation of the activated state of hairy cells (HCs). The failure of alpha-IFN to induce Ig secretion or CD38 expression in HCs speaks against a differentiation induction effect. The LT secretion induced by TNF suggests that other cytokines than TNF might be involved in the proliferation of HCs and that alpha-IFN by blocking the production of LT and perhaps other cytokines causes a growth arrest in HCs.","['Hassan, I B', 'Lantz, M', 'Sundstrom, C']","['Hassan IB', 'Lantz M', 'Sundstrom C']","['Department of Pathology, University Hospital, Uppsala, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*metabolism', 'Cytokines/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/*metabolism', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology/metabolism', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(91)90166-Q [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(91)90166-q [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(10):903-10. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90166-q.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although both fibrinolytic and fibrinogenolytic products were detected by the measurement of FDP, only fibrinolytic products were detected by the measurement of D-dimer. In patients with DIC and other thrombo-embolic diseases, plasma D-dimer levels were significantly higher than in normal persons. A significant positive correlation between plasma D-dimer and serum FDP was found in DIC patients. In patients with DIC associated with acute promyelocytic leukemia, which is thought to be an increased fibrinogenolysis state, serum FDP was higher than the plasma D-dimer which suggests that increased fibrinogenolysis affects the result of serum FDP measurement. Plasma D-dimer significantly increased 5 minutes after endoscopic embolization with thrombin in the patients with esophageal varices. However serum FDP increased 30 minutes after the treatment, which suggests that the D-dimer is more useful for rapid detection of coagulo-fibrinolytic change than serum FDP. Plasma D-dimer was significantly higher in patients with cerebral infarction and increased with age. These finding suggest the usefulness of plasma D-dimer measurement for the specific and rapid evaluation of coagulo-fibrinolytic activation and thrombo-embolic state.","['Suehiro, A', 'Koyama, T']","['Suehiro A', 'Koyama T']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Rinsho Byori,Rinsho byori.

These neoplasms arise following the appearance in the thymus of a recombinant retrovirus but can be prevented by thymectomy, indicating a role for both virus and elements of the thymic microenvironment in leukemogenesis. The intrathymic appearance of recombinant retrovirus was examined at ages leading up to leukemogenesis in order to identify and characterize the microenvironments in which the virus is first expressed. A stromal cell, the macrophage, was found to be the first thymic element to produce detectable levels of recombinant retrovirus, approximately 12 weeks before thymocytes. This observation provides a mechanism to reconcile viral leukemogenesis with the requirement for an intact thymus.

Infectivity for macrophages was more complex. All viruses replicated in macrophages to a low level, but viral sequences both inside and outside the V3 loop region influenced the efficiency of replication. Two experiments showed that the mechanism of restriction of infection of 1022 cells by HIV strain JR-CSF was related to lack of virus entry. First, productive virus infection occurred after transfection of 1022 cells with viral plasmid DNA. Second, the nonpermissive HIV strain JR-CSF could infect 1022 cells when pseudotyped with the envelope of other retroviruses, including human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), HTLV-II, and amphotropic murine leukemia virus.

These compounds were developed on the basis of the idea that ring opening and tautomerization to an enamine intermediate might provide a mechanistic alternative to the beta-elimination reaction for release of phosphoramide mustard. The 4,4,6-trimethyltetrahydro-1,3-oxazine moiety was selected on the basis of its rapid rate of iminium ion generation and relatively slow rate of hydrolysis. These analogues underwent phosphorodiamidate release by three distinct mechanisms: hydrolysis to aldophosphamide and subsequent beta-elimination; cyclization to produce the 4-hydroxycyclophosphamides, which release phosphorodiamidate by ring opening and elimination; and tautomerization to the enamine with rapid expulsion of phosphorodiamidate. Kinetic studies demonstrated that hydrolysis to the aldehyde contributed minimally to the overall activation process and that the enamine pathway represented the major route of activation. For those analogues that could undergo cyclization, this pathway competed effectively with enamine release, and these analogues were essentially equivalent to their 4-hydroxycyclophosphamide counterparts in cytotoxicity. A series of tetra-N-substituted phosphorodiamidates that cannot undergo cyclization was prepared to explore the effects of cyclization on the cytotoxicity of these analogues. The tetrakis(chloroethyl)phosphorodiamidates were highly potent in vitro against both cyclophosphamide-sensitive and -resistant L1210 and P388 cell lines, and one of these analogues had significant antitumor activity against L1210 leukemia in vivo. These results demonstrate that the enamine mechanism provides a viable pathway for delivery of phosphorodiamidates and that this approach can be used to deliver phosphorodiamidates that are non-cross-resistant in cyclophosphamide-resistant cell lines.","['Borch, R F', 'Valente, R R']","['Borch RF', 'Valente RR']","['Department of Chemistry, University of Rochester, New York 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '7AM2ILM9FI (aldophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis/therapeutic use', 'Cyclization', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/*chemistry/therapeutic use']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00114a014 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1991 Oct;34(10):3052-8. doi: 10.1021/jm00114a014.,,"['CA11198/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA34619/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This analogue was essentially inactive in vitro against L1210 and P388 leukemia cells. 6-Phenylcyclophosphamide and its 4-hydroperoxy derivative were potent inhibitors of blood acetylcholinesterase and were lethal at therapeutic doses in mice. In contrast, 4-hydroperoxy-6-(4-pyridyl)cyclophosphamide did not inhibit acetylcholinesterase and showed significant antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo against both wild-type and cyclophosphamide-resistant L1210 leukemia. The 4-hydroperoxy-6-arylcyclophosphamides were generally active in vitro against both wild-type and cyclophosphamide-resistant L1210 and P388 cells, and several analogues showed significant activity in vivo. Surprisingly, there was no correlation between antitumor activity in vitro and the rate of PDA release in aqueous buffer. Several compounds that showed essentially no release of PDA in aqueous buffer over several hours were highly cytotoxic to leukemia cells following a 1-h exposure in vitro.

At the melphalan dose of 90 mg/m2, grade greater than or equal to 3 regimen-related toxicity (RRT) was observed in five patients (31%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 11% to 59%), with hepatic (venoocclusive disease [VOD]) and urinary (hemorrhagic cystitis) RRT being the most frequent complications. Further escalation of the melphalan dose to 135 mg/m2 was deemed excessively toxic, as three of five patients had grade greater than or equal to 3 RRT. Following this experience, 21 patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) were treated with BUCY-2 plus melphalan 90 mg/m2 and AuBMT in separate studies. Three of these patients--all with extensively pretreated MM--had grade greater than or equal to 3 RRT (14%; 95% CI, 3% to 36%); no others had grade greater than or equal to 3 RRT. Therefore, a total of eight of the 37 patients (22%; 95% CI, 10% to 38%) who received BUCY-2 plus melphalan 90 mg/m2 conditioning developed grade greater than or equal to 3 RRT; three of these patients (8%; 95% CI, 3% to 25%) died of RRT. Although limited by the relatively small number of patients, our analysis of the patients receiving this regimen showed that the presence of parameters denoting the lymphoid diagnostic group (ie, ALL, NHL, and MM), more extensive pretreatment, and/or more advanced disease status were associated with a higher incidence of grade greater than or equal to 3 RRT. Response data on the AML, ALL, and NHL patients who received BUCY-2 plus melphalan 90 mg/m2 were analyzed: three patients (all with AML in first or second remission) are leukemia-free at 3.0, 2.8, and 1.4 years after AuBMT. The actuarial 2-year event-free survival in this group is 17% (95% CI, 5% to 54%). Response data on the MM and CML patients will be reported subsequently.

Prior combination chemotherapy had failed in all the patients, and all but five had been previously treated with both mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) and doxorubicin, bleomycin, and vinblastine with or without dacarbazine (ABV[D]). Thirty-four eligible patients received short-course conventional chemotherapy and/or involved-field radiotherapy before CBV. However, formal restaging was not performed after these conventional therapies; ie, the therapies were not used to select responding patients for transplantation, and all who received such therapy subsequently received CBV and autologous marrow grafts. Forty-four patients (80%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 69% to 91%) achieved a complete response after CBV and BMT. Performance status at protocol entry and the use of conventional cytoreduction therapy before CBV correlated with response. Median follow-up is now 3.5 years (range, 2.5 to 5.0 years). Kaplan-Meier estimates for overall and event-free survival 5 years after transplant are 53% (95% CI, 37% to 67%) and 47% (95% CI, 33% to 60%), respectively. In a univariate analysis, patients with a normal performance status and those without constitutional (""B"") symptoms at protocol entry had an improved overall and event-free survival. In a multivariate analysis, only a normal performance status remained significant. Disease progression occurred in 17 patients at an actuarial rate of 39% (95% CI; 26% to 56%) and occurred at previous sites of active disease in all but one patient; our analysis did not identify prognostic factors for progression. Toxic deaths, caused by either neutropenic sepsis or interstitial pneumonitis (IP), occurred in 12 patients (21%; 95% CI, 10% to 32%).

The cytoplasmic domain of CD6 contains two serine residues, one or both of which are substrates for phosphorylation during T cell activation. The extracellular domain of CD6 is significantly related to the extracellular domain of the human and mouse T cell antigen CD5, the cysteine-rich domain of the bovine and mouse type I macrophage scavenger receptor, the extracellular domain of the sea urchin spermatozoa protein that crosslinks the egg peptide speract, the mammalian complement factor 1, and the human lung tumor antigen L3.

Cleavage of XTT by dehydrogenase enzymes of metabolically active cells yields a highly colored formazan product which is water soluble. This feature obviates the need for formazan crystal solubilization prior to absorbance measurements, as required when using other tetrazolium salts such as MTT. Bioreduction of XTT by all the murine cells examined was not particularly efficient, but could be potentiated by addition of electron coupling agents such as phenazine methosulfate (PMS) or menadione (MEN). Optimal concentrations of PMS or MEN were determined for the metabolism of XTT by the T cell lines HT-2 and 11.6, NFS-60 a myeloid leukemia, MC/9 a mast cell line and mitogen activated splenic T cells. When used in combination with PMS, each of these cells generated higher formazan absorbance values with XTT than were observed with MTT. Thus the use of XTT in colorimetric proliferation assays offer significant advantages over MTT, resulting from reduced assay time and sample handling, while offering equivalent sensitivity.","['Roehm, N W', 'Rodgers, G H', 'Hatfield, S M', 'Glasebrook, A L']","['Roehm NW', 'Rodgers GH', 'Hatfield SM', 'Glasebrook AL']","['Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Co., Indianapolis, IN 46285.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '117038-70-7', '(2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-((phenylamino)carbonyl)-2H-tetrazoliu', 'm hydroxide)', '12001-79-5 (Vitamin K)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '299-11-6 (Methylphenazonium Methosulfate)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colorimetry/*methods', 'Coloring Agents', 'Concanavalin A', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Mast Cells/cytology', 'Methylphenazonium Methosulfate', 'Mice', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology', '*Tetrazolium Salts', 'Thiazoles', 'Vitamin K']",1991/09/13 00:00,1991/09/13 00:01,['1991/09/13 00:00'],"['1991/09/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/13 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/13 00:00 [entrez]']","['0022-1759(91)90114-U [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(91)90114-u [doi]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1991 Sep 13;142(2):257-65. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(91)90114-u.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple forms synthesized by U937 cells and their relationship to thioredoxin/adult T cell leukemia-derived factor.,2170-4,"Recently, our laboratory reported the purification and partial amino acid sequence of a 10-kDa eosinophil cytotoxicity-enhancing factor (ECEF) polypeptide from the U937 cell source. This cytokine enhanced human eosinophil antibody-dependent cytotoxic function by greater than 200% and was half-maximally effective at a concentration of approximately 1 ng/ml. In this study, we describe the conditions required for ECEF synthesis and the use of rabbit antibody raised to 10-kDa ECEF to investigate the existence of related polypeptide species. Unstimulated U937 cells released an immunoreactive 14-kDA species. Cells stimulated with 7.5 micrograms/ml of LPS also released a 13-kDa species. Cells stimulated with 400 ng/ml of PMA also synthesized a 10-kDa species (equivalent in size to the form we had purified). This 10-kDa species remained primarily cell associated, but detectable amounts were released into the supernatant by 48 h of culture. In washed cell pellets, the location of the 10-kDa species was found to be in the plasma membrane, externally oriented, as determined by FACS analysis, iodination with the membrane impermeable reagent 125I-sulfosuccinimidyl-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl) propionate, and by its removal with brief trypsin treatment. Partial amino acid sequence data suggested that the 14-, 13-, and 10-kDa species all share the same N-terminal. The 14- and 10-kDa ECEF species were recovered by electroelution from SDS-PAGE gels and tested for activity in the assay of eosinophil cytotoxic function. Because of the amino acid sequence similarities between the ECEF species and thioredoxin (TRX), rTRX (synthesized in Escherichia coli and purified) was also tested for activity. The 14-kDa ECEF and rTRX induced a slight, but consistent and statistically significant enhancement of eosinophil cytotoxic function. By comparison, lower doses of the 10-kDa ECEF induced a major increase in cytotoxic function. Thus the forms of ECEF differ in size, conditions required for synthesis, trafficking by the U937 cell after synthesis, and biologic activity. It is likely that these considerations bear on the involvement of ECEF in the pathophysiology of eosinophilia in vivo.","['Balcewicz-Sablinska, M K', 'Wollman, E E', 'Gorti, R', 'Silberstein, D S']","['Balcewicz-Sablinska MK', 'Wollman EE', 'Gorti R', 'Silberstein DS']","['Department of Medicine, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Cytokines)', '52500-60-4 (Thioredoxins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cytokines/*analysis/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Eosinophils/drug effects/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Rabbits', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Thioredoxins/*analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Oct 1;147(7):2170-4.,,"['AI-22532/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-24570/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-28525/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vivo data, however, reveal that where p53 has undergone genetic change in tumors, both alleles have been affected. We previously identified a case of human acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) in which both alleles of the p53 gene had undergone independent missense mutations (at codons 135 cys to ser and 246 met to val). In these blasts, p53 mutations appear to be acting recessively.

Both mutations from the AML blasts (codon 135 and codon 246) confer transforming ability on the mutant protein.

In the present study, we show that IL-6 production by AML blasts is up-regulated by endogenously produced IL-1 beta. Neutralization of the endogenous source of IL-1 results in a significant decrease in IL-6 production, as determined by ELISA. Conversely, exposure of AML blasts to IL-1 alpha results in a significant increase in IL-6 production in 10 of 16 patient samples. Antibodies against IL-1 alpha and -beta also cause a drastic decrease in IL-6 and GM-CSF gene expression by the cells, suggesting that cytokine gene expression in AML blasts is driven, at least in part, by endogenous IL-1. The biologic significance of IL-6 production in culture of AML blasts has been addressed using a neutralizing antibody against IL-6. Our data indicate that IL-6 is important for the survival of clonogenic blasts in culture. In contrast, the survival of the total population of blasts is IL-6-independent, as assessed by the integrity of cellular DNA, even in the presence of anti-IL-6. These observations are consistent with the view that AML blasts might be organized as a lineage, with comparable hierarchy as in normal hemopoiesis and, perhaps, increased heterogeneity despite a homogenous appearance (McCulloch and Till: Blood Cells 7:63-77, 1981; Buick and McCulloch: Control of Animal Cell Proliferation. Academic Press, New York, vol. 1, pp. 25-57, 1985). Buick and McCulloch have identified a subpopulation of AML clonogenic cells with stem-cell-like properties, and suggested that the majority of blasts may have undergone a determination-like step. Our data indicate a marked difference in IL-6 requirement for cell survival between precursors and the majority of blasts, suggesting that IL-6 responsiveness may decrease following a determination-like event, i.e., the reduction in proliferative capacity.","['Beauchemin, V', 'Villeneuve, L', 'Rodriguez-Cimadevilla, J C', 'Rajotte, D', 'Kenney, J S', 'Clark, S C', 'Hoang, T']","['Beauchemin V', 'Villeneuve L', 'Rodriguez-Cimadevilla JC', 'Rajotte D', 'Kenney JS', 'Clark SC', 'Hoang T']","['Clinical Research Institute of Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Blast Crisis/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/genetics/immunology/*physiology', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology/*pathology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041480305 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1991 Sep;148(3):353-61. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041480305.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Human thymocytes and all the leukemic T cell lines tested express both type I and II lck transcripts, albeit at different relative levels. Peripheral blood T cells express mainly type II lck transcripts, whereas two colonic carcinoma lines, COLO 201 and COLO 205, express exclusively type I lck transcripts. Treatment of the leukemic T cell lines, P30/OKUBO and Jurkat, by the phorbol esters tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) or phorbol dibutyrate (PDB) results in the down-regulation of the type I, and the up-regulation of the type II, lck transcript levels. The effect of PDB on the in vitro differentiation of Jurkat cells, and the expression of lck transcripts, is reversible. The modulation of lck transcript levels in TPA-treated Jurkat cells is not due to differential RNA stability, suggesting that the two lck promoters are utilized differentially during T cell differentiation. The leukemic T cell line, Jurkat, may thus serve as a model for the elucidation of molecular mechanisms that regulate lck transcription and T cell differentiation.","['Leung, S', 'Miyamoto, N G']","['Leung S', 'Miyamoto NG']","['Division of Cellular and Molecular Biology, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,"['0 (Oncogene Proteins, Viral)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.10.2 (Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck))', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colonic Neoplasms', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphocyte Specific Protein Tyrosine Kinase p56(lck)', 'Oncogene Proteins, Viral/genetics', 'Oncogenes/drug effects', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041480304 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1991 Sep;148(3):344-52. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041480304.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Agents known to reverse this pleiotropic drug resistance (chemosensitizers) have been shown to interact with P-gp; and as such, the inhibition of photoaffinity labeling by P-gp probes (such as [3H]azidopine) has been proposed as a basis for mass screening of chemosensitizers. In this study, we provide direct evidence that a novel calcium channel blocker (SR33557), which was 4.5 times more potent in sensitizing P388/ADR cells to doxorubicin as compared to verapamil (while inducing a similar increase in uptake and decrease in efflux of [14C]doxorubicin, did not compete for the [3H]azidopine-binding site on P-gp, whereas verapamil did. Moreover, SR33557, which is inherently photoactivable, did not photolabel P-gp, but a 65-kDa protein did appear to be an acceptor; and this binding was displaced by diltiazem and nifedipine, but not by verapamil. Finally, the implication for the participation of a sphingomyelin/sphingosine cycle (as a potential lipid second messenger system) in the chemosensitization of P388/ADR cells was investigated. 30 microM SR33557 induced a 72% inhibition in acid lysosomal sphingomyelinase activity, a 5-fold increase in sphingosine levels, and a 75% inhibition in intracellular protein kinase C activity. Although no direct link is established between these observations and P-gp activity, further studies on a possible sphingosine-mediated regulation of P-gp may yield information on the involvement of this second messenger system in the action of SR33557.","['Jaffrezou, J P', 'Herbert, J M', 'Levade, T', 'Gau, M N', 'Chatelain, P', 'Laurent, G']","['Jaffrezou JP', 'Herbert JM', 'Levade T', 'Gau MN', 'Chatelain P', 'Laurent G']","['Laboratoire de Pharmacologie et de Toxicologie Fondamentales, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique 8221, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Calcium Channel Blockers)', '0 (Indolizines)', '0 (Phenethylamines)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'KU213XYO69 (fantofarone)', 'NGZ37HRE42 (Sphingosine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium Channel Blockers/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Indolizines/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Phenethylamines/antagonists & inhibitors/*pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Second Messenger Systems', 'Sphingosine/analysis', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1991/10/15 00:00,1991/10/15 00:01,['1991/10/15 00:00'],"['1991/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)55070-5 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Oct 15;266(29):19858-64.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Studies of the Op18 gene are of particular interest because of the proposed role of Op18 protein in signal transduction and because of its occurrence in markedly increased amounts in acute leukemia cells. We have recently reported the cloning and sequencing of two cDNA clones for Op18 (1 and 1.5 kilobases). Both clones code for the same 149-amino acid polypeptide; however, they differ in their 3'-region as a result of alternative polyadenylation. We report here the sequencing of the Op18 gene and describe its expression in leukemia. The Op18 gene, which is 6.3 kilobases in length, is comprised of five exons and four introns and exhibits features that are common to other genes involved in cellular growth and proliferation. The increase in Op18 polypeptide in leukemia is associated with increased RNA transcription without gene amplification or rearrangement. Treatment of K562 leukemia cell line with hemin that induces terminal differentiation resulted in decreased expression of Op18. Our findings suggest that the high amount of Op18 protein in acute leukemia results from increased expression of a structurally unaltered gene.","['Melhem, R F', 'Zhu, X X', 'Hailat, N', 'Strahler, J R', 'Hanash, S M']","['Melhem RF', 'Zhu XX', 'Hailat N', 'Strahler JR', 'Hanash SM']","['University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Microtubule Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (STMN1 protein, human)', '0 (Stathmin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', '*Microtubule Proteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*genetics', 'Phosphoproteins/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Stathmin']",1991/09/25 00:00,1991/09/25 00:01,['1991/09/25 00:00'],"['1991/09/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)55189-9 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Sep 25;266(27):17747-53.,,"['CA26803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32146/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['Op18'],,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M31303', 'GENBANK/M68976', 'GENBANK/M68977', 'GENBANK/M68978', 'GENBANK/M68979', 'GENBANK/M68980', 'GENBANK/M68981', 'GENBANK/M68982', 'GENBANK/M68983', 'GENBANK/S56448']",,,

Using an immunofluorescence technique, we determined the localization of nucleophosmin (protein B23) in HL-60 cells after incubation with DOX in the absence and presence of DPM. Bright nucleolar fluorescence was observed in control HL-60 cells. The addition of DOX (0.1-0.25 micrograms/ml) in the culture system resulted in time- and dose-dependent induction of nucleophosmin translocation from the nucleolus to nucleoplasm and inhibition of cell growth. DPM (5 microM) alone had no effect on nucleophosmin translocation and inhibition of cell growth. However, the addition of DPM to the cells enhanced DOX-stimulated translocation of nucleophosmin. There was a good correlation between the DPM enhancement of DOX-induced nucleophosmin translocation and the increased inhibition of cell growth. The cell number decreased to a greater extent within a shorter time period under treatment with DOX in the presence of DPM. Short exposure (0.5 hr) of HL-60 cells to DOX induced dose-response nucleophosmin translocation and cell growth inhibition. Such effects of a short exposure to DOX were also enhanced by DPM (5 microM) included in the fresh medium after removal of DOX. This was in agreement with the observation that DPM could increase the cellular DOX by inhibiting the drug efflux from the cells. These results demonstrate that DPM, being able to increase and retain the intracellular levels of DOX, can markedly enhance the cytotoxicity of DOX, and suggest possible clinical application. ""Nucleophosmin translocation"", as observed by immunofluorescence, could be useful in determining the efficacy of combinations of DOX and DPM in cancer chemotherapy.","['Yung, B Y', 'Chang, F J', 'Luo, K J']","['Yung BY', 'Chang FJ', 'Luo KJ']","['Department of Pharmacology, Chang Gung Medical College, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (NPM1 protein, human)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Phosphoproteins)', '117896-08-9 (Nucleophosmin)', '64ALC7F90C (Dipyridamole)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)']",IM,"['Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dipyridamole/*pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Nucleophosmin', 'Phosphoproteins/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1991/10/21 00:00,1991/10/21 00:01,['1991/10/21 00:00'],"['1991/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910490421 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1991 Oct 21;49(4):592-7. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910490421.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to overcome this problem we have investigated the interaction of ARA-C with 3-deazauridine (3-DU) against HL-60 myeloid leukemic cells. 3-DU is an interesting agent to use in combination with ARA-C, since drug-resistant cells that are deficient in deoxycytidine kinase are very sensitive to this uridine analogue. We have observed that for both short and long drug exposure there was a potent synergistic interaction between ARA-C and 3-DU with respect to their cytotoxic effects on HL-60 leukemic cells. This synergy could be explained by an increased cellular uptake of ARA-C to ARA-CTP by the leukemic cells in the presence of 3-DU, due to the reduction in the pool of dCTP produced by this latter analogue. Since dCTP is a potent feedback inhibitor of the phosphorylation of ARA-C by deoxycytidine kinase, the reduction in the dCTP produced by 3-DU results in an increased rate of phosphorylation of the arabinosyl analogue. Our results suggest that ARA-C and 3-DU may be an interesting drug combination to circumvent drug resistance in the chemotherapy of acute leukemia.","['Momparler, R L', 'Bouffard, D Y', 'Momparler, L F', 'Marquet, J', 'Zittoun, J', 'Marie, J P', 'Zittoun, R']","['Momparler RL', 'Bouffard DY', 'Momparler LF', 'Marquet J', 'Zittoun J', 'Marie JP', 'Zittoun R']","['Departement de pharmacologie, Universite de Montreal, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,"['0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '263CU738ZY (3-Deazauridine)', 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)']",IM,"['3-Deazauridine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute']",1991/10/21 00:00,1991/10/21 00:01,['1991/10/21 00:00'],"['1991/10/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/21 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/21 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910490417 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1991 Oct 21;49(4):573-6. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910490417.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a continuation of previous reports, we now present data showing that cholesterol concentration modulates EL toxicity in the K562, U937 and MOLT4 leukemic cell lines in vitro. Cells become sensitive to otherwise ineffective doses of EL when their cholesterol content is lowered. Cell cholesterol levels were reduced by exposure to an egg lipid mixture (neutral glycerides, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine, AL721).

These donor-host combinations were selected after evaluation of GVHD triggered by minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) in 24 allogeneic strain combinations derived from six strains of H-2b mice. Recipients (n = 475), previously submitted to total body irradiation (9.5 Gy), were transplanted with 10(7) bone marrow cells along with 5 x 10(7) spleen cells. While lethal GVHD was observed in half of the strain combinations, it was possible to select 12 donor-host combinations characterized by severe, mild, or absent GVHD. When levels of anti-host CTL activity were assessed following in vivo priming and in vitro boosting, strong CTL-mediated cytotoxicity was observed in all combinations whether they developed GVHD or not. CTL frequency measured by limiting dilution analysis (LDA) ranged from 1/16880-1/306. The Spearman rank test revealed no positive correlation between GVHD intensity and donor anti-host CTL activity assayed either in bulk culture experiments or in LDA conditions. These results indicate that MiHA capable of triggering potent CTL responses in vitro do not necessarily initiate GVHD, and that in vitro measurement of donor CTL activity against host-type Con A blasts is not a predictive assay for anti-MiHA GVHD. However, the possibility to recruit CTL populations targeting host MiHA expressed specifically on hematopoietic cells suggests a novel therapeutic strategy for the cure of hematopoietic malignancies. Indeed, transplantation of donor hematopoietic stem cells supplemented with T cells aimed at MiHA specifically expressed by host hematopoietic cells, could possibly potentiate the desirable graft vs leukemia effect without increasing the risk of GVHD.","['Fontaine, P', 'Langlais, J', 'Perreault, C']","['Fontaine P', 'Langlais J', 'Perreault C']","['Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,['0 (Minor Histocompatibility Antigens)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*diagnosis', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Minor Histocompatibility Antigens/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00215256 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunogenetics. 1991;34(4):222-6. doi: 10.1007/BF00215256.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine its function in vivo in multiple cell types, we have used two transgenic mouse lines in which tax is expressed under the control of the LTR (LTRtax) or murine Thyl. 2 (Thytax) transcriptional regulatory sequences. Tax protein is expressed in fibroblasts, salivary gland, skeletal muscle, bone matrix and thymus tissue. In these tissues the expression of endogenous IL-2R, c-fos, GM-CSF, Zif268, IL-6, and PDGF-B were studied. In fibroblastic tumors GM-CSF, IL-6, PDGF-B, Zif268, c-fos were expressed at high levels.

The same two proteins were precipitated after biosynthetic labeling with (35S)-methionine from B cells and, to a lesser extent, from T cells.

In vitro, JCML peripheral blood granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-GM) demonstrate the unique characteristic of ""spontaneous"" proliferation at very low cell densities in the absence of exogenous growth factors. The ""spontaneous"" CFU-GM proliferation can be abolished by prior adherent cell (monocyte) depletion, suggesting a paracrine mode of cellular proliferation. Although previous studies using a [3H]thymidine ([3H]TdR) incorporation assay suggested an important role for granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in JCML, many non-growth factor-related reasons for [3H]TdR incorporation and the relatively low level of inhibition of [3H]TdR uptake left those conclusions open to question. Therefore, we performed clonal CFU-GM assays, which more specifically reflect cytokine effects on CFU-GM, using JCML peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNC) and neutralizing antibodies against GM-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating (M-CSF), interleukin 3 (IL-3), interleukin 1 alpha (IL-1 alpha), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta), interleukin 4 (IL-4), interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and interferon gamma (IFN gamma). Cultures containing anti-GM-CSF alone inhibited ""spontaneous"" JCML CFU-GM by 87% +/- 9% (mean +/- standard error of the mean [SEM]). No other anti-cytokine antibody produced a significant inhibition of CFU-GM growth. Various combinations of antibodies, excluding anti-GM-CSF, failed to demonstrate any synergistic inhibitory effects upon CFU-GM. Because this apparent paracrine cellular stimulation could be due to excessive cytokine production, by monocytes or other accessory cells, we examined cytokine levels in conditioned media from various JCML cell populations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs). Monocytes from only a minority of JCML patients produced higher than normal quantities of GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and/or TNF alpha, but no obvious pattern could be discerned. Further, only 7 of 15 JCML monocyte-conditioned media (MCM) had elevated GM-CSF, and 6 of 15 JCML patients had normal levels of all nine cytokines tested. The monocyte depletion experiments and the inhibition experiments with anti-cytokine antibodies taken together demonstrate clearly that the ""spontaneous"" growth of JCML CFU-GM in vitro critically depends on at least one monocyte-derived growth factor, GM-CSF.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Emanuel, P D', 'Bates, L J', 'Zhu, S W', 'Castleberry, R P', 'Gualtieri, R J', 'Zuckerman, K S']","['Emanuel PD', 'Bates LJ', 'Zhu SW', 'Castleberry RP', 'Gualtieri RJ', 'Zuckerman KS']","[""Department of Medicine, Children's Hospital of Alabama, Birmingham.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Antibodies', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cytokines/biosynthesis', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/biosynthesis/physiology', 'Granulocytes/*pathology', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/immunology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism']",1991/11/01 00:00,1991/11/01 00:01,['1991/11/01 00:00'],"['1991/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1991 Nov;19(10):1017-24.,,"['CA13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25408/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK07488/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The response rate was 79% for cases of pneumonia and 63% for cases of bacteremia. Only 50% of the microbiologically documented infections caused by gram-positive organisms responded whereas 95% of gram-negative infections, including all of those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, responded. Response rates were lower among patients whose neutrophil counts decreased during therapy than among those whose neutrophil counts increased (64% vs. 85%, p = 0.008). Side-effects that were possibly or probably related to antibiotic therapy were observed during 11% of the episodes. The most common side-effects were diarrhea and rashes including one case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Three patients developed a coagulopathy during therapy. Cefoperazone plus aztreonam proved to be an effective combination for treatment of gram-negative infections and fever of unknown origin in cancer patients and an every 8-hour schedule of administration was as effective as an every 4-hour schedule.

We show that after the cells were purified, 45-56% of the total receptors were on the cell surface. In the absence of transferrin, unoccupied receptors are quickly internalized (rate constant, 0.12 min-1) whereas their recycling is much slower (rate constant, 0.026 min-1). This difference between endocytosis and recycling rates leads to a balanced receptor distribution with only 22% of the total receptors outside after incubation of the cells for 20-30 min at 37 degrees C. The internalization rate of occupied receptors, measured in the presence of transferrin is faster (rate constant, 0.21 min-1) than that of unoccupied receptors calculated in the absence of transferrin (0.12 min-1; see above). On the other hand, mere binding of transferrin to its receptor, without internalization, arrested by cytoplasm acidification, is sufficient to induce a large increase (by a factor of seven) in the recycling rate of unoccupied internal receptors from 0.026 min-1 to 0.17 min-1. Thus, in these lymphocytes, transferrin mobilizes internal receptors by modifying the kinetic rates of internalization and recycling, leading to a new equilibrium between external and internal receptors.","['Sainte-Marie, J', 'Vidal, M', 'Bette-Bobillo, P', 'Philippot, J R', 'Bienvenue, A']","['Sainte-Marie J', 'Vidal M', 'Bette-Bobillo P', 'Philippot JR', 'Bienvenue A']","['CNRS URA 530, Departement Biologie-Sante, USTL, Montpellier, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/metabolism', '*Endocytosis', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Temperature', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb16287.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1991 Oct 1;201(1):295-302. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb16287.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The enzyme from each source can accommodate various types of proteins (protein kinase A, virus structural gag protein or pp60src) as modelized by the use of their N-terminal derived peptides (GNAAAARR, GQTVTTPL and GSSKSKPKDP, respectively). As for some other types of membrane-bound enzymes, NMT activity can be enhanced by pretreatment with various types of detergents, amongst which Triton 770 and deoxycholate were the most potent. Further experiments on the L1210 microsome-rich fractions demonstrate that these two detergents were able to solubilize the microsomal enzyme, without modifying its substrate specificity. Finally, three compounds described in the literature to be inhibitors of NMT activity from other sources were tested for L1210 microsome-associated activity.

KTZ inhibited [3H]-thymidine incorporation in the tumor cells in vitro; 50% inhibition of DNA synthesis was observed at concentrations of 4-7 micrograms/ml. [3H]-thymidine uptake in bone-marrow and spleen cells prepared from healthy mice was also inhibited by KTZ, but 50% inhibition was observed only at a concentration of 50 micrograms/ml. Stimulation of spleen cells with concanavalin A led to an increase in their sensitivity to the inhibition of DNA synthesis by KTZ. The tumor-cell lines varied in their sensitivity to the inhibition of DNA synthesis by TFP, and the effects of TFP on DNA synthesis in bone-marrow and spleen cells were similar to those observed in the tumor cells. Synergistic, additive, or less than additive effects of the drug combinations on the inhibition of DNA synthesis in vitro were observed both in tumor cells and in bone-marrow cells. In vivo experiments were conducted on groups of C57BL/6 (B6) mice that were inoculated s.c. with tumor cells and then treated with i.p. injections of KTZ, TFP or both. Control groups were injected with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Each of the drugs alone as well as their combinations caused a significant delay in the appearance of palpable tumors, a decrease in tumor size, and a marked prolongation of survival. The concentrations of the drugs used in in vivo experiments did not affect the WBC counts in the peripheral blood of healthy mice. KTZ is currently used for the treatment of prostatic cancer because of its inhibitory effect on testosterone biosynthesis.

Sandw. on the basis of bioactivity-guided fractionation and confirmed to mediate a potent cytotoxic response with cultured P-388 cells. We presently report a detailed isolation procedure and the results of studies designed to examine its mechanism of action. By means of a Michael-type addition, stizophyllin formed adducts with nucleophilic substances such as L-cysteine and beta-mercaptoethanol. The adduct with beta-mercaptoethanol was isolated, structurally characterized, and found to be 20-fold less cytotoxic than stizophyllin. Stizophyllin interacted with DNA, but no mutagenicity was observed with Salmonella typhimurium strain TM677 or cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells, and no in vitro reaction occurred with guanosine. Relative to control cell cultures, the total biosynthesis of DNA, RNA or protein was reduced when P-388 cells were treated with stizophyllin. However, the cell number did not increase in the presence of inhibitory stizophyllin concentrations (e.g., 4 micrograms/ml), and the DNA content (per cell) actually doubled after approximately 48 h. Consistent with this, stizophyllin blocked the cells in the G2 + M compartment of the cycle, and the block appeared to be specific for the G2 phase. Accordingly, stizophyllin did not modulate in vitro tubulin polymerization reactions nor did it affect the morphology of dibutyryl cAMP-treated astrocytoma cells in culture. These data suggest that the cytotoxic activity of stizophyllin is mediated by covalent reaction with a cellular component (such as a sulfhydryl-containing protein) by means of a Michael-type addition. Based on the cell-cycle specificity of the response, it appears that this interaction prevents the cells from progressing through mitosis.","['Duh, C Y', 'Kinghorn, A D', 'Pezzuto, J M']","['Duh CY', 'Kinghorn AD', 'Pezzuto JM']","['Program for Collaborative Research in the Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Illinois, Chicago 60612.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Chem Biol Interact,Chemico-biological interactions,0227276,"['0 (Mutagens)', '0 (Pregnatrienes)', '0 (Tubulin)', '109237-00-5 (stizophyllin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Astrocytoma', 'CHO Cells', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cricetinae', 'DNA/biosynthesis/drug effects', 'DNA Replication/*drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388', 'Mice', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*pharmacology', '*Plants, Medicinal', 'Pregnatrienes/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tubulin/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-2797(91)90030-B [pii]', '10.1016/0009-2797(91)90030-b [doi]']",ppublish,Chem Biol Interact. 1991;80(1):43-56. doi: 10.1016/0009-2797(91)90030-b.,,['R01 CA33047/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

In matching control studies, there was no increase in the frequency of neurite contact with cells of the rat plasmacytoma line (YB2/0): these were not selected as targets, and contacts were broken if formed. Time-lapse records of the derivation of neurites from their path suggested a neurotropic effect of mast cells, with neurite contact ensuing when the intervening distance was less than 36 +/- 4 microns. Once formed, contacts were invariably maintained throughout the period of examination (up to 72 h), in contrast to YB2/O or fibroblast contacts. We conclude that neurons selectively form and maintain connections with cells representative of rat connective tissue-type and mucosal mast cells in vitro. Similar interactions in vivo could promote nerve/mast cell contacts, which may allow bidirectional communication between the nervous and immune systems.","['Blennerhassett, M G', 'Tomioka, M', 'Bienenstock, J']","['Blennerhassett MG', 'Tomioka M', 'Bienenstock J']","['Department of Pathology, McMaster University Health Sciences Center, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cell Tissue Res,Cell and tissue research,0417625,,IM,"['Animals', 'Animals, Newborn/physiology', 'Cell Communication/*physiology', 'Cell Membrane/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Fibroblasts/pathology/ultrastructure', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Mast Cells/*cytology/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Neurons/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Plasmacytoma/pathology', 'Rats', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/*cytology/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Time Factors']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00318146 [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Res. 1991 Jul;265(1):121-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00318146.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we examined the ability of AS101 to protect mice bone marrow colony forming units-granulocyte-macrophage treated in vitro with various doses of ASTA-Z 7557, a potent derivative of cyclophosphamide. We demonstrate that prior incubation with AS101 protects colony forming units-granulocyte-macrophage from toxic effects of ASTA-Z. This protection can also be conferred by injection of mice with AS101 prior to incubation of their bone marrow in vitro with ASTA-Z. Prior incubation with AS101 was shown not to protect K562 leukemic cells or HL-60 cells from the toxic effects of ASTA-Z. We show that AS101 protection from the toxic effects of ASTA-Z in vitro and CTX in vivo can be partially ascribed to increased aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity induced by AS101. This was shown directly by measuring cellular ALDH activity and indirectly by measuring the toxicity of ASTA-Z and CTX in the presence of cyanamide, an inhibitor of ALDH. AS101 is also demonstrated in this study to protect spleen cells from the toxic effects of 5-fluorouracil, probably through a different mechanism. These properties of AS101 make it a useful candidate for increasing the qualitative potential of bone marrow used for autologous transplantation after purging with ASTA-Z. In addition, the results suggest an increase in ALDH activity by AS101 as one of the mechanisms of protection from the toxic effects of ASTA-Z and CTX. However, the chemoprotectiveness of AS101 was found not to be restricted to cyclophosphamide, since as shown in this study, AS101 helped by other mechanisms to reconstitute the number of spleen cells after 5-fluorouracil treatment.","['Kalechman, Y', 'Barkai, I S', 'Albeck, M', 'Horwith, G', 'Sehagl, S N', 'Sredni, B']","['Kalechman Y', 'Barkai IS', 'Albeck M', 'Horwith G', 'Sehagl SN', 'Sredni B']","['C.A.I.R.

Inhibition of isolated L1210 TS by ICI D1694 is mixed noncompetitive (although tending toward competitive), with a Ki of 62 nM (Kies = 960 nM). The synthetic gamma-polyglutamates are up to 2 orders of magnitude more potent as inhibitors of TS; e.g., the tetraglutamate (glu4) has a Ki of 1.0 nM (Kies = 15 nM). Although inhibitory activity of ICI D1694 toward rat liver dihydrofolate reductase was similar to that of TS (Ki = 92 nM; competitive inhibition) the polyglutamate derivatives did not show enhanced activity. ICI D1694 was also a very potent inhibitor of L1210 cell growth (50% inhibitory activity = 8 nM). L1210 growth inhibition was not observed in the presence of thymidine, consistent with TS being the locus of action. Folinic acid antagonized L1210 growth inhibition in a competitive fashion such that the highest folinic acid concentration used (25 microM) increased the 50% inhibitory activity 6000-fold. When given as a 4-h delayed ""rescue"", folinic acid was much less effective in antagonizing growth inhibition. These observations are consistent with folinic acid competing with ICI D1694 for uptake into the cell and/or intracellular polyglutamation. The L1210:1565 cell line, which has greatly impaired reduced-folate/methotrexate transport and thus is resistant to methotrexate, was significantly cross-resistant to ICI D1694 (121-fold), suggesting that ICI D1694 is dependent on this uptake mechanism for good cytotoxic potency in L1210 cells. L1210 cells that were incubated for 4 h with 0.1 microM 3H-ICI D1694 accumulated approximately 1.5 microM intracellular 3H, and the high performance liquid chromatography analysis of the cell extracts demonstrated that 96% of the 3H was associated with the ICI D1694 polyglutamate fractions (principally glu4). Upon resuspension in drug-free medium for 24 h, approximately 75% of the cellular 3H was retained, this being the higher polyglutamate pool (glu4-6). In mice, after a single bolus injection of 10 mg/kg of ICI D1694, TS was inhibited greater than 80% for 24 h in ascitic L1210:NCI cells (as measured by the rate of 3H release from [5-3H]deoxyuridine). ICI D1694 cured the L1210:ICR ascitic tumor in mice at 0.4 mg/kg daily for 5 days (maximum tolerated dose, approximately 50 mg/kg).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Jackman, A L', 'Taylor, G A', 'Gibson, W', 'Kimbell, R', 'Brown, M', 'Calvert, A H', 'Judson, I R', 'Hughes, L R']","['Jackman AL', 'Taylor GA', 'Gibson W', 'Kimbell R', 'Brown M', 'Calvert AH', 'Judson IR', 'Hughes LR']","['Drug Development Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Quinazolines)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '0 (Thiophenes)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'FCB9EGG971 (raltitrexed)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/pharmacology', 'Glutamates/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Quinazolines/metabolism/*pharmacology', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Thiophenes/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1991/10/15 00:00,1991/10/15 00:01,['1991/10/15 00:00'],"['1991/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Oct 15;51(20):5579-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to evaluate the possibility of using this drug for local treatment of cancer, Vinorelbine-loaded bioresorbable polymeric implants were prepared using a copolymer of D,L-lactic and glycolic acids (PLA 37.5 GA 25). According to the manufacturing process, the 1.2-mm-diameter cylindrical rods obtained had a drug content of 1, 5, or 20% (w/w) and released half of their content within about 6 days in vitro. In vivo release in rats was slower, half of the drug being released after about 14 days. A dose-dependent antitumoral effect was observed in mice (solid P388 leukemia model) when implants were administered into or in contact with the tumor. At highest drug loads and when administered soon after tumor implantation, Vinorelbine implants were more effective than i.v. administration (median survival time of treated animals related to untreated controls, greater than 360 versus 188). In dogs, results of toxicity experiments revealed that administration of implants in vital organs must be avoided. On the contrary, s.c. administration was well tolerated. A transient local necrosis was observed in the days following implantation, but normal skin was recovered after about 10 weeks. Thus, a clinical trial was conducted on patients with head and neck cancer; implantation of 20% loaded polymeric implants into the tumor sites succeeded in 8 of 9 patients. The sole failure was attributed to the unusual hardness of the tumor tissue. Except for a local transient inflammatory reaction (easily treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents), no other sign of toxicity was detected, and patients tolerated the device well. Fourteen days after implantation, patients underwent their planned surgery, and the implants were recovered. Residual drug content varied from 24 to 55%. In all cases, there was a clearly delimited necrotic area around the implant, ranging from 0.5 to 3.5 cm in diameter. In the smallest tumors, necrosis was also observed in the normal tissue inside this area.

Under these conditions there was significant high-affinity binding activity in r- extracts assayed at 4 degrees C but not at 23 degrees C. Loss of binding at 23 degrees C was not a function of GR proteolysis or denaturation of the steroid-binding site and could be prevented by the addition of sodium molybdate. Dissociation of ligand from either activated or unactivated receptors in r- extracts was significantly more rapid than from receptors in extracts prepared from normal cells, suggesting that the defect in receptors in r- cells is the result of mutation in the ligand-binding site. While the rate of dissociation from unactivated receptors in r- extracts was linear, dissociation from receptors in extracts of 6TG1.1 cells was biphasic. Analysis of these dissociation curves, as well as dissociation from receptors in the B-cell line IM-9, indicated that the mutant gene present in r- cells is also present in the dexs parental cell line.

We have used two promonocytic leukemia cell lines, U937 and HL-CZ, which differ in their differentiation antigen expression. While both cell lines express CD15 antigen, only the former expresses both CD4 and CD10 antigens. These phenotypes suggest that these two cell lines appear to be arrested at different stages of differentiation. Some regions of the long terminal repeat (LTR) of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) contain nucleotide sequences which bind cellular trans-activating factors such as NF-kappa B and Sp1. These sequences are also present in cellular regulatory gene sequences. The cell lines have been transfected by electroporation with a nested series of deletion mutants containing different lengths of the promoter/enhancer region for HIV-LTR. The promoter/enhancer region has been linked to a 'reporter' chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) gene. We have found that promoter/enhancer trans-activation is markedly enhanced by treating transfected cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), while similar treatment with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) slightly enhanced activation. U937 cells always showed much greater transactivating activities than did HL-CZ cells. Deletion of a negative regulatory element (NRE) from the LTR resulted in an enhanced transactivation, while deletions affecting NF-kappa B and/or Sp1 binding sites markedly reduced transactivation. Deletion of both NRE and NRF, a second negative regulatory factor binding site, from the LTR restored the transactivation. However, in the presence of TPA, deletion of NRE sequence without concomitant deletion of the downstream NRF binding sequence was sufficient for recovering transactivation. Since these two cell lines have shown subtle differences in these responses, it may be speculated that monocytes at different stages of differentiation may respond in different ways, qualitatively and/or quantitatively, to signal transduction factors involved in the transactivation of cellular genes.","['Chang, K S', 'Liu, W T', 'Josephs, S F']","['Chang KS', 'Liu WT', 'Josephs SF']","['Medical Research Center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan, Taiwan, Republic of China.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Ireland,Cancer Lett,Cancer letters,7600053,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'HIV Long Terminal Repeat/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics/immunology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcriptional Activation/drug effects/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-3835(91)90051-I [pii]', '10.1016/0304-3835(91)90051-i [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Lett. 1991 Oct;60(1):75-83. doi: 10.1016/0304-3835(91)90051-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The toxicity of these agents precludes the achievement of sufficient levels in the serum to circumvent efficiently the MDR in vivo. The authors previously demonstrated that quinine, the widely used antimalarial agent, is able to reverse primary resistance of rat colon cancer cells to anthracyclines. In this report, the efficiency of quinine formiate in reversing the doxorubicin (ADM) (Adriamycin, Adria Laboratories, Columbus, OH) resistance of the well-defined MDR human leukemic cell line K562/ADM was demonstrated. In culture medium, quinine is slightly less effective than verapamil in increasing the cytotoxicity and uptake of ADM when both drugs are used at the same concentration. A nontoxic dose of 5 micrograms/ml is necessary to reverse the MDR in K562/ADM cells. In patients receiving quinine formiate in a continuous intravenous infusion, a significant correlation (r = 0.84) was found between the serum levels of quinine and the ability of sera to increase ADM uptake in K562/ADM cells. When quinine is administered at a conventional dose (25 to 30 mg/kg/d), serum levels consistently reach more than 8 micrograms/ml without severe side effects; ear noises and vertigo are the dose-limiting side effects. At these concentrations, quinine induces a more than double increase in ADM uptake in K562/ADM cells. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that quinine should be administered 24 to 36 hours before anti-cancer drugs in clinical trials that test its efficiency as a modifier of MDR in human hematologic malignant neoplasms.","['Solary, E', 'Velay, I', 'Chauffert, B', 'Bidan, J M', 'Caillot, D', 'Dumas, M', 'Guy, H']","['Solary E', 'Velay I', 'Chauffert B', 'Bidan JM', 'Caillot D', 'Dumas M', 'Guy H']","[""Unite d'Hematologie Clinique, Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Le Bocage, Dijon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'A7V27PHC7A (Quinine)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)']",IM,"['Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/drug therapy', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/drug therapy', 'Quinine/*blood/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1991/10/15 00:00,1991/10/15 00:01,['1991/10/15 00:00'],"['1991/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19911015)68:8<1714::aid-cncr2820680811>3.0.co;2-2 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Oct 15;68(8):1714-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19911015)68:8<1714::aid-cncr2820680811>3.0.co;2-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite the LALW-2 cells being highly resistant to MTX (inhibitory dose for 50% of cells, more than 10(-3) mol/l), southern blot analysis did not show any amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase gene, nor was there any evidence, by comparison with drug-sensitive CCRF-CEM cells, that the gene was overexpressed. Kinetic analysis of dihydrofolate reductase activity in the presence of MTX provided no basis for attributing resistance in LALW-2 cells to a change in enzyme structure. By contrast, studies of MTX accumulation revealed that the LALW-2 cells accumulated significantly less drug than either CCRF-CEM cells or a MTX-resistant CCRF-CEM subline with a characterized transport defect. These data suggest that extreme MTX resistance in LALW-2 cells is mediated by reduced drug accumulation in the absence of any effect on the target enzyme.","['Norris, M D', 'Haber, M', 'Kavallaris, M', 'Brian, M J', 'Lutze, L H', 'White, L', 'Stewart, B W']","['Norris MD', 'Haber M', 'Kavallaris M', 'Brian MJ', 'Lutze LH', 'White L', 'Stewart BW']","[""Children's Leukaemia and Cancer Research Unit, Prince of Wales Children's Hospital, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['EC 1.5.1.3 (Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance/genetics/physiology', 'Gene Amplification/genetics', 'Gene Expression/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacokinetics/toxicity', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase/genetics/metabolism', 'Transplantation, Heterologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19910901)68:5<981::aid-cncr2820680512>3.0.co;2-w [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Sep 1;68(5):981-7. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910901)68:5<981::aid-cncr2820680512>3.0.co;2-w.,,,['DHFR'],,,,,,,,,,,,

No patients were excluded or lost during follow-up. Forty-three percent of the patients were Stage I plus II, and 57% were Stage III. Thirty-eight patients (33%) had blood urea nitrogen greater than or equal to 40 mg/dl (substage B). Reaching an objective response treatment was stopped, generally after 1 year, and restarted at relapse. After induction therapy, 94 patients (82%) responded and had a median duration of response (MDR) of 22 months. After first relapse, 26 of 38 patients (69%) responded again to the same regimen and had an MDR of 11 months. This response rate and MDR are significantly lower than the ones achieved in induction chemotherapy. After second relapse, 7 of 16 patients (44%) again responded with an MDR of 3.5 months. The median survival time (MST) was 50.5 months for all patients. The most relevant side effect was leukopenia. No case of secondary leukemia was noticed. The authors conclude that patients with MM can be treated safely without maintenance therapy after reaching remission because a high response rate can be obtained in first and even second relapse. The planned treatment pause at remission does not adversely affect the survival time. Secondary leukemia is infrequent after this policy. Quality of life improves during the treatment pause.","['Paccagnella, A', 'Chiarion-Sileni, V', 'Soesan, M', 'Baggio, G', 'Bolzonella, S', 'De Besi, P', 'Casara, D', 'Frizzarin, M', 'Salvagno, L', 'Favaretto, A']","['Paccagnella A', 'Chiarion-Sileni V', 'Soesan M', 'Baggio G', 'Bolzonella S', 'De Besi P', 'Casara D', 'Frizzarin M', 'Salvagno L', 'Favaretto A', 'et al.']","['Medical Oncology Department, Padova General Hospital, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Carmustine/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Melphalan/administration & dosage', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19910901)68:5<975::aid-cncr2820680511>3.0.co;2-o [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Sep 1;68(5):975-80. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910901)68:5<975::aid-cncr2820680511>3.0.co;2-o.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To determine whether a distinct clinicopathologic entity of malignant histiocytosis X exists, the authors examined tissues from 31 patients with HX and divided them into four categories. Group A (19 patients) was characterized morphologically by benign-appearing LC and had an indolent course. The male:female (M:F) ratio was 10:9, and the mean age was 21 years (range, 2 months to 60 years). The immunophenotype of this group was S-100+, vimentin+, LN-2+, LN-3+, lysozyme-, LCA-, Leu-M1-. Group B (three patients) had benign-appearing LC, yet had an aggressive clinical course. All patients were male, with a mean age of 47 years (range, 3 years to 72 years). Organs involved included the liver, spleen, heart, thymus, lung, kidney, and pancreas. The immunophenotype was the same as for Group A. Group C (two patients) had atypical and malignant appearing LC, yet a relatively benign clinical course. The ages were four and 65 years, with one female and one male patient. In both patients, the cells were S-100+, vimentin+, LN-2+, LN-3+, and LCA-. Group D (seven patients) was characterized by atypical and malignant-appearing LC and an aggressive clinical course. The mean age was 25 years (range, congenital to 54 years) with one female and six male patients. Organs involved were the thymus, lungs, spleen, liver, kidney, brain, heart, pancreas, stomach, and muscle. Birbeck granules were found in two patients, and the one patient on which fresh tissue was available was CD1+. The typical immunophenotype was S-100+, vimentin+, LN-2+, LN-3+, Leu-M1-, lysozyme-. The results of our study indicate that (1) a distinct clinical entity of malignant HX, characterized morphologically by malignant-appearing LC and clinically by male predominance, atypical organ involvement, and an aggressive clinical course, does exist; and (2) the morphologic appearance of the LC is an imperfect predictor of the clinical severity of HX.","['Ben-Ezra, J', 'Bailey, A', 'Azumi, N', 'Delsol, G', 'Stroup, R', 'Sheibani, K', 'Rappaport, H']","['Ben-Ezra J', 'Bailey A', 'Azumi N', 'Delsol G', 'Stroup R', 'Sheibani K', 'Rappaport H']","['James Irvine Center for the Study of Leukemia and Lymphoma, Department of Pathology, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Histiocytic Sarcoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Histiocytosis, Langerhans-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Langerhans Cells/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19910901)68:5<1050::aid-cncr2820680524>3.0.co;2-k [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Sep 1;68(5):1050-60. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910901)68:5<1050::aid-cncr2820680524>3.0.co;2-k.,,['CA 33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differences were found in the blast cell karyotype and immunoglobulin gene rearrangements of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-positive acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and biphenotypic leukemia expressing B lymphoid and myeloid markers. The karyotypic abnormalities, t(9;22) and t(4;11), were noticed in acute biphenotypic leukemia, and were consistently associated with rearrangement at the immunoglobulin locus. Furthermore, coexpression of CD19/CD20 and either myeloperoxidase or myeloid surface markers were predictive of finding the t(9;22) or t(4;11) karyotype. Patients with TdT-positive AML, on the other hand, were less likely to show rearrangement at the immunoglobulin locus, and did not have the t(9;22) or t(4;11). Instead, a variety of nonrandom karyotypic abnormalities were seen, including trisomy 13. Unlike common AML, the majority of TdT-positive cases demonstrated an abnormal karyotype with duplications and/or deletions present in all cases. In no instance was trisomy 8, t(8;21), t(15;17), or any other isolated translocation identified.

Evidence is presented showing that idiopathic myelofibrosis is an acquired clonal disorder in terms of the hematopoietic abnormalities, but that the marrow fibrosis is a result of non-clonal disordered fibrogenesis. The clinical, laboratory and pathologic features of idiopathic myelofibrosis are discussed.

Cyto-histological classifications and immunophenotyping of different types of NHL have contributed to the characterisation of three major subtypes of NHL in children i.e. Burkitt's lymphoma (BL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) and large cell lymphoma (LCL). Precise staging of the disease at diagnosis is necessary before the onset of the treatment and should be performed as quickly as possible. Presence of bone marrow and central nervous system (CNS) involvement are major prognosis criteria. In most cases, surgery has no therapeutic role and is required only for diagnostic procedures. Similarly, several studies have demonstrated that irradiation of various sites including the CNS does not improve survival. Thus, NHL patients are usually treated with chemotherapy alone. BL and LL have distinct clinical presentations and require completely different chemotherapy protocols. After comparable induction phases with intensive chemotherapy regimens, the former is usually treated with a short consolidation phase while the latter receives a long lasting consolidation consisting of intermittent chemotherapy for at least one year. The prognosis of stage I-II, and III-IV bone marrow negative NHL of children is excellent with respectively 95% and 75% long term survival. However, patients with concomittent CNS and bone marrow involvement in both histological subtypes have a considerably worse prognosis with only 30% long term survival.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Blay, J Y', 'Louis, D', 'Bouffet, E', 'Thiesse, P', 'Biron, P', 'Favrot, M C', 'Brunat-Mentigny, M', 'Philip, T']","['Blay JY', 'Louis D', 'Bouffet E', 'Thiesse P', 'Biron P', 'Favrot MC', 'Brunat-Mentigny M', 'Philip T']","['Pediatric Oncology Department, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/epidemiology/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/*drug therapy/epidemiology/therapy', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/radiotherapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/epidemiology/therapy', 'Prognosis', 'Salvage Therapy', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0268-960X(91)90040-J [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(91)90040-j [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1991 Jun;5(2):90-7. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(91)90040-j.,39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Recruiting potential unrelated bone marrow donors to a register would add not only to the cost, but also to the volume, of transplantation. Proposals to establish such registries have thus been subject to rigorous financial scrutiny. In Australia, 3 alternative estimates suggest that approximately 200 patients, otherwise suitable for bone marrow transplantation, do not receive transplants because they have no suitable related donor. The population of Australia is approximately 16 million. The alternatives for these patients are thus chemotherapy or unrelated bone marrow transplantation. The costs of chemotherapy and transplantation have been directly compared in 1 trial of treatment for acute nonlymphoblastic leukaemia. The cost per year of life saved was approximately the same for the 2 treatments, with better patient survival from transplantation. The estimated cost difference in both the United States and Australia, between the policy extremes of no patients transplanted, and all transplanted, was between 1.3-2.4% of the total costs of managing these patients. The cost of searching existing registers for unrelated donors for Australian patients, averages A$24,000-28,000 to the point of a successful donor procedure. The cost of establishing and maintaining an Australian Register of a size predicted to find donors for half of the potential recipients, has been estimated at A$ 10,000 per donor procedure. The decision to proceed with unrelated bone marrow transplantation commits resources that are currently used by the alternative therapies. It is thus important to monitor both the costs and effects of the new approach.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Chapman, J R', 'Atkinson, K', 'Lapsley, H']","['Chapman JR', 'Atkinson K', 'Lapsley H']","['Tissue Typing Laboratory, Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service, Sydney, NSW, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Blood Rev,Blood reviews,8708558,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/economics', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*economics/statistics & numerical data', 'Decision Making', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/economics/surgery', 'New South Wales', 'Registries', '*Tissue Donors', 'Tissue and Organ Procurement/*economics/methods', 'Washington']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0268-960X(91)90043-C [pii]', '10.1016/0268-960x(91)90043-c [doi]']",ppublish,Blood Rev. 1991 Jun;5(2):112-6. doi: 10.1016/0268-960x(91)90043-c.,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

T-cell depletion decreased acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) (relative risk [RR] 0.45; P less than .0001) and chronic (GVHD) (RR 0.56; P less than .0001). However, it increased graft failure (RR 9.29; P less than .0001). Leukemia relapse also was increased. In first remission acute leukemia or chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia, leukemia relapse was 2.75 times more likely after T-cell-depleted transplants (P less than .0001). T-cell depletion increased the risk of treatment failure (RR 1.35; P less than .0003) and decreased leukemia-free survival. We also studied controllable variables associated with outcome of T-cell-depleted transplants. The unique findings were that among recipients of T-cell-depleted transplants for early leukemia, radiation doses greater than or equal to 11 Gy (RR 0.54; P less than .01), dose rates greater than 14 cGy/min (RR 0.56; P less than .002), and additional posttransplant immune suppression with cyclosporine alone (RR 0.53; P less than .0006) or cyclosporine plus methotrexate (RR 0.36; P less than .01) were associated with fewer treatment failures. Use of monoclonal antibodies rather than physical techniques for T-cell depletion (RR 2.01; P less than .03) and fractionated radiation (RR 1.69; P less than .05) were associated with increased treatment failure and lower leukemia-free survival.

This compound exerted a pronounced inhibitory effect not only on heme and Hb synthesis, but also on all the remaining above-mentioned parameters. In particular, SA induced: (1) a reduction of the level of alpha-globin mRNA; (2) a decreased number of exposed TfR molecules, without modification of their affinity for the ligand; (3) a reduced level of TfR RNA, without significant change of TfR gene transcription rate; and (4) a lower ferritin content. The addition of exogenous hemin to differentiating FLC exerted opposite effects, and particularly induced an increase of both the number of TfRs and ferritin content. These findings suggest that in erythroid cells optimal heme synthesis is required to coordinately sustain globin chains synthesis and TfR/ferritin production; thus, the intracellular heme level may represent a key regulatory factor in the Hb synthesis pathway.","['Battistini, A', 'Coccia, E M', 'Marziali, G', 'Bulgarini, D', 'Scalzo, S', 'Fiorucci, G', 'Romeo, G', 'Affabris, E', 'Testa, U', 'Rossi, G B']","['Battistini A', 'Coccia EM', 'Marziali G', 'Bulgarini D', 'Scalzo S', 'Fiorucci G', 'Romeo G', 'Affabris E', 'Testa U', 'Rossi GB', 'et al.']","['Department of Virology and Hematology, Istituto Superiore di Sanita, Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Ferritins/*analysis', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Heme/*physiology', 'Heptanoates/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*analysis']",1991/10/15 00:00,1991/10/15 00:01,['1991/10/15 00:00'],"['1991/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82258-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Oct 15;78(8):2098-103.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces transcription of the M-CSF gene in human myeloid cells. The present work examined the effects of TNF on cis-acting elements in the M-CSF promoter. Deleted forms of the M-CSF promoter were linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene and transfected by electroporation into HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells. The results demonstrate that an enhancer responsive to TNF stimulation is located between positions -406 and -344 upstream to the transcription start site. The fragment from positions -419 to -304 was cloned 5' to the heterologous thymidine kinase (TK) promoter and linked to the CAT gene. Both orientations of this fragment enhanced TK-promoter activity in TNF-treated HL-60 cells. The results of gel mobility shift assays with the -419 to -304 fragment demonstrate binding of a constitutive nuclear protein. A TNF-inducible protein also bound to this fragment and resulted in a different mobility pattern. Binding of the TNF-induced nuclear protein to the -419 to -304 fragment was inhibited by an oligonucleotide containing the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) consensus sequence. DNA footprinting demonstrated protection of an NF-kappa B binding site at positions -377 to -368. Methylation interference assays showed that the TNF-induced protein made contact points with guanine residues in the same NF-kappa B sequence. Taken together, the findings provide evidence for involvement of an NF-kappa B-like factor in transcriptional regulation of the M-CSF gene.","['Yamada, H', 'Iwase, S', 'Mohri, M', 'Kufe, D']","['Yamada H', 'Iwase S', 'Mohri M', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1991/10/15 00:00,1991/10/15 00:01,['1991/10/15 00:00'],"['1991/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)82244-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Oct 15;78(8):1988-95.,,"['CA34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

After 8 years of the chronic phase of CLL, lymphoblastoid cells appeared and became dominant in the PB. After repeated subcultures of the patient's PB cells in the acute phase, lymphoblastoid cells have proliferated actively in the presence of recombinant human IL-3, and the TMD2 cell line has been established. The lymphoblastoid cells in acute phase and TMD2 cells proliferated dependently on IL-3, whereas growth of the small lymphocytes in chronic phase was not supported by IL-3. Other ILs (IL-1, 2, and 4 through 6) or CSF did not support the growth or survival of TMD2 cells. The existence of high-affinity receptors for IL-3 was shown on TMD2 cells (binding sites 88 per cell, Kd = 76.9 pmol/L). DNA extracted from the small lymphocytes in the chronic phase, the lymphoblastoid cells in the acute phase, and TMD2 cells showed the same rearrangement pattern of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene. Therefore, these cells were considered to have originated from the same clone. These results imply that a genetic event that caused the responsiveness to IL-3 in the cell of the chronic phase caused the acute transformation of CLL in this patient. We consider that TMD2 cell line is valuable as a model of cells of CLL in the acute phase and as a tool for studying the signal transduction system of IL-3.","['Tohda, S', 'Nara, N', 'Murohashi, I', 'Aoki, N']","['Tohda S', 'Nara N', 'Murohashi I', 'Aoki N']","['Department of Internal Medicine 1, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-3)']",IM,"['Aged', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Karyotyping', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81096-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Oct 1;78(7):1789-94.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On hematopoietic progenitor cells, cooperation with another cytokine (such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor [GM-CSF], G-CSF, IL-3, or IL-6) is required to render the cells responsive to IL-4. The present study was undertaken to determine if such an interaction entails induction of IL-4 receptor (IL-4R) expression. Using the murine myeloid leukemia M1 cell line and mature, bone marrow (BM)-derived macrophages, we investigated whether IL-4R expression can be induced during differentiation. We detected no high-affinity IL-4R on the surface of either cell, but with exposure to IL-6 a significant induction of IL-4R was measured on both cell types by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. This increase in IL-4R was first noted 6 hours after exposure of the cells to IL-6 and continued to increase up to 48 hours. By RNase protection analysis we found that the expression of IL-4R mRNA also appeared within 6 hours, continuing to increase up to 48 hours. Nuclear run-on assays showed that this increase in steady-state level of IL-4R mRNA results from a transcriptional activation of the IL-4R gene. These data suggest that regulation of IL-4R expression by IL-6 is under transcriptional control.","['Feldman, G M', 'Ruhl, S', 'Bickel, M', 'Finbloom, D S', 'Pluznik, D H']","['Feldman GM', 'Ruhl S', 'Bickel M', 'Finbloom DS', 'Pluznik DH']","['Division of Cytokine Biology, Food and Drug Administration, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*metabolism', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/metabolism', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Mitogen/genetics/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81082-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Oct 1;78(7):1678-84.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that P53 gene mutations occurred more often in patients with 17p monosomy seems to support the ""recessive"" model of tumor suppressive activity of the P53 gene rather than the ""dominant"" model, in which alteration of only one allele is sufficient for the development of malignancy.","['Fenaux, P', 'Jonveaux, P', 'Quiquandon, I', 'Lai, J L', 'Pignon, J M', 'Loucheux-Lefebvre, M H', 'Bauters, F', 'Berger, R', 'Kerckaert, J P']","['Fenaux P', 'Jonveaux P', 'Quiquandon I', 'Lai JL', 'Pignon JM', 'Loucheux-Lefebvre MH', 'Bauters F', 'Berger R', 'Kerckaert JP']","['Service des Maladies du Sang-C.H.U., Lille, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17', 'Exons', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Monosomy', '*Mutation', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Polymorphism, Genetic']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)81078-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Oct 1;78(7):1652-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Five years later the consequences of the disaster are still not fully known. Nevertheless the long term future of nuclear energy in the world is uncertain. Questions need to be answered by observing hard facts if emotional attitudes are not to prevail over reality. The reactor and its core were destroyed by an explosion, causing two radioactive jet emissions of iodine 131, followed by caesium 137. Both elements are mainly incorporated in the body via food. The Chernobyl disaster was a consequence of inadequate safety regulations and human error. Enforcement of strict regulations are likely to be highly effective in preventing a further catastrophe.

Aminopeptidase activities on U937 and TF-1 cells were almost inhibited with 10 and 100 micrograms/ml of ubenimex, respectively. Cross-linking studies of 125I-GM-CSF binding to TF-1 cells demonstrated that the 150-kDa band of 2 major bands was enhanced after incubation with 0.01 microgram/ml ubenimex but decreased after that with 100 micrograms/ml, and that the 95-kDa band was not changed at any concentration of ubenimex. Change in density of the 150-kDa band on ubenimex-treated TF-1 cells was correlated with that in expression of CD10 (neutral endopeptidase) on them, whereas that in expression of CD13 (aminopeptidase N) was not changed at any concentration. These results suggest that one possible mechanism of ubenimex action in hematopoietic progenitor cells is the up-regulation of the high affinity receptor for GM-CSF and that in leukemic cell lines is suppression of amino acid incorporation via peptidase regulation.","['Shibuya, K', 'Chiba, S', 'Hino, M', 'Kitamura, T', 'Miyagawa, K', 'Takaku, F', 'Miyazano, K']","['Shibuya K', 'Chiba S', 'Hino M', 'Kitamura T', 'Miyagawa K', 'Takaku F', 'Miyazano K']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', 'EC 3.4.11.- (Aminopeptidases)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)', 'I0J33N5627 (ubenimex)']",IM,"['Aminopeptidases/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leucine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Mice']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0753-3322(91)90125-D [pii]', '10.1016/0753-3322(91)90125-d [doi]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 1991;45(2-3):71-80. doi: 10.1016/0753-3322(91)90125-d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A similar apparent binding constant was obtained for a 19-residue peptide encompassing the Cys-His box, designated the ""zinc finger motif,"" indicating that it contains most if not all the information to bind Zn2+ tightly. Changing Trp 35 to Phe in the peptide did not affect the Zn2+ affinity, indicating that Trp 35 is not crucial for Zn2+ binding. On the contrary, replacing Cys 29 by Ser, the chemical modification or oxidation of the three Cys sharply reduced Zn2+ affinity, confirming the essential role of Cys in Zn2+ binding. In addition, fluorescence and energy transfer data suggested that Zn2+ binding modifies the Trp 35 environment but not its solvent exposure, and increases the average distance between Tyr 28 and Trp 35 by about 2 A.

A retrospective analysis of 260 patients.,101-6,"Bleeding and thrombosis are frequent complications in myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) and are associated with severe organ damage and a high mortality. Elevated platelet count, elevated hematocrit, and patient age are regarded as risk factors for bleeding and thromboembolic events in MPD, although the significance of these parameters was not confirmed by clinical studies. We retrospectively analyzed vascular complications in 260 patients with MPD and tried to identify parameters predictive for bleeding and thrombembolic events. Our cohort consisted of 115 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), 84 patients with polycythemia vera (PV), 26 with essential thrombocythemia (ET), 25 with osteomyelofibrosis (OMF), and 10 patients with unclassifiable MPD. During a median follow-up period of 31 months, 126 patients with chronic MPD suffered bleeding or thrombotic events. Bleeding was observed in 57% of patients with OMF, 23% with PV, 20% with chronic phase CML, and 16% with ET. Thrombotic events were most common in patients with PV (36% of patients), followed by ET, OMF, and chronic phase CML (20%, 17%, and 6% of patients, respectively). Recurrent thrombotic episodes frequently occurred in patients with PV and ET, whereas patients with OMF often had more than one bleeding event. Thirty patients died of thrombohemorrhagic complications during follow-up. Multivariate analysis, including all patients with chronic MPD, revealed that elevated red blood cell count, higher hemoglobin level, and increased percentage of segmented neutrophils at the time of diagnosis were associated with thrombosis, whereas patients with bleeding complications were characterized by low red cell count, lower hemoglobin, and a lower percentage of segmented neutrophils. However, when analyzed by MPD subgroup, none of these parameters retained a predictive value for bleeding or thrombotic events. Moreover, elevated platelet count and patient age were not risk factors for bleeding complications. Thrombotic events were less frequent in patients below the age of 40, and were increased in patients aged 70 and above. However, this was primarily due to the high percentage of elderly patients in subgroups mainly affected by thrombosis (PV and ET). In most MPD subgroups, the rate of bleeding and thrombosis was highest just before and during the first months after diagnosis, and declined thereafter. Thrombohemorrhagic complications were less frequent after phlebotomy in PV and after therapy with alkylating agents in CML. The institution of cytoreductive therapy soon after the diagnosis was made may explain the reduced incidence of complications later in the disease.

A simple retroviral vector (G2) was developed that contains a normal human GC cDNA under the control of the Moloney murine leukemia virus long-terminal repeat (LTR) enhancer/promoter. Murine bone marrow was transduced with the G2 vector and maintained in long-term bone marrow culture (LTBMC). Expression of the human GC gene in the transduced murine LTBMC cells exceeded the level of endogenous murine GC mRNA. Murine bone marrow cells were also transduced with G2 and transplanted into irradiated syngeneic recipients. High levels of GC gene transfer and expression were seen in day-12 CFU-S foci, and to a lesser extent in the hematopoietic organs 4 months after gene transfer/bone marrow transplant (BMT). Human bone marrow, from a patient with Gaucher disease, was also used in studies of GC gene transduction. Gene transfer into 35-40% of the Gaucher hematopoietic progenitor cells was achieved, following prestimulation of the marrow with recombinant hematopoietic growth factors. Equal rates of gene transfer were obtained using either total marrow mononuclear cells or progenitor cells enriched 100-fold by immunomagnetic bead separation. GC gene transduction corrected the enzymatic deficiency of the Gaucher marrow. Our results demonstrate the potential utility of retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer for gene therapy of Gaucher disease. Current efforts are aimed at achieving more consistent in vivo GC expression in the murine BMT model and demonstrating transduction of pluripotent human hematopoietic stem cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kohn, D B', 'Nolta, J A', 'Weinthal, J', 'Bahner, I', 'Yu, X J', 'Lilley, J', 'Crooks, G M']","['Kohn DB', 'Nolta JA', 'Weinthal J', 'Bahner I', 'Yu XJ', 'Lilley J', 'Crooks GM']","['Division of Research Immunology and Bone Marrow Transplantation, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, CA.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Gene Ther,Human gene therapy,9008950,['EC 3.2.1.45 (Glucosylceramidase)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Gaucher Disease/genetics/*therapy', '*Genetic Therapy', 'Glucosylceramidase/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Models, Genetic', 'Retroviridae/genetics', 'Transduction, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1089/hum.1991.2.2-101 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Gene Ther. 1991 Summer;2(2):101-5. doi: 10.1089/hum.1991.2.2-101.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study we labeled the L2C leukemic guinea pig lymphocyte, a naturally stimulated cell, with [2-14C]acetate, and compared the composition of newly synthesized lipids isolated from nuclei and whole cells (or microsomes). We observed that the proportion of cholesterol in labeled non-saponifiable lipids extracted from nuclei was lower than in non-saponifiable lipids isolated from whole cells, whereas the proportion of squalene and polar lipids was higher. By analyzing total lipid extracts, the polar lipids were identified as alkylglycerols, and the above mentioned distribution of constituents was confirmed. The identification of alkylglycerols was also supported by the comparison of radioactive lipid composition after labeling cells with three different lipid precursors: [2-14C]mevalonate, [2-14C]acetate and [2-14C]stearate. When cells were labeled in the presence of dodecylimidazole, the percentage of squalene and alkylglycerols decreased in nuclear lipids, but was not altered when cells were cultured in the presence of propiconazole, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor which does not affect cell division of human stimulated lymphocytes.

We demonstrated in earlier studies that the upstream region of the mouse GM-CSF promoter at positions between -95 and -73 is essential for transcriptional activation in response to PMA/A23187. This region contains two DNA-binding motifs, GM2 and GC-box. The GM2 sequence (GGTAGTTCCC) is recognized by an inducible factor NF-GM2; the other (CCGCCC) by constitutive factors A1, A2, and B. To elucidate the mechanism of GM-CSF gene activation, we have purified the inducible factor NF-GM2 from the nuclear extract of stimulated Jurkat cells on the basis of specific DNA-binding activity. The purified NF-GM2 consists of 50 (p50) and 65 kDa (p65) polypeptides and has a binding activity specific for both the GM-CSF and immunoglobulin kappa (GGAAAGTCCC) enhancers. Electrophoretically purified p50 alone can form a protein-DNA complex, but in the mixture, p50 associates preferentially with p65 to form the NF-GM2 complex. In addition, p65 gave per se, with low affinity, a protein-DNA complex that migrated more slowly than native NF-GM2 complex. Furthermore, an antiserum against KBF1 (identical to 50 kDa NF-kappa B protein) reacted with the p50 of NF-GM2, indicating that the NF-GM2 polypeptide cannot be immunologically differentiated from the 50 kDa subunit of NF-kappa B. The purified NF-GM2 activated in vitro transcription from the kappa B enhancer, while it failed to stimulate transcription from the GM-CSF promoter harboring the GM2 sequence. This suggests that the activation mechanism of the GM-CSF gene through the GM2/GC-box sequence is different from that of genes carrying the kappa B enhancer alone.","['Tsuboi, A', 'Sugimoto, K', 'Yodoi, J', 'Miyatake, S', 'Arai, K', 'Arai, N']","['Tsuboi A', 'Sugimoto K', 'Yodoi J', 'Miyatake S', 'Arai K', 'Arai N']","['Department of Molecular Biology, DNAX Research Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Palo Alto, CA 94304-1104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (NF-kappa B)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'NF-kappa B/immunology/*isolation & purification/pharmacology', 'Oxidation-Reduction', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcription Factors/*isolation & purification', 'Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/3.8.807 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1991 Aug;3(8):807-17. doi: 10.1093/intimm/3.8.807.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CTL derived from the patient with HAM/TSP expressed CD8 antigen, and their function was restricted by HLA-A2. They showed cytotoxic effects predominantly against the target cells expressing HTLV-I p40tax among the autologous B cell lines infected with vaccinia recombinants containing various HTLV-I genes which served as targets. These data are consistent with the previously reported findings that fresh PBL of HAM/TSP patients contain p40tax-specific CTL activity. Furthermore, CTL derived from the patient with Sjogren syndrome without neurological involvement also demonstrated cytotoxicity predominantly to p40tax. The cytotoxicity to the target cells experimentally expressing p40tax was blocked by unlabeled HTLV-I-infected cells possessing HLA-A2. HTLV-I-specific cytotoxicity was also inhibited by unlabeled B cells bearing p40tax. Thus, HTLV-I p40tax-specific cytotoxicity is mediated by the major CTL population activated by native HTLV-I antigens in patients with HAM/TSP or Sjogren syndrome. In contrast to the CTL of these patients, CTL similarly induced from the asymptomatic HTLV-I-carrier, which were highly cytotoxic to autologous HTLV-I-infected T cells, did not show significant levels of cytotoxicity to autologous B cells expressing p40tax.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Kannagi, M', 'Harada, S', 'Maruyama, I', 'Inoko, H', 'Igarashi, H', 'Kuwashima, G', 'Sato, S', 'Morita, M', 'Kidokoro, M', 'Sugimoto, M']","['Kannagi M', 'Harada S', 'Maruyama I', 'Inoko H', 'Igarashi H', 'Kuwashima G', 'Sato S', 'Morita M', 'Kidokoro M', 'Sugimoto M', 'et al.']","['Department of Biodefence and Medical Virology, Kumamoto University Medical School, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Int Immunol,International immunology,8916182,"['0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Gene Products, tax)', '0 (HLA-A2 Antigen)']",IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Gene Products, tax/*immunology', 'HLA-A2 Antigen/immunology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Paraparesis, Tropical Spastic/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/intimm/3.8.761 [doi]'],ppublish,Int Immunol. 1991 Aug;3(8):761-7. doi: 10.1093/intimm/3.8.761.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though the overall incidence of childhood ALL expressing myeloid antigens is low, the evidence that this co-expression may be related to an unfavourable clinical course and that it more frequently occurs in null-ALL, particularly in the first year of life, suggests that the routine assessment of myeloid antigens may allow to identify a subgroup of childhood ALL with a poor clinical outcome.","['Cantu-Rajnoldi, A', 'Putti, C', 'Saitta, M', 'Granchi, D', 'Foa, R', 'Schiro, R', 'Castagni, M', 'Valeggio, C', 'Jankovic, M', 'Miniero, R']","['Cantu-Rajnoldi A', 'Putti C', 'Saitta M', 'Granchi D', 'Foa R', 'Schiro R', 'Castagni M', 'Valeggio C', 'Jankovic M', 'Miniero R', 'et al.']","['Laboratorio di Ricerche Cliniche, Anatomia ed Istologia Patologica, Istituti Clinici di Perfezionamento, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/immunology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Prognosis']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08004.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Sep;79(1):40-3. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08004.x.,,,,,,"['Br J Haematol. 1992 May;81(1):138-9.

Labelling indices (LI) were obtained from both the bone marrow aspirate (BMasp) and biopsies (bx) and durations of S-phase (Ts) and total cell cycle time (Tc) were measured by double-labelling the S-phase cells in vitro with tritiated thymidine. Median LI BMasp was 8% and from BMbx was 25%. The median Ts was 12 h (range 3.1-35 h) and Tc was 48 h (range 11.5-211 h). All patients received induction therapy with a combination of cytosine arabinoside and an anthracycline. Outcome of therapy or FAB type were not related to cell cycle characteristics. Patients with above median LI BMasp, however, had longer remission durations (P = 0.03) as did patients with above median Ts (P = 0.03) and Tc (P = 0.03). Upon longer follow-ups, even some of the patients with slowly cycling myeloblasts have relapsed (log rank P = 0.453 and 0.203 for Ts and Tc respectively). We conclude that patients with rapidly cycling cells tend to relapse faster; however, slowly cycling nature of myeloblasts is not associated with curability.","['Raza, A', 'Preisler, H', 'Lampkin, B', 'Yousuf, N', 'Tucker, C', 'Peters, N', 'White, M', 'Kukla, C', 'Gartside, P', 'Siegrist, C']","['Raza A', 'Preisler H', 'Lampkin B', 'Yousuf N', 'Tucker C', 'Peters N', 'White M', 'Kukla C', 'Gartside P', 'Siegrist C', 'et al.']","['Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,['G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bromodeoxyuridine', 'Cell Cycle/physiology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08003.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Sep;79(1):33-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb08003.x.,,"['CA28734/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA41285/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients with a low risk of developing acute leukaemia were included, i.e. refractory anaemia (RA), RA with ringed sideroblasts (RARS) and RA with excess blasts (RAEB), providing the percentage of myeloblasts in the bone marrow did not exceed 10%. Recombinant HuEpo treatment was initiated at a dose of 50 units/kg body weight and administered subcutaneously three times weekly. At 3-week intervals the dose was increased with 50 units/kg per injection, until after 15 weeks a maximum dose of 250 units/kg three times weekly was reached. All patients completed the study. Recombinant HuEpo was well tolerated and no serious side effects were seen. There was no evidence of the emergence of a new malignant clone in response to rHuEpo as shown by sequential karyotyping. In none of the patients was an increase in haemoglobin level or a diminished red blood cell transfusion requirement seen. In four out of 10 evaluable sequential bone marrow smears, an increase in erythropoiesis was seen, suggesting stimulation of ineffective red cell production. One of these patients also showed a rise in reticulocyte count. The number of erythroid progenitor cells (BFU-E and CFU-E) in blood and bone marrow was not affected by rHuEpo treatment. Also no change in the number of myeloid progenitor cells (CFU-GM) in blood and bone marrow was noted. In conclusion, subcutaneous treatment with rHuEpo at dosages up to 250 units/kg body weight (three times weekly) fails to increase the haemoglobin level or to diminish the transfusion requirement in patients with MDS and anaemia. It is unclear whether higher doses of rHuEpo are effective or whether patients with less severe anaemia who are transfusion independent, have a higher likelihood of response.","['van Kamp, H', 'Prinsze-Postema, T C', 'Kluin, P M', 'den Ottolander, G J', 'Beverstock, G C', 'Willemze, R', 'Fibbe, W E']","['van Kamp H', 'Prinsze-Postema TC', 'Kluin PM', 'den Ottolander GJ', 'Beverstock GC', 'Willemze R', 'Fibbe WE']","['Department of Pathology, University Medical Centre, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Drug Evaluation', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Injections, Subcutaneous', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/blood/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04477.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Aug;78(4):488-93. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04477.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Resistance to cisplatin is often multifocal with plasma membrane, cytosolic and nuclear components. Cisplatin-DNA adducts appear to be recognised by specific damage recognition proteins. Proteins associated with the transport of platinum through plasma membranes and genes associated with cisplatin resistance appear to be close to being elucidated. Current Phase I and Phase II clinical trials with platinum-containing complexes largely focus on the 1,2 diaminocyclohexane (DACH) carrier ligand, the dicarboxylatocyclobutane leaving group and complexes which circumvent cisplatin resistance in murine leukaemia models. At present, the trials are at too early a stage to allow comment on their clinical utility and, consequently, the relevance of the murine leukaemia-based preclinical observations. On the horizon, orally active platinum (IV) ammine/amine dicarboxylate dichloride coordination complexes with preclinical toxicological profiles similar to carboplatin should enter clinical trial in the next year.","['McKeage, M J', 'Higgins, J D 3rd', 'Kelland, L R']","['McKeage MJ', 'Higgins JD 3rd', 'Kelland LR']","['Drug Development Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, UK.']",['eng'],['Congress'],England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (DNA Adducts)', '0 (cisplatin-DNA adduct)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Cisplatin/chemical synthesis/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'DNA', '*DNA Adducts', 'Drug Resistance', '*Platinum/chemistry/metabolism/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1991.400 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1991 Oct;64(4):788-92. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1991.400.,,,,,,,PMC1977702,,,,,,,,

This was tested in the only 28 former county boroughs in which accurate comparisons of workplace data from the 1971 and 1981 censuses are possible--because their boundaries were left unaltered by the major reorganisation in 1974. After ranking the districts according to extent of commuting increase, a significant trend in leukaemia incidence was found at ages 0-14 (P less than 0.05) and a suggestive one at ages 0-4 (P = 0.055). Among ten similar sized groups of county districts ranked by commuting increase, the only significant increases (P less than 0.001) of leukaemia in 1972-85 at ages 0-4 and 0-14 were in the highest tenth for commuting increase. These excesses persisted after excluding Reading, a major part of an area where an excess of leukaemia has been linked to the nearby nuclear establishments at Aldermaston and Burghfield. This whole area has experienced greater commuting increases than 90% of county districts in England and Wales. The findings are consistent with other evidence supporting the above hypothesis; they also suggest that contacts between adults may influence the incidence of leukaemia in children.","['Kinlen, L J', 'Hudson, C M', 'Stiller, C A']","['Kinlen LJ', 'Hudson CM', 'Stiller CA']","['Department of Public Health, University of Oxford, Radcliffe Infirmary, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Demography', 'England/epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Infant', '*Interpersonal Relations', 'Leukemia/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', '*Nuclear Reactors']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1991.348 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1991 Sep;64(3):549-54. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1991.348.,,,,,,,PMC1977635,,,,,,,,

No definite inhibition of apoptosis was observed. Indeed, CHM-treatment augmented apoptosis in the B-CLL cultures and also induced apoptosis of cultured normal peripheral blood lymphocytes. Augmentation was dose-dependent for B-CLL cells over the concentration range 10(-6) M (0.28 micrograms ml-1) to 10(-2) M (2800 micrograms ml-1), resulting in 9% to 98% apoptosis respectively by 24 h of culture (r = 0.619, P = 0.0008).

Inhibition of protein synthesis in these cells by CHM was virtually complete at a concentration of 10(-3) M. The findings are in accord with some recent reports indicating that suppression of protein synthesis by CHM does not inhibit apoptosis in all circumstances. They also illustrate the marked susceptibility of B-CLL cells, compared with normal lymphocytes, to the induction of apoptosis by this drug.

To study this, sensitivity of normal peripheral blood (PB) lymphocytes to a number of cytostatic drugs was assessed with the MTT assay. We compared this sensitivity with the drug sensitivity of leukaemic cells of 38 children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. We also studied a possible differential sensitivity of leukaemic cells from bone marrow (BM) and PB. The following drugs were used: Prednisolone, dexamethasone, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine, cytosine arabinoside, vincristine, vindesine, daunorubicin, doxorubicin, mafosfamide (Maf), 4-hydroperoxy-ifosfamide, teniposide, mitoxantrone, L-asparaginase, methotrexate and mustine. Normal PB lymphocytes were significantly more resistant to all drugs tested, except to Maf. Leukaemic BM and PB cells from 38 patients (unpaired samples) showed no significant differences in sensitivity to any of the drugs. Moreover, in 11 of 12 children with acute leukaemia of whom we investigated simultaneously obtained BM and PB (paired samples), their leukaemic BM and PB cells showed comparable drug sensitivity profiles. In one patient the BM cells were more sensitive to most drugs than those from the PB, but the actual differences in sensitivity were small.

Patients with APL are currently being managed with cytolytic chemotherapy (usually an anthracycline in combination with arabinosylcytosine), a treatment that can induce complete remissions in 65% or more of patients and probably cure 15% or more. Exciting new clinical observations have shown that patients with APL also respond extremely well to treatment with all-trans retinoic acid, an agent which induces the leukemic promyelocytes to undergo maturation and lose their ability to proliferate. Retinoic acid by itself is not curative, but by combining it with cytolytic chemotherapy, it may be possible to cure the majority of patients with this previously fatal leukemia. Interestingly, independent molecular studies have recently revealed that the breakpoint of t(15;17) lies within the gene encoding the retinoic acid receptor-alpha (RAR-alpha) on chromosome 17q21, and that patients with APL express aberrant forms of the RAR-alpha transcript. This convergence of clinical and molecular observations, though fortuitous, is extremely important because it represents the first example of a selective form of treatment for a human leukemia that is related to a specific genetic abnormality.","['Clarkson, B']",['Clarkson B'],"['Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Cells,"Cancer cells (Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. : 1989)",9000382,['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)'],IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics', 'Tretinoin/*therapeutic use']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Cells. 1991 Jun;3(6):211-20.,95,,['RAR-&agr;'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that decreases in cell deformability, in the absence of an increase in cell surface adhesive properties, would be sufficient to cause cell retention in a filtration apparatus modeling the pulmonary microvasculature. The myelomonocytic cell line (HL60 cell line) was used to test the hypothesis since these cells were unable to increase adherence in response to n-formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine (FMLP) in either the undifferentiated state or when differentiated towards granulocytes. With differentiation, HL60 cell volume decreased, and f-actin organization changed from a thick cortical rim with focal areas of f-actin in undifferentiated cells to a thin rim in differentiated cells. Differentiated cells responded to FMLP by reorganizing f-actin and increasing stiffness. Undifferentiated cells did not exhibit changes in f-actin with stimulation, were stiffer than differentiated cells, and did not increase stiffness in response to FMLP. Cytochalasin D (CD), which disrupted the cytoarchitecture as assessed by confocal microscopy but did not affect cell volume or adherence, decreased the stiffness of undifferentiated and FMLP-stimulated differentiated cells, thus suggesting the importance of microfilament organization in the stiffness of these cells. Filtration of cells through 8-microns pores showed that undifferentiated cells were markedly retained and did not exhibit any further retention with FMLP. Differentiated cells exposed to FMLP exhibited a concentration-dependent increase in retention in 8-microns pores that was abolished by CD. In addition, CD reduced retention of undifferentiated cells, indicating that microfilament organization is an important factor in determining a cell's rheologic properties. In conclusion, FMLP-stimulated microfilament reorganization, which increased cell stiffness, was sufficient in the absence of adherence factors to cause cell retention in a filtration system. This lends support to the hypothesis that decreases in cell deformability contribute to neutrophil retention in the pulmonary microvasculature.","['Erzurum, S C', 'Kus, M L', 'Bohse, C', 'Elson, E L', 'Worthen, G S']","['Erzurum SC', 'Kus ML', 'Bohse C', 'Elson EL', 'Worthen GS']","['Department of Medicine, National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine, Denver, CO 80206.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,8917225,"['0 (Actins)', '22144-77-0 (Cytochalasin D)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)']",IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Actins/metabolism', 'Biophysical Phenomena', 'Biophysics', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytochalasin D/pharmacology', 'Filtration', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*pathology', 'Microcirculation', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1165/ajrcmb/5.3.230 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 1991 Sep;5(3):230-41. doi: 10.1165/ajrcmb/5.3.230.,,"['HL-07085/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-40784/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This has resulted in a reduction in the morbidity and mortality associated with these diseases and now permits both a dose and a schedule intensification of chemotherapy.

RB mRNA expression was greatly reduced in DL-12. In addition, cloning and sequencing analysis of the RB cDNA revealed that the RB mRNA in DL-8 had a 276-nucleotide deletion presumably consisting of exons 10, 11, and 12, suggesting that altered splicing resulted in the loss of these exons. Analysis of the p53 gene indicated that DL-5 had a deletion in both alleles and expressed a smaller mRNA.

To differentiate between the germline configuration and the rearranged genome in a DNA sample extracted from lymphocytes, we compared the ratio of the amplified products. The intensity of amplification of the intron region (JHF) upstream of the first joining region was compared to the intensity of joining region 6 of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. The number of the amplification cycles in the PCR was designated in such a way that the ratio of JHF/JH6 was less than one in the rearranged configuration. As the concentration of clonal B-lymphocytes with the rearranged genome in the sample increased the amplification of the JHF intron proportionally decreased. We used the same approach for the two constant regions of the T-cell receptor beta chain. As one of the intron regions of the constant sequence became depleted by rearrangement so the amplification of the particular region decreased. Therefore, the absence or decreased concentration of a particular product of amplification indicated deletion and thus rearrangement of the genome in the leukemic B- or T-lymphocytes. The threshold of detection of cells with the rearranged genome on a photograph of agarose gel loaded with the particular amplified regions and staining with the ethidium bromide is less than 10% by densitometric tracing and 25-50% by visual evaluation. This novel approach allows the detection of the rearranged DNA sequences in a 2 day span. Hence, it can serve as a diagnostic tool for the identification of clonal expansion of lymphocytes in acute leukemias and lymphomas in particular and for the detection of deleted genomic regions in general.","['Stolc, V', 'Uhrmacher, J', 'Krause, J R']","['Stolc V', 'Uhrmacher J', 'Krause JR']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of Pittsburg, PA 15261.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', '*Gene Rearrangement', '*Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830380102 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1991 Sep;38(1):1-8. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830380102.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, CDF/LIF may induce the expression of particular immediate early genes prior to its positive and negative effects on neurotransmitter and neuropeptide gene expression.","['Yamamori, T']",['Yamamori T'],"['Biology Division, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Neuroreport,Neuroreport,9100935,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neuregulins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neuregulins', 'Neurons/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Sympathetic Nervous System/cytology/*physiology', 'Transcription Factors/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00001756-199104000-00003 [doi]'],ppublish,Neuroreport. 1991 Apr;2(4):173-6. doi: 10.1097/00001756-199104000-00003.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of macrophage-target interaction coupled to nitric oxide generation, but independent of tumor necrosis factor production.",1816-22,"IFN-gamma primes murine macrophages to render them responsive for triggering by subactivating concentrations of bacterial LPS to mediate nonspecific tumor cytotoxicity. However, IFN-gamma also has direct anti-proliferative effects on transformed cells that serve as sensitive tumor targets for cytotoxic macrophages. We investigated the effects of preexposure of L1210 mouse leukemia and P815 mouse mastocytoma targets to rIFN-gamma on changes in their susceptibility to cytotoxicity by LPS-activated mouse peritoneal macrophages (PM). Co-incubation of inflammatory PM and either L1210 or P815 targets with IFN-gamma and LPS produced a classical synergistic cytotoxicity for both targets over that of IFN-gamma or LPS alone. Similar synergistic augmentation of cytotoxicity occurred when effector PM were preprimed for 24 h with IFN-gamma before testing for cytotoxicity of untreated targets. However, pretreatment of L1210 and P815 targets for 24 h with IFN-gamma (50 U) before assay produced divergent results in that L1210 was more susceptible, whereas P815 was less susceptible to cytotoxicity by LPS-activated macrophages. Similar results were obtained when both macrophages and targets were pretreated separately with IFN-gamma for 24 h before their combined assay for tumor cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of L1210 targets for 1, 4, or 24 h with IFN-gamma produced similar effects on their increased susceptibility to macrophage cytotoxicity. In contrast, P815 pretreated for 1 and 4 h with IFN-gamma showed an early increased susceptibility to macrophage cytotoxicity followed by a decrease after 24 h pretreatment. The pretreatment of L1210 or P815 targets with IFN-gamma before their exposure to LPS-activated macrophages had no effect on the production of TNF. However, there was a corresponding increase in nitric oxide generation by LPS-activated macrophages after their exposure to IFN-gamma pretreated L1210 targets and a decrease in the presence of IFN-gamma-pretreated P815 targets that correlated with their changes in susceptibility to macrophage killing. Nitric oxide generation by macrophages alone in response to LPS was found to be greater than when effector macrophages were exposed to the tumor targets and this was either increased by L1210 or decreased by P815 that had been pretreated with IFN-gamma. Our results indicate that IFN-gamma may act directly and differentially on tumor targets to alter their susceptibility for macrophage cytotoxicity, which was coupled to changes in the generation of cytotoxic nitric oxide, rather than TNF production by the macrophage.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Leu, R W', 'Leu, N R', 'Shannon, B J', 'Fast, D J']","['Leu RW', 'Leu NR', 'Shannon BJ', 'Fast DJ']","['Biomedical Division, Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Inc., Ardmore, OK 73402.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mast-Cell Sarcoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Nitric Oxide/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/biosynthesis']",1991/09/15 00:00,1991/09/15 00:01,['1991/09/15 00:00'],"['1991/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Sep 15;147(6):1816-22.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The simplest methods utilize a single VH primer specific for sequences present in most VH regions corresponding to the third framework region (FR3). An alternative approach is to use a panel of VH family-specific primers specific for the first framework regions (FR1). In the course of nucleotide sequence analysis of IgH gene rearrangements amplified using a VH FR1 primer panel, these authors previously observed 3' VH region deletion and/or base mis-matches sufficient to prevent efficient priming from the VH FR3 primer target sequence in a significant minority of cases of B-lineage malignancy. An improved PCR method has therefore been developed by using a panel of seven VH FR1 family-specific primers incorporated in a single reaction. By using this method clonal IgH gene rearrangement is detected in 15 of 16 cases of B-lineage malignancy. Significantly, this series included four cases of B-lymphoma in which previous attempts to detect PCR clonal IgH gene rearrangements using a VH FR3 primer were unsuccessful. In two of these cases, nucleotide sequence analysis of the amplified DNA showed that failure to prime with the VH FR3 primer was likely to be attributable to insufficient homology with the target sequence. The use of the approach described in this paper should significantly improve the reliability of detection of B-lymphoid clonality by PCR.","['Deane, M', 'McCarthy, K P', 'Wiedemann, L M', 'Norton, J D']","['Deane M', 'McCarthy KP', 'Wiedemann LM', 'Norton JD']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Clone Cells', '*Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*diagnosis/genetics/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Aug;5(8):726-30.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the two rearrangements contained a mutation in the coding sequence leading to the generation of a nonsense codon.

Rearrangements and/or deletions of the Ig heavy chain (IgH), Ig kappa chain (Ig kappa), and Ig lambda chain (Ig lambda) genes were detected in 98, 48, and 23% of cases, respectively. Although these percentages suggest the presence of a hierarchical order in IgH and Ig light chain (IgL) gene rearrangements during B-cell differentiation, no correlation was found between the immunophenotype of the precursor B-ALL and the arrangement patterns of their IgH and IgL genes. Multiple rearranged IgH gene bands, generally differing in density, were found in 27 (45%) of the precursor B-ALL in various restriction enzyme digests. Cytogenetic data were used to determine whether the presence of more than two rearranged IgH gene bands was caused by hyperdiploidy of chromosome 14 or other chromosome 14 aberrations. The combined cytogenetic and IgH gene data allowed the precursor B-ALL to be divided into three groups: a monoclonal group (n = 36; 60%), a biclonal group (n = 16; 27%), and an oligoclonal group (n = 8; 13%). In five biclonal ALL biclonality at the Ig kappa gene level was also found. Such subclone formation was not detected at the Ig lambda gene level. As the detection limit of the Southern blot technique is 2-5%, it might well be that small subclones remained undetected, implying that the frequency of subclone formation at the IgH gene level in precursor B-ALL is probably higher than 40%. It has been suggested that precursor B-ALL with multiple IgH gene rearrangements have a higher tendency to relapse. Although higher relapse rates were found in the oligoclonal group (53%) and in the combined bi-oligoclonal group (33%) compared with the monoclonal group (20%), the log rank trend test showed no significance. The occurrence of multiple subclones in precursor B-ALL as found by IgH gene analyses will severely hamper the detection of minimal residual disease using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mediated amplification of 'tumor-specific' IgH gene junctional regions, because it cannot be predicted which detectable (or undetectable) subclone will cause minimal residual disease and/or relapse.

During antineoplastic treatment, the concentration of microorganisms in saliva doubled from day 0 to day 2, presumably as a result of a concurrent 64% decrease in the salivary flow rate. No changes in the relative proportion of individual microorganisms or acquisition of new microorganisms occurred during antineoplastic treatment. During antibacterial treatment, which was subsequently initiated in all patients, a 100-fold decline occurred in the median salivary concentration of microorganisms within the first 7 days. During this period, members of the normal flora became undetectable in 5 patients, and Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus faecalis or Candida spp. became parts of the quantitatively predominant oral microflora in 7 patients. Apart from Candida spp., these potentially pathogenic microorganisms were acquired only after the initiation of the antibacterial treatment. After termination of the antibacterial treatment, the median concentration of microorganisms increased again to the original level and normal flora became reestablished within a period of 8 days. Clinically, 10/20 acute oral infections emerged before day 8, i.e. within the period with increased concentrations of microorganisms in saliva. Specifically, the clinical diagnosis of acute oral candidiasis was associated with a rise in the concentration of Candida spp. above a critical value of 1,000 CFU/ml. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 1 was detected in 4/9 HSV-seropositive patients on days 14 and 21, and HSV-1 was in all 4 cases isolated simultaneously with the emergence of an intraoral ulcer. The results suggest that chemotherapy-induced xerostomia plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of acute oral infections and transmission of potentially pathogenic microorganisms is of importance mainly after initiated antibiotic treatment in these patients.","['Bergmann, O J']",['Bergmann OJ'],"['Department of Oral Biology, Royal Dental College, Aarhus, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Infect Dis,Scandinavian journal of infectious diseases,0215333,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '74KXF8I502 (Aclarubicin)']",IM,"['Aclarubicin/administration & dosage', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bacteria, Aerobic/isolation & purification', 'Bacteria, Anaerobic/isolation & purification', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/microbiology', 'Candidiasis/etiology/microbiology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Enterobacteriaceae/isolation & purification', 'Enterococcus faecalis/isolation & purification', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mouth/*microbiology', 'Mouth Diseases/*etiology/microbiology', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Saliva/microbiology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/00365549109024323 [doi]'],ppublish,Scand J Infect Dis. 1991;23(3):355-66. doi: 10.3109/00365549109024323.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Because this receptor occurs on many or all murine cells and is probably essential for viability of cultured fibroblasts, its normal function might be to transport an essential metabolite. We expressed ecoR in Xenopus laevis oocytes by injecting RNA transcribed from the cloned cDNA. These oocytes specifically bound the gp70 envelope glycoprotein from an ecotropic murine leukaemia virus. An inward current was recorded electrophysiologically when a mixture of amino-acids was applied: this resulted from a stereoselective, saturable uptake of lysine, arginine and ornithine; it was independent of sodium and not substantially altered by gp70. Cysteine and homoserine were also taken up, but sodium was necessary for their transport. These properties of ecoR correspond to those of the y+ amino-acid transporter.

Structural information on the LIF receptor is not yet available, whereas recent cloning of the IL-6 receptor has shown it to be bipartite, with a signal-transducing subunit that lacks sequence homology to known protein kinases and produces second messengers of unknown nature. The molecular nature of the mechanisms which LIF and IL-6 use to induce cell differentiation is not known. To address this issue, we took advantage of a clone of M1 myeloblastic leukemia cells capable of being induced for terminal differentiation by both LIF and IL-6 directly activate the same set of immediate early response genes upon induction of M1 myeloid differentiation. At least two mechanisms of gene activation, one transcriptional and the other posttranscriptional, are shown to be involved. It is also shown that the LIF and IL-6 immediate early response, at suboptimal cytokine concentrations, is additive. Using a variety of protein kinase activators and inhibitors, we have shown that the intracellular signalling pathways for both LIF and IL-6 are distinct from those of known second messengers and involve protein phosphorylation, notably tyrosine phosphorylation of a 160-kDa protein, as an essential step(s) in the immediate early activation of MyD gene expression. These observations indicate that the functional similarities of LIF and IL-6 as inducers of cell differentiation prevail at the level of the complex differentiation immediate early response and implicate common mechanisms of signal transduction for LIF- and IL-6-induced differentiation.","['Lord, K A', 'Abdollahi, A', 'Thomas, S M', 'DeMarco, M', 'Brugge, J S', 'Hoffman-Liebermann, B', 'Liebermann, D A']","['Lord KA', 'Abdollahi A', 'Thomas SM', 'DeMarco M', 'Brugge JS', 'Hoffman-Liebermann B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '42HK56048U (Tyrosine)']",IM,"['*Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Interleukin-6/*physiology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lymphokines/*physiology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Signal Transduction/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tyrosine/*metabolism']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.9.4371-4379.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Sep;11(9):4371-9. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.9.4371-4379.1991.,,"['1RO1CA43618-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '1RO1CA47572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5T32HD07152/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC361299,,,,,,,,

The MTA phosphorylase-containing tumor cell lines, especially of human origin, were found to be more sensitive to treatment by these analogues. Of the analogue series, 10 was the most potent inhibitor of growth in each of the cell lines tested. The analogues, especially compound 10, displayed a reduced capacity to alter polyamine pools relative to MTA, mechanistically indicating a decreased potential for interactions at sites other than MTA phosphorylase. The results indicate that of the analogues tested, compound 10 displayed the best inhibitor/substrate interaction with MTA phosphorylase, which, in turn, correlated with more potent growth inhibition in tumor cell lines containing MTA phosphorylase. Overall, this supports the concept that MTA phosphorylase plays a role in the activation of such analogues.","['Sufrin, J R', 'Spiess, A J', 'Kramer, D L', 'Libby, P R', 'Miller, J T', 'Bernacki, R J', 'Lee, Y H', 'Borchardt, R T', 'Porter, C W']","['Sufrin JR', 'Spiess AJ', 'Kramer DL', 'Libby PR', 'Miller JT', 'Bernacki RJ', 'Lee YH', 'Borchardt RT', 'Porter CW']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Polyamines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""134782-20-0 (5'-deoxy-5'-((2-monofluoroethyl)thio)adenosine)"", ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", 'EC 2.4.2.1 (Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase)', ""EC 2.4.2.28 (5'-methylthioadenosine phosphorylase)"", 'EC 3.- (Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.3.1.1 (Adenosylhomocysteinase)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Adenosylhomocysteinase', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Drug Stability', 'Humans', 'Hydrolases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Structure', 'Polyamines/metabolism', 'Purine-Nucleoside Phosphorylase/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thionucleosides/chemical synthesis/*chemistry/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00112a039 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1991 Aug;34(8):2600-6. doi: 10.1021/jm00112a039.,,"['CA13038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37606/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

As such, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a prime example. LIF was initially described, purified, and genetically cloned on the basis of its ability to induce the differentiation and suppress the clonogenicity of the monocytic leukemia cell line, M1. Subsequently, it has become apparent that in vitro LIF inhibits the differentiation of pluripotential ES cells, stimulates the synthesis of hepatic acute-phase proteins, induces a switch in neurotransmitter phenotype from adrenergic to cholinergic, suppresses adipocyte lipoprotein lipase activity, and results in an increase in bone resorption. Moreover, elevation of LIF levels in vivo has a number of patho-physiological consequences, many of which parallel those effects observed in vitro. The challenge that lies ahead is to determine whether other sites of LIF action exist and to define more clearly the physiological role LIF plays in vivo. A major mechanism of cell-cell communication is by the production and secretion of polypeptide hormones by one cell type, which act either systemically or locally, via interaction with specific receptors on the surface of responsive cells. Recently, it has become apparent that hormones initially described and named, on the basis of a specific action, in many cases exert a spectrum of effects on a broad range of cell types. Moreover, the effects exerted are often mimicked closely by other hormones. Hormones that act in a pleiotropic manner are, for example, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), the various fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). This review will focus on the various biological effects ascribed to LIF.","['Hilton, D J', 'Gough, N M']","['Hilton DJ', 'Gough NM']","['Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Cell Biochem,Journal of cellular biochemistry,8205768,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Hormones)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Hormones/*physiology', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Lymphokines/*physiology']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcb.240460105 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Biochem. 1991 May;46(1):21-6. doi: 10.1002/jcb.240460105.,58,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lower level of tumor cytotoxicity by lipid A-activated AKR macrophages correlated with lower levels of cytotoxic nitric oxide generation as measured by nitrite end product accumulation. The refractory state of AKR macrophages was unexpectedly found to be independent of their C5 deficiency in that IFN-gamma reconstituted their response to activation by lipid A coincident with an increase in C1q mRNA synthesis. AKR macrophages were augmented in their lipid A activation by exogenous soluble C1q in the absence of IFN-gamma, which corresponded with an increased production of nitric oxide by C1q-reconstituted macrophages. In contrast, responsive C3H mouse macrophages with sufficient levels of C1q synthesis were inhibited by exogenous soluble monomeric C1q in their lipid A activation. Both AKR and C3H macrophages plated over immobilized C1q were inhibited in their lipid A activation for tumor cytotoxicity and nitric oxide generation. Our results provide evidence that C1q modulates macrophage activation by lipid A for nitric oxide-mediated tumor cytotoxicity under the influence of IFN-gamma, which stimulates C1q synthesis and secretion. These findings strongly suggest that macrophage synthesis of C1q, but not C5, is a prerequisite for their activation by lipid A.","['Leu, R W', 'Zhou, A Q', 'Rummage, J', 'Fast, D J', 'Shannon, B J']","['Leu RW', 'Zhou AQ', 'Rummage J', 'Fast DJ', 'Shannon BJ']","['Biomedical Division, Samuel Roberts Noble Foundation, Inc., Ardmore, OK 73402.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Lipid A)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '31C4KY9ESH (Nitric Oxide)', '80295-33-6 (Complement C1q)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Complement C1q/genetics/*pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Lipid A/*pharmacology', 'Macrophage Activation/*drug effects', 'Macrophages/immunology/metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Nitric Oxide/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/08/15 00:00,1991/08/15 00:01,['1991/08/15 00:00'],"['1991/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Aug 15;147(4):1315-21.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Potential involvement of a protein kinase C dependent mechanism.,7947-52,"1-beta-D-Arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) is an effective chemotherapeutic agent that incorporates into DNA and results in DNA fragmentation. Recent work has demonstrated that ara-C transiently induces expression of the c-jun immediate early response gene. The present studies in HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells extend these findings by demonstrating that the increase in c-jun mRNA levels at 6 h of ara-C treatment is regulated by a transcriptional mechanism. In contrast, the subsequent down-regulation of c-jun expression is controlled by a posttranscriptional decrease in the stability of the c-jun transcripts. Previous work in phorbol ester treated cells has indicated that c-jun expression is regulated by the activation of protein kinase C. The present results demonstrate that protein kinase C activity is increased in ara-C-treated cells. This increase was maximal at 60 min and remained detectable through 6 h of ara-C exposure. Moreover, the induction of c-jun transcripts by ara-C was inhibited by the isoquinolinesulfonamide derivative H7, but not by HA1004, suggesting that this effect is mediated by protein kinase C. Ara-C-induced c-jun expression was also inhibited by staurosporine, another inhibitor of protein kinase C. Taken together, these results indicate that the cellular response to ara-C includes the activation of protein kinase C and that ara-C potentially induces c-jun transcription by a protein kinase C dependent signaling mechanism.","['Kharbanda, S', 'Datta, R', 'Kufe, D']","['Kharbanda S', 'Datta R', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Isoquinolines)', '0 (Piperazines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Sulfonamides)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '38966-21-1 (Aphidicolin)', '84477-87-2 (1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine)', '91742-10-8 (N-(2-guanidinoethyl)-5-isoquinolinesulfonamide)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine', 'Aphidicolin', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/drug effects/physiology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Diterpenes/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoquinolines/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Piperazines/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Sulfonamides', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects']",1991/08/13 00:00,1991/08/13 00:01,['1991/08/13 00:00'],"['1991/08/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/13 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/13 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00246a011 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1991 Aug 13;30(32):7947-52. doi: 10.1021/bi00246a011.,,['CA29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['c-jun'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Raised against a monoclonal IgM rheumatoid factor autoantibody, this mAb recognizes a major kappa-L chain-associated cross reactive Id, designated 17.109-CRI. Molecular studies reveal that the 17.109-CRI in CLL is a serologic marker for expression of a conserved kappa L chain V region gene (V Kappa gene) of the V Kappa 3 subgroup, designated Humkv325. We isolated an upstream gene fragment of Humkv325 to examine for Ig gene rearrangements of this and other closely related V Kappa 3 genes by Southern analyses. Consistent with Humkv325 encoding the 17.109-CRI, we find that the genomic DNA from all 17.109-reactive leukemia cell populations have gene rearrangements that are detected using this probe. In addition, we observe V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements frequently in the genomic DNA of lambda L chain-expressing leukemia cells. Of the genomic DNA from 33 lambda-L chain-expressing CLL samples, 8 (24%) had additional nongerm-line bands detected with the Humkv325 probe. Consistent with these bands representing Ig gene rearrangements, the additional band in each but one sample also hybridized with probes specific for the J Kappa region and/or the kappa-deleting element. Using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), we examined the genomic DNA from all lambda L chain-expressing CLL for V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements to J Kappa and/or Kde. PCR on each DNA sample with V Kappa 3 gene rearrangements detected by Southern analysis generated gene fragments that hybridized specifically with oligonucleotides corresponding to framework or CDR of the Humkv325 gene. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of representative samples confirmed that these DNA contained abortive Humkv325 gene rearrangements. PCR for rearranged V Kappa 3 genes in the DNA of other lambda-L chain-expressing CLL either did not generate any PCR product or produced fragments that failed to hybridize with all Humkv325 oligonucleotide probes. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of the latter demonstrated that these represent abortive V Kappa gene rearrangements involving another conserved V Kappa 3 gene, designated Vg. These studies indicate that Humkv325 and Vg frequently may undergo Ig gene rearrangement independent of their expression. As such, the frequent use of Humkv325 in CLL may be secondary, in part, to an enhanced propensity of this V Kappa 3 gene to undergo genetic rearrangement during B cell ontogeny.","['Rassenti, L Z', 'Pratt, L F', 'Chen, P P', 'Carson, D A', 'Kipps, T J']","['Rassenti LZ', 'Pratt LF', 'Chen PP', 'Carson DA', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0945.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Light Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Autoantibodies/*genetics', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Light Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Aug 1;147(3):1060-6.,,"['AR07144/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'AR25443/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that chemical coupling of galactose residues to a virus might permit specific infection of hepatocytes mediated by asialoglycoprotein receptors unique to these cells. To test this hypothesis, we took advantage of the fact that: 1) artificial asialoglycoproteins can be created by chemical coupling of lactose to proteins; and 2) viruses that are ecotropic have a narrow species specificity. An ecotropic, rodent-specific, replication-defective murine leukemia virus containing the gene for beta-galactosidase was chemically modified with lactose to contain 5.9 mumol of lactose per mg of viral RNA. Modified and unmodified viruses were incubated for 5 days with HepG2, a human hepatoma line that possesses asialoglycoprotein receptors, and SK Hep1, a human cell line that does not. As expected from the ecotropism, unmodified virus did not produce beta-galactosidase activity in either cell type. Modified virus did not produce beta-galactosidase activity in SK Hep1 cells. However, modified virus did produce beta-galactosidase activity, 71.2 units/mg of cell protein, in the human receptor (+) HepG2 cells. Interestingly, modification of the virus also resulted in decreased enzyme activity in previously susceptible host rodent cells. Competition with modified virus by an excess of an asialoglycoprotein completely prevented development of enzymatic activity in HepG2 cells. Histochemical treatment of cells with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl beta-D-galactoside to detect in situ beta-galactosidase activity demonstrated that only HepG2 cells treated with modified virus were positive and that 36% of these cells were stained after 5 days.

HMBA treatment was associated with: (1) decreases in U-937 cell proliferation, (2) increases in nonspecific esterase activity and cell surface antigen expression consistent with monocytic differentiation, (3) decreases in c-myc gene expression, and (4) induction of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) transcripts. Treatment of U-937 cells with HMBA was also associated with increases in phospholipase A2 activity and increases in the release of arachidonic acid and its metabolites. Dexamethasone, an agent previously shown to inhibit monocytic differentiation, had no detectable effect on the down-regulation of c-myc, but blocked the induction of TNF expression. Taken together, the results demonstrate that HMBA induces monocytic differentiation of U-937 cells and that this effect is sensitive, in part, to dexamethasone.","['Bernstein, S H', 'Sherman, M L', 'Hass, R', 'Nakamura, T', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Kufe, D W']","['Bernstein SH', 'Sherman ML', 'Hass R', 'Nakamura T', 'Kharbanda S', 'Kufe DW']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Dexamethasone/pharmacology', 'Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'RNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha']",1991/07/05 00:00,1991/07/05 00:01,['1991/07/05 00:00'],"['1991/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(91)90728-N [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(91)90728-n [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1991 Jul 5;42(2):403-7. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(91)90728-n.,,"['CA 01092/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL 07516/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This CN-TPBP existed in cytosol of HeLa cells, but translocated into nuclear fraction of the cells after treatment of the cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA). The translocation of CN-TPBP induced by TPA became apparent within 10 min after the treatment with TPA, and was completed within 3 h. CN-TPBP bound TPA with the association constant of 1.4 x 10(10) M-1, and also bound teleocidin B, debromoaplysiatoxin, and thapsigargin in a mutually competitive manner. The binding affinity order of synthetic analogs of teleocidin B correlated with the adhesion-inducing potency order of the compounds toward human leukemia cell line HL-60. The apparent molecular weight of CN-TPBP under non-denaturing conditions was estimated to be 66-68 kDa. CN-TPBP forms a complex with the 90 kDa heat shock protein, and the complex was stabilized by the presence of molybdate. These characteristics of CN-TPBP are similar to those of the nuclear receptors of glucocorticoid and dioxin. These findings suggested that CN-TPBP acts as a nuclear receptor for tumor promoters, and that tumor promoters may exert their biological effects by binding to CN-TPBP.","['Hashimoto, Y', 'Shudo, K']","['Hashimoto Y', 'Shudo K']","['Institute of Applied Microbiology, University of Tokyo.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Jpn J Cancer Res,Japanese journal of cancer research : Gann,8509412,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Carcinogens/*metabolism', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'HeLa Cells/drug effects/metabolism', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Structure', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1349-7006.1991.tb01902.x [doi]'],ppublish,Jpn J Cancer Res. 1991 Jun;82(6):665-75. doi: 10.1111/j.1349-7006.1991.tb01902.x.,,,,,,,PMC5918497,,,,,,,,

In vitro, NC proteins activate both dimerization of viral RNA and annealing of the replication primer tRNA onto viral RNA, two reactions necessary for the production of infectious virions. In this study the role of the zinc finger of Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) NCp10 in RNA binding and annealing activities was investigated through modification or replacement of residues involved in zinc coordination. These alterations did not affect the ability of NCp10 to bind RNA and promote RNA annealing in vitro, despite a complete loss of zinc affinity. However mutation of two conserved lysine residues adjacent to the finger motif reduced both RNA binding and annealing activities of NCp10. These findings suggest that the complexed NC zinc finger is not directly involved in RNA-protein interactions but more probably in a zinc dependent conformation of NC protein modulating viral protein-protein interactions, essential to the process of viral RNA selection and virion assembly. Then the NC zinc finger may cooperate to select the viral RNA genome to be packaged into virions.","['Prats, A C', 'Housset, V', 'de Billy, G', 'Cornille, F', 'Prats, H', 'Roques, B', 'Darlix, J L']","['Prats AC', 'Housset V', 'de Billy G', 'Cornille F', 'Prats H', 'Roques B', 'Darlix JL']","['Centre de Recherche de Biochimie et Genetique Cellulaires du CNRS, Toulouse, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,"['0 (RNA, Transfer, Pro)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Viral Core Proteins)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)', 'K848JZ4886 (Cysteine)']",IM,"['Alkylation', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Capsid/genetics/*metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Cysteine/metabolism', 'Escherichia coli/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics/*physiology', 'Mutation/genetics', 'Plasmids/genetics', 'RNA, Transfer, Pro/metabolism', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'Viral Core Proteins/genetics/*metabolism', 'Zinc/metabolism', 'Zinc Fingers/*physiology']",1991/07/11 00:00,1991/07/11 00:01,['1991/07/11 00:00'],"['1991/07/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/11 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/19.13.3533 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1991 Jul 11;19(13):3533-41. doi: 10.1093/nar/19.13.3533.,,,,,,,PMC328376,,,,,,,,

However, pure platelet suspensions transformed exogenous leukotriene A4 to lipoxins, including lipoxin A4 and (6S)-lipoxin A4, but not lipoxin B4. This compound was produced exclusively in the presence of granulocytes. A common unstable tetraene intermediate in lipoxin formation, 15-hydroxy-leukotriene A4 [5(6)-epoxy-15-hydroxy-7,9,13-trans-11-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid], was indicated by trapping experiments with methanol. Thus, identical profiles of less polar tetraene-containing derivatives were formed from leukotriene A4 in platelet suspensions, from exogenous 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid in granulocyte suspensions and from endogenous substrate in mixed platelet/granulocyte suspensions. Evidence for the involvement of 12-lipoxygenase in platelet-dependent lipoxin formation was obtained. Thus, lipoxin synthesis from leukotriene A4 and 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid production from arachidonic acid by human platelets was equally inhibited by 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid with 50% inhibition obtained at 7.0 microM and 8.2 microM, respectively. In experiments with subcellular preparations from platelets, lipoxin synthesis was observed in both the particulate and soluble fraction and was paralleled by the 12-lipoxygenase activity. Furthermore, lipoxin formation from leukotriene A4 in platelet sonicates was dose-dependently inhibited by exogenous arachidonic acid. Finally, 12-lipoxygenase-deficient platelets from a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia were totally unable to produce lipoxins from exogenous or granulocyte-derived leukotriene A4. It is concluded that the transcellular lipoxin synthesis is dependent on the platelet 12-lipoxygenase and proceeds via the unstable intermediate, 15-hydroxy-leukotriene A4. This tetraene epoxide is transformed to lipoxin B4 by a granulocyte epoxide hydrolase activity or to lipoxin A4 and lipoxins A4/B4 isomers by enzymatic or nonenzymatic hydrolysis.","['Edenius, C', 'Stenke, L', 'Lindgren, J A']","['Edenius C', 'Stenke L', 'Lindgren JA']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '0 (Lipoxins)', '0 (lipoxin A4)', '92950-25-9 (lipoxin B4)', 'EC 1.13.11.12 (Lipoxygenase)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acids/*blood', 'Blood Platelets/*metabolism', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/*blood/isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/blood', '*Lipoxins', 'Lipoxygenase/*blood', 'Models, Biological', 'Reference Values', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism']",1991/07/15 00:00,1991/07/15 00:01,['1991/07/15 00:00'],"['1991/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb16137.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1991 Jul 15;199(2):401-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb16137.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated the effect of recombinant interferon-alpha 2a (IFN-alpha) on this interaction between hematopoietic progenitor cells and bone marrow-derived stromal cells by culturing normal stromal cells with IFN-alpha (50 to 5,000 U/mL). At 50 U/mL we found that: (1) the capacity of stromal cells to bind two types of CML primitive progenitor cells (BI-CFC and long-term culture-initiating cells) was increased; and (2) the amount of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in the stromal layer was increased. However, sulfated GAGs were not directly involved in binding CML BI-CFC, unlike binding by normal BI-CFC, which is sulfated GAG-dependent. Neuraminidase-treated control stromal cells bound an increased number of CML BI-CFC, reproducing the effect of IFN-alpha, whereas the binding to IFN-alpha-treated stromal cells was unaffected by neuraminidase treatment. Thus, the enhanced attachment by primitive CML progenitor cells to INF-alpha-treated stromal cells might be due to changes in the neuraminic acid composition in the stromal cell layer. Our in vitro evidence may provide insights into the mechanism of action of IFN-alpha in vivo. Prolonged administration may alter the marrow microenvironment in some patients such that it can restrain the aberrant proliferation of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive stem cells while permitting Ph-negative stem cells to function normally.","['Dowding, C', 'Guo, A P', 'Osterholz, J', 'Siczkowski, M', 'Goldman, J', 'Gordon, M']","['Dowding C', 'Guo AP', 'Osterholz J', 'Siczkowski M', 'Goldman J', 'Gordon M']","['MRC/LRF Leukaemia Unit, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/physiology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Adhesion/*drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/drug effects/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/*pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*blood/pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1991/07/15 00:00,1991/07/15 00:01,['1991/07/15 00:00'],"['1991/07/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83226-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jul 15;78(2):499-505.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously, we have shown that both c-myc and c-myb were induced in normal myeloid precursors when the cells were stimulated for growth, were expressed in the autonomously proliferating myeloid leukemic M1 cell line and were rapidly suppressed in both normal and M1 cells following induction of terminal differentiation associated with growth arrest. In order to distinguish molecular events associated with terminal differentiation versus those due to growth inhibition, as well as to increase our understanding of the role of the proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-myb in both of these cellular processes, in this work we have studied the expression of c-myc and c-myb in M1 cells induced for growth inhibition associated with terminal differentiation (via treatment with the physiological inducers IL6 or leukemia inhibitory factor mean value of LIF), partial differentiation (using IL1 or LPS) or no detectable differentiation properties (using IFN beta or IFN gamma). We show that, for all the treatments used in this study, down regulation of the proto-oncogenes c-myc and c-myb occurred only when M1 cells were stimulated to undergo terminal differentiation. In addition, we transfected the M1 cell line with a vector containing the c-myc gene under control of the beta-actin promoter, so that c-myc was no longer down regulated by IL6 or LIF. Previously, we have shown that in the presence of the myeloid differentiation inducers IL6 or LIF, these M1myc cells were blocked at an intermediate stage of myeloid differentiation and continued to proliferate. In sharp contrast to their altered response to IL6 or LIF, M1myc cells were as responsive as the parental M1 cells to growth suppression by the different antiproliferative compounds which do not induce terminal differentiation. Thus, continued expression of c-myc had no effect on growth suppression induced by IL1, IFN beta, IFN gamma and LPS. Taken together, these results indicate that c-myc and c-myb down regulation is not necessary for growth suppression, but down regulation of c-myc is, and c-myb may be, essential for terminal differentiation.","['Hoffman-Liebermann, B', 'Liebermann, D A']","['Hoffman-Liebermann B', 'Liebermann DA']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects/physiology', 'Cell Division/drug effects/physiology', 'Down-Regulation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic/drug effects/physiology', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myb', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics/metabolism', 'Suppression, Genetic/*genetics/physiology']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1991 Jun;6(6):903-9.,,['1R01CA43618-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, Tax1 activated expression of two other transcription factors having zinc finger motifs, Egr-1 and Egr-2, in the same cells. The Tax1-inducible transcription factors identified here are encoded by the members of immediate early genes under the control of growth signals.

When these analogues were separated into mitomycin C and mitomycin A subsets, the former gave a correlation only with E1/2, whereas the latter (which differ little in their E1/2 values) gave a correlation only with log P. These correlations are in contrast to those made in the P388 leukemia assay in mice wherein the most active mitomycin C and mitomycin A analogues were the most hydrophilic ones. When the same compounds were tested against P388 leukemia cells in the MTT assay, the results were the same as those of the solid tumor assays.

In this report we show that DNA binding activity of 2 regulatory factors, KBFI and NF-kappa B, known to be essential for constitutive expression of MHC-class-I genes, is deficient in nuclear extracts from K562 cells. Induction of class-I gene expression at the surface of tumor cells by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) shows that TNF-alpha can act in synergy with IFN-gamma to induce DNA binding of both factors NF-kappa B and KBFI to the class-I gene enhancer and that this induction of transcriptional factors is correlated with enhancement of MHC-class-I mRNA transcription and cell-surface antigen expression.","['Blanchet, O', 'Bourge, J F', 'Zinszner, H', 'Tatari, Z', 'Degos, L', 'Paul, P']","['Blanchet O', 'Bourge JF', 'Zinszner H', 'Tatari Z', 'Degos L', 'Paul P']","['INSERM U93, Centre Hayem, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer Suppl,International journal of cancer.

Functional and biochemical aspects of membrane association.,631-6,"Phospholipase A2 activity was characterized in the human monocytic tumour-cell lines U937 and THP1. The enzyme showed an alkaline pH optimum and substrate specificity for arachidonoyl-phosphatidylcholine. The activation of phospholipase A2 required bivalent cations (Ca2+ greater than Mg2+ = Sr2+ greater than Ba2+). Investigation of the subcellular distribution of the enzyme revealed that the phospholipase A2 activity was shifted to the cytosol in the presence of EDTA, indicating that the association of the enzyme with the cellular membranes is Ca2+ (bivalent-cation)-dependent. Stimulation of THP1 cells for 2-4 h with the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) activated cytosolic and membrane-bound phospholipase A2. At this time, no effect of PMA on phospholipase A2 activity was observed in the less mature U937 cells. However, when both cell lines were induced to differentiate along the monocytic pathway by a 2-3-day treatment with PMA, the cells released significant amounts of arachidonic acid and prostanoids. Compared with undifferentiated control cells, these PMA-differentiated cells showed a decrease in cytosolic phospholipase A2 activity and an increase in membrane-bound activity. Membrane-bound and cytosolic enzyme showed the same pH optimum, Ca(2+)-dependency and substrate specificity. These data indicate that membrane-bound and cytosolic phospholipase A2 activities represent one enzyme and that the membrane-bound form is the biologically active phospholipase A2.","['Rehfeldt, W', 'Hass, R', 'Goppelt-Struebe, M']","['Rehfeldt W', 'Hass R', 'Goppelt-Struebe M']","['Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Medical School Hannover, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '9G34HU7RV0 (Edetic Acid)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/pharmacology', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/drug effects/enzymology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Edetic Acid/pharmacology', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Membrane Proteins/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism/*physiology', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Substrate Specificity/drug effects', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1991/06/15 00:00,1991/06/15 00:01,['1991/06/15 00:00'],"['1991/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2760631 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1991 Jun 15;276 ( Pt 3):631-6. doi: 10.1042/bj2760631.,,,,,,,PMC1151051,,,,,,,,

Rex action requires a 255-nucleotide viral RNA stem-loop structure termed the Rex RNA response element (RexRE) located in the 3' retroviral long terminal repeat. Rex function leads to the induced cytoplasmic expression of the incompletely spliced family of viral mRNAs that uniquely encode the HTLV-I structural and enzymatic proteins (Gag, Pol, and Env). Our studies now demonstrate that Rex acts by binding directly to the RexRE in a sequence-specific manner. These effects of Rex require the presence of a 10-nucleotide subregion of the RexRE that is essential for Rex function in vivo. Dominant-negative mutants of Rex also bind to the RexRE with high affinity, while a recessive-negative Rex mutant altered within its arginine-rich, positively charged domain fails to engage the RexRE. Analogously, both the wild-type and dominant-negative Rex proteins specifically bind to the structurally distinct HIV-1 Rev response element, a finding that likely underlies the respective stimulatory and inhibitory effects of these HTLV-I proteins in the heterologous HIV-1 system. However, consistent with their lack of amino acid homology, the binding sites for Rex and Rev within the HIV-1 Rev response element are distinct.","['Bogerd, H P', 'Huckaby, G L', 'Ahmed, Y F', 'Hanly, S M', 'Greene, W C']","['Bogerd HP', 'Huckaby GL', 'Ahmed YF', 'Hanly SM', 'Greene WC']","['Department of Medicine, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC 27710.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Gene Products, rev)', '0 (Gene Products, rex)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Fusion Proteins)', '0 (rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus)']",IM,"['Binding Sites', 'Carrier Proteins/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Escherichia coli', 'Gene Products, rev/*genetics', 'Gene Products, rex/*metabolism', 'HIV-1/*genetics', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Mutation', 'RNA, Viral/*metabolism', 'RNA-Binding Proteins', 'Recombinant Fusion Proteins/metabolism', '*Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'rev Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.13.5704 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Jul 1;88(13):5704-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.13.5704.,,,"['rev', 'rex']",,,,PMC51946,,,,,,,,

Analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.,12508-13,"The key enzymes in the formation of eicosanoids, including leukocyte 5-lipoxygenase (5LX), platelet 12-lipoxygenase (12LX), reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase (15LX), prostaglandin G/H synthase cyclooxygenase, and leukotriene A4 (LTA) hydrolase have been studied extensively in recent years. Little is known, however, about the regulation of these enzymes at the gene level. We have developed a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to quantify the mRNAs for these five enzymes, as well as for cytoplasmic beta-actin (bACT) mRNA. Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells, which display megakaryocytic/erythroid characteristics, were selected as a source of RNA to characterize the assay. These cells expressed mRNA for bACT, LTA, cyclooxygenase, and 12LX (in decreasing order). mRNA for 5LX and 15LX was undetectable. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells obtained from asthmatic patients, primarily alveolar macrophages, contained mRNA for bACT, LTA, 5LX, cyclooxygenase, and 15LX (in decreasing order). Treatment of HEL cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or steroid administration to asthmatic patients apparently selectively regulated certain of these target genes. The utility of this assay in quantifying mRNA for the various target genes in blood cells, including platelets from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, has also been demonstrated. Studies on the regulation of genes for enzymes involved in the leukotriene and prostaglandin biosynthetic pathways, especially when only small tissue samples are available, will be facilitated with this approach.","['Funk, C D', 'FitzGerald, G A']","['Funk CD', 'FitzGerald GA']","['Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37232.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 1.13.11.31 (Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.13.11.33 (Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.13.11.34 (Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase)', 'EC 1.14.99.1 (Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases)', 'EC 3.3.2.- (Epoxide Hydrolases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'V38765PUZ6 (leukotriene A4 hydrolase)']",IM,"['Actins/analysis', 'Arachidonate 12-Lipoxygenase/analysis', 'Arachidonate 15-Lipoxygenase/analysis', 'Arachidonate 5-Lipoxygenase/analysis', 'Asthma/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Blood Platelets/enzymology', 'Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid/chemistry', 'Epoxide Hydrolases/analysis', 'Erythrocytes/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/enzymology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthases/analysis', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'Reticulocytes/enzymology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1991/07/05 00:00,1991/07/05 00:01,['1991/07/05 00:00'],"['1991/07/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/05 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)98928-3 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Jul 5;266(19):12508-13.,,['HL30400/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The purpose of this study was to determine whether a rise in PCO2 in such blood could be a useful indication of consumption of oxygen in vitro. Because of the non-bocarbonate buffer capacity of blood and the carriage of CO2, mainly as bicarbonate, we reasoned that the rise in PCO2 would be too small to be helpful. Hence the quantitative relationship between the consumption of oxygen and the production of CO2 in blood was determined. Other reactions yielding CO2 (the titration of lactic acid) were monitored. Consumption of oxygen was stimulated in blood of normals in vitro by adding methylene blue (100 mumol/L); in addition, blood from four patients with leukemia was studied without additions. The rate of consumption of oxygen at 22 degrees C was linear over 60 min; the respiratory quotient was close to unity. The rise in PCO2 was small even when the fall in PO2 was 60 mmHg.

RNA analysis revealed substantial expression of the genes encoding beta-globin and the erythroid-specific transcription factor GF-1. Although apparently immortal, the lines were not initially transplantable. Thus, constitutive myc expression in early erythroid cells can enhance their self-renewal capacity but is insufficient to fully transform them. The cell lines proliferated without the addition of exogenous factors, but their clonogenicity in semisolid medium was enhanced in the presence of erythropoietin, interleukin 3, and/or leukemia-inhibitory factor. In combination with either interleukin 3 or erythropoietin, leukemia-inhibitory factor also facilitated differentiation of certain lines.

Thus the suggestion on the basis of in vitro studies that the early phase of A-RadLV lymphomagenesis is associated with suppressor T-cells which abrogate a potential anti-tumor immune response has not been confirmed in these studies.","['Haran-Ghera, N', 'Peled, A']","['Haran-Ghera N', 'Peled A']","['Department of Chemical Immunology, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (CD8 Antigens)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/pharmacology', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/immunology', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology', 'CD8 Antigens', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Cyclosporins/pharmacology', 'Disease Models, Animal', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocyte Subsets', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Jun;5(6):500-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Inocula of BALBRL male 1 were rejected in C57BL/6 (B6) mice treated with minimum essential medium (MEM) (control), anti-L3T4 (CD4) monoclonal antibody (mAb) or anti-Lyt-2.2 (CD8) mAb and CTL against the tumor were generated in vitro. No rejection and no induction of CTL were observed in B6 mice treated with anti-L3T4 (CD4) plus anti-Lyt-2.2 (CD8) mAb. CTL with the classical Thy-1+ CD3+CD4-CD8+ TCR alpha beta phenotype were generated in mixed lymphocyte tumor cell culture (MLTC) spleen cells from B6 mice treated with MEM (control) or anti-L3T4 (CD4) mAb, whereas CTL with an unusual Thy-1+CD3+CD4-CD8- TCR alpha beta phenotype were generated in MLTC spleen cells from anti-Lyt-2.2 (CD8) mAb-treated B6 mice. Both types of CTL were reactive with both H-2Kd and Dd (Ld) class I antigen. These findings suggest that when CD4+ cells were blocked by anti-L3T4 (CD4) mAb, CD8+ CTL mediated rejection, and when CD8+ cells were blocked by anti-Lyt-2.2 (CD8) mAb, CD4+ cells were capable of mediating rejection, although less efficiently than CD8+ cells, by inducing CD4-CD8- TCR alpha beta CTL. The finding that adoptive transfer of CD4 and CD8-depleted MLTC spleen cells, obtained from anti-Lyt-2.2 (CD8) mAb-treated B6 mice that had rejected BALBRL male 1, resulted in rejection of BALBRL male 1 inoculated into B6 nu/nu mice confirmed the above notion.

In undifferentiated HL-60 cells, neither ATP nor FMLP elicited significant PLD activation or increased secretion despite the previously documented ability of ATP to stimulate large increases in polyphosphoinositide hydrolysis and Ca2+ mobilization. Conversely, within 1 d after induction of granulocytic differentiation by dibutyryl cAMP, both ATP and FMLP induced large increases in azurophilic secretion and corresponding increases in PLD activity. ATP-activated PLD activity was near-maximal within 1 d after dibutyryl cAMP treatment, while the FMLP-induced activity increased continuously over 4 d, with a maximal level twice that stimulated by ATP. Additional experiments characterized the activation of PLD by receptor-independent pathways at different stages of differentiation; these included studies of phorbol ester action in intact cells and GTP gamma S action in electropermeabilized cells. An apparent role for guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins in PLD regulation was also indicated by the significant reduction in FMLP- and ATP-stimulated PLD activity observed in cells pretreated with pertussis toxin. At all stages of differentiation, there was good correlation between the relative efficacies of ATP versus FMLP in stimulating both secretion and PLD activity. These data indicate: (a) that the receptor-regulated phospholipase D signaling pathway is induced during differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells; and (b) that differential activation of this signaling system by various Ca(2+)-mobilizing receptor agonists may underlie the differential regulation of secretion and other phagocyte functions by such agents.","['Xie, M S', 'Jacobs, L S', 'Dubyak, G R']","['Xie MS', 'Jacobs LS', 'Dubyak GR']","['Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,"['0 (Phosphatidic Acids)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Receptors, Purinergic)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '3K9958V90M (Ethanol)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 3.1.4.4 (Phospholipase D)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Ethanol/pharmacology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/*pharmacology', 'Phosphatidic Acids/metabolism', 'Phospholipase D/*analysis', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Receptors, Purinergic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI115303 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1991 Jul;88(1):45-54. doi: 10.1172/JCI115303.,,"['GM-36387/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-07653/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC296001,,,,,,,,

Purified toxin A was radiolabeled using a modified Bolton-Hunter method to sp act 2 microCi/micrograms, with retention of full biologic activity. 3H-Toxin A bound specifically to a single class of receptors on rabbit BB and on RBL cells with dissociation constants of 5.4 x 10(-8) and 3.5 x 10(-8) M, respectively. RBL cells were highly sensitive to toxin A (cell rounding) and had 180,000 specific binding sites per cell, whereas IMR-90 fibroblasts were far less sensitive to toxin A and lacked detectable specific binding sites. Exposure of BB to trypsin or chymotrypsin significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding. Preincubation of BB with Bandeirea simplicifolia (BS-1) lectin also reduced specific binding, and CHAPS-solubilized receptors could be immobilized with WGA-agarose. The addition of 100 nM toxin A accelerated the association of 35S-GTP gamma S with rabbit ileal BB, and preincubation of BB with the GTP analogues GTP gamma S or Gpp(NH)p, significantly reduced 3H-toxin A specific binding.

However, HA-induced calcium mobilization was transient and returned to the basal level within 1-2 min, whereas HA-BSA-induced calcium mobilization was sustained for more than 10 min as a result of the additional influx of extracellular calcium. More interestingly, fluorescein (FITC) labeled HA-BSA was less incorporated into cytosols and present in the membrane fractions for more than 60 min, whereas membrane-bound FITC-HA was rapidly incorporated into cytosols. Furthermore, the levels of inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, which is known to activate calcium channels were more sustained after HA-BSA stimulation than those of HA alone.

We used decision-analysis techniques to determine whether prophylactic intravenous immune globulin is likely to result in an overall clinical benefit to patients who receive this treatment and to examine its cost effectiveness. METHODS: We constructed a model to compare two strategies: treatment with intravenous immune globulin at a dose of 400 mg per kilogram of body weight every three weeks and no immune globulin therapy. Baseline estimates of the efficacy of intravenous immune globulin were derived from the published results of the randomized trial. The costs of treatment, complications, and infections were estimated on the basis of component costs. Health outcomes were measured in terms of gains in quality-adjusted life expectancy. RESULTS: Intravenous immune globulin therapy can result in a loss of quality-adjusted life expectancy when the inconvenience of treatment is taken into account. If the inconvenience of treatment is not considered, therapy results in a gain of 0.8 quality-adjusted days per patient per year of therapy at a cost of $6 million per quality-adjusted life-year gained. CONCLUSIONS: Decision-analysis modeling may be applied to the results of randomized controlled trials to assess the potential clinical and financial effects of adopting the intervention in medical practice.

The effects of this agent on gene expression, particularly the transcriptional induction of genes implicated in growth control, are unknown. The present results demonstrate that etoposide induces expression of the c-jun protooncogene in HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. This induction of c-jun expression was maximal at 3 hr and was transient. Similar findings were obtained in the human U-937 myeloid leukemia cell line. Nuclear run-on assays demonstrated that the induction of c-jun expression by etoposide is regulated at the transcriptional level. The results further demonstrate that etoposide-induced c-jun expression occurs in association with the appearance of c-fos transcripts. Moreover, the c-jun gene is induced by etoposide during periods of oligonucleosomal DNA cleavage, which is characteristic of programmed cell death. These findings suggest that transcriptional induction of c-jun expression represents a signaling pathway activated in the cellular response to etoposide-induced DNA damage.","['Rubin, E', 'Kharbanda, S', 'Gunji, H', 'Kufe, D']","['Rubin E', 'Kharbanda S', 'Gunji H', 'Kufe D']","['Laboratory of Clinical Pharmacology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)']",IM,"['DNA Damage', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1991 Jun;39(6):697-701.,,"['CA-29431/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-42802/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",['c-jun'],,,,,,,,,,,,

Temporary cellular anoxia has previously been shown to activate transcription of endogenous type C leukemia virus sequences, resulting in a significant increase in retroviral RNA within the cell (1). Here we report a 15-fold increase in HIV-1-specific RNA in unstimulated ACH.2 T cells within 24 h of anoxia. This induction of RNA is accompanied by an accumulation of intracellular p24 gag protein as well as an increase in envelope protein. Anoxia induces a further increase in total HIV-1 RNA in ACH.2 cells prestimulated to produce virus by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and in H9 T cells acutely infected with HIV-1-IIIB. The induction of RNA in ACH.2 cells appears to be reversible. Anoxic culture for 24 h followed by a 24-h re-oxygenation period results in a return to ""resting state"" levels of HIV-1 RNA.

Between 2 h and 4 h following TPA-treatment U937 cells started to release significant amounts of TNF-alpha which remained detectable until 8-10 days. A significant IL-1 beta release was measured 24 h-48 h post stimulation and increased levels of IL-1 beta persisted until 20-22 days of culture. In contrast no release of either IL-1 alpha or IL-6 could be detected with 5 x 10(-9) M TPA during the whole time course of the experiments. The sequential induction of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta appeared to be independently regulated since TNF-alpha release was not required for the onset of IL-1 beta production. Northern-blot analysis confirmed the sequential induction and the long term expression of TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta mRNAs. Western-blot analysis predominantly showed a high molecular weight IL-1 beta protein of about 35 kD. Further investigations on the regulation of cytokine production and release by TPA-differentiated U937 cells revealed that TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta synthesis was not influenced by exogenously added rhTNF-alpha or PGE2, whereas rh gamma-IFN specifically enhanced the IL-1 beta production. Thus, the regulation and intracellular processing of cytokines generated by differentiating U937 cells shows some differences when compared to mature monocytes/macrophages which may be related to the tumorigenic origin of U937 cells or to an incomplete differentiation.","['Hass, R', 'Lonnemann, G', 'Mannel, D', 'Topley, N', 'Hartmann, A', 'Kohler, L', 'Resch, K', 'Goppelt-Strube, M']","['Hass R', 'Lonnemann G', 'Mannel D', 'Topley N', 'Hartmann A', 'Kohler L', 'Resch K', 'Goppelt-Strube M']","['Department of Molecular Pharmacology, Medical School, Hannover, F.R.G.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dinoprostone/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/drug effects/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(91)90008-h [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(5):327-39. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90008-h.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, administration of TNF alpha to mice bearing solid MBL-2 tumor led to increased tumor vascular permeability within 1 h, and resulted in the enhanced accumulation of systemically transferred LAK cells in tumor tissue. Based on these results, we treated MBL-2-bearing mice with TNF alpha and then with LAK cells 1 h later. No therapeutic effect was observed when tumor-bearing mice were treated with TNF alpha alone or LAK cells plus IL2.

We used an in vitro tumor lysis model that incorporated fresh CLL cells from 21 different patients as targets for two distinct normal human leukocyte effector subsets, neutrophils, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Lym-1 antigen (Lym-1-Ag) expression varied greatly and did not correlate with the expression of other CLL-associated antigens such as CD5, CD19, or HLA-DR. CLL cells were not lysed by neutrophils alone or with IFN-gamma in the absence of Lym-1. Neutrophil Lym-1-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) in the absence of IFN-gamma was weak and inconsistent. IFN-gamma exposure induced MoAb-dependent lysis of 80% of 21 CLL targets and resulted in an eightfold augmentation of neutrophil ADCC against the remainder. Cytotoxicity correlated directly and positively with Lym-1-Ag expression. Confirmation of the need for interaction between neutrophil IgG Fc receptors (Fc gamma Rs) and the Fc portion of the Lym-1 MoAb was obtained by demonstrating that purified Staphylococcus aureus Protein A (SpA) inhibited ADCC. IFN-gamma exposure caused no consistent alternations in Lym-1-Ag expression on CLL cells so that target antigen upregulation was unlikely to account for augmentation of neutrophil ADCC.

Recent studies have indicated that a class of cellular genes known as early response genes are important in the control of cellular growth properties. Two of these genes, c-jun and c-fos, play an important role in the control of cellular differentiation. Because the acute myelogenous leukemia cell line, HL-60, is capable of differentiating to either macrophages or granulocytes, it provides a good model to understand differential gene expression. To determine if the modulation of c-jun was important in the differentiation of HL-60 cells to either macrophages or granulocytes, expression of c-jun mRNA was determined by Northern analysis at various times following treatment with a variety of differentiating agents, including 12-tetradeconyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA), retinoic acid (RA), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), or 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25 (OH)2 D3]. Both TPA and 1,25(OH)2D3, which induce HL-60 cells to differentiate to macrophages, resulted in marked increases in c-jun mRNA; while RA and DMSO, which induce HL-60 cells to differentiate to granulocytes, did not greatly alter c-jun mRNA expression. HL-60 cell lines resistant to macrophage differentiation after exposure to either 1,25(OH)2D3 or TPA did not result in increases in c-jun mRNA. These results suggest that elevation of c-jun mRNA in HL-60 cells correlated temporally with differentiation to macrophages. Thus, c-jun may be a critical cellular transcription factor involved in macrophage differentiation.","['Gaynor, R', 'Simon, K', 'Koeffler, P']","['Gaynor R', 'Simon K', 'Koeffler P']","['Division of Hematology-Oncology, UCLA School of Medicine, Wadsworth Veterans Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', '*Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrophages/*metabolism/pathology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/06/15 00:00,1991/06/15 00:01,['1991/06/15 00:00'],"['1991/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85276-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jun 15;77(12):2618-23.,,"['CA26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA30981/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43277/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",['c-jun'],,,,,,,,,,,,

We have used provirus tagging to identify genes that cooperate with the E mu-myc transgene in B cell transformation. Here we report on the identification of four loci, pim-1, bmi-1, pal-1, and bla-1, which are occupied by proviruses in 35%, 35%, 28%, and 14% of the tumors, respectively. bmi-1, pal-1, and bla-1 represent novel common proviral insertion sites. The bmi-1 gene encodes a 324 amino acid protein with a predominantly nuclear localization. bmi-1 is highly conserved in evolution and contains several motifs frequently found in transcriptional regulators, including a new putative zinc finger motif. No genes have yet been assigned to pal-1 and bla-1. The distribution of proviruses over the four common insertion sites suggests that provirus tagging can be used not only to identify the cooperating oncogenes but also to assign these genes to distinct complementation groups in tumorigenesis.","['van Lohuizen, M', 'Verbeek, S', 'Scheijen, B', 'Wientjens, E', 'van der Gulden, H', 'Berns, A']","['van Lohuizen M', 'Verbeek S', 'Scheijen B', 'Wientjens E', 'van der Gulden H', 'Berns A']","['Division of Molecular Genetics, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cell,Cell,0413066,"['0 (Bmi1 protein, mouse)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Repressor Proteins)', 'EC 2.3.2.27 (Polycomb Repressive Complex 1)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Enhancer Elements, Genetic', '*Genes, Immunoglobulin', '*Genes, myc', 'Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/*genetics', 'Lymphoma/*genetics/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Transgenic', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Mutagenesis, Insertional', 'Nuclear Proteins/*genetics', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Polycomb Repressive Complex 1', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction/methods', '*Proto-Oncogene Proteins', 'Proviruses/genetics', '*Repressor Proteins', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Zinc Fingers/genetics']",1991/05/31 00:00,1991/05/31 00:01,['1991/05/31 00:00'],"['1991/05/31 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/31 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/31 00:00 [entrez]']","['0092-8674(91)90382-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0092-8674(91)90382-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell. 1991 May 31;65(5):737-52. doi: 10.1016/0092-8674(91)90382-9.,,,,,,['Cell. 1991 Aug 23;66(4):623.

The results of previous phase I-II clinical trials suggest that recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (rhGM-CSF) may accelerate neutrophil recovery and thereby reduce complications in patients after autologous bone marrow transplantation. METHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at three institutions. The study design and treatment schedules were identical, and the results were pooled for analysis. One hundred twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Sixty-five patients received rhGM-CSF in a two-hour intravenous infusion daily for 21 days, starting within four hours of the marrow infusion, and 63 patients received placebo. RESULTS: No toxic effects specifically ascribed to rhGM-CSF were observed. The patients given rhGM-CSF had a recovery of the neutrophil count to 500 x 10(6) per liter 7 days earlier than the patients who received placebo (19 vs. 26 days, P less than 0.001), had fewer infections, required 3 fewer days of antibiotic administration (24 vs. 27 days, P = 0.009), and required 6 fewer days of initial hospitalization (median, 27 vs. 33 days; P = 0.01). There was no difference in the survival rate at day 100. CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation for lymphoid neoplasia, rhGM-CSF significantly lessens morbidity. Further studies will be required to establish its optimal dosage and schedule of administration.","['Nemunaitis, J', 'Rabinowe, S N', 'Singer, J W', 'Bierman, P J', 'Vose, J M', 'Freedman, A S', 'Onetto, N', 'Gillis, S', 'Oette, D', 'Gold, M']","['Nemunaitis J', 'Rabinowe SN', 'Singer JW', 'Bierman PJ', 'Vose JM', 'Freedman AS', 'Onetto N', 'Gillis S', 'Oette D', 'Gold M', 'et al.']","['Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Double-Blind Method', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Infection Control', 'Leukemia/*surgery/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/surgery', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/*surgery/therapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/surgery', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/therapy', 'Postoperative Complications/therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/surgery', 'Recombinant Proteins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1991/06/20 00:00,1991/06/20 00:01,['1991/06/20 00:00'],"['1991/06/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/20 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199106203242504 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1991 Jun 20;324(25):1773-8. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199106203242504.,,"['CA 18029/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34183/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 47748/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

VH6 is a single-member family in a total repertoire of 100-200 VH genes; thus, if usage were purely random, one would expect VH6 rearrangement frequency to be less than 1%. Analysis of VH gene usage in normal lymphoid tissues also revealed biased usage of VH6. VH6 was preferentially utilized in 16- to 24-week-old fetal liver as compared to adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells or spleen.

The onset of inhibition occurs after 10 min and reaches a maximum at 45 min. To study the mechanism and the site of action of retinoic acid, the activity of the phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate-specific phospholipase C was studied in cells permeabilized with streptolysin O and in membrane preparations. Phospholipase C activity was stimulated either via the guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (G-protein) or directly by Ca2+. Retinoic acid treatment, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner, led to a decrease in phospholipase C activity when stimulated with either GTP gamma S or NaF, both of which activate the enzyme via the G-protein. By contrast, it had no effect on the enzyme activity when stimulated with Ca2+ alone. This indicates that retinoic acid interferes with the coupling of the G-protein and phospholipase C. A relationship between the inhibition of phospholipase C activity and the induction of differentiation by retinoic acid was investigated. Only a small inhibition of GTP gamma S-stimulated phospholipase C activity was observed when an analogue of retinoic acid, etretine or Ro10-1670, with low differentiating activity, was used. Moreover, no inhibition of the GTP gamma S-stimulated phospholipase C activity was observed in an HL-60 sub-line resistant to retinoic acid. These results suggest that phospholipase C inhibition is an important step in the induction of differentiation.","['Geny, B', 'Cost, H', 'Barreau, P', 'Basset, M', 'Le Peuch, C', 'Abita, J P', 'Cockcroft, S']","['Geny B', 'Cost H', 'Barreau P', 'Basset M', 'Le Peuch C', 'Abita JP', 'Cockcroft S']","['INSERM, Unite 204, Centre Hayem, Hopital Saint Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Signal,Cellular signalling,8904683,"['0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Diglycerides)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Streptolysins)', '0 (streptolysin O)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Bacterial Proteins', 'Calcium/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Diglycerides/metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inositol Phosphates/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Streptolysins/pharmacology', 'Tretinoin/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Type C Phospholipases/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0898-6568(91)90003-D [pii]', '10.1016/0898-6568(91)90003-d [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Signal. 1991;3(1):11-23. doi: 10.1016/0898-6568(91)90003-d.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They regulate many fundamental processes in all eukaryotic cells, such as growth, vesicle traffic and cytoskeletal organization. GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) accelerate the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis of Ras-related proteins, leading to down-regulation of the active GTP-bound form. For p21ras, two GAP proteins are known, rasGAP and the neurofibromatosis (NF1) gene product. There is evidence that rasGAP may also be a target protein for regulation by Ras and be involved in downstream signalling. We have purified a GAP protein for p21rho, which is involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Partial sequencing of rhoGAP reveals significant homology with the product of the bcr (breakpoint cluster region) gene, the translocation breakpoint in Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myeloid leukaemias. We show here that the carboxy-terminal domains of the bcr-encoded protein (Bcr) and of a Bcr-related protein, n-chimaerin, are both GAP proteins for the Ras-related GTP-binding protein, p21rac. This result suggest that Bcr could be a target for regulation by Rac and has important new implications for the role of bcr translocations in leukaemia.","['Diekmann, D', 'Brill, S', 'Garrett, M D', 'Totty, N', 'Hsuan, J', 'Monfries, C', 'Hall, C', 'Lim, L', 'Hall, A']","['Diekmann D', 'Brill S', 'Garrett MD', 'Totty N', 'Hsuan J', 'Monfries C', 'Hall C', 'Lim L', 'Hall A']","['Chester Beatty Beatty Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nature,Nature,0410462,"['0 (Chimerin 1)', '0 (GTPase-Activating Proteins)', '0 (Nerve Tissue Proteins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (ras GTPase-Activating Proteins)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (BCR protein, human)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP Phosphohydrolases)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'EC 3.6.5.2 (rac GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Chimerin 1', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', 'Enzyme Activation', 'GTP Phosphohydrolases/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'GTPase-Activating Proteins', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nerve Tissue Proteins/genetics', '*Protein-Tyrosine Kinases', 'Proteins/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcr', 'rac GTP-Binding Proteins', 'ras GTPase-Activating Proteins']",1991/05/30 00:00,1991/05/30 00:01,['1991/05/30 00:00'],"['1991/05/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/30 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/30 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/351400a0 [doi]'],ppublish,Nature. 1991 May 30;351(6325):400-2. doi: 10.1038/351400a0.,,,"['bcr', 'rac1']",,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, large cells possessing a lobulated nucleus characteristic of megakaryocytes, which showed polyploidization to more than 4N up to 16N, were occasionally seen. Nearly 5% of the total number of Y5 cells were positive for acetylcholinesterase reaction. The survival time of C3H/He mice after injection with Y5 cells was longer than that of mice injected with the original MK8057 cells. The colony-forming ability of Y5 cells in the spleen of the lethally irradiated mouse was much lower, whereas the number of in vitro colonies derived from Y5 was greater than that of MK8057. The plating efficiency of colony formation in serum-free methylcellulose culture was higher at a low O2 tension. Conditioned medium of Y5 cells enhanced colony formation as well as 3H-TdR uptake by Y5 cells, which implies that Y5 cells may produce autocrine growth factor(s). mRNAs for IL-6, LIF, and INF-gamma were expressed in Y5 cells; these cytokines may have roles in the growth mechanisms of the cell line.","['Sasaki, H', 'Kajigaya, Y', 'Hirabayashi, Y', 'Funabiki, T', 'Inoue, T', 'Yokota, T', 'Ikuta, K', 'Arai, K', 'Matsuyama, S']","['Sasaki H', 'Kajigaya Y', 'Hirabayashi Y', 'Funabiki T', 'Inoue T', 'Yokota T', 'Ikuta K', 'Arai K', 'Matsuyama S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Yokohama City University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9004-67-5 (Methylcellulose)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Antigens, Surface/metabolism', 'Cell Division', 'Culture Media', 'Cytokines/genetics', 'Gene Expression', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Interferon-gamma/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/genetics/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymphokines/genetics', 'Methylcellulose', 'Mice', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Ploidies', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 May;5(5):408-15.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence that the chemotactic peptide receptor catalytically activates guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins in native plasma membranes.,725-32,"Receptors for the chemotactic peptide fMet-Leu-Phe (fMet, N-formylmethionine) are present in membranes of myeloid differentiated human leukemia (HL-60) cells and stimulate phospholipase C via a pertussis-toxin-sensitive guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory protein(s) [G-protein(s)]. We have developed methods for the assessment of formyl-peptide-receptor-stimulated binding of radiolabeled guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate ([35S]GTP[S]) to native HL-60 membranes. Agonist stimulation of [35S]GTP[S] association with the membrane was minimal (less than or equal to 20%) when GTP[S] was the sole nucleotide present in the incubation medium. In contrast, receptor activation led to a marked (up to sixfold) stimulation of [35S]GTP[S] binding when GDP or GTP were present in high (greater than 100-fold) excess of [35S]GTP[S]. The increase in [35S]GTP[S] binding caused by the chemotactic agonist was strictly dependent on the presence of Mg2+ and was significantly increased by Na+. Agonist-independent binding of [35S]GTP[S] and the increase due to the chemotactic agonist were markedly attenuated by both pertussis and cholera toxin. Comparison of the number of chemotactic-peptide-sensitive [35S]GTP[S]-binding sites to the number of chemotactic peptide receptors present in HL-60 membranes provided direct evidence that a single formyl-peptide receptor is capable of catalyzing the binding of [35S]GTP[S] to, and thus the activation of, multiple (up to 20) G-proteins in native plasma membranes.","['Gierschik, P', 'Moghtader, R', 'Straub, C', 'Dieterich, K', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Gierschik P', 'Moghtader R', 'Straub C', 'Dieterich K', 'Jakobs KH']","['Pharmakologisches Institut, Universitat Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', '20762-30-5 (Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",IM,"['Adenosine Diphosphate Ribose/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/enzymology', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/metabolism"", 'Guanosine Diphosphate/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology', 'Sodium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/08 00:00,1991/05/08 00:01,['1991/05/08 00:00'],"['1991/05/08 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/08 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/08 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15964.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1991 May 8;197(3):725-32. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15964.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In all patients studied, serum albumin and prealbumin concentrations were low at diagnosis. Decreasing serum total protein and transferrin concentrations, stable low serum albumin, and increasing prealbumin levels were observed during the ALL induction therapy. In contrast, these protein levels remained stable in the children with other malignancies. By week 8 the patients with ALL had lower serum total protein, albumin, and transferrin than the children with other types of cancer.

This inhibitory effect was mediated at least in part by the tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and IFN gamma secreted by the clones. Antisera to these cytokines partially prevented inhibition. Involvement of additional factors is also suggested in blocking CML cell proliferation because this was not 100% inhibited even by a combination of TNF alpha and IFN gamma.

High concentrations of Et3PbCl (greater than 10 microM) caused a substantial liberation of [14C]arachidonic acid within 10 to 20 min in dimethyl sulfoxide-differentiated cells, comparable to the effect of the calcium ionophore A23187 (10 microM). Following liberation of arachidonic acid, its metabolites could be detected. Prolongation of the incubation time and reduction of Et3PbCl concentration resulted in a shift of fatty acids from phospholipids to triacylglycerols. Deacylation of phospholipids and reacylation into phospholipids and triacylglycerols were in equilibrium when the cells were treated with Et3PbCl at concentrations of less than or equal to 10 microM for 5 hr or less than or equal to 1 microM for 24 hr; no increase of free fatty acids could be observed, and the loss of fatty acids within the phospholipids was equivalent to the increase of fatty acid content within the triacylglycerols. Moreover, under these conditions, no loss of viability was seen after 24 hr, as compared with untreated differentiated cells. This concentration- and time-dependent effect of Et3PbCl might be due to a stimulated liberation of fatty acids via phospholipase A2, because this stimulation could be totally prevented by the phospholipase inhibitors quinacrine and p-bromophenacylbromide. Additionally, pretreatment of differentiated HL-60 cells with pertussis toxin resulted in a drastic reduction of [14C]arachidonic acid liberation when cells were stimulated with Et3PbCl. These results suggest the involvement of a pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding protein and of a signal transduction mechanism during stimulated fatty acid release; release does not seem to be via a direct stimulation of phospholipase activity by the lead compound.","['Krug, H F', 'Culig, H']","['Krug HF', 'Culig H']","['Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Institut fur Genetik und fur Toxikologie, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Triglycerides)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '2225PI3MOV (Thimerosal)', '27YG812J1I (Arachidonic Acid)', '660G77BZ3J (triethyllead)', 'EC 2.3.1.23 (1-Acylglycerophosphocholine O-Acyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.1.- (Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.1.1.32 (Phospholipases A)', 'EC 3.1.1.4 (Phospholipases A2)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['1-Acylglycerophosphocholine O-Acyltransferase/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Arachidonic Acid', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Fatty Acids/*metabolism', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/pathology', 'Organometallic Compounds/*toxicity', '*Pertussis Toxin', 'Phospholipases/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Phospholipases A/metabolism', 'Phospholipases A2', 'Phospholipids/*metabolism', 'Thimerosal/pharmacology', 'Triglycerides/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/*pharmacology']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1991 Apr;39(4):511-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These patients were classified into three groups: group A (n = 8)--patients with overt CNS leukemia, group B (n = 5)--patients with CNS leukemia in remission, group C (n = 10)--patients without CNS disease. IFN-gamma in the CSF was undetectable in these 23 patients. There was no difference in IL-1-beta levels among the three groups. However, TNF-alpha levels were significantly higher in group A than in group B, and higher in group B than in group C. By Kendall's rank sum test, high TNF levels in CSF correlated with high CSF leukemic cell counts and low sugar levels. In two patients with overt CNS leukemia, the TNF level in the CSF decreased gradually with intrathecal chemotherapy. These results indicate that TNF released from stimulated cells in the cerebrospinal space may induce CNS leukemia-related symptoms or alter laboratory parameters measured in the CSF.

We have developed a simple flow cytometric procedure that allows better selection of stained cells. When an argon ion laser emitting at 488 nm is used, the green fluorescence detected is the sum of cell autofluorescence and of the signal generated by the FITC antibody. Thus, when we subtract green signal from the red by fluorescence compensation, the signal of stained cells is on average reduced more than for the unstained counterpart. In this scenario, positive selection of cells with low red signal allows more efficient selection of stained cells. We tested the overcompensation procedure on mixtures of cells unstained and stained with a relevant FITC antibody. Cell mixtures were analyzed using normal vs increased levels of compensation in the red channel. Increased levels of compensation resulted in easier gating and higher recovery of stained cells. The efficiency of the overcompensation procedure was particularly high when using red filters with low cutoff (i.e., 560 or 570 nm), possibly because of the significant emission of fluorescein in the red channel, which caused separation between stained and unstained cells also in the red dimension. This method is useful for sorting cells expressing low levels of surface markers and facilitates selection of rare cells transfected with surface antigen genes. This technique is compatible with the use of propidium iodide for live/dead cell discrimination and with the subtraction of the cellular background of autofluorescence.","['Alberti, S', 'Bucci, C', 'Fornaro, M', 'Robotti, A', 'Stella, M']","['Alberti S', 'Bucci C', 'Fornaro M', 'Robotti A', 'Stella M']","['Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Milano, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Histochem Cytochem,The journal of histochemistry and cytochemistry : official journal of the Histochemistry Society,9815334,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Separation', 'Flow Cytometry/instrumentation/*methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluoresceins', '*Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/pathology', 'Mice', 'Thiocyanates', 'Transfection']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/39.5.1901878 [doi]'],ppublish,J Histochem Cytochem. 1991 May;39(5):701-6. doi: 10.1177/39.5.1901878.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many tumours are allele-specific class I negative and, in murine systems, reconstitution of class I expression by gene transfection leads to an increase in tumour immunogenicity. In many systems where mice have rejected class I transfected tumour cells they are also immune to a subsequent challenge with the untransfected parent tumour. In this study we have examined the effect of stable class II antigen expression (induced by gene transfection) on a class I loss mutant (H-2Kk negative) murine cell line, K36.16. We show that H-2Ek expression is more effective at increasing tumour immunogenicity than the reconstitution of H-2Kk expression in these cells.

When human leukemia K562 cells were incubated in the presence of 80 microM hemin, benzidine-positive cells appeared at day 2 and 90% of the cells became positive at day 6. However, RNA blot analysis reveals that mRNA for gamma-globin was already abundant in untreated K562 cells and the level of the message was slightly increased by hemin-treatment. Spectroscopic analysis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the induced cell extracts indicate that hemoglobin molecules were not detected in untreated cells, and increased successively up to day 6. The hemin-induced cells were thoroughly washed, and then recultured in the absence of hemin. The benzidine-positive cells mostly disappeared 3 days after the elimination of the inducer. During the hemin-induced erythroid differentiation, the activity and mRNA for poly(ADP-ribose) synthetase decreased to 50% and 20% of the initial level at day 3 and a low level of the gene expression was maintained afterwards, whereas the activity and mRNA returned to the initial value 1 day after hemin elimination. The results indicate that the hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of K562 cells is a reversible process and depression of the synthetase may be involved in the progress of differentiation.","['Tomoda, T', 'Kurashige, T', 'Yamamoto, H', 'Fujimoto, S', 'Taniguchi, T']","['Tomoda T', 'Kurashige T', 'Yamamoto H', 'Fujimoto S', 'Taniguchi T']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kochi Medical School, Kochi, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', 'EC 2.4.2.30 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases)']",IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Erythrocytes/*cytology', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', 'Hemin/*pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerases/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/03/26 00:00,1991/03/26 00:01,['1991/03/26 00:00'],"['1991/03/26 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/26 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/26 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4781(91)90125-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4781(91)90125-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1991 Mar 26;1088(3):359-64. doi: 10.1016/0167-4781(91)90125-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Information transfer by intermediately thiophosphorylated beta gamma subunits.,707-16,"Signal-transducing guanine-nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) are heterotrimers, composed of the nucleotide-binding alpha subunit and a beta gamma dimer. The influence of beta gamma dimer preparations of the retinal G protein transducin (TD) was studied on formylpeptide-receptor--G-protein interactions in membranes of differentiated HL 60 cells. For this, TD was prepared from bovine rod outer segment (ROS) membranes with either GTP or its analogs, guanosine 5'-[gamma-thio]triphosphate (GTP[S]) and guanosine 5'-[beta gamma-imino]triphosphate (Gpp[NH]p). After removal of free nucleotides, TD beta gamma was separated from TD alpha and its function analyzed. Addition of TD beta gamma isolated from TD prepared with GTP[S] (TD beta gamma GTP[S]) to HL 60 membranes abolished high-affinity binding of fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe (fMet, N-formylmethionine) to its receptor. In contrast, TD beta gamma isolated from TD prepared with GTP (TD beta gamma GTP), boiled TD beta gamma GTP[S] and TD alpha prepared with GTP[S] had no or only slight effects. The inhibitory effect of TD beta gamma GTP[S] on fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe receptor binding was potentiated by GDP at low concentrations but not by GTP[S]. Furthermore, TD beta gamma GTP[S], but not TD beta gamma GTP or TD beta gamma isolated from TD prepared with Gpp[NH]p (TD beta gamma Gpp[NH]p), prevented fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated binding of [35S]GTP[S] to G proteins in HL 60 membranes, measured in the presence of GDP. When TD beta gamma GTP was incubated with GTP [S] and TD-depleted illuminated ROS membranes, and subsequently separated from the membranes and free GTP[S], this TD beta gamma GTP, similar to TD beta gamma GTP[S], abolished high-affinity binding of fMet-Leu-[3H]Phe to its receptor, fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated binding of [35S]GTP[S], and fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated GTP hydrolysis in HL 60 membranes. Inhibition of [35S]GTP[S] binding by TD beta gamma was not seen in the presence of the metabolically stable GDP analog, guanosine 5'-[beta-thio]diphosphate. In order to obtain an insight into the modification of TD beta gamma apparently caused by GTP[S], and into its mechanism of action in HL 60 membranes, TD, TD alpha and TD beta gamma, all prepared in the presence of GTP, were incubated with [35S]GTP[S] and TD-depleted illuminated ROS membranes. Fluorographic analysis of the supernatant proteins revealed 35S labelling of the beta band of the G protein. When apparently thiophosphorylated TD beta gamma was incubated with [3H]GDP in the presence of HL 60 membranes, [3H]GTP[S] was rapidly formed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Wieland, T', 'Ulibarri, I', 'Gierschik, P', 'Jakobs, K H']","['Wieland T', 'Ulibarri I', 'Gierschik P', 'Jakobs KH']","['Pharmakologisches Institut der Universitat Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,"['146-91-8 (Guanosine Diphosphate)', ""37589-80-3 (Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate))"", '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (GTP-Binding Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'GTP-Binding Proteins/*metabolism', ""Guanosine 5'-O-(3-Thiotriphosphate)/*pharmacology"", 'Guanosine Diphosphate/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', '*Signal Transduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/03/28 00:00,1991/03/28 00:01,['1991/03/28 00:00'],"['1991/03/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/28 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/28 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15869.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1991 Mar 28;196(3):707-16. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1991.tb15869.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We proposed then that the released cytokines may play a role in mediating tumor cell regression in vivo. In this paper, we provide further information on the nature of the signals, provided by the tumor cells (K562 erythroleukemia), that stimulate LAK cells to secrete IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. Using a previously published protocol for coating tumor-membrane molecules onto cell-sized hydrophobic beads (also called pseudocytes), we demonstrate that the signal provided by the tumor cell is membrane associated. Beads coated with K562 membranes stimulated LAK cells to release IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha. The pretreatment of these beads with trypsin and sodium periodate eliminated the ability of these pseudocytes to stimulate cytokine release in LAK cells. The glycoproteins that stimulate LAK cells to secrete IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were further enriched by their ability to bind concanavalin A (Con A, Jack Bean). To determine if the tumor-associated molecules that stimulate LAK cells to release IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha are also the molecules involved in mediating tumor cell lysis, we tested the ability of the Con A binding and nonbinding proteins to inhibit the LAK cell-mediated lysis of K562 cells. Our results demonstrate that molecules that inhibited LAK cell-mediated cytotoxicity were not enriched by Con A. These results are therefore consistent with the conclusion that different sets of tumor-associated molecules are involved in the stimulation of LAK cells to secrete cytokine and in the induction of LAK cells to mediate tumor cell cytolysis.","['Chong, A S', 'Pinkard, J K', 'Lam, K S', 'Scuderi, P', 'Hersh, E M', 'Grimes, W J']","['Chong AS', 'Pinkard JK', 'Lam KS', 'Scuderi P', 'Hersh EM', 'Grimes WJ']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Receptors, Concanavalin A)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma/*metabolism', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/*immunology', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*immunology', 'Receptors, Concanavalin A/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*metabolism']",1991/04/15 00:00,1991/04/15 00:01,['1991/04/15 00:00'],"['1991/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(91)90334-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(91)90334-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1991 Apr 15;134(1):96-110. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(91)90334-8.,,"['CA 17094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23074/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 34121/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evaluation of the molecular basis for this cross-reactivity indicates that such CRIs are encoded by conserved antibody variable region genes (V genes) that have undergone little or no somatic hypermutation. We find that such anti-CRI MoAbs stain a subpopulation of cells within the mantle zones surrounding the germinal centers of normal human tonsil. In contrast, MoAbs specific for variable region subgroup determinants react with cells in both the mantle zones and germinal centers of secondary B-cell follicles. To test whether mantle zone B cells not reactive with existing anti-CRI MoAbs may express slg bearing as-yet-unrecognized CRIs present on Igs produced by neoplastic cells of some patients with Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia or CLL, we immunized mice with purified Waldenstrom's IgM that have been characterized for their variable region subgroups using subgroup-specific antisera raised against synthetic peptides. The supernatants of hybridomas generated from the splenocytes of immunized mice were screened for their ability to stain a subpopulation of mantle zone lymphocytes in human tonsil. With this approach, two new anti-CRI MoAbs were identified, designated OAK1 and VOH3. OAK1 binds to a CRI present on a subset of kappa light chains of the VK1 subgroup. VOH3 recognizes a CRI determinant(s) present on a subset of antibody heavy chains of the VH3 subgroup. Flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that OAK1 specifically binds leukemia cells from 5 to 20 patients (25%) with kappa light chain expressing CLL. In addition, VOH3 reacted with the leukemia cells from 1 of 17 (6%) patients tested. The success of these methods demonstrates that the variable regions of the Igs produced by mantle zone B cells share idiotypic determinants with Igs expressed in B-cell CLL (B-CLL) and Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia.","['Axelrod, O', 'Silverman, G J', 'Dev, V', 'Kyle, R', 'Carson, D A', 'Kipps, T J']","['Axelrod O', 'Silverman GJ', 'Dev V', 'Kyle R', 'Carson DA', 'Kipps TJ']","['Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0945.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/classification/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/immunology', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Palatine Tonsil/immunology', 'Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia/*immunology']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83287-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Apr 1;77(7):1484-90.,,"['AG04100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR07144/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The entire genomic sequence has been determined and the gene consists of five exons and four introns. The human IL-9 gene is mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 5 at band 5q31-32, a region found to be deleted in a number of patients with acquired 5q- abnormalities and hematologic disorders. Several blocks of transcriptional control sequences have been identified at the 5'-flanking region of the human IL-9 gene that may play an important role in the control of IL-9 gene expression. The 5'-regulatory region of the human IL-9 gene also contains sequences identified in the 5'-flanking regions of other cytokine genes mapped to the long arm of human chromosome 5, including IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and other T-cell growth factor genes including IL-2 and IL-6.

Transient transfection analysis using the plasmid containing the 5'-flanking region of IL-9 gene upstream from the firefly luciferase ciferase report gene indicated that the 0.9-kb Smal-Sacl fragment of the IL-9 gene contains sequences required for the constitutive and activated expression of IL-9 gene in HTLV-I-transformed cells.

However, the mechanism of its immunomodulatory effect has not been fully clarified. In the present study the in vitro effect of PSK on the lymphocytes of patients with gastric cancer was studied. Culturing lymphocytes with PSK at 5-100 micrograms/ml increased the level of DNA synthesis, and augmented the cytotoxicities against K562 and KATO-3. Flow-cytometric analysis also showed an increase in the proportion of interleukin-2 (IL-2)-receptor-positive cells after the lymphocytes were cultured with PSK. However the cytotoxicity of cells cultured with PSK was not augmented by the addition of recombinant interferon gamma (rIFN gamma) and rIL-2. Further experiments using fractionated PSK showed that its biological action is present mainly in fractions having molecular masses greater than 10(5) Da. However, these immunomodulations were not seen in all patients. These results suggest that the susceptibility of lymphocytes to PSK may be different in each patients, and that the immunomodulation by PSK may be mediated by mechanisms independent of IFN and IL-2.","['Nio, Y', 'Shiraishi, T', 'Tsubono, M', 'Morimoto, H', 'Tseng, C C', 'Imai, S', 'Tobe, T']","['Nio Y', 'Shiraishi T', 'Tsubono M', 'Morimoto H', 'Tseng CC', 'Imai S', 'Tobe T']","['First Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proteoglycans)', '3X48A86C8K (polysaccharide-K)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/*pharmacology', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon-gamma', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Proteoglycans/*pharmacology', 'Stomach Neoplasms/*therapy']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01741328 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1991;32(6):335-41. doi: 10.1007/BF01741328.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mechanism by which binding of GM-CSF to its receptor stimulates gene expression remains unknown. To examine this process in more detail, we have transfected human monocytic leukemia cells U937 with a plasmid containing an AP-1 enhancer element and a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase recorder gene and treated them with GM-CSF. We find that GM-CSF stimulates a 2-3-fold increase in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity over a concentration range 1-1,000 units/ml. Northern and Western blot analysis demonstrates that the mechanism by which GM-CSF stimulates AP-1 enhancer activity involves increases in c-jun and c-fos mRNA levels, and increases in Jun protein. In a similar fashion the treatment of normal human monocytes with GM-CSF also induced increases in total cellular c-jun. Because protein kinase C plays a crucial role in activating c-jun transcription we examined the role of this enzyme in mediating the effects of GM-CSF. Treatment of U937 cells with inhibitors of protein kinase C including staurosporine 10 nM and H-7 50 microM, or down-regulation of protein kinase C by phorbol ester pretreatment blocks the induction of c-jun by GM-CSF. However, HA which does not block protein kinase C had no effect on GM-CSF stimulation of c-jun RNA levels. In addition, GM-CSF treatment causes the rapid translocation of protein kinase C to the particulate fraction which was maximal by 5 min and returned to base line by 80 min. These data suggest that the binding of GM-CSF to its receptor stimulates increases in c-jun mRNA and protein and activates AP-1 enhancer activity. These effects may be at least in part mediated by activation of protein kinase C.","['Adunyah, S E', 'Unlap, T M', 'Wagner, F', 'Kraft, A S']","['Adunyah SE', 'Unlap TM', 'Wagner F', 'Kraft AS']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, University of Alabama, Birmingham 35294.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Plasmids', 'Protein Kinase C/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-jun', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription Factors/*genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/03/25 00:00,1991/03/25 00:01,['1991/03/25 00:00'],"['1991/03/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)67647-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Mar 25;266(9):5670-5.,,['R01CA42533-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['c-jun'],,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report we have examined the regulation of amino acid transport systems, in particular, systems A and ASC, during differentiation of erythroleukemic cells. For additional comparison we examined the uptake of leucine, 3-aminoendobicyclo-(3,2,1)-octane-3-carboxylic acid (BCO), arginine, and glutamate. Hexamethylene-bis-acetamide (HMBA), dimethyl sulfoxide, and butyrate induce cell differentiation with a block in G1-G0 phase of the cell cycle. These agents caused a significant downregulation of 2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid uptake by system A. In contrast, the Na(+)-dependent threonine uptake by system ASC remained unaltered. The uptake of leucine, BCO, arginine, and glutamate by as yet unidentified systems was, however, stimulated after HMBA treatment. Hemin, a potent inducer of hemoglobin synthesis in K-562 cells, does not block cell cycle events and, interestingly, had no significant effect on both systems A and ASC. These differences in inducer actions suggest that system A activity may be related to specific stages of cell differentiation and perhaps to other cellular signals.","['Vadgama, J V', 'Chan, M N', 'Wu, J M']","['Vadgama JV', 'Chan MN', 'Wu JM']","['Department of Pediatrics, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Aminoisobutyric Acids)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', '2566-34-9 (2-(methylamino)isobutyric acid)', '2ZD004190S (Threonine)', 'GMW67QNF9C (Leucine)']",IM,"['Amino Acids/pharmacology', 'Aminoisobutyric Acids/*metabolism', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leucine/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Threonine/*metabolism', 'Tritium']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1991.260.3.C392 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1991 Mar;260(3 Pt 1):C392-9. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1991.260.3.C392.,,['DK-39147/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients' notes to identify items of management costing money; prospective costing of these items. The Medical Research Council acute myeloblastic leukaemia 9 trial was used to identify the amount and distribution of these costs when either one or two courses of induction treatment were required to obtain complete remission. These findings were then extrapolated to four published international controlled trials using similarly intense treatment and in which the number of courses of treatment required for complete remission was stated, to compare British costs for treatment with idarubicin and daunorubicin, both in combination with cytarabine. SETTING: Leukaemia unit, Royal Marsden Hospital, London. SUBJECTS: Data on 10 patients receiving intensive induction treatment for acute myeloblastic leukaemia were used to identify 160 items of cost in four broad groups: general (including accommodation), diagnostic, supportive treatment, and cytotoxic chemotherapy. One newly treated patient was prospectively assessed over one month, including a time and motion study, to cost these items; then costs for 268 patients from the MRC trial receiving moderate induction chemotherapy including daunorubicin were assessed, and costs for treatment of 522 patients in the four international studies comparing daunorubicin with idarubicin were analysed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost effectiveness was measured as the overall cost to obtain complete remission in untreated patients with acute myeloblastic leukaemia after treatment with idarubicin or daunorubicin. RESULTS: The 160 costed items were measured for their sensitivity in varying the total cost of treatment, this being assessed within Britain in other district general and private hospitals to measure the extremes of cost of these items. Overall, idarubicin, although more expensive, showed a substantial saving (1477 pounds per patient) in total hospital costs, more than offsetting the increased cost (607 pounds) of the new treatment, an overall savings of 870 pounds per patient (5%). CONCLUSION: Approaches modelling cost effectiveness may be an essential part of planning new programmes of treatment in the future. This method can be used to estimate the cost effectiveness of the treatments in different environments and countries where costs may vary widely.","['Lobo, P J', 'Powles, R L', 'Hanrahan, A', 'Reynold, D K']","['Lobo PJ', 'Powles RL', 'Hanrahan A', 'Reynold DK']","['Medical Department, Farmitalia Carlo Erba (UK), Limited, St Albans, Hertfordshire.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,BMJ,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),8900488,"['ZRP63D75JW (Idarubicin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Cost-Benefit Analysis', 'Costs and Cost Analysis', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Idarubicin/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/diagnosis/economics/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', '*Models, Theoretical', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Retrospective Studies']",1991/02/09 00:00,1991/02/09 00:01,['1991/02/09 00:00'],"['1991/02/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/09 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/bmj.302.6772.323 [doi]'],ppublish,BMJ. 1991 Feb 9;302(6772):323-6. doi: 10.1136/bmj.302.6772.323.,,,,,,,PMC1669019,,,,,,,,

Caeruloplasmin maintains levels of functional enzyme activity during differentiation of K562 cells.",153-8,"K562 cells, a human erythroleukaemic cell line blocked for differentiation, commit towards erythrocytes when exposed to haemin (20 microM). The cells synthesize fetal haemoglobins and show site-specific binding of caeruloplasmin, a plasma copper protein. These events are set into motion by haemin. On the assumption that the binding of caeruloplasmin could reflect a greater need for copper, we sought to determine whether the transfer of 67Cu from caeruloplasmin was accelerated in haemin-induced compared with non-induced K562 cells. Cu,Zn superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) was the recipient. Haemin induction caused the K562 cells to lose CuZnSOD activity. By 96 h, the level of SOD activity was less than 60% of that of non-induced cells. The loss was confined entirely to the CuZn form, MnSOD activity staying essentially unchanged. Although CuZnSOD activity declined with the haemin induction, the incorporation of [4,5-3H]lysine into immunoprecipitable CuZnSOD protein was unaffected. There was also no change in CuZnSOD mRNA concentration in haemin-induced cells. Thus a loss of enzyme did not correlate with a decline in the synthesis de novo of CuZnSOD protein. When 48 h-induced cells were transferred to a medium supplemented with 0.2 microM-caeruloplasmin, CuZnSOD activity was restored to control levels in 24 h. Caeruloplasmin also stimulated the incorporation of [3H]lysine into immunoprecipitable CuZnSOD protein. Caeruloplasmin addition may have affected a post-translational regulatory site for CuZnSOD biosynthesis, possibly by providing copper for the newly synthesized enzyme.","['Percival, S S', 'Harris, E D']","['Percival SS', 'Harris ED']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Texas A&M University, College Station 77843.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 1.15.1.1 (Superoxide Dismutase)', 'EC 1.16.3.1 (Ceruloplasmin)', 'K3Z4F929H6 (Lysine)']",IM,"['Biological Transport', '*Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Ceruloplasmin/*pharmacology', 'Copper/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Heme/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Lysine/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Superoxide Dismutase/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",1991/02/15 00:00,1991/02/15 00:01,['1991/02/15 00:00'],"['1991/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2740153 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1991 Feb 15;274 ( Pt 1):153-8. doi: 10.1042/bj2740153.,,"['DK08170/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK35920/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC1150191,,,,,,,,

Autoradiography demonstrated that in each hemopoietic tissue examined cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage were the primary cell type labeled with 125I-LIF. Moreover, both fetal and adult parenchymal hepatocytes displayed higher levels of labeling than either monocytes or macrophages. The number of receptors per positive cell varied from 150 for bone marrow monocytes to 2,000 for adult hepatocytes.

In an effort to overcome this problem, a technique is described for the simultaneous measurement of a specific cellular protein, total cellular protein, and DNA content. The method utilizes dual-laser (uv and 488 nm) excitation and three fluorescent dyes: FITC, SR101, and DAPI. FITC-labelled antibody coupled with indirect immunofluorescence was used to quantify the c-myc oncoprotein, whereas SR101 and DAPI were used to measure total cellular protein and cellular DNA, respectively. Flow cytometric measurements of c-myc oncoprotein were compared to densitometric readings of p64c-myc. SR101 protein determinations were compared to those obtained by the Lowry technique. Results indicated that flow cytometric measurements correlated well with those obtained by the biochemical methods. The usefulness of the technique was further examined following treatment of exponentially growing HL-60 cells with 2.5 micrograms/ml cycloheximide for 0 to 12 h. Cycloheximide treatment was found to cause a significant decrease in c-myc oncoprotein content within 2 h (P less than 0.05), a relative increase in the proportion of G0/G1 cells and a modest decrease in total cellular protein. This technique appears to provide a rapid, quantitative approach, useful for investigating alterations in cellular growth balance occurring with cell differentiation, neoplastic transformation, or cell treatment with radiation or cytostatic drugs.","['Engelhard, H H 3rd', 'Krupka, J L', 'Bauer, K D']","['Engelhard HH 3rd', 'Krupka JL', 'Bauer KD']","['Department of Pathology, Northwestern University Medical School, Chicago, Illinois 60611.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Indoles)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '0 (Thiocyanates)', '47165-04-8 (DAPI)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)', 'FX0ES3271V (sulforhodamine 101)', 'I223NX31W9 (Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'DNA/*analysis/metabolism', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Fluorescein-5-isothiocyanate', 'Fluoresceins', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'HeLa Cells', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Indoles', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Proteins/*analysis/metabolism', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*analysis/metabolism', 'Rhodamines', 'Thiocyanates', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/chemistry/metabolism/pathology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/cyto.990120110 [doi]'],ppublish,Cytometry. 1991;12(1):68-76. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990120110.,,['R01 CA 44947/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a possible mechanism for this observed enhancement, we have investigated the role of dThd as an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (ADPRP), an enzyme which is activated in response to DNA damage. Exposure of L1210 cells in culture to 50 microM BCNU resulted in a greater than 10-fold increase in ADPRP activity within 3-4 h. The polymerase activity increased with increasing BCNU concentration after a 4-h exposure, reaching apparent saturation at 50 microM BCNU. However, this activation was abolished by 2 mM dThd. Median inhibition of the ADPRP activity elicited by 30 and 75 microM BCNU occurred at 38 and 135 microM dThd, respectively. When BCNU was replaced by 3'-CTNU, no activation of ADPRP was observed, even at or above concentration of 3'-CTNU previously shown to cause DNA damage. 3'-Amino-3'-deoxythymidine, the principal hydrolysis product of 3'-CTNU, was found to be an inhibitor of BCNU-stimulated ADPRP activity with potency similar to dThd. Furthermore, intact 3'-CTNU was found to inhibit BCNU-stimulated ADPRP activity. Although 3'-CTNU should be capable of activating ADPRP by causing DNA damage, our results suggest that no net activation is observed due to inhibition by the various thymidine species present. Thus, inhibition of ADPRP by dThd following DNA damage by BCNU is consistent with the potentiation of antitumor activity previously reported. However, the observed potentiation of 3'-CTNU activity by dThd does not appear to result from such a mechanism.","['August, E M', 'Cooper, D L', 'Prusoff, W H']","['August EM', 'Cooper DL', 'Prusoff WH']","['Department of Pharmacology, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Dideoxynucleosides)', '0 (Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors)', ""65174-26-7 (3'-(3-(2-chloroethyl)-3-nitrosourea)-3'-deoxythymidine)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carmustine/*pharmacology', 'DNA/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'Dideoxynucleosides/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Mice', '*Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase Inhibitors', 'Thymidine/*pharmacology']",1991/03/15 00:00,1991/03/15 00:01,['1991/03/15 00:00'],"['1991/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Mar 15;51(6):1586-90.,,"['CA-05262/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Analysis of five kappa-expressing subclones (all having the same heavy chain rearrangement) demonstrated independent kappa light chain rearrangement events by DNA hybridization analysis. Northern blot analysis using probes recognizing the four different V kappa families revealed that two subclones used the most proximal V kappa (V kappa IV), one subclone used a V kappa I, and one subclone used a V kappa II. By polymerase chain reaction analyses, we detected transcripts from rearranged V-J-C kappa genes as well as transcripts from germline J-C kappa and V kappa in BLIN-1 cells induced to rearrange the kappa locus. kappa germline transcripts were also detected in normal developing B cell populations in fetal liver and bone marrow. Our collective results indicate that: (a) BLIN-1 can be induced to rearrange the kappa locus, and this correlates with the expression of germline kappa locus transcripts that may play a role in activating or targeting gene rearrangement; and (b) active rearrangement and usage of V genes representing different kappa families suggest that, like in the mouse, repertoire diversification in humans occurs in the presence of a fixed heavy chain rearrangement.","['Martin, D', 'Huang, R Q', 'LeBien, T', 'Van Ness, B']","['Martin D', 'Huang RQ', 'LeBien T', 'Van Ness B']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Constant Regions)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Joining Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Constant Regions/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Joining Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/*genetics', 'Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains/*genetics', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Recombination, Genetic', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.173.3.639 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1991 Mar 1;173(3):639-45. doi: 10.1084/jem.173.3.639.,,"['CA-31685/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01 CA-21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 GM-37687/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC2118832,,,,,,,,

Measurements of fluid phase endocytosis and morphometric analysis of the endosome compartment indicated that the endocytic capacities of HeLa and lymphoid cells are equivalent and suggested that the low level of CD4 uptake in lymphocytic cells is due to exclusion of CD4 from coated pits. This conclusion was supported by experiments using truncated CD4 molecules, lacking the bulk of the cytoplasmic domain, which were internalized equally efficiently in both transfected lymphocytes and HeLa cells. Together, these results indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of CD4 mediates the different interactions with the endocytic apparatus in lymphoid and nonlymphoid cells. We suggest that the CD4-associated lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase p56lck may be involved in preventing CD4 endocytosis in T cells.","['Pelchen-Matthews, A', 'Armes, J E', 'Griffiths, G', 'Marsh, M']","['Pelchen-Matthews A', 'Armes JE', 'Griffiths G', 'Marsh M']","['Chester Beatty Laboratories, Institute of Cancer Research, London, England.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,['0 (CD4 Antigens)'],IM,"['*CD4 Antigens/genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Membrane/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Coated Pits, Cell-Membrane/physiology/ultrastructure', '*Endocytosis', 'HeLa Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Organelles/physiology/ultrastructure', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Transfection']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.173.3.575 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1991 Mar 1;173(3):575-87. doi: 10.1084/jem.173.3.575.,,,,,,,PMC2118819,,,,,,,,

The release of radioactive material, over a 10-day period, resulted in millions of Soviets, and other Europeans, being exposed to measurable levels of radioactive fallout. Because of the effects of wind and rain, the radioactive nuclide fallout distribution patterns are not well defined, though they appear to be focused in three contiguous Soviet Republics: the Ukrainian SSR, the Byelorussian SSR, and the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic. Further, because of the many radioactive nuclides (krypton, xenon, cesium, iodine, strontium, plutonium) released by the prolonged fires at Chernobyl, the long-term medical, psychological, social, and economic effects will require careful and prolonged study. Specifically, studies on the medical (leukemia, cancers, thyroid disease) and psychological (reactive depressions, post-traumatic stress disorders, family disorganization) consequences of continued low dose radiation exposure in the affected villages and towns need to be conducted so that a coherent, comprehensive, community-oriented plan may evolve that will not cause those already affected any additional harm and confusion.","['Ginzburg, H M', 'Reis, E']","['Ginzburg HM', 'Reis E']","['Office of Emergency Preparedness, Health Resources and Services Administration, Public Health Service, Rockville, MD 20857.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Public Health Rep,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",9716844,"['0 (Radioactive Fallout)', '0 (Radioactive Pollutants)']",IM,"['Accidents/*mortality/psychology', 'Animals', 'Food Contamination, Radioactive', 'Health Services Needs and Demand', 'Humans', 'Morbidity', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Reactors', 'Radioactive Fallout/adverse effects', 'Radioactive Pollutants/analysis', 'USSR', 'Ukraine/epidemiology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Public Health Rep. 1991 Jan-Feb;106(1):32-40.,,,,,,,PMC1580196,,,,,,['Public Health Rep 1991 May-Jun;106(3):352'],,

To determine whether c-myc is differently expressed at the various stages of the differentiation pathway, we used B-type chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells, representing resting B lymphocytes, inducible to proliferation and/or differentiation in vitro. The c-myc protein, and Ig lambda-light chain and PCA-1 antigen as markers of B-cell maturation, were analyzed in single, morphologically defined cells by immunocytochemical double-staining. The proliferation of individual cells was determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation and by analysis of Ki-67 antigen expression. The results show that the level of c-myc expression correlates to the stage of differentiation and to the proliferative activity. Uninduced resting cells did not express c-myc. The c-myc protein was observed in the highest amount at the proliferative B-lymphoblast stage of maturation and was reduced in plasmablasts and undetectable in plasma cells. The results suggest that maturation of B cells into nonproliferative, terminally differentiated plasma cells is associated with a downregulated c-myc expression and thus support the view that the deregulated c-myc gene in BL and MPC is expressed at an inappropriate stage of maturation and thereby inhibits terminal differentiation.","['Larsson, L G', 'Schena, M', 'Carlsson, M', 'Sallstrom, J', 'Nilsson, K']","['Larsson LG', 'Schena M', 'Carlsson M', 'Sallstrom J', 'Nilsson K']","['Department of Pathology, University of Uppsala, University Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains)', '0 (Ki-67 Antigen)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin lambda-Chains/metabolism', 'Ki-67 Antigen', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*genetics/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84196-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Mar 1;77(5):1025-32.,,,['c-myc'],,,,,,,,,,,,

The rap-1A protein has also been shown to block the interaction of ras with its GTPase activating protein in vitro, leading to speculation regarding its role in vivo. A closely related protein, rap-1B, has also been identified in platelets, human erythroleukemia cells, neutrophils, and aortic smooth muscle cells. Unlike rap-1A, rap-1B has been shown to be phosphorylated in platelets.

In this assay system, equimolar concentrations of rap-1B were found to block germinal vesicle breakdown triggered by the oncogenic ras protein.

Opposing effects of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on IFN-gamma-induced HLA-DR and Ia expression depends on the maturation and differentiation stage of the cell.,899-905,"MHC class II induction by cytokines has been suggested to play a major role in the initiation and propagation of immune and autoimmune processes. TNF-alpha has been found both to enhance and also to inhibit IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression. In the present studies, the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma induced MHC class II expression was tested in various cell lines. On the basis of the data, we propose that, depending on the stage of differentiation and maturation of the cells, TNF-alpha might synergize or antagonize the affects of IFN-gamma on the regulation of MHC class II expression. Thus, in immature cells such as HL-60 or THP-1, TNF-alpha enhances IFN-gamma-induced class II expression. However, when differentiation was induced in these cells by TPA or IFN-gamma, the additive effect of TNF-alpha on the IFN-gamma induced DR expression was eliminated. Furthermore, TNF-alpha down-regulates the IFN-gamma-induced class II expression in differentiated cells such as human skin fibroblasts or activated macrophages. In bone marrow cells induced to differentiate in vitro, TNF-alpha decreased the IFN-gamma-induced MHC class II expression in a maturation-dependent fashion. These results provide a rational explanation for the conflicting reports regarding the effect of TNF-alpha on IFN-gamma-induced class II expression. But more importantly they may be relevant to the biologic function of TNF-alpha. Thus, we show that TNF-alpha-treated mice have reduced level of Ia expression on peritoneal macrophages and in vivo treatment with TNF-alpha antagonizes the ability of IFN-gamma to induce class II expression on these macrophages.","['Watanabe, Y', 'Jacob, C O']","['Watanabe Y', 'Jacob CO']","['Syntex Research, Palo Alto, CA 94303.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '81627-83-0 (Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Down-Regulation', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*analysis', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*analysis', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology', 'Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*pharmacology']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Feb 1;146(3):899-905.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This report describes the development of a P388 cell line (P388/DPPEc) that is resistant to DPPE and its analogues and the in vitro characterization of the cross-resistance of this subline to various antitumor and cytotoxic agents. The P388/DPPE tumor cell line was developed by serial transplantation in DPPE-treated mice. Resistance to DPPE was phenotypically stable. The P388/DPPE subline was cross-resistant to DPPE analogues and metal coordination complexes of DPPE. In addition, P388/DPPE cells were resistant to several mitochondrial uncouplers, including rhodamine-123, tetraphenylphosphonium, and carbonylcyanide-p-trifluro-methoxyphenyl hydrazone. P388/DPPE cells were less capable of sequestering and retaining 123Rh than were sensitive (P388/S) cells. Exposure to Au(DPPE)2+, a gold complex of DPPE with increased antitumor activity, resulted in a depletion of cellular ATP; the depletion was more rapid in the sensitive than the resistant cells. The rate of mitochondrial respiration, as measured by 14CO2 evolution from [6-14C]glucose, was greater in P388/S than in P388/DPPE. As with that evidenced for 123Rh, the cellular uptake of radiolabeled DPPE was decreased in P388/DPPEc cells. The results suggest that the basis for the resistance of this cell line may be an alteration in mitochondrial membrane potential. These data and the striking cross-resistance of P388/DPPE to mitochondrial uncouplers support the hypothesis that mitochondria may be one target involved in the cytotoxic or antitumor activities of these compounds. Mitochondria may also be causally related to the cytotoxic or antitumor activities, in that DPPE may be concentrated in cells via the presence of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential. Thus, P388/DPPE cells can serve as a tool to screen for and evaluate drugs that rely on affecting mitochondrial function, either mechanistically or causally, for their antitumor efficacy.","['Hoke, G D', 'McCabe, F L', 'Faucette, L F', 'Bartus, J O', 'Sung, C M', 'Jensen, B D', 'Heys, J R', 'Rush, G F', 'Alberts, D W', 'Johnson, R K']","['Hoke GD', 'McCabe FL', 'Faucette LF', 'Bartus JO', 'Sung CM', 'Jensen BD', 'Heys JR', 'Rush GF', 'Alberts DW', 'Johnson RK', 'et al.']","['SmithKline and French Research and Development Laboratories, King of Prussia, Pennsylvania 19406.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Organogold Compounds)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', '0 (Organophosphorus Compounds)', '0 (Rhodamines)', '142M471B3J (Carbon Dioxide)', '1663-45-2 (bis(diphenylphosphine)ethane)', '1N3CZ14C5O (Rhodamine 123)', '47895-18-1 (bis(1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane)gold(I))', '7440-57-5 (Gold)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)']",IM,"['Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Carbon Dioxide/metabolism', 'Cell Line/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance/*genetics', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gold/pharmacology', 'Leukemia P388/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/*drug effects/physiology', 'Organogold Compounds', 'Organometallic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Organophosphorus Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Rhodamine 123', 'Rhodamines/metabolism']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1991 Jan;39(1):90-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We report here that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) acts synergistically with low levels of IL-2 to promote LAK differentiation in peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in homogeneous T acute lymphocytic leukemic cells exhibiting LAK precursor reactivity. No augmentation of LAK response was observed with IFN-alpha-2, IFN-beta-1, and IFN-beta-2/IL-6. The synergism between IL-2 and IFN-gamma was expressed in the ability of activated lymphocytes to lyse natural killer resistant cell line targets and surgically removed melanoma cells. The augmented LAK response due to IFN-gamma does not reflect up-regulation of the high-affinity IL-2 receptors consisting both of alpha and beta subunits, since expression of the alpha (Tac) subunit on the responding leukemic cells was not increased by IFN-gamma. The observed IFN-gamma/IL-2 synergism in the induction of monoclonal LAK precursors suggests that a single precursor cell responds to both IFN-gamma and IL-2 and that different mechanisms underlie the basal IL-2-mediated LAK response and its enhancement by IFN-gamma.","['Kaufmann, Y', 'Davidsohn, J', 'Levanon, M', 'Icekson, I', 'Revel, M', 'Ramot, B']","['Kaufmann Y', 'Davidsohn J', 'Levanon M', 'Icekson I', 'Revel M', 'Ramot B']","['Institute of Hematology, Chaim Sheba Medical Center, Tel-Hashomer, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Immunol Immunopathol,Clinical immunology and immunopathology,0356637,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '82115-62-6 (Interferon-gamma)']",IM,"['Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interferon-gamma/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*physiology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/immunology']",1991/02/01 00:00,1991/02/01 00:01,['1991/02/01 00:00'],"['1991/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0090-1229(91)90142-w [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Immunol Immunopathol. 1991 Feb;58(2):278-88. doi: 10.1016/0090-1229(91)90142-w.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, it is of interest to investigate the mechanism underlying its transcriptional activation in these cells. To delineate the sequences and factors involved in c-fos transcriptional activation during the course of myeloid cell differentiation, we have used the K 562 chronic leukemic cell line as a model. K 562 cells were transfected with chloramphenicol transacetylase (CAT) reporter constructs, including various regions of the human c-fos promoter, and induced to differentiate by two distinct agents: 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which activates a differentiation program along the megakaryoblastic pathway; and hemin, which induces erythroid differentiation. We show here that TPA treatment of K 562 cells induces fos CAT reporter constructs activation, whereas treatment with hemin does not. Furthermore, predifferentiation of the cells with hemin blocks a subsequent induction by TPA, in correlation with the inhibition by hemin of megakaryoblastic differentiation markers appearance. Both the induction by TPA and the inhibition by hemin are mediated by a dyad symmetry element (DSE) located in the upstream regulatory region, between -318 and -296. These results suggest that the protein complex binding to the DSE regulatory element is the target for c-fos activation by TPA and inhibition by hemin in K 562 cells. However, no modulation of protein affinity for the DSE sequence was detected by gel shift assay during the course of induction or inhibition, suggesting that the structural change responsible for the transcriptional modulation is too unstable or too subtle to be detected by this method.","['Trouche, D', 'Robin, P', 'Sassone-Corsi, P', 'Farrar, W L', 'Harel-Bellan, A']","['Trouche D', 'Robin P', 'Sassone-Corsi P', 'Farrar WL', 'Harel-Bellan A']","[""Laboratoire d'Immunologie, CNRS URA 1156, Institut Gustave Roussy, Villejuif, France.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos)', '42VZT0U6YR (Heme)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Heme/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Binding', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)79588-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Jan 1;77(1):55-63.,,,['c-fos'],,,,,,,,,,,,

To verify this interpretation and to elucidate in more detail the diversity of this common type of TCR delta recombination we amplified and sequenced the junctional region of nine cALL patients and cell line REH-6 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A V delta 2 D delta 3 recombination was confirmed in all cases; convincing evidence for the participation of D delta 1 or D delta 2 elements was not obtained. Eight of nine patients and REH-6 showed complete 5' D delta 3 boundaries within V delta 2 D delta 3 segments, a limitation of junctional diversity also detected in 50% of peripheral blood cell clones derived from two healthy probands. Notably, sequence identity at the V delta 2 D delta 3 junction was demonstrated for a cALL and one of the control clones. Another group of 35 of 162 cALL patients was characterized by V delta 2 rearrangements and biallelic deletion of J delta and C delta sequences.

The site of cleavage was confirmed by h.p.l.c. analysis, amino acid analysis and sequence determination of the products. Phosphoramidon (3.6 microM), a potent inhibitor of the enzyme, prevents this cleavage even during prolonged incubation. The high efficiency of hydrolysis of THF by NEP is similar to that reported for [Leu5]enkephalin, and the dipeptide Phe-Leu is the C-terminal product in the hydrolysis of both peptides. The presence of NEP, reportedly identified as the common acute lymphoblastic leukaemia antigen (CALLA), in bone-marrow cells and other cells of the immune system raises the possibility that it may play a role in modulating the activity of peptides such as THF.","['Indig, F E', 'Pecht, M', 'Trainin, N', 'Burstein, Y', 'Blumberg, S']","['Indig FE', 'Pecht M', 'Trainin N', 'Burstein Y', 'Blumberg S']","['Sackler Institute of Molecular Medicine, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Israel.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Amino Acids)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '107489-37-2 (thymic humoral factor gamma 2)', 'EC 3.4.24.11 (Neprilysin)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Amino Acids/analysis', 'Animals', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Cattle', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Hydrolysis', 'Kinetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neprilysin/antagonists & inhibitors/chemistry/*metabolism', 'Oligopeptides/*metabolism/pharmacology']",1991/09/15 00:00,1991/09/15 00:01,['1991/09/15 00:00'],"['1991/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2780891 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1991 Sep 15;278 ( Pt 3):891-4. doi: 10.1042/bj2780891.,,,,,,,PMC1151431,,,,,,,,

However the formation of 5,12-dihydroxy-6-fluoroeicosa-6,8,10,14-tetraenoic acids, epimeric at C-12, was not observed. Eicosa-5(Z),8(Z),14(Z)-trienoic acid (ET), previously described as a good substrate of 5-lipoxygenase, is oxidized mainly to 5-hydroperoxyeicosa-6,8,14-trienoic acid (5-OOH-ET), which does not serve as a substrate for the leukotriene A4 (LTA4) synthase activity of 5-lipoxygenase [Nave, Dulery, Gaget & Ducep (1988) Prostaglandins 36, 385-398]. To allow a better estimation of the effect of fluorine substitution on the rate of oxidation of the 5,8-cis,cis-diene moiety by 5-lipoxygenase, the 5- and 6-fluoro derivatives of ET were studied as substrates. Qualitatively, the metabolism of 5F-ET and 6F-ET was found to be similar to that observed for 5F-ETE and 6F-ETE. Quantitatively, 6F-ET proved to be a somewhat better substrate than ET, whereas 5F-ET was poorly metabolized. The relative ability of arachidonic acid, ET and the corresponding 5- and 6-fluoro derivatives to inhibit the 5-lipoxygenase-catalysed oxidation of eicosa-5(Z),8(Z)-dienoic acid (ED) was also investigated. 6F-ETE and 5F-ETE were found to be effective and about equipotent inhibitors of 5-lipoxygenase in the micromolar range.

Selenoperoxidase activities of cells grown for longer than 1 week in 1% serum with no added selenium [Se(-) cells] were less than 10% of the activities of selenium-satisfied controls [Se(+) cells] or selenium-repleted counterparts [Se(-/+) cells]. The enzymes measured were classical glutathione peroxidase (GPX) and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPX). Se(-) cells exhibited a compensatory increase in catalase activity. Dye exclusion and clonal survival assays indicated that Se(-) and Se(+) cells were relatively insensitive to photochemically generated phospholipid hydroperoxides in liposomal form. However, both cell types were sensitive to liposomal cholesterol hydroperoxides, e.g., 7-hydroperoxycholesterol (7-OOH), Se(-) being much more so (LD50 approximately 10 microM) than Se(+) (LD50 approximately 75 microM). By contrast, 7-hydroxycholesterol over a comparable concentration range was minimally toxic to Se(-) and Se(+) cells. Cell killing by 7-OOH was inhibited by desferrioxamine and by butylated hydroxytoluene, suggesting that iron-mediated free radical reactions are involved. The involvement of glutathione in cytoprotection was confirmed by showing that Se(+) cells were more sensitive to 7-OOH after treating with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of GSH synthesis. Cellular detoxification of 7-OOH is provisionally attributed to PHGPX rather than GPX, since 7-OOH and other cholesterol hydroperoxides were found to be good substrates for PHGPX in a cell free system, but were unreactive with GPX.","['Geiger, P G', 'Thomas, J P', 'Girotti, A W']","['Geiger PG', 'Thomas JP', 'Girotti AW']","['Department of Biochemistry, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Lipid Peroxides)', '0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '1P9D0Z171K (Butylated Hydroxytoluene)', '2846-29-9 (cholesterol 7-hydroperoxide)', '97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)', 'J06Y7MXW4D (Deferoxamine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Butylated Hydroxytoluene/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Cell-Free System', 'Cholesterol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Deferoxamine/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology/*pathology', 'Lipid Peroxides/*pharmacology', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Phospholipids/metabolism', 'Selenium/*pharmacology']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-9861(91)90250-M [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(91)90250-m [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1991 Aug 1;288(2):671-80. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(91)90250-m.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This phenomenon does not require a net change in the amount of polymerized actin. However, increased amounts of polymerized actin have been detected in oxidant-injured cells and it was the purpose of this study to determine the conditions under which the actin polymerization may occur. Utilizing the formation of oxidized glutathione (GSSG) as an indicator of cellular sulfhydryl oxidation, conditions were chosen to accentuate sulfhydryl oxidation within the target P388D1 cell line following exposure to the oxidants, H2O2 and diamide. Using the DNase I and flow cytometric assays of actin polymerization, significant polymerization of actin was detected only under conditions in which sulfhydryl oxidation occurred after exposure to the two oxidizing agents. Greater sulfhydryl oxidation early in the course of injury was associated with a greater rate and extent of actin polymerization in the injured cells. Experiments with cells depleted of glutathione (GSH) demonstrated that neither loss of GSH nor absolute levels of GSSG formed during oxidant exposure were responsible for the polymerization of actin. The data presented are consistent with the hypothesis that oxidizing conditions which induce significant sulfhydryl oxidation in target cells are correlated with assembly of polymerized actin and that this represents a process which is distinct and separate from the ATP-dependent gross disruption of microfilaments.","['Hinshaw, D B', 'Burger, J M', 'Beals, T F', 'Armstrong, B C', 'Hyslop, P A']","['Hinshaw DB', 'Burger JM', 'Beals TF', 'Armstrong BC', 'Hyslop PA']","['Department of Surgery, VA Medical Center, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48105.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Arch Biochem Biophys,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,0372430,"['0 (Actins)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '10465-78-8 (Diamide)', '8L70Q75FXE (Adenosine Triphosphate)', 'BBX060AN9V (Hydrogen Peroxide)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)', 'ULW86O013H (Glutathione Disulfide)']",IM,"['Actins/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Adenosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Deoxyribonuclease I/metabolism', 'Diamide/*pharmacology', 'Glutathione/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Disulfide', 'Hydrogen Peroxide/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia P388', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Mice']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0003-9861(91)90200-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0003-9861(91)90200-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Arch Biochem Biophys. 1991 Aug 1;288(2):311-6. doi: 10.1016/0003-9861(91)90200-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They are generally considered to be due to hypersplenism and to inadequate production by bone marrow which is heavily infiltrated by the neoplastic hairy cells (HC). However, the cytopenias may also be caused by hemopoietic inhibition by cytokines derived from the mononuclear cells (MNC) of HCL. We studied the MNC of HCL with an in vitro assay for granulocyte-macrophage progenitors (CFU-GM) to search for this hemopoietic inhibitor(s) and to determine the cell source and mechanism of its production/release. We found that MNC conditioned media from 7 of 9 HCL cases exerted substantial inhibitory effect (23% to 66%) on normal marrow cells. Peak inhibitory activity was obtained in media conditioned with 10(6) MNC/ml for 90 minutes to 24 hours. Both HC and lymphocytes could release inhibitor(s) through mutually synergistic cell interactions. HC alone were inactive and lymphocytes alone were only weakly active. Mixtures of conditioned media of HC and of lymphocytes were not synergistic. The lymphocytes responsible for the inhibition were present in preparations depleted of cells bearing the cluster designation 4 antigen (CD4+) and B cells and were most likely the CD8+ T-cells. In one patient so examined, a partial reversal of inhibition was achieved by treating MNC-CM with antibodies to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha suggesting that TNF-alpha was at least partly involved in the inhibition of CFU-GM. This mechanism of cytokine release may be operative in vivo to account for the cytopenias in HCL and, if so, could alter the concept of hypersplenism in this disease.","['Janckila, A J', 'Gentile, P S', 'Yam, L T']","['Janckila AJ', 'Gentile PS', 'Yam LT']","['Special Hematology Laboratory, Department of Veterans Affairs VA Medical Center, Louisville, KY 40206.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Granulocytes/physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/metabolism/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Monocytes/physiology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830380106 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1991 Sep;38(1):30-9. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830380106.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The treatments examined were based on the use of sodium thiosulfate, sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DDTC), glutathione (GSH), sodium N-methyl-D-glucamine dithiocarbamate (NaG) and S-2-(3-aminopropylamino)ethylphosphorothioic acid (WR-2721). The differences in the effectiveness of the procedures were assessed using BUN and serum creatinine values, histopathological examination, body weight changes, and renal platinum levels as indices. The effect of such treatments on the antineoplastic activity of cisplatin were examined with both the Walker 256 carcinosarcoma in the rat and the L1210 murine leukemia in mice. Under the conditions used, GSH was found to be more effective than the other nucleophiles in protecting against the nephrotoxicity of cisplatin while providing the least amount of interference with the antitumor activity as measured against the Walker 256 carcinosarcoma and the L1210 murine leukemia. Simultaneous i.v. administration of cisplatin and any of the sulfur-containing nucleophiles leads to a significant protection against the nephrotoxicity but reduced the anti-neoplastic activity of cisplatin when measured against the Walker 256 carcinosarcoma.","['Jones, M M', 'Basinger, M A', 'Holscher, M A']","['Jones MM', 'Basinger MA', 'Holscher MA']","['Department of Chemistry, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 37235.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Ireland,Toxicology,Toxicology,0361055,"['49DFR088MY (Platinum)', '70FD1KFU70 (Sulfur)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinoma 256, Walker/drug therapy', 'Cisplatin/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/toxicity', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Kidney Diseases/chemically induced/pathology/*prevention & control', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Platinum/blood', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sulfur']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0300-483X(91)90072-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0300-483x(91)90072-9 [doi]']",ppublish,Toxicology. 1991;68(3):227-47. doi: 10.1016/0300-483x(91)90072-9.,,['CA-38997-04/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moloney murine leukemia virus-derived retrovirus vectors that contain human factor IX cDNA linked to heterologous promoters and the neomycin-resistant gene were constructed and employed to prepare recombinant retroviruses. Rat CECs and NIH 3T3 cells infected with these viruses were selected with the neomycin analogue, G418 sulfate, and tested for expression of factor IX. A construct with the factor IX cDNA under direct control by long terminal repeat gave the highest level of expression (0.84 and 3.6 micrograms per 10(6) cells per day for CECs and NIH 3T3 cells, respectively) as quantitated by immunoassays as well as clotting activity assays. A single RNA transcript of 4.4 kilobases predicted by the construct and a recombinant factor IX of 68 kilodaltons identical to purified plasma factor IX were found. The recombinant human factor IX produced showed full clotting activity, demonstrating that CECs have an efficient mechanism for posttranslational modifications, including gamma-carboxylation, essential for its biological activity. These results, in addition to other properties of the endothelium, including large number of cells, accessibility, and direct contact with the circulating blood, suggest that CECs can serve as an efficient drug delivery vehicle producing factor IX in a somatic gene therapy for hemophilia B.","['Yao, S N', 'Wilson, J M', 'Nabel, E G', 'Kurachi, S', 'Hachiya, H L', 'Kurachi, K']","['Yao SN', 'Wilson JM', 'Nabel EG', 'Kurachi S', 'Hachiya HL', 'Kurachi K']","['Department of Human Genetics, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48109-0618.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9001-28-9 (Factor IX)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Endothelium, Vascular/physiology', 'Factor IX/*genetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Therapy', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Hemophilia B/therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection']",1991/09/15 00:00,1991/09/15 00:01,['1991/09/15 00:00'],"['1991/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.88.18.8101 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1991 Sep 15;88(18):8101-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.88.18.8101.,,"['HL38644/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'P01-DK42718/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC52454,,,,,,,,

This pathway is considered to be the main source of endogenous adenine. We determined the concentrations of MTA and adenine in control subjects and in those with a pathological disorder. In patients with active leukemias, as well as with other types of malignancies, the concentrations of MTA and adenine in the urine were elevated. These changes seemed to be the result of an accelerated production of MTA due to an accelerated biosynthesis of polyamine. In patients with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency, the concentrations of adenine in the urine were elevated, presumably due to a disturbance in the catabolism of adenine. Although adenine is a potent inhibitor of MTA phosphorylase, APRT-deficient patients did not excrete MTA into urine in concentrations significantly larger than noted for control subjects. However, the amount of MTA excreted positively correlated with that of adenine in these patients, hence that accumulated adenine probably had a slight, but positive, inhibitory effect on the degradation of MTA.","['Kaneko, K', 'Fujimori, S', 'Kumakawa, T', 'Kamatani, N', 'Akaoka, I']","['Kaneko K', 'Fujimori S', 'Kumakawa T', 'Kamatani N', 'Akaoka I']","['Central Laboratory of Analytical Biochemistry, Teikyo University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Metabolism,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,0375267,"['0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Thionucleosides)', ""634Z2VK3UQ (5'-methylthioadenosine)"", 'EC 2.4.2.7 (Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)', 'K72T3FS567 (Adenosine)']",IM,"['Adenine/*metabolism/urine', 'Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*deficiency', 'Adenosine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/urine', 'Adult', 'Aged', '*Deoxyadenosines', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/metabolism/urine', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/metabolism/urine', 'Osmolar Concentration', 'Thionucleosides/*metabolism/urine']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0026-0495(91)90066-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0026-0495(91)90066-6 [doi]']",ppublish,Metabolism. 1991 Sep;40(9):918-21. doi: 10.1016/0026-0495(91)90066-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After one week, the tumor cells were harvested, and 51Cr was used to label intracellular molecules. Spontaneous release of 51Cr was used as a measure of plasma membrane permeability. Compared to cells from mice fed coconut oil (rich in saturated fatty acids), tumor cells from mice fed menhaden oil (rich in long chain polyunsaturated omega 3 fatty acids) showed an increased level of spontaneous 51Cr release, which was exacerbated by increased temperature and reduced by extracellular protein. At physiological salt concentrations, the released 51Cr was detected in particles of approximately 2700 daltons. Enhanced permeability correlated with the incorporation of dietary (fish oil) omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acid into the tumor cells. The results demonstrate that omega 3 fatty acids are incorporated into cellular constituents of tumor cells and change properties associated with the plasma membrane. This result suggests that dietary manipulation may be used to enhance tumor cell permeability and contribute to tumor eradication.","['Jenski, L J', 'Sturdevant, L K', 'Ehringer, W D', 'Stillwell, W']","['Jenski LJ', 'Sturdevant LK', 'Ehringer WD', 'Stillwell W']","['Department of Biology, Indiana University-Purdue University, Indianapolis, 46205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Lipids,Lipids,0060450,"['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Dietary Fats)', '0 (Fatty Acids, Omega-3)', '0 (Fish Oils)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Plant Oils)', '1D8HWC57D0 (Menhaden oil)', 'Q9L0O73W7L (Coconut Oil)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane Permeability/drug effects', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', 'Coconut Oil', 'Cytosol/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dietary Fats/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Omega-3/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Fish Oils/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Membrane Lipids/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', '*Plant Oils', 'Temperature']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02537198 [doi]'],ppublish,Lipids. 1991 May;26(5):353-8. doi: 10.1007/BF02537198.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We examined the effects of some inhibitors for these biochemical activities in human myelogenous leukemia cells. Genistein, which is known to inhibit the activities of protein tyrosine kinase, phosphatidylinositol turnover and topoisomerase II, induced nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction and lysozyme activity in ML-1, HL-60 and U937 cells. Morphological studies showed that genistein-induced differentiation of myeloblastic ML-1 cells into promyelocytes and of promyelocytic HL-60 cells into mature granulocytes. The differentiation-inducing effect of genistein was augmented by addition of 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3) or retinoic acid, VD3 being more effective than retinoic acid. Methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinamate, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, had only a weak effect in inducing differentiation of ML-1 cells. On the other hand, psi-tectorigenin was more effective than genistein in inducing the differentiations of ML-1 and HL-60 cells. Psi-tectorigenin is reported to inhibit phosphatidylinositol turnover without inhibiting protein tyrosine kinase. Thus modulation of phosphatidylinositol turnover might be more important than that of protein tyrosine kinase activity for differentiation of some myelogenous leukemia cells.","['Makishima, M', 'Honma, Y', 'Hozumi, M', 'Sampi, K', 'Hattori, M', 'Umezawa, K', 'Motoyoshi, K']","['Makishima M', 'Honma Y', 'Hozumi M', 'Sampi K', 'Hattori M', 'Umezawa K', 'Motoyoshi K']","['Saitama Cancer Center, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Cinnamates)', '0 (Isoflavones)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '63177-57-1 (methyl 2,5-dihydroxycinnamate)', '8HXB4THX7F (psi-tectorigenin)', 'DH2M523P0H (Genistein)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cinnamates/pharmacology', 'Genistein', 'Humans', 'Isoflavones/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Phosphatidylinositols/*metabolism', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(91)90072-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(91)90072-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(8):701-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90072-2.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This approach was based on the assumption that the qualitative expression of antigens is not an all or none phenomenon, but that different degrees of expression of antigens exist. Patients with significantly elevated CD13 (MY7+) cells in bone marrows (CD13 greater than reference value + one standard deviation) (S.D.) showed decreased probability of entering CR (p less than 0.05) and a significantly shorter survival (p less than 0.05). Superior CR rates (p less than 0.05) without difference in long-term survival were seen in patients with low CD33 (MY9) or low HLA-DR expression, while high CD14 (MY4) expression showed a trend towards an adverse factor (p = 0.12). No other antibody reactivities showed differences in CR rates (CD3, CD20, CDw65 (VIM-2) and NAT-9). The more prominent bone marrow expression of CD33 antigen than CD13 (CD33/CD13 greater than 1) correlated to a better chance of entering CR (p = 0.01) and to improved survival (p = 0.002), while the expression of high numbers of VIM-2+ cells was a favourable prognostic factor regarding length of survival (p = 0.002). The importance of a high CD33/CD13 ratio as a positive prognostic factor was evaluated using stratified analysis according to age or leucocyte counts at presentation. In both cases, CD33/CD13 was associated with longer survival (age: p = 0.05, leucocyte counts: p = 0.03). A Cox multiparameter analysis revealed that the CD33/CD13 ratio was a favourable prognostic factor (p = 0.03) together with age (p = 0.001) and leucocyte counts in peripheral blood (p less than 0.01). We conclude that establishing the immunologic phenotype can be of prognostic value in cases of AML, especially with regard to the relationship between the CD33 and CD13 antigens.","['Kristensen, J S', 'Hokland, P']","['Kristensen JS', 'Hokland P']","['University Department of Medicine and Haematology, Aarhus County Hospital, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Aging/physiology', 'Analysis of Variance', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/physiology', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/immunology/*mortality', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0145-2126(91)90071-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0145-2126(91)90071-z [doi]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1991;15(8):693-700. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(91)90071-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The surface protein gp70 has eight potential attachment sites for N-linked glycan; each signal asparagine was converted to aspartate, and mutant viruses were tested for the ability to grow in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts. Seven of the mutations did not affect virus infectivity, whereas mutation of the fourth glycosylation signal from the amino terminus (gs4) resulted in a noninfectious phenotype. Characterization of mutant gene products by radioimmunoprecipitation confirmed that glycosylation occurs at all eight consensus signals in gp70 and that gs2 carries an endoglycosidase H-sensitive glycan. Elimination of gs2 did not cause retention of an endoglycosidase H-sensitive glycan at a different site, demonstrating that this structure does not play an essential role in envelope protein function. The gs3- mutation affected a second posttranslational modification of unknown type, which was manifested as production of gp70 that remained smaller than wild-type gp70 after removal of all N-linked glycans by peptide N-glycosidase F. The gs4- mutation decreased processing of gPr80 to gPr90, completely inhibited proteolytic processing of gPr90 to gp70 and Pr15(E), and prevented incorporation of envelope products into virus particles. Brefeldin A-induced mixing of the endoplasmic reticulum and parts of the Golgi apparatus allowed proteolytic processing of wild-type gPr90 to occur in the absence of protein transport, but it did not overcome the cleavage defect of the gs4- precursor, indicating that gs4- gPr90 is resistant to the processing protease. The work reported here demonstrates that the gs4 region is important for env precursor processing and suggests that gs4 may be a critical target in the disruption of murine leukemia virus env product processing by inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation.","['Kayman, S C', 'Kopelman, R', 'Projan, S', 'Kinney, D M', 'Pinter, A']","['Kayman SC', 'Kopelman R', 'Projan S', 'Kinney DM', 'Pinter A']","['Laboratory of Retroviral Biology, Public Health Research Institute, New York, New York 10016.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (Gene Products, env)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', 'N08U5BOQ1K (Glucosamine)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Codon/genetics', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*genetics/growth & development', 'Gene Products, env/*genetics', '*Genes, env', 'Glucosamine/metabolism', 'Glycosylation', 'Kinetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', '*Protein Processing, Post-Translational', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Transfection', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.10.5323-5332.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Oct;65(10):5323-32. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.10.5323-5332.1991.,,['CA-42129/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['env'],,,,PMC249012,,,,,,,,

We have constructed a mutant SFFV envelope gene in which the sequences that code for the hydrophobic membrane-spanning domain have been deleted, and we expressed this gene by using recombinant vaccinia virus vectors or retroviral vectors. The mutant SFFV envelope gene was found to encode a truncated glycoprotein (gp52t) which was also transport defective; a majority of gp52t remained cell associated, while a small proportion of the molecules underwent oligosaccharide processing. The processed form of gp52t was secreted from the cells. Retroviral vectors carrying the mutant SFFV envelope gene were found to be nonpathogenic in adult mice. These results indicate that the hydrophobic membrane-spanning region of gp52 is required for pathogenicity of SFFV and suggest that these sequences may play a role in signal transduction.

This paper explores their applications in the field of quantitative structure-activity relationships. In particular, their ability to fit biological activity surfaces, predict activity, and determine the ""functional forms"" of its dependence on physical properties is compared to well-established methods in the field. A dataset of 256 5-phenyl-3,4-diamino-6,6-dimethyldihydrotriazines that inhibit dihydrofolate reductase enzyme is used as a basis for comparison. It is found that neural networks lead to enhanced surface fits and predictions relative to standard regression methods. Moreover, they circumvent the need for ad hoc indicator variables, which account for a significant part of the variance in linear regression models. Additionally, they lead to the elucidation of nonlinear and ""cross-products"" effects that correspond to trade-offs between physical properties in their effect on biological activity. This is the first demonstration of the latter two findings. On the other hand, due to the complexity of the resulting models, an understanding of the local, but not the global, structure-activity relationships is possible. The latter must await further developments. Furthermore, the longer computational time required to train the networks is somewhat inconveniencing, although not restrictive.","['Andrea, T A', 'Kalayeh, H']","['Andrea TA', 'Kalayeh H']","['E.

When these cells are exposed to the carcinogen after a low number of passages post-infection (p.i.), cell transformation becomes apparent only after many subsequent passages. On the other hand, when exposure is done after a high number of passages p.i., cell transformation can be detected in the treated culture or at the next passage. It is thus evident that whereas the carcinogenic effect is rapid, the viral effect becomes apparent only after a long period of latency. Here we provide evidence that this viral effect requires multiple proviruses and that the long latent period reflects the time needed for a sufficient accumulation of proviruses in some of the cells. This accumulation may result from multiple rounds of superinfection by virions released into the culture medium, although we cannot exclude other mechanisms of provirus amplification.

THP-1 is a mature monocytic leukemia cell line that produces TNF in a dose-dependent fashion in response to purified endotoxin. E. coli were incubated in the presence of amikacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, aztreonam, or imipenem at concentrations that killed greater than 99.9% of the organisms. Aliquots of these antibiotic-bacterial cultures were added to THP-1 cells, and TNF concentrations were determined by specific immunoassay. Amikacin and imipenem produced rapid bacterial killing and were associated with low TNF levels. Ceftazidime, aztreonam, and cefotaxime killed E. coli at a slower rate and were associated with significant increases in mononuclear cell TNF responses. Ciprofloxacin produced intermediate TNF levels. Differences exist among bactericidal antibodies in their ability to generate products capable of stimulating mononuclear cell TNF release.","['Simon, D M', 'Koenig, G', 'Trenholme, G M']","['Simon DM', 'Koenig G', 'Trenholme GM']","[""Department of Medicine, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, IL 60612.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Infect Dis,The Journal of infectious diseases,0413675,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', '71OTZ9ZE0A (Imipenem)', '84319SGC3C (Amikacin)', '9M416Z9QNR (Ceftazidime)', 'G2B4VE5GH8 (Aztreonam)', 'N2GI8B1GK7 (Cefotaxime)']",IM,"['Amikacin/pharmacology', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Aztreonam/pharmacology', 'Cefotaxime/pharmacology', 'Ceftazidime/pharmacology', 'Ciprofloxacin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Escherichia coli/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Imipenem/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/*biosynthesis']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/infdis/164.4.800 [doi]'],ppublish,J Infect Dis. 1991 Oct;164(4):800-2. doi: 10.1093/infdis/164.4.800.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Distinctive responses of the erythroid-specific and the nonspecific delta-aminolevulinate synthase mRNA.,17494-502,"We have examined the levels of delta-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS) mRNAs encoding the erythroid-specific (ALAS-E) and the nonspecific (ALAS-N) ALAS isozymes in murine Friend virus-transformed erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Both ALAS-E and ALAS-N mRNAs were detected in a clone of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO)-sensitive MEL cells, termed DS-19, without cross-hybridization. Untreated DS-19 cells contained approximately 10-fold more ALAS-E mRNA than ALAS-N mRNA. When DS-19 cells were treated with Me2SO or hemin, ALAS-N mRNA declined rapidly, which was followed by a marked increase in ALAS-E mRNA. Similarly, the immunoquantifiable ALAS-N protein decreased, while the ALAS-E protein increased upon Me2SO treatment. A clone of Me2SO-resistant cells, termed DR-1, which fails to undergo erythroid differentiation, was found to lack ALAS-E mRNA, whereas it showed significant induction responses of mRNAs for other heme pathway enzymes by Me2SO treatment. DR-1 cells contained a similar level of an erythroid-specific transcription factor, GATA-1, as did DS-19 cells, and had neither major deletion nor rearrangement of the ALAS-E gene. These findings indicate that the genes encoding the two ALAS isozymes are under separate controls and suggest that ALAS-E mRNA accumulation is responsible for increased heme synthesis in MEL cells undergoing erythroid differentiation.","['Fujita, H', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Yamagami, T', 'Hayashi, N', 'Sassa, S']","['Fujita H', 'Yamamoto M', 'Yamagami T', 'Hayashi N', 'Sassa S']","['Rockefeller University Hospital, New York, New York 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleotides)', '0 (Heptanoates)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '51568-18-4 (succinylacetone)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.3.1.37 (5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['5-Aminolevulinate Synthetase/*genetics/metabolism', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Deoxyribonucleotides', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Globins/genetics/metabolism', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hemin/metabolism', 'Heptanoates/pharmacology', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'RNA, Messenger/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/09/15 00:00,1991/09/15 00:01,['1991/09/15 00:00'],"['1991/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)47399-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Sep 15;266(26):17494-502.,,['DK-32890/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increased expression associated with a genomic rearrangement.,17243-9,"L1210 murine leukemic cells grown under conditions of continuous low folate concentrations acquire increased levels of a high affinity/low capacity folate-binding protein (FBP). Using an oligonucleotide probe complementary to the human FBP, we have cloned and sequenced two murine FBP cDNAs isolated from a library constructed using a L1210 subline adapted for growth on low levels of 5-formyltetrahydrofolate. The encoding proteins, designated FBP1 and FBP2, have predicted Mr values of 29,415 and 28,821, respectively. These proteins share significant sequence identity with each other (70%) and with the deduced sequences of the human- and bovine-encoded FBPs (68-79%). Southern blot analysis of the low folate-adapted cell line revealed that, while neither of the two FBP-encoding genes was amplified, the FBP1 genomic locus had undergone rearrangement. On Northern blot analysis, this rearrangement was reflected in the enhanced expression (greater than 100-fold) of a FBP1-specific transcript which was 200 nucleotides shorter than the corresponding L1210 parental transcript. The increased expression of this transcript coincided with the increased expression of a membrane protein (Mr = 38,000) which could be affinity-labeled with a N-hydroxysuccinimide ester of [3H]folate. Accordingly, the FBP1 transcript appears to encode the high affinity/low capacity FBP. Compared to parental L1210 cells, expression of the FBP2-encoding transcript was unchanged in this cell line and, while the exact nature of the protein is unclear, FBP2 may represent a fetal form of the FBP.","['Brigle, K E', 'Westin, E H', 'Houghton, M T', 'Goldman, I D']","['Brigle KE', 'Westin EH', 'Houghton MT', 'Goldman ID']","['Department of Medicine, Virginia Commonwealth University, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored)', '0 (Receptors, Cell Surface)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Biological Transport', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA', 'Folate Receptors, GPI-Anchored', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Gene Rearrangement', 'Glycosylation', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational', '*Receptors, Cell Surface', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/09/15 00:00,1991/09/15 00:01,['1991/09/15 00:00'],"['1991/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)47365-1 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Sep 15;266(26):17243-9.,,"['CA-09340/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39807/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M64782', 'GENBANK/M64817', 'GENBANK/S53397', 'GENBANK/S53399', 'GENBANK/S53401', 'GENBANK/S53403', 'GENBANK/S54662', 'GENBANK/S54667', 'GENBANK/S55022', 'GENBANK/S55024']",,,

Recently the authors have discovered that infection with HIV or Mo-MuLV causes a specific acceleration of the synthesis of an UAG suppressor glutamine tRNA in the host cell; they could demonstrate that this phenomenon is based on transcriptional promotion of tRNA genes which is due to a new transcriptional activator synthesized as a function of viral infection and/or increased virus levels.

In comparison with CMK, we have examined the characteristics of a subclone, designated as CMK11-5, that is morphologically larger than the parent clone CMK and contains multinucleated giant cells. All CMK11-5 cells were positive for platelet peroxidase (PPO) activity, and some contained abundant alpha-granules and well-developed demarcation membranes. CMK cells had few demarcation membranes and alpha-granules, and 10% of these cells were found not to possess PPO activity. Phenotypic analysis revealed the percentage of CMK11-5 cells for platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa (CD41a), and GPIIIa (CD61) was greater than that for CMK cells. On the basis of these findings, CMK11-5 cells were considered to be more differentiated than CMK cells. We further examined the expression of GPIIb and platelet factor 4 (PF4) mRNA by Northern blot hybridization using 32P-labeled cDNA probes for GPIIb and PF4 in CMK and CMK11-5 cells. CMK cells exhibited mRNA for GPIIb, and its expression was augmented by TPA addition, but not PF4.

Uteroferrin exerts maximum CFU activities at 1 microgram/ml in serum-free culture medium with no supplemental iron (90 micrograms/ml ferric iron). However, when ferric iron concentration in medium was increased to 200 micrograms/ml, uteroferrin had maximum CFU activities at 100 pg/ml. Preincubation of uteroferrin with polyclonal antiserum or monoclonal antibody to uteroferrin effectively eliminated its CFU activities. Uteroferrin derived from human term placentae also exhibits BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-GEMM activities.

We describe the synthesis of a streptavidin-biotin-toxin conjugate using whole ricin. Streptavidin-biotin-ricin (SA-BR) conjugates were synthesized by biotinylation of whole ricin, which was then complexed with streptavidin. Hybrid molecules consisting of a single biotinylated ricin moiety linked to a streptavidin molecule were separated by gel filtration. This SA-BR conjugate was used in an indirect cytotoxicity assay. The assay involved sensitizing of target cells with biotinylated monoclonal antibody (B-MCAB) followed by treatment with dilutions of SA-BR conjugate. The assay demonstrated a specific antibody-directed cytotoxicity. The strength of this SA-BR system is that a single conjugate was able to be used in conjunction with a library of B-MCABs to selectively target phenotypically different cell types. The application of the SA-BR conjugate is thus only restricted by the availability of B-MCABs specific for the desired target cells. The high affinity of avidin for biotin (Kd approximately 10(-15)) and the ability of a single conjugate to target phenotypically different cells through utilization of a library of B-MCABs gives SA-BR conjugates great potential in the selective targeting of individual cell types.","['Meyer, B F', 'Stoner, M L', 'Raphael, C L', 'Davis, R E', 'Herrmann, R P']","['Meyer BF', 'Stoner ML', 'Raphael CL', 'Davis RE', 'Herrmann RP']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Perth Hospital, Western Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Bacterial Proteins)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '6SO6U10H04 (Biotin)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', '9013-20-1 (Streptavidin)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Bacterial Proteins', '*Biotin', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Separation/*methods', '*Immunotoxins', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Ricin', 'Streptavidin', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1991 Aug;19(7):710-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When these cases were cultured with recombinant human cytokines (but without BCGF) only a minority showed colony formation, in all instances less than seen with BCGF. Three cases were stimulated both by interleukin 3 (IL-3) and the putative pre-B growth factor interleukin 7 (IL-7). One case was stimulated both by tumor necrosis factor alpha and by interleukin 6 (IL-6); these results were confirmed on highly purified CD-10+, CD-19+ cells prepared by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. A further case was stimulated by granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), including CD-10+, CD-19+ purified cells. All cases responding to recombinant cytokines were heavily pretreated patients at relapse, whereas none of the newly diagnosed untreated cases showed any response.

Exposure to rIL-3 for 24 h significantly increased the percentage of cycling S-phase cells in normal BMMC as well as leukemic cells. A concomitant expansion of intracellular deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) levels occurred to a significantly greater extent in normal BMMC. Compared to treatment with Ara-C (10 mumol/liter) alone, prior and coadministration of rIL-3 with Ara-C increased Ara-CTP levels in leukemic blasts. However, an identical treatment produced significantly higher dCTP levels in normal BMMC, resulting in a significantly lower mean Ara-CTP to dCTP pool ratio in normal BMMC compared to that observed in each of the samples of AML blasts. Following treatment with Ara-C plus rIL-3 versus Ara-C alone, the alteration in Ara-C DNA incorporation corresponded with the change in Ara-CTP to dCTP ratio observed in normal BMMC and AML blasts. The differential effect of rIL-3 on the metabolism of high-dose Ara-C in normal versus leukemic cells may indicate a role for rIL-3 in enhancing the selectivity of Ara-C toward leukemic myeloblasts.","['Bhalla, K', 'Birkhofer, M', 'Arlin, Z', 'Grant, S', 'Lutzky, J', 'Safah, H', 'Graham, G']","['Bhalla K', 'Birkhofer M', 'Arlin Z', 'Grant S', 'Lutzky J', 'Safah H', 'Graham G']","['Department of Medicine, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston 29425.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,"['0 (Deoxycytosine Nucleotides)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""2056-98-6 (2'-deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate)"", '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Bone Marrow/*metabolism', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Deoxycytosine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1991 Aug;19(7):669-73.,,['CA-45671-03/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the ultrastructural level it was possible to see that in the absence of a 37 degrees C incubation of purified nuclei, the final matrix lacked well-defined nucleolar remnants but a peripheral lamina was clearly visible, as well as a sparse fibrogranular network which was located at the periphery of the structures. On the contrary, after a 37 degrees C nuclear incubation, very electron-dense nucleolar remnants were observed along with an abundant meshwork dispersed throughout the interior of the structures. When intact cells were heat shocked in vivo, electron-dense residual nucleoli were present only when isolated nuclei had been exposed to 37 degrees C in vitro, whereas without such an incubation, they were not as easily distinguishable and appeared less electron-dense. In the latter case the inner network was more evenly distributed. After purified nuclei were incubated at 37 degrees C for 45 min, the high salt and DNase I resistant fraction retained about 18% of the nuclear protein whereas if the heating was omitted protein recovery dropped to 6%. An increase in the recovery of intact structures in the matrix fraction was the main reason for the higher protein recovery. Heating nuclei in vitro further increased the amount of nuclear protein present in the matrix fraction even if intact cells had been heat shocked in vivo. No major qualitative differences were seen when the polypeptide pattern of the various types of nuclear matrices was analyzed on one-dimensional polyacrylamide gels and this finding was further supported by Western blot analysis with a monoclonal antibody to lamins A and C. These results show that heating mainly stabilizes the nucleolar remnants of the matrix and to a lesser extent the inner network, but the morphology of the final structures is different depending on whether the stabilization is performed in vivo or in vitro.","['Martelli, A M', 'Falcieri, E', 'Gobbi, P', 'Manzoli, L', 'Gilmour, R S', 'Cocco, L']","['Martelli AM', 'Falcieri E', 'Gobbi P', 'Manzoli L', 'Gilmour RS', 'Cocco L']","['Istituto di Anatomia Umana Normale, Bologna, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Nuclear)', '0 (Lamins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', 'EC 3.1.21.1 (Deoxyribonuclease I)', 'EC 3.1.27.5 (Ribonuclease, Pancreatic)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Nuclear', 'Blotting, Western', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Nucleus/ultrastructure', 'Deoxyribonuclease I', 'Hot Temperature', 'Lamins', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Molecular Weight', 'Nuclear Matrix/*ultrastructure', 'Nuclear Proteins/analysis/isolation & purification', 'Ribonuclease, Pancreatic']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0014-4827(91)90254-r [doi]'],ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1991 Oct;196(2):216-25. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90254-r.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pharmacokinetics of high-dose p.o. leucovorin was studied in 23 children. There was considerable interpatient variability in the plasma concentrations of total bioactive folates (TBAF), (6S)-leucovorin, and (6S)-5-methyltetrahydrofolic acid. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of TBAF was 821 +/- 97 (SE) nM, occurring at a median of 8 h; the Cmax of (6S)-leucovorin was 77 +/- 11 nM, occurring at 4 h. The TBAF concentration fell to 146 +/- 42 nM by 24 h. (6S)-5-Methyltetrahydrofolic acid accounted for 90 +/- 7% of the TBAF at the Cmax. The plasma concentration of (6R)-leucovorin, the unnatural isomer, was equal to that of TBAF. Thus, p.o. leucovorin reduced the 5-fold excess of (6R)-leucovorin over TBAF seen after i.v. doses. The relative amounts of the three major plasma species were approximately the same as in adults, even though the Cmax of each compound was lower.","['Patel, R', 'Newman, E M', 'Villacorte, D G', 'Sato, J K', 'Reaman, G H', 'Finklestein, J Z', 'Krailo, M D', 'Hammond, G D', 'Holcenberg, J S']","['Patel R', 'Newman EM', 'Villacorte DG', 'Sato JK', 'Reaman GH', 'Finklestein JZ', 'Krailo MD', 'Hammond GD', 'Holcenberg JS']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Los Angeles, California 90054.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Tetrahydrofolates)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'TYK22LML8F (5-methyltetrahydrofolate)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Fluorouracil/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leucovorin/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Tetrahydrofolates/metabolism/toxicity']",1991/09/15 00:00,1991/09/15 00:01,['1991/09/15 00:00'],"['1991/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Sep 15;51(18):4871-5.,,['CA38053/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Such alloimmunization (AI) may result in refractoriness to further platelet transfusions. Contaminating leucocytes bearing Class II HLA and present in platelet concentrates (PC) are responsible for the formation of HLA antibodies and their removal by filtration reduces the rate of recipient AI. Ultraviolet irradiation (UVR) of PC at an appropriate dose inactivates the contaminating mononuclear leucocytes so that responses in vitro to mitogens and alloantigens are abrogated. It seems likely that UV-irradiation of donor dendritic cells (DC) is important in preventing in vitro responses to alloantigens and in vivo allosensitization. At the same time, satisfactory platelet function and structure is retained when measured by in vitro tests. In vivo assessments of platelet recovery and survival in healthy subjects and the ability to correct the bleeding time in thrombocytopenic patients are comparable to non-irradiated PC.

The results show that the age is a significant independent prognostic factor in CLL but not in CML.

We observed that CsA had a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on growth of the cells in vitro, decreasing protein content, cell number and the rate of incorporation of 3H-thymidine into the cells. However, CsA treatment had no significant effect on intracellular polyamine levels in the cells. Contrary to previous reports, simultaneous addition of the diamine, putrescine, with CsA did not block or lessen the growth inhibitory effects of CsA. On the other hand, ornithine decarboxylase activity, the rate limiting enzyme of polyamine biosynthesis which converts ornithine to putrescine, was decreased by CsA treatment. This decrease appeared to be reversible and contrasts with the inhibition by alpha-difluoromethyl-ornithine, which is irreversible and can be overcome by addition of putrescine. This suppression of ornithine decarboxylase by CsA is more likely to occur by indirect effects on translation and/or transcription rather than a direct effect on the enzyme. It may be a contributory factor in the overall antiproliferative effects of CsA but is more likely to be a response to these growth inhibitory effects rather than a direct effect of the drug.","['McLachlan, G', 'Thomson, A W', 'Wallace, H M']","['McLachlan G', 'Thomson AW', 'Wallace HM']","['Department of Medicine, University of Aberdeen, Medical School, Scotland, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '2FZ7Y3VOQX (Spermine)', 'U87FK77H25 (Spermidine)', 'V10TVZ52E4 (Putrescine)']",IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*metabolism', 'Putrescine/*metabolism', 'Spermidine/*metabolism', 'Spermine/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1991.287 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1991 Aug;64(2):255-8. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1991.287.,,,,,,,PMC1977540,,,,,,,,

In evaluating the electrophoretic LD isoenzyme patterns of these patients, three criteria were used. In criterion-1 elevations, the LD-3/total LD ratio, expressed as a fraction of serum total LD, and LD-3 value, expressed in absolute units, were greater than the upper limit of the reference range. In criterion-2 elevations, only the LD-3/total LD ratio was greater than the upper limit of the reference range. In criterion-3 elevations, only the absolute LD-3 activity exceeded the upper limit of the reference range, and these specimens showed isomorphic elevation of all five LD isoenzymes. Use of the last of these criteria increased the clinical sensitivity of serum LD-3 elevations in active CGL from 82% to 92%. The mean serum LD-3 absolute value and serum total LD activity usually showed statistically significant differences (P less than 0.05) among patients with active CGL, those in partial remission, and those in complete remission, but did not distinguish between subgroups of individuals with active CGL. Elevation of the serum LD-5/total LD ratio in 16 of 58 patients was due to hepatic injury or methodologic imprecision, showing analytically insignificant, borderline abnormalities in all cases of active CGL. In 10 of 62 patients in complete remission or partial remission, however, such elevation was unexplained. Our results indicate that the evaluation of serum LD-3 values in both absolute and relative terms slightly increases the clinical sensitivity of LD-3, and, therefore, suggest that LD-3 might be a useful marker for CGL.","['Buchsbaum, R M', 'Liu, F J', 'Trujillo, J M']","['Buchsbaum RM', 'Liu FJ', 'Trujillo JM']","['Division of Laboratory Medicine, University of Texas M.

Fifteen control patients received standard blood components with a mean of 0.1 x 10(9) (PCs) and 1 x 10(9) (RBCs) WBCs per unit. Platelet loss during cotton-wool filtration averaged 14 percent (range, 3-32%) from fresh PCs and 24 percent (range, 9-62%) from stored PCs. Filtration did not change corrected increments (CI) measured after transfusion of fresh PCs. The Cl 1 hour after filtration of stored PCs diminished by 27 percent, but the difference was smaller after 18 hours, which suggests better survival of WBC-reduced platelets. The number of platelet units transfused did not differ in the two groups. No patient in the WBC-reduced group developed permanent platelet refractoriness; transient HLA antibodies of low titer developed in two patients.

The difficulty in achieving high cure rates begins after age 50 and steadily increases for patients over 60, 70 and 80. Less aggressive staging procedures are justified, and the modern visualizing techniques provide alternatives to lymphangiography and laparosplenectomy. In HD, local radiation instead of Total Nodal Irradiation, and doses of 30 or even 20 Gy may be administered for stages I and II; for stages III and IV the ChlVPP and the NOVP or the ""ABVD without D"" regimens may be adopted. After chronological and/or biological age 80, sequentially administered single agents produce an effective palliation, allowing for a good quality of life during treatment, and often obtain a reasonable prolongation of survival. Many NHL of elderly patients are indolent in their course, and a ""watch and wait"" policy is often in the true interest of the patient; when local aggressiveness only is apparent, a local low dose radiation may be considered. For advanced stage, treatment-requiring low-grade-NHL, oral chlorambucil plus or minus low dose steroids (or prednimustine) should be considered in alternative to watch and wait. For high grade, aggressive NHL, chemotherapy with short, non-Methotrexate-containing programs like POCE, NOSTE, P-VABEC, or other variations of MACOP-B are acceptable. Beyond age 80, or when other factors deteriorate the chances for survival, single agents like VM 26, or simple combinations of VP 16 + Prednimustine or VP 16 and Mitoxantrone may be adopted.","['Fiorentino, M V']",['Fiorentino MV'],"['Medical Oncology Dpt, Padua General Hospital.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aging', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Hodgkin Disease/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/diagnosis/mortality/*therapy']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991;5 Suppl 1:79-85.,40,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty patients were treated while they were in resistant or progressive disease states using alternating MOPP/ABVD protocol; 15 patients received ABMT in first relapse; 51 patients had a complete remission (CR) with first-line therapy but later relapsed and then received conventional salvage therapy; 16 achieved no response or progression (""resistant relapse"" patients) and 35 responded partially or completely (""sensitive-relapse"" patients).

A multivariate analysis identified poor performance status and resistant-relapse patients as very important adverse risk factors for survival immediately after ABMT. These results, while validating this procedure for inducing remissions in advanced highly-treated patients, at the same time confirm the need of employing this approach in first relapse or in second complete remission after standard therapy and before ABMT or, in first complete remission in very high risk Hodgkin's disease patients.

Ph1-positive ALL frequently showed biphenotypical or biclonal phenotypes of myeloid and lymphoid lineages. Furthermore, we demonstrated the ability of two Ph1-positive ALL cell lines to differentiate into monocytic lineage in vitro, thus suggesting the possibility that these Ph1-positive ALL cells might reside on the stage of multipotent stem cell along the hematopoietic cell differentiation.

Annual complete blood cell count testing and intensive follow-up of all out-of-normal-range results began in 1985 on a voluntary basis. The program to date has not identified any evidence for an unusual distribution of out-of-range complete blood cell count results. Active employees with out-of-range complete blood cell count values had no increase in adverse health outcomes compared with those with in-range values. Retired employees with out-of-range values were more likely to have a serious underlying medical condition, but this appeared to be more a function of age than of occupational exposure. Four cases of myelodysplastic syndrome were brought to our attention as a result of the program, but there is no similarly followed population available for comparison to determine whether this represents an increase over expected cases. The lack of correlation of out-of-range complete blood cell count results in active employees with serious hematologic disease raises significant questions about the utility of such surveillance for chemically exposed groups (eg, benzene-exposed workers) when exposure levels are low and well controlled.","['Cowles, S R', 'Bennett, J M', 'Ross, C E']","['Cowles SR', 'Bennett JM', 'Ross CE']","['Shell Oil Company, Corporate Medical Department, Houston, Texas 77252-2463.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Occup Med,Journal of occupational medicine. : official publication of the Industrial Medical Association,7502807,['0 (Petroleum)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Blood Cell Count/drug effects', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Male', '*Mass Screening', 'Middle Aged', 'Occupational Diseases/chemically induced/*prevention & control', 'Petroleum/*adverse effects', 'Population Surveillance', 'Risk Factors']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Occup Med. 1991 Jul;33(7):808-12.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Raised against a human monoclonal IgM with rheumatoid factor activity, Lc1 detects a major cross-reactive Id (CRI) present on the H chain of many monoclonal IgM autoantibodies. In contrast to other major autoantibody-CRI investigated to date, we note that the Lc1-CRI is expressed by subpopulation of cells in the germinal centers, as well as in the mantle zones, of secondary human B cell follicles. To examine the molecular basis for Lc1 expression, we used the polymerase chain reaction to isolate the functionally rearranged Ig VH genes of monoclonal Lc1-reactive B cell populations from six unrelated patients with CLL or SLL. Although the neoplastic B cells from most patients with CLL or SLL express the CD5 surface differentiation Ag, the lymphoma cells from one patient with SLL were CD5-negative. We find that the Lc1-reactive cells from each cell population have Ig rearrangements involving a VH gene of the VH4 subgroup. However, the VH4 genes rearranged in different Lc1-reactive tumor populations may originate from at least two disparate germ-line VH4 genes. Also, in contrast to the CD5-positive tumor populations, we find evidence for intraclonal diversity in the functionally rearranged VH4 genes of the CD5-negative SLL. Collectively, this study discerns a degeneracy in the VH4 genes that can encode the Lc1 CRI, indicating the term ""supratypic cross-reactive idiotype"" may best describe the specificity of the Lc1 mAb. Also, this study suggests that expression of CD5 may delineate categories of B cell SLL that differ in their relative rates of constitutive Ig V gene somatic mutation.","['Pratt, L F', 'Szubin, R', 'Carson, D A', 'Kipps, T J']","['Pratt LF', 'Szubin R', 'Carson DA', 'Kipps TJ']","['Sam and Rose Stein Institute for Research on Aging, Department of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0945.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Variable Region)', '0 (Oligonucleotides)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*immunology', 'Autoantibodies/*immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cross Reactions', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Variable Region/genetics', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotides/chemistry', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction']",1991/09/15 00:00,1991/09/15 00:01,['1991/09/15 00:00'],"['1991/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1991 Sep 15;147(6):2041-6.,,"['AG04100/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'AR38475/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA49870/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/M64141', 'GENBANK/M64142', 'GENBANK/M64143', 'GENBANK/S55017', 'GENBANK/S55037', 'GENBANK/S55039', 'GENBANK/S55041', 'GENBANK/S55042', 'GENBANK/S55045', 'GENBANK/S55046']",,,

It reacts with in vitro activated T cells and a small subset of normal resting T cells, but not with resting B cells or any of the 29 established human permanent cell lines tested. Immunohistological analysis of a wide spectrum of human tissues showed that Ber-ACT8 reactivity is restricted to a few T cells in the peripheral blood, the extrafollicular areas of lymph nodes and tonsils, and splenic red pulp. In the gut Ber-ACT8 labelled most intraepithelial T cells and up to 50% of lamina propria T cells. The antibody also immunostained T cells present in the oral and bronchial mucosa. Double labelling on splenic cells, fresh blood lymphocytes, and in vitro activated T cells showed that most Ber-ACT8 positive cells coexpressed CD8. Ber-ACT8 did not react with any of the 14 Hodgkin's lymphomas nor any of the 172 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas tested, with the exception of 10 cases of T cell lymphomas, five of which were located in the jejunum and associated with coeliac disease, and one B cell lymphoma, and most cases of hairy cell leukaemia tested. Parallel immunostainings with Ber-ACT8, anti-TCR-beta (beta F1), and anti-TCR-delta showed that most Ber-ACT8 positive T cells carry the TCR of alpha beta type. Comparison of Ber-ACT8 with HML-1, B-ly7, and LF61 showed essentially the same reactivity and an identical molecular target. The molecular structure recognised seems to be a trimeric molecule with components of 150, 125 and 105 kilodaltons, with the Ber-ACT8 epitope localised on the 150 kilodalton chain. The 150 kilodalton molecule contains an 0-linked carbohydrate moiety of about 10 kilodaltons. Because of its very selective distribution, the trimeric antigen is a powerful reagent for the diagnosis of gut T cell-derived T cell lymphomas and other extranodal T cell lymphomas, as well as hairy cell leukaemia.","['Kruschwitz, M', 'Fritzsche, G', 'Schwarting, R', 'Micklem, K', 'Mason, D Y', 'Falini, B', 'Stein, H']","['Kruschwitz M', 'Fritzsche G', 'Schwarting R', 'Micklem K', 'Mason DY', 'Falini B', 'Stein H']","['Free University Berlin, Klinikum Steglitz, Department of Pathology, Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Mitogens)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Lymphocyte Activation/immunology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitogens/immunology', 'Mucous Membrane/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.44.8.636 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1991 Aug;44(8):636-45. doi: 10.1136/jcp.44.8.636.,,,,,,,PMC496753,,,,,,,,

The remaining three cases could not be sub-classified. A striking finding was that pre-T ALL differed from intrathymic ALL not only in the absence of both E rosettes and intrathymic differentiation antigens, but also in the expression of two non-lineage specific antigens HLA-DR and CD10. Both antigens appear in the bone marrow from the very first stages of lymphoid differentiation, implying that the origin for pre-T ALL is bone marrow. A comparison of the clinical features of pre-T and thymic ALL showed that pre-T ALL disease showed a pattern more similar to non-T ALL disease: a lower incidence of mediastinal mass, absence of extrahaematopoietic disease, lower white cell counts and haemoglobin concentrations, and a higher incidence of bone pain. No obvious difference in response to treatment was apparent.

Three of these sites were shown to be immunodominant T-cell sites in mice in our previous study.

We studied the effects of media with variable concentrations of three metals (Fe2+, Cu2+, Zn2+), a metal chelator (deferoxamine, DFX) and a cell-growth inhibitor (hydroxyurea) on the growth, intracellular metal concentration and activity of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase in murine leukemic lymphocytes (L1210). Intracellular concentrations of Fe and Cu fluctuated within narrow limits in normal media, but decreased to very low concentrations in metal-poor media. The intracellular Zn concentration did not vary appreciably. Growth in intact cells decreased by 50%-70% when normal media were replaced by metal-poor media, but returned to control values when media were supplemented with gradually increasing concentrations of Fe and Cu. Fe and Cu had synergistic effects, while Zn had no stimulatory action. Hydroxyurea and DFX both inhibited cell growth, but only DFX inhibition was reversed by addition of metals. The addition of the above metals and inhibitors to the cell extracts produced effects on ribonucleotide reductase activity similar to those observed on the growth of whole cell preparations (stimulation by Fe and Cu, inhibition by Zn, DFX and hydroxyurea). These findings show that (a) the intracellular metal concentration is maintained in a narrow range during cell growth; (b) ribonucleotide reductase activity varies with cell growth; (c) ribonucleotide reductase activity and cell growth increase with Fe and Cu and decrease with Zn and DFX. Our data suggest that (a) Fe, Cu and Zn may have some effect on the growth and ribonucleotide reductase activity of L1210 cells, that (b) Fe, Cu and Zn may operate in a related and interdependent way and that (c) DFX inhibits cell growth probably through inhibition of the reductase activity and chelation of the Fe of its Fe-containing subunit. We conclude that any study on one of these metals should always include the other two and that manipulation of intracellular metals should be investigated as a potential therapeutic modulator of growth in leukemic lymphocytes.","['Oblender, M', 'Carpentieri, U']","['Oblender M', 'Carpentieri U']","['University of Texas Medical Branch, Department of Pediatrics, Galveston 77550.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,"['0 (Chelating Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'J41CSQ7QDS (Zinc)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Chelating Agents/pharmacology', 'Copper/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Culture Media', 'Intracellular Fluid/metabolism', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Zinc/metabolism/*pharmacology']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01612765 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1991;117(5):444-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01612765.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this initial success, disease recurrence remains a major problem. Relapse from clinically undetectable residual malignant cells is the most likely mechanism of recurrence. Of crucial importance to the clinician is the accurate detection of residual malignant cells prior to clinical relapse. Standard approaches to evaluate for this minimal residual disease (MRD) allow detection only when the malignant clone exceeds 1%. Patients in remission, however, may frequently have residual neoplastic cells that are far below this level. Recently, several investigators have adapted the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect tumor-specific DNA or RNA sequences. This approach is highly sensitive (able to detect 1 malignant cell in 10(6) normal cells). The application of this technique to the study of MRD thus far has been limited to tumors in which specific DNA or RNA sequence data are available. This review describes the application of PCR to the detection of MRD in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and follicular small cleaved cell lymphoma. Because the number of clinical studies and length of follow-up is limited, detection of MRD by PCR is at present largely a research tool and the biological significance of MRD as determined by PCR must await further studies.","['Roth, M S', 'Terry, V H']","['Roth MS', 'Terry VH']","['Division of Hematology and Oncology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor 48105-0650.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Henry Ford Hosp Med J,Henry Ford Hospital medical journal,0122304,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Gene Amplification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/diagnosis/*genetics', '*Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/genetics']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Henry Ford Hosp Med J. 1991;39(2):112-6.,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The molecular basis of CML involves activation of a cellular proto-oncogene--ABL. The consequence is to increase tyrosine kinase activity. This results in a marked clonal increase in the myeloid mass. Later on, cellular maturation is blocked and the decrease eventuates in acute leukemia. Abnormalities of other proto-oncogenes or antioncogenes, like P53, may be involved in leukemia progression. Treatment of CML involves chemotherapy and, more recently, interferon. Whether this treatment prolongs survival or increases the likelihood of cure is unknown but either result seems unlikely.

During 48 hr drug-exposure, the sensitivity of doxorubicin and pirarubicin were potentiated markedly when reserpine was present at the concentration of 1 microgram/ml, which is not toxic to P388 leukemia (P388/S) cells. However, reserpine had little effect on the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and pirarubicin in the sensitive parent cell. Reserpine at 0.5-20 micrograms/ml increased intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin and pirarubicin in the drug-resistant cells. The potentiating action of reserpine was stronger when the cells were preincubated with reserpine within 30 min. Efflux of doxorubicin and pirarubicin was greater in drug-resistant cells compared to sensitive cells. This enhanced efflux of drug resulted in a decrease in the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin in the drug-resistant cells. When the resistant cells were exposed to 2 micrograms/ml of reserpine, this enhanced efflux was blocked. A similar effect of reserpine on doxorubicin was seen with the efflux pattern of pirarubicin. From the measurements of drug uptake and efflux, it seems that like other multiple drug resistance modifiers, reserpine modulates anthracycline resistance by increasing intracellular accumulation of drug.","['Shibata, H', 'Furusawa, S', 'Kawauchi, H', 'Sasaki, K', 'Takayanagi, Y']","['Shibata H', 'Furusawa S', 'Kawauchi H', 'Sasaki K', 'Takayanagi Y']","['Cancer Research Institute, Tohoku College of Pharmacy, Sendai, Japan.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi,Nihon yakurigaku zasshi.

Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) was identified as the cause of ARF in 26 cases, with sepsis (96%) and exposure to nephrotoxic drugs (88%), especially aminoglycosides, being the commonest precipitating factors. Toxic levels of the latter were commonly documented. Patient survival was 45%. Requirement for mechanical ventilation resulted in a universally fatal outcome; age greater than 55 yr and the presence of CNS symptoms or signs were also significantly associated with a poor outcome. Non-ATN causes (urate nephropathy or obstruction) carried a better prognosis. However, only 4 patients (14%) lived for more than 6 months following ARF. Thus, although a subgroup of patients more likely to benefit from treatment can be identified, the overall prognosis is poor and limited by that of the underlying disease. The potential benefit of avoiding nephrotoxic drugs, especially aminoglycosides, in these patients is highlighted by this study.","['Harris, K P', 'Hattersley, J M', 'Feehally, J', 'Walls, J']","['Harris KP', 'Hattersley JM', 'Feehally J', 'Walls J']","['Department of Nephrology, Leicester General Hospital, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,"['0 (Aminoglycosides)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', 'F8VB5M810T (Tetracycline)']",IM,"['Acute Kidney Injury/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Aminoglycosides/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kidney Tubular Necrosis, Acute/complications/etiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors', 'Tetracycline/adverse effects/therapeutic use']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1991.tb00133.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1991 Aug;47(2):119-22. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1991.tb00133.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to the well-established role of class II antigens in low-affinity adhesion provided by interactions between class II and CD4, recent data indicated that class II may also induce adhesion between T and B cells by activating the CD18/CD11a (LFA-1) adhesion pathway. Here we report that monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against HLA-DR (L243, p4.1, HB10a, VI15) and certain broad class II reacting mAb (TU35, TU39), but not anti-DQ (TU22, Leu-10) mAb, induced homotypic aggregation of human class II-positive monocytic (I937) and T leukemic (HUT78) tumor cell lines and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed B-lymphoid cell lines (EBV-LCL). Class II-negative cell lines (U-937 and the EBV-LCL mutant line 616) were not induced to aggregate. An HLA-G-transfected EBV-LCL, 221-AGN, but not the class I-negative parental line, 221, showed homotypic aggregation in response to an HLA-G specific mAb (87G) and a broad reacting class I-specific mAb (IOT2). Both cell lines responded with aggregation to anti-class II mAb (TU35). The anti-class I mAb, W6/32, had no effect on all cell lines tested and two anti-beta 2-microglobulin mAb had variable, weak effects. The aggregation response was an active, temperature-sensitive process which was almost totally abrogated by azide and by cytochalasins B and E, but unaffected by colchicine, EDTA, aphidicolin, actinomycin D and protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (genistein, herbimycin A). Serine/threonine protein kinase inhibitors (staurosporin, H7) partly inhibited the aggregation responses. There was no strict correlation between induction of aggregation and epitope density. FcR were not involved in the aggregation response, since F(ab')2 fragments of anti-DR mAb, L243, were as effective as the whole antibody. The aggregation was not influenced by mAb against accessory molecules previously shown to be involved directly or indirectly in homotypic aggregation [CD11a (LFA-1)/CD18/CD54 (ICAM-1), CD58 (LFA-3)/CD2, BB1/CD28, CD43, and CD44].

Body weights of both rats and mice were reduced in the groups receiving diet containing 8,000 and 16,000 ppm, and feed consumption of rats in the highest treatment groups was approximately two-thirds that of controls. Degeneration of the germinal epithelium in the seminiferous tubules of the testis was observed in male rats that received 16,000 ppm; no other compound-related histopathologic effects were observed in either species. Two-year studies were conducted by feeding diets containing 0, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm nalidixic acid to groups of 50 rats and mice/sex/group. The average daily feed consumption was slightly reduced compared to control groups and resulted in approximate daily doses of 82 or 175 mg nalidixic acid/kg for low dose and high dose rats, and 220 or 475 mg/kg for low dose and high dose mice. Mean body weights of dosed rats and mice were lower than those of controls, except for groups of low dose female rats and male mice. The incidences of preputial gland neoplasms in dosed male rats and of clitoral gland neoplasms in dosed female rats were significantly increased compared to those in controls; responses in low dose groups were similar to those in high dose groups. There were decreased incidences of leukemia and mammary gland neoplasms in dosed female rats and of pituitary gland neoplasms in dosed male rats. Subcutaneous tissue fibrosarcomas were marginally increased in dosed male mice. There were no increased incidences of neoplasms in dosed female mice. Under the conditions of these studies, the dietary administration of nalidixic acid was carcinogenic for rats, causing preputial gland or clitoral gland neoplasms in males and females, respectively.

The patient had an exceptionally high leucocyte count (1,300,000/microliters), most of the cells being morphologically atypical lymphocytes. The computed tomogram of the skull showed a marginal zone infarct with a hypodense focus in the area of the right middle and posterior cerebral arteries, extending from the cortical to subcortical zones almost as far as the posterior horn. This was interpreted as a leukostasis syndrome with cerebral infarction due to rapid progression of the CLL. Significant reduction of leucocyte count with considerable improvement in clinical signs was achieved after three doses of vincristine and prednisone together with one cycle of COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone) therapy.

However, galaptin was not synthesized in vitro by buffy coat cells. Rather, a monomeric beta-galactoside-binding protein of Mr 15.5-16.5K that is immunologically distinct from galaptin was synthesized. This galactoside-binding protein was separable from galaptin by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by anion-exchange chromatography. In contrast, immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that galaptin was synthesized by the B lymphoblastoid cells. cDNA corresponding to the B lymphoblastoid cell mRNA encoding galaptin was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction. The amplified product was partially sequenced, and 299 nucleotides were identified. The derived amino acids corresponded to residues 6-65, 84-114, and 118-126 found to be present in human splenic galaptin.

Previously, it has been shown that a single amino acid substitution, Val-25----Ile in gPr80env, is responsible for the temperature sensitivity, inefficient transport, and processing of gPr80env at the restrictive temperature and the neurovirulence of ts1. Since the neurovirulence of ts1 is associated with inefficient transport and processing of gPr80env and since in other systems involving viral envelope proteins it has been shown that correct folding and oligomerization of envelope monomers are required for efficient transport, we have investigated the ability of gPr80env derived from either wild-type MoMuLV-TB or ts1 to associate into oligomeric complexes. In these experiments, we establish that at both the restrictive and the nonrestrictive temperatures gPr80env molecules derived from MoMuLV-TB associate to form oligomeric complexes and these oligomers are most likely trimers. gPr80env molecules derived from ts1 also oligomerize at both temperatures; however, at the restrictive temperature, most of the molecules within the trimeric complexes remain as gPr80env and are not processed to gp70 and Prp15E. These results indicate that lack of oligomerization of gPr80env is not responsible for the transport defect of ts1. Therefore, by interacting specifically with critical sites within target cells, oligomers of mutant gPr80env rather than ""tangles"" of monomeric viral envelope proteins may be involved in the neurodegenerative disorder produced by ts1.","['Kamps, C A', 'Lin, Y C', 'Wong, P K']","['Kamps CA', 'Lin YC', 'Wong PK']","['University of Texas M.

The ATP-concentration before and after irradiation depends significantly on the glucose supply of the culture medium.","['Ulmer, W']",['Ulmer W'],"['FB Radiologie, Bereich Medizinphysik/Biophysik, St. Marien-Krankenhaus Siegen.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

We used the fluorescent halo technique to measure alterations in the superhelical density and the topological constraints of DNA in LY-R and LY-S nucleoids. The results for untreated cells show that both cell lines reached maximal DNA unwinding at the same concentration of propidium iodide (PI), whereas LY-S nucleoids were less efficient in their ability to rewind their DNA. The loop size did not differ significantly between the cell lines. Incubation of LY-R and LY-S cells with novobiocin at a concentration which does not influence survival (0.1 mM for 45 min), but inhibits DNA synthesis in LY-R cells (by 28%) to a greater extent than in LY-S cells (by 10%), also causes more DNA unwinding in LY-R nucleoids than in LY-S nucleoids. However, a decreased superhelical density was observed in nucleoids from both cell lines. Novobiocin applied before, and present during, irradiation prevents radiation-induced alterations in DNA supercoiling more efficiently in LY-R than in LY-S cells. The presence of novobiocin during the repair period increased DNA rewinding to levels not significantly different from control values in nucleoids from both cell lines.","['Kapiszewska, M', 'Lange, C S']","['Kapiszewska M', 'Lange CS']","['Institute of Molecular Biology, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '17EC19951N (Novobiocin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'DNA Damage/*drug effects', 'DNA Repair/*drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L5178/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Novobiocin/*pharmacology', 'Radiation Tolerance/physiology']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1991 Sep;127(3):285-91.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This gene encodes a helix-loop-helix protein. It has been found to be expressed in normal bone marrow and in leukemic T-cell and erythroleukemia cell lines, but not in normal T cells. Recently, a site-specific deletion, tald, renamed tald1 in this paper, has been detected in a high proportion of pediatric T-ALL, which arose by a site-specific DNA recombination between tal-1 and a new locus termed SIL. In this study we searched for structural rearrangements within tal-1 in a panel of 134 non-selected leukemic patients (including 66 with T-ALL). Only 6% of patients with T-ALL harbored the tald1 deletion. A second specific deletion termed tald2 was observed in another 6% of T-ALL patients; it involves another site within tal-1 plus the same site as tald1 in the SIL locus. Similarly to tald1 deletion, tald2 junctions harbor structural characteristics that are reminiscent of aberrant recombinase activity. Moreover, we report a detailed analysis of the tal-1 gene structure. Transcription analysis and in vitro translation data are consistent with the differential expression of several TAL-1 protein species containing the HLH motif but differing in their amino terminus. Taken together, our data indicate that t(1;14) translocations and both tald deletions disrupt the 5' part of the tal-1 gene, placing its entire coding sequences under the control of the regulatory elements of the TCR-delta gene or the SIL gene, both of which are normally expressed in T-cell lineage.","['Bernard, O', 'Lecointe, N', 'Jonveaux, P', 'Souyri, M', 'Mauchauffe, M', 'Berger, R', 'Larsen, C J', 'Mathieu-Mahul, D']","['Bernard O', 'Lecointe N', 'Jonveaux P', 'Souyri M', 'Mauchauffe M', 'Berger R', 'Larsen CJ', 'Mathieu-Mahul D']","['INSERM U301, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology/ultrastructure', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 1', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Genes, Regulator/genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Structure', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics', 'Protein Biosynthesis/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/genetics', 'Translocation, Genetic/*genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1991 Aug;6(8):1477-88.,,,"['SIL', 'tal-1']",,,,,,,,,"['GENBANK/S53245', 'GENBANK/S53678', 'GENBANK/S53686', 'GENBANK/S53691', 'GENBANK/S53698', 'GENBANK/S74831', 'GENBANK/S74923', 'GENBANK/S74924', 'GENBANK/S74925', 'GENBANK/S74926']",,,

Expression of the 70 kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) was examined simultaneously as an internal control. pRB was found to be absent or expressed at an abnormally low level in 13 of 56 cases. Abnormal expression of pRB was most common in AML (8/32) and CML-BC (4/9), and less common in ALL (1/12). Expression of pRB was not induced in two cases of pRB- AML cultured for 24 h with GM-CSF, indicating that pRB expression could not be induced by increasing the rate of proliferation. The eight cases of AML lacking pRB protein were examined for RB1 mRNA by Northern blot. Two lacked RB1 mRNA and six had a normal-sized mRNA (approximately 4.7 kb), although the amount of RB mRNA was very low in some cases. RB1 gene structure was normal by Southern blot in all eight cases lacking pRB protein which were studied.

Serum ferritin concentration as a nonspecific tumor marker for M1 and M2 myeloid leukemia].,297-304,"Serum ferritin concentration was studied in 136 patients with different types of acute leukemia. Pretreatment serum ferritin concentrations in the immature myeloblastic leukemia (M1 and M2 of the FAB-classification of acute leukemias) was found to be highly increased compared to the more mature types of acute myeloblastic leukemias (M3 to M5) and the acute lymphoblastic leukemias (L1 to L3). Investigation of the intracellular ferritin concentration showed, that the serum ferritin levels paralleled the intracellular ferritin concentration within the leukemic blasts. Within the immature myeloic blasts (M1) the intracellular ferritin concentration was 14-fold increased compared to normal granulocytes. This correlated with the 17-fold increased serum ferritin levels in these patients. Intracellular ferritin concentrations within the leukemic blasts of more mature types of acute leukemia (M3 to M5) were found to be only slightly increased. These data support the concept, that an increased synthesis and release of ferritin by the leukemic blasts is responsible for the increased serum ferritin concentration. This concept is also supported by the observation, that a further increase of serum ferritin concentration was seen during a cytotoxic chemotherapy. It is noteworthy, that this increase was more pronounced in the immature leukemias obviously caused by a loss of intracellular ferritin from the damaged leukemic blasts. The serum ferritin levels followed closely the activity of the disease. Increased pretreatment serum ferritin concentrations normalized completely when patients achieved complete remission. In contrast, in patients with tumor relapse or tumor progression serum ferritin concentrations increased again. These data suggest that the serum ferritin in immature myeloblastic leukemia has the characteristics of a tumor associated marker.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Aulbert, E', 'Fromm, H', 'Hornemann, H']","['Aulbert E', 'Fromm H', 'Hornemann H']","['Evangelisches Waldkrankenhaus Spandau, Akademisches Lehrkrankenhaus, Freien Universitat Berlin.']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Med Klin (Munich),"Medizinische Klinik (Munich, Germany : 1983)",8303501,"['0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",IM,"['Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Ferritins/*blood', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*diagnosis', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/blood/diagnosis']",1991/06/15 00:00,2000/03/22 00:00,['1991/06/15 00:00'],"['1991/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2000/03/22 00:00 [medline]', '1991/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Med Klin (Munich). 1991 Jun 15;86(6):297-304.,,,,"Ferritin bei akuten Leukamien.

The signal intensity of specific transcripts and the amount of protein being secreted increased upon exposure to the phorbol ester PMA.

Patients received mitoxantrone 20-37.5 mg/m2 daily for 2 days or 1 dose of 40-80 mg/m2 and HiDAc 3 g/m2 over 3 h once daily for five doses. All eight of the patients with previously untreated disease and eight of ten patients with ALL in relapse achieved complete remission (CR). The untreated patients included two with Philadelphia positive ALL who also achieved CR (one after one course of mitoxantrone-HiDAc, and one after one course of mitoxantrone-HiDAc followed by one additional dose of vincristine and daily prednisone). Seven of the eight previously untreated patients who achieved CR are still in remission. The one T-cell ALL has relapsed at 2 months after CR. The toxicity was acceptable. The regimen thus induces a remission rate equivalent to that of traditional vincristine-prednisone. The 'quality of remission' may be superior, and this therapy should be explored as a primary induction therapy in patients with ALL.","['Arlin, Z A', 'Feldman, E J', 'Finger, L R', 'Ahmed, T', 'Mittelman, A', 'Cook, P', 'Puccio, C', 'Baskind, P', 'Arnold, P', 'Razis, E D']","['Arlin ZA', 'Feldman EJ', 'Finger LR', 'Ahmed T', 'Mittelman A', 'Cook P', 'Puccio C', 'Baskind P', 'Arnold P', 'Razis ED', 'et al.']","['New York Medical College, Division of Neoplastic Diseases, Valhalla 10595.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Mitoxantrone/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Aug;5(8):712-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Numerous terms are used to refer to cases with unscheduled expression of lineage-foreign proteins; the best defined categories were hybrid acute leukemia and acute mixed-lineage leukemia. The incidence of phenotypically variant acute leukemia varies with the quality and quantity of parameters used and the stringency of the criteria employed for its definition. Considerable interest has focused on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells expressing one or several myeloid lineage-associated antigens (My+ ALL), CD13, CD14, CD15, CD33, and CDw65. Owing to legitimate and cryptic expression on lymphoid cells, CD11b and CD15 reagents may not be considered as specific indicators of myeloid differentiation. The reported incidence ranged from 5 to 46% in 14 studies on My+ ALL, totalling 3817 patients. Several detailed reports documented a higher incidence of My+ ALL in adults (realistically in the range 10-20%) than in children (5-10%) and in B-lineage ALL as opposed to T-lineage ALL. My+ ALL cases are more likely to display unique cytogenetic [t(9;22), 11q23, 14q32] features than My-neg ALL. There appears to be no predominant expression of a single myeloid-associated antigen among those analyzed. As the morphological diagnosis of a leukemia subtype is often imprecise, some T-neg B-neg My+ ALL cases might actually contain FAB AML-M0 populations. While the expression of myeloid-associated antigens has no apparent prognostic significance in the majority of childhood ALL subtypes, in adults myeloid antigens seem to identify a high risk group of ALL patients with a poorer response to standard ALL therapy.","['Drexler, H G', 'Thiel, E', 'Ludwig, W D']","['Drexler HG', 'Thiel E', 'Ludwig WD']","['Department of Human and Animal Cell Cultures, Braunschweig, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Child', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Clone Cells', 'Humans', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*diagnosis/immunology/pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Terminology as Topic']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1991 Aug;5(8):637-45.,86,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We used immuno-cryoultramicrotomy to look for TL on mitochondria in situ, thereby avoiding the plasma membrane contamination that occurs when isolating organelles. Establishing optimal fixation conditions was crucial, as mitochondrial structure was not preserved by the low concentrations of fixative needed for detection of antibody labeling. The plasma membranes of tissue culture and thymus cells were labeled well with anti-TL antibody and protein A-gold conjugate, while mitochondria within the cells were not labeled. Isolation of mitochondria on a one-step Ficoll gradient resulted in a purer organelle preparation than did isolation of mitochondria by centrifugation alone.

The human gp91-phox gene spans approximately 30 kilobases, and is divided into 13 exons. A ubiquitous factor that is indistinguishable from the CCAAT-binding factor CP1 interacts in vitro with the distal gp91-phox promoter CCAAT box motif. CP1 binding is prevented, however, by a CCAAT displacement protein (CDP) that binds to the region surrounding the CCAAT box. CDP DNA-binding activity is found in nuclear extracts prepared from cells in which the endogenous gp91-phox gene is transcriptionally inactive, but is absent or reduced in expressing cells, consistent with CDP functioning as a repressor of gp91-phox transcription. Introduction of gp91-phox promoter/reporter constructs into nonexpressing cells yields significantly less expression than that produced by the parental reporter vector alone. The reduction in expression is relieved when the CDP/CP1-binding site is removed from the gp91-phox promoter, confirming that it is a target for repression. No derepression is observed if the CP1-binding site is selectively mutated.

Our objective was to define this symptom complex and attempt to delineate its etiology. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: A pediatric ICU in a children's oncology hospital. PATIENTS: Children admitted to the ICU over a 24-month period who developed persistent bradycardia (heart rate less than 5% for age for greater than 1 hr) after an episode of sepsis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven children developed postsepsis bradycardia. Six patients had a primary diagnosis of acute myelogenous leukemia and one patient had acute lymphocytic leukemia. All patients had positive blood cultures (Streptococcus mitis, n = 4; Escherichia coli, n = 2; and Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1). All seven children were clinically recovering from sepsis when the bradycardia developed. Neither hypotension nor other symptom was associated with the bradycardia. No therapy was given for the bradycardia. Echocardiograms and ECGs were normal in all patients, except for the presence of bradycardia. Bradycardia persisted for 24 to 72 hrs. After that time, heart rates slowly increased to the normal range for age. CONCLUSIONS: We speculate that this syndrome may result from alterations in beta-adrenergic receptor function or an unidentified humoral factor produced by the invading organism or as part of the host's response to sepsis. Prior drug therapy or the underlying illness may predispose to this condition, since all the patients had acute leukemia. As the bradycardia was clinically insignificant, invasive therapeutic or diagnostic strategies were not indicated.","['Tobias, J D', 'Bozeman, P M', 'Stokes, D C']","['Tobias JD', 'Bozeman PM', 'Stokes DC']","[""Department of Anesthesiology/Critical Care Medicine, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101-0318.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Crit Care Med,Critical care medicine,0355501,,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Bradycardia/diagnosis/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Critical Care/statistics & numerical data', 'Escherichia coli Infections/*complications/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Klebsiella Infections/*complications/therapy', '*Klebsiella pneumoniae', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sepsis/*complications/therapy', 'Streptococcal Infections/*complications/therapy']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00003246-199109000-00013 [doi]'],ppublish,Crit Care Med. 1991 Sep;19(9):1172-6. doi: 10.1097/00003246-199109000-00013.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This so-called growth factor activity has been amply demonstrated by many laboratories assessing thymidine incorporation or cell recovery. Attempts to actually quantitate the fraction of fresh splenic B cells responding to IL-5, by limiting dilution analysis or other means, with few exceptions have yielded disappointingly small numbers--generally between 1 and 5%, or perhaps less. We have recently identified the peritoneal cavity as a reservoir rich in IL-5-responsive B cells. In this report, we provide independent corroboration of this high IL-5 reactivity by means of cell cycle analysis. Low-density peritoneal B cells, more than 90% of which are in G0 and G1 phases, were stimulated with polyclonal activators in the presence of mitotic inhibitors. Frequencies of IL-5-responsive B cells were measured by observing the differences in the proportions of cultured cells entering S and later phases in the presence, compared to the absence, of IL-5. Some 10 to 20% more of the low-density peritoneal B cells from normal mice entered S phase when IL-5 was present with LPS + DXS. A similar IL-5-mediated elevation in the frequency of S phase entry was seen with peritoneal B cells from the autoimmune mouse strain NZB. Furthermore, a measurable fraction of peritoneal B cells from these mice were even capable of responding to IL-5 alone. These IL-5-induced increases could be blocked by anti-IL-5 mAb. About 30% of the BCL1 leukemic B cell line initiated DNA replication when stimulated with IL-5 alone. Hence, IL-5-responsive B cell fractions have been measured for some normal, autoimmune strain and transformed leukemic B cell phenotypes. In addition to quantitating the proportion of IL-5-responsive B cells, these experiments formally demonstrate that IL-5 can act in the G1 phase to increase S phase entry.","['Wetzel, G D']",['Wetzel GD'],"['Basel Institute for Immunology, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,['0 (Interleukin-5)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Autoimmune Diseases/*physiopathology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects/immunology', 'Cell Cycle/*drug effects', 'Interleukin-5/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Peritoneal Cavity/cytology', 'S Phase', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/10/01 00:00,1991/10/01 00:01,['1991/10/01 00:00'],"['1991/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(91)90074-L [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(91)90074-l [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1991 Oct 1;137(1):245-51. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(91)90074-l.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We describe the relationships between the mortality data for cancers of the brain, the lymphatic tissues and leukemia, and the spatial distribution of agricultural pesticide use for 34 drainage basins in Quebec, from 1976-1985. The basins were grouped into three categories (low, intermediate, and high exposure) according to the level of sales of pesticides. For cancers of the lymphatic tissues among women 35 to 64 years of age, a high relative risk (RR) was observed (RR = 1.91, 95% Confidence Interval = 1.14, 3.18) in basins highly exposed to pesticides compared to those with low exposure. Analysis of correlation for this cancer at 34 basins showed significant associations between geographical distributions of the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) and those of numerous variables indicative of pesticide use in agriculture. Agreement between the results for mortality data in this exploratory study and the results from another study on cancer incidence data for 1982-1983, supports the hypothesis of a potential relationship between the use of pesticides in agriculture and cancer of the lymphatic tissues.","['Godon, D', 'LaJoie, P', 'Thouez, J P']","['Godon D', 'LaJoie P', 'Thouez JP']","['Departement de Geographie, Universite de Montreal, Quebec.']",['fre'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Switzerland,Can J Public Health,Canadian journal of public health = Revue canadienne de sante publique,0372714,['0 (Pesticides)'],IM,"['Adult', '*Agriculture', 'Brain Neoplasms/chemically induced/*mortality', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/chemically induced/*mortality', '*Lymphatic Metastasis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pesticides/*adverse effects', 'Quebec/epidemiology', 'Research', 'Risk Factors']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Can J Public Health. 1991 May-Jun;82(3):174-80.,,,,"Mortalite par cancers du cerveau, des tissus lymphatiques et la leucemie selon l'utilisation des pesticides, en agriculture, au Quebec (1976-1985).",,,,,,,,,,,

Between January 1984 and May 1987, 20 evaluable patients with CLL, median age 66 years (range 43-82), classified according to Rai (4 in stage I, 10 in stage II, 4 in stage III, 2 in stage IV) and 10 evaluable patients with NHL low-grade malignancy according to the Working Formulation, Stages III and IV, median age 54 years (range 32-71) were treated using a 6 MeV Linear Accelerator, applying two opposite alternating fields including total body, with a fraction of 15 cGy, 2 fractions weekly (3-day interval) for a total dose of 150 cGy given over 5 weeks. Prednimustine (100 mg/m2, orally, for 5 consecutive days, every 3-4 weeks, for 6-9 courses) was administered 2 months after TBI treatment, as consolidation therapy. By May 1989, a total of 85% hematological responses (defined as normalization of the differential white cell count, of the total blood cell count and of bone marrow infiltration) were obtained after combined treatment in CLL patients; moreover 3 CR (according to the WHO criteria), 75% with splenomegaly reduction and 40% with lymphadenopathy reduction were seen. Ninety percent objective responses (5 CR and 4 PR) were observed in the NHL patients, with 50% having splenomegaly reduction and 67% lymphadenopathy reduction. The median response time in the two groups was, respectively, 14 and 23 months. The overall toxicity (WHO grades 1,2,3,4) after combined treatment was 65% and 70% in the two patient groups. WHO grade III toxicity, completely reversible, was verified in only 16.6% of the cases; all cases, except one, were previously treated. Additionally, 1 toxic death (grade IV thrombocytopenia and leukopenia) was observed in a heavily pretreated patient affected with CLL after TBI alone. Prednimustine regimen was generally well tolerated. The high response rate and acceptable toxicity, confirms the feasibility and the usefulness of TBI in the context of a combined treatment for CLL and low-grade NHL patients. However in order to further reduce the severe toxic side effects, observed in one patient, white blood cells and platelet count should be plotted and monitored carefully, particularly in pretreated patients.","['Roncadin, M', 'Arcicasa, M', 'Bortolus, R', 'Trovo, M G', 'Carbone, A', 'Tirelli, U', 'De Paoli, A', 'Franchin, G', 'Grigoletto, E']","['Roncadin M', 'Arcicasa M', 'Bortolus R', 'Trovo MG', 'Carbone A', 'Tirelli U', 'De Paoli A', 'Franchin G', 'Grigoletto E']","['Department of Radiotherapy, C.R.O., Aviano, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cancer Invest,Cancer investigation,8307154,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Feasibility Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*radiotherapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Prospective Studies', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombocytopenia/etiology', '*Whole-Body Irradiation/adverse effects']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/07357909109084637 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Invest. 1991;9(4):403-7. doi: 10.3109/07357909109084637.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, no inhibitory effects were seen in Ph1-positive leukemic cell lines derived from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia in blast crisis and various types of Ph1-negative leukemia cells, including B-lineage leukemia cells. In a flow cytometry assay of IL-4 receptor (IL-4R), all three Ph1-positive ALL cell lines showed the presence of IL-4R on their cell surfaces, and the IL-4-dependent inhibition on the growth of Ph1-positive ALL cells was abrogated by the addition of either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies against rhIL-4. Other cytokines, including IL-2, IL-3, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (CSF), granulocyte-CSF, and IL-6, showed no inhibitory effects on the growth of Ph1-ALL cells, but tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon (IFN)-alpha, -beta, and -gamma displayed slight inhibitory effects in a high concentration. The growth inhibition induced by rhIL-4 in the Ph1-positive ALL cells was not abrogated by the addition of antibodies against either IFN-gamma or TNF-alpha. Furthermore, these cells showed no significant production of IFN-alpha, -beta, or -gamma or TNF-alpha after exposure to rhIL-4, thus indicating that the growth inhibition of Ph1-positive ALL cells by rhIL-4 is not associated with IL-4-stimulating production of these factors. rhIL-4 caused significant inhibition of the tyrosine kinase activity in these Ph1-positive ALL cells, similar to Herbimycin A, an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase that inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity in these cells.

As compared with an older age population (greater than or equal to 50 years), there were no major differences in presenting features except for an increased proportion of males (2.08 v 1.21; P less than .025) and a higher hemoglobin level (13.47 +/- 2.70 g/dL v 12.84 +/- 2.77 g/dL; P less than .05) in the younger group. Median survival is 12.3 years (expected median from a control group, 31.2 years). Clinical stages, bone marrow patterns, blood lymphocyte counts, and its doubling time are all useful to separate different risk groups of patients.

We have followed by polymerase chain reaction and Northern blot analysis the expression of these ""pre-B-specific"" genes in correlation with the status (rearranged v germline) of Ig gene loci (H, kappa, lambda) in a panel of 32 leukemias pertaining mostly to the B lineage and including a number of ambiguously characterized samples. All cells that had rearranged the H locus only expressed V pre-B and lambda-like transcripts, in agreement with a pre-B status. In this group, some biphenotypic leukemias (mostly My/B) might, in fact, be already engaged in the B lineage. Rearrangement of V kappa or V lambda loci correlated with the disappearance of the pre-B gene products. In a pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line that was induced to mature to the B-cell stage in culture upon kappa gene rearrangement, the mu-pseudolight chain complex was actually replaced by the classical mu-kappa molecule. Finally, V pre-B and lambda-like genes were found expressed in two leukemic cells that had retained all Ig loci in germline configuration. This finding raises the possibility of having an early pro-B progenitor in which V pre-B and lambda-like products associate with a H chain surrogate in a complex that would trigger an early event of B-cell differentiation such as the H locus rearrangements.","['Schiff, C', 'Milili, M', 'Bossy, D', 'Tabilio, A', 'Falzetti, F', 'Gabert, J', 'Mannoni, P', 'Fougereau, M']","['Schiff C', 'Milili M', 'Bossy D', 'Tabilio A', 'Falzetti F', 'Gabert J', 'Mannoni P', 'Fougereau M']","[""Centre d'Immunologie INSERM-CNRS de Marseille-Luminy, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Genetic Markers)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Base Sequence', 'DNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', 'Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Genes, Immunoglobulin/*genetics', 'Genetic Markers/genetics', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/*genetics', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/isolation & purification', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1991/09/15 00:00,1991/09/15 00:01,['1991/09/15 00:00'],"['1991/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84120-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Sep 15;78(6):1516-25.,,,"['&lgr;', 'V Pre-B']",,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro induced differentiation of primarily cultured bone marrow cells from the patients, colony-forming unit granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) and L-CFU colony-forming assays, and karyotype analysis were performed over the treatment course. The very high bone marrow complete remission (CR) rate (94%) suggested that all-trans RA was superior to conventional chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of APL. The leukemic clone was reduced by RA-induced terminal differentiation and loss of proliferation capacity of leukemic cells. Relapse after CR in about 40% of patients was the major reason for the failure of the RA treatment. Patients who relapsed after a chemotherapy-maintained CR could be effectively reinduced to second CR by RA. However, if relapse occurred after a CR maintained by both RA and chemotherapy, the sensitivity of newly emerged leukemic clones to RA was greatly reduced. Therefore, it is suggested that RA should be replaced by conventional chemotherapy as soon as CR is achieved.

Chromatin was fractionated by several methods, including low-salt elution, mononucleosome gel mobility shift using HPLC-purified HMG 17, and cesium chloride-guanidine equilibrium gradient centrifugation of formaldehyde-fixed chromatin. By these latter two methods, chromatin highly enriched for transcriptionally engaged or competent genes was isolated. A significant correlation was noted between postsynthetic modification of histones by methylation and by the slow-turnover form of acetylation. However, there was no enrichment of methylated histones in the transcriptionally competent fraction of chromatin isolated by HMG 17 binding. Moreover, only minor enrichment of methylated histone H3.1 and no enrichment of methylated histones H3.2 and H4 was detected in transcriptionally engaged chromatin isolated by gradient centrifugation. Chromatin soluble in low-salt buffer was found to be significantly enriched in methylated histones, but not in active genes.

The following results could be demonstrated: in several patients with a normal or elevated fiber count at onset, partial and complete remission was characterized by an increase in reticulin in the regenerative hematopoietic tissue. On the other hand, a relapse was most frequently heralded by a reduction of the formerly increased amount of fibers. Because of the inverse relationship between the density of argyrophilic fibers and the amount of fat cells, these findings were observable only by considering the hematopoietic tissue and not the total marrow area, as has been done in previous studies.

By statistical multivariate analyses, the individual plasma proteins and their combined protein patterns were correlated with the diagnoses and it was demonstrated that acute leukaemia cell samples contained significantly different protein patterns compared with the other diagnostic groups and normal controls. By comparison with the white blood cell differential count, in 78 samples of acute leukaemia, it was demonstrated that the protein patterns were significantly correlated with the specific cell types in the samples. In all, the differential counts accounted for about 29% of the variation in protein patterns. Alpha 1-antitrypsin was found significantly correlated with the myeloblasts and myelo-band cells.

We have previously reported that, despite normal to increased numbers of CD16+ large granular lymphocytes, fluorescence-activated-cell-sorted NK cells from CML patients are profoundly defective in NK cell activity and are unable to lyse the CML blast-crisis-derived, NK-sensitive target K562. Since we and others have also previously shown that the defective NK cytotoxicity from CML patients is restorable after 1-4 weeks of incubation with rIL-2, we therefore deemed it important to study the kinetics of IL-2-mediated NK restoration at earlier time intervals (less than 1 week). In the present report, we have demonstrated a significant restoration of NK cell cytotoxicity in CML patients against K562 after 5 days of short-term culture with rIL-2. In addition, recovery of NKCF production and restoration of target-binding capacity to normal levels by NK cells from CML patients were also observed after short-term (less than 1 week) rIL-2 treatment.

Cyclophosphamide (CY) is an available chemo-immunotherapeutic agent. The effects of CY on the cure and dormancy of DL811 leukemias were investigated. Simultaneous injection of DL811 cells and CY into athymic nude mice revealed that DL811 cells were sensitive to CY doses of 0.5 mg and more per mouse in a dose-related manner. A single dose of 1 mg CY on day 7 after DL811 cell inoculation was most curative of disseminated leukemias (cure rate: 50-80%) as compared with other single CY doses at different times. Cured mice were strongly immune to DL811 leukemias. This therapeutic modality had no curative effect in athymic nude mice. Relapses occurred occasionally in CY-cured mice and most relapsed tumors had the same surface phenotype as that of the DL811 leukemia. In comparison with DL811 leukemias, however, relapsed tumors were less sensitive to rejection by cured mice and less frequently cured by a single dose of 1 mg CY on day 7 of inoculation, implying that they changed in antigenicity and drug sensitivity. Whole-body irradiation of 400 rad gamma-rays to cured mice raised the incidence of relapses from 22.9 to 44.7% and that of deaths from relapses from 8.6 to 26.3%. Thus, leukemic cells may survive against host immune surveillance in a dormant state and relapse after changing their immunologic and chemotherapeutic natures.

The immunophenotype of the cultured cells was CD2+, CD3+, CD4+, CD5+, CD8-, DR+ and CD25- (Tac, IL-2 receptor alpha chain). Southern-blot hybridization analysis of T-cell-receptor beta chain DNA demonstrated the same rearrangement in freshly isolated blood cells and cultured cells, indicating that the cell line was derived from the patient's malignant clone. Since cultured T-cells grew in complete medium without added IL-2, we investigated whether HH cells could be producing and responding to IL-2 in an autocrine fashion. However, no IL-2 was detectable in supernatant from the cell line, while antibodies to IL-2, or to the IL-2 receptor alpha or beta chains did not inhibit cell growth. In addition, no mRNA message for IL-2 was detectable in these cells. The results appear to exclude an autocrine IL-2-dependent mechanism of cell growth for this T-cell line. Although cultured HH cells lacked detectable IL-2 receptor alpha chain, they did show increased proliferation to exogenous IL-2. Binding studies with 125I-IL-2 demonstrated an intermediate affinity receptor for IL-2, KD = 1.7 nM, with 6400 binding sites per cell, suggesting the presence of an IL-2 receptor beta chain. Consistent with these findings 125I-IL-2 cross-linking studies demonstrated a single receptor calculated to be 75 kDa. Also, the beta chain of the IL-2 receptor was detected by immunofluorescence using specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs). Nanomolar concentrations of an IL-2-diphtheria toxin fusion protein inhibited cellular protein synthesis, an effect abrogated by native IL-2. These findings indicate that the IL-2 receptor beta-chain was functional.

Since there is no other available probe in this region, pCN2 should prove very useful in studying abnormalities of chromosome 9p in human malignancies.","['Nobori, T', 'Hexdall, L E', 'Carson, D A']","['Nobori T', 'Hexdall LE', 'Carson DA']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Hum Genet,Human genetics,7613873,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9', 'DNA/genetics', 'DNA Probes', '*Genes, ras', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', 'Lymphoma', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Polymorphism, Genetic', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00197163 [doi]'],ppublish,Hum Genet. 1991 Aug;87(4):433-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00197163.,,"['AI24466/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'GM23200/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'T22 TW00011/TW/FIC NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trephines were sectioned transversely to obtain one cylinder for cryostat sectioning and immunostaining and a second for histomorphological evaluation using a plastic-embedding technique. The results obtained by histomorphological and immunohistological evaluation were compared for their contribution to staging and classification. Using both techniques, bone marrow involvement was seen in 3/43 (7.0%) biopsies from patients with Hodgkin's disease and in 193/270 (71.5%) cases with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, including multiple myeloma and acute lymphocytic leukaemia. Immunohistology proved superior in detecting minimal mainly interstitial bone marrow infiltration in 15 leukaemia/lymphoma cases. Biopsies showing infiltration with both methods (n = 157) were re-examined for classification of lymphomatous infiltrates. Whereas immunohistology did not provide additional information in cases with Hodgkin's disease and myeloma, this method was crucial for establishing the definitive diagnosis in a number of cases with acute lymphocytic leukaemia and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. In all of six leukaemia cases, in which no or inadequate material was available for immunophenotyping of cell suspensions, immunohistology clearly defined the subtype. In the 140 cases of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma the majority of cases (76.4%) were identically classified. In some cases, with important prognostic and therapeutic implications, immunohistology alone provided the definitive diagnosis: T-cell lymphoma (n = 2), hairy cell leukaemia (n = 2) and centrocytic non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 3). Bone marrow immunohistology is, therefore, an important supplement for classical lymphoma/leukaemia diagnosis. The differences observed between histomorphology and immunohistology emphasize the importance of lymph node biopsy in lymphoma classification.","['Thaler, J', 'Dietze, O', 'Denz, H', 'Demuth, R', 'Nachbaur, D', 'Stauder, R', 'Huber, H']","['Thaler J', 'Dietze O', 'Denz H', 'Demuth R', 'Nachbaur D', 'Stauder R', 'Huber H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital, Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,['0 (Biomarkers)'],IM,"['Biomarkers', 'Biopsy/methods', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Histological Techniques', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/classification/*pathology']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1991.tb01475.x [doi]'],ppublish,Histopathology. 1991 Jun;18(6):495-504. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1991.tb01475.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two sublines of murine monocytic leukemia P388 cells were used, one parental (Par-P388) and one multidrug resistant (MDR-P388). In cell growth inhibition assays in vitro, the Par-P388 cells showed a normal sensitivity to daunomycin (DAU) while the MDR-P388 cells were 200-fold resistant. In cellular fluorescence assays, DAU retention in MDR-P388 cells reached only 5% of the level achieved in Par-P388 cells. This cell line pair was used to compare the nonimmunosuppressive cyclosporin analog PSC 833 with several resistance-modifying agents (RMAs) for their in vitro chemosensitizing activity and for their restoration of DAU retention. PSC 833 sensitized the MDR-P388 cells 60- and 140-fold when used at 0.1 and 0.3 micrograms/ml (0.08 and 0.25 microM), respectively, a complete restoration of sensitivity being obtained at 1.0 micrograms/ml PSC 833. Similarly as little as 0.1 micrograms/ml (0.08 microM) PSC 833 was sufficient to restore intracellular DAU retention to 60% of the level found in Par-P388 cells, a 3-fold higher concentration restoring virtually the whole DAU retention. For both these activities, PSC 833 was at least one order of magnitude more active than CsA, which was itself an order of magnitude stronger than verapamil, another RMA already used in clinic. Since PSC 833 had no effect on the PAR-P388 cells, neither on chemosensitization nor on drug retention, it is assumed that it acts on the P-glycoprotein, which is highly expressed on the membrane of the MDR-P388 cells, by inhibiting the function of the P-glycoprotein pump and thus restoring a normal ACD-sensitivity of the MDR-P388 cells.","['Boesch, D', 'Muller, K', 'Pourtier-Manzanedo, A', 'Loor, F']","['Boesch D', 'Muller K', 'Pourtier-Manzanedo A', 'Loor F']","['Preclinical Research, Sandoz Pharma Ltd., Basel, Switzerland.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'H0C805XYDE (Quinacrine)', 'ITX08688JL (Quinidine)', 'N3RQ532IUT (Amiodarone)', 'Q7ZP55KF3X (valspodar)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Amiodarone/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cyclosporins/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance/genetics/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Quinacrine/pharmacology', 'Quinidine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(91)90452-Z [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(91)90452-z [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1991 Sep;196(1):26-32. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90452-z.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

TGF-beta 1 inhibited immature M1 cell growth due to a general slowdown of the cell cycle, without arrest at any specific point. Ten nanograms per milliliter TGF-beta 1 completely suppressed phagocytic activity and adhesion to the dish surface and partially inhibited the expression of Fc receptors and vimentin during the differentiation of M1 cells induced by IL-6. IL-6-induced declines in the expression of c-myc mRNA and in the accumulation of G0/G1 cells were also partially blocked by TGF-beta 1. When treated concurrently with IL-6 and TGF-beta 1, approximately 50% of M1 cells were morphologically converted to promonocyte or monocyte-like cells, which did not exhibit the characteristics of mature macrophages. Although pretreatment with TGF-beta 1 also inhibited the IL-6-induced phagocytic activity, this inhibition was reversible. Once TGF-beta 1 was removed from the culture medium after 72 h of incubation with IL-6, the kinetics of differentiation induced by IL-6 were faster in pretreated cells than in nonpretreated cells. TGF-beta 1 appears to inhibit the IL-6 induced conversion of M1 cells at the intermediate stage of monocytic differentiation.","['Michishita, M', 'Hirayoshi, K', 'Tsuru, A', 'Nakamura, N', 'Yoshida, Y', 'Okuma, M', 'Nagata, K']","['Michishita M', 'Hirayoshi K', 'Tsuru A', 'Nakamura N', 'Yoshida Y', 'Okuma M', 'Nagata K']","['Division of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Exp Cell Res,Experimental cell research,0373226,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Transforming Growth Factor beta)', '0 (Vimentin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Cytokines/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-6/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Acute/metabolism/*pathology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/drug effects/pathology/ultrastructure', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc/genetics/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', 'Receptors, Fc/genetics/metabolism', 'Transforming Growth Factor beta/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vimentin/genetics/metabolism']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0014-4827(91)90461-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0014-4827(91)90461-3 [doi]']",ppublish,Exp Cell Res. 1991 Sep;196(1):107-13. doi: 10.1016/0014-4827(91)90461-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therapeutic efficacy of MST-16 was heavily dependent on the treatment schedule: 9 daily oral administrations and treatment every 4 h on day 1 only were much more effective against s.c.-implanted L1210 leukemia than a single dose or five daily administrations giving the same total dose. Orally administered MST-16 showed potent life-prolonging effects (196%, 219% and 148%) in mice inoculated i.p. with P388, L1210 leukemia, and C-26 colon adenocarcinoma, respectively, but had no effect on B16 melanoma inoculated in the same way. MST-16 inhibited more than 80% growth of Lewis lung carcinoma, B16 melanoma, and C-38 colon adenocarcinoma implanted s.c., but had only a minor effect on M5076 fibrosarcoma. Lung metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma was also effectively suppressed. Furthermore, MST-16 significantly inhibited growth of human colon, lung and breast cancers implanted s.c. in nude mice. We also made a kinetic analysis of the in vitro cell-killing effect by ICRF-154, the active form of MST-16 in vivo. It demonstrated a cell cycle phase-specific and time-dependent action, providing a reasonable explanation for the schedule-dependent therapeutic effect of MST-16.","['Narita, T', 'Koide, Y', 'Yaguchi, S', 'Kimura, S', 'Izumisawa, Y', 'Takase, M', 'Inaba, M', 'Tsukagoshi, S']","['Narita T', 'Koide Y', 'Yaguchi S', 'Kimura S', 'Izumisawa Y', 'Takase M', 'Inaba M', 'Tsukagoshi S']","['Research Laboratory, Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Piperazines)', 'R1308VH37P (sobuzoxane)']",IM,"['Administration, Oral', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Availability', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Piperazines/*administration & dosage/pharmacokinetics', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685528 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1991;28(4):235-40. doi: 10.1007/BF00685528.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is known that both agents are immunoaugmentative because of their ability to destroy tumor-induced CD4+ suppressor T cells preferentially.

The parameters of T cell activation measured were the serum levels of soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), soluble CD4 (sCD4) and soluble CD8 (sCD8) molecules and the proportions of T cells expressing the cytotoxicity-linked cytoplasmic serine esterase. All patients studied with active disease had elevated sIL-2R and sCD8 molecules and an elevated proportion of T cells expressing serine esterase. Patients studied in complete remission also had elevated sIL-2R. sCD8 and serine-esterase-positive T cells, but values were lower than those studied in active disease. These patients were all studied in the absence of any ongoing or recent infection or exposure to homologous blood products, either of which could potentially affect these parameters.

Hypogammaglobulinemia is present in about 20% to 70% of patients with CLL.

As of this writing, the rate of infection in the two treatment groups was not significantly different, and no substantial loss of protection against bacterial infection was found in the lower-dose group.

All patients were cytogenetically Ph- at the moment of molecular analysis. Of these 76% were PCR negative, 24% positive for bcr-abl transcripts. 100% of the Cyclosporine A/Methotrexate treated patients (7/7) were negative. Severe chronic GvHD was twice as frequent in PCR positive patients (60%) than in negative ones (31%). The only patient who relapsed during follow up was PCR positive. The two longest survivors were PCR negative. These data are still insufficient for assessing the predictive value of PCR analysis in CML. Patients. 25 patients with Ph+ CML at diagnosis were enrolled in this study. Two died soon after BMT because of infection for failure of engraftment/early relapse, two were Ph chromosome positive and PCR+, and were therefore dismissed from this study. All remaining 21 patients were cytogenetically Ph- at the time of molecular analysis and underwent ABMT from matched donors.

These cells, which express only their adult globin genes, will transcribe the human adult beta gene but not the fetal gamma genes when they are introduced on an intact human chromosome 11 by cell fusion. However, MEL cells stably transfected with the human A gamma gene attached to one of the active elements (HS2) of the beta-globin locus control region (LCR) readily produce gamma-globin mRNA in amounts equivalent to those seen with a comparable beta gene insert. When both beta and gamma genes are attached to HS2, equal amounts of beta A gamma mRNAs are produced, irrespective of the gene order. Furthermore, when HS2 is inserted into the 5' end of a 40-kb cosmid containing the G gamma A gamma-117 delta beta genes in their normal chromosomal organization (but with the Greek HPFH -117 A gamma gene mutation), it directs expression of readily detectable amounts of G gamma A gamma and beta-globin mRNAs in MEL cells. Therefore, under these circumstances we have observed no competition between beta and gamma genes for expression in MEL cells. These findings suggest that MEL cells are capable of perpetuating regulatory information involved in developmental control when it is provided by an intact chromosome, but are incapable of reconstructing such information on transfected DNA.","['Morley, B J', 'Abbott, C A', 'Wood, W G']","['Morley BJ', 'Abbott CA', 'Wood WG']","['MRC Molecular Haematology Unit, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Headington, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'EC 2.4.2.7 (Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase)']",IM,"['Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/genetics', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', 'Fetus', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', '*Transfection']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80372-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Sep 1;78(5):1355-63.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cases represented 6.1% of 410 newly diagnosed ALLs (two treatment protocols) and 16.8% of 95 AMLs (two protocols). T-lineage--associated antigens were identified in 9 of the My+ ALL cases and in 14 of those classified as Ly+ AML; all but 1 of the 19 cases that could be subclassified had an early thymocyte stage of differentiation. The My+ ALL cases had an increased frequency of French-American-British (FAB) L2 morphology (36%); the Ly+ AML cases were characterized by FAB M1 or M2 morphology, low levels of myeloperoxidase reactivity and combined populations of myeloperoxidase-positive large blasts and small blasts generally of hand-mirror morphology. Karyotypic abnormalities included t(9;22)(q34;q11) in three cases of My+ ALL, 11q23 translocations in two cases of My+ ALL, and 14q32 translocations in three My+ ALL and five Ly+ AML cases. Mixed-lineage expression lacked prognostic significance in either ALL or AML; however, the findings indicate that some patients with Ly+ AML may respond to prednisone, vincristine, and L-asparaginase after failing on protocols for myeloid leukemia. At relapse, two My+ ALLs had converted to AML and two Ly+ AMLs to ALL; one case in each group showed complete replacement of the original karyotype. Acute mixed-lineage leukemia does not adequately describe the heterogeneity of the cases identified in this study and should be replaced by a set of more restrictive terms that indicate the unique biologic features of these leukemias.","['Pui, C H', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Head, D R', 'Schell, M J', 'Rivera, G K', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Crist, W M', 'Behm, F G']","['Pui CH', 'Raimondi SC', 'Head DR', 'Schell MJ', 'Rivera GK', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Crist WM', 'Behm FG']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Chromosome Aberrations/diagnosis', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Biphenotypic, Acute/drug therapy/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/genetics/immunology/*pathology', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Analysis']",1991/09/11 19:15,2001/03/28 10:01,['1991/09/11 19:15'],"['1991/09/11 19:15 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1991/09/11 19:15 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80369-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Sep 1;78(5):1327-37.,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,['Blood. 1992 May 15;79(10):2799-800.

Although the survival and growth of WEHI-274.3 cells in vitro is absolutely dependent on the addition of exogenous growth factors such as interleukin-3 (IL-3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or colony-stimulating factor-1, when injected into syngeneic mice the cell line is tumorigenic. Sera from normal mice contain low levels of an activity that sustains survival of WEHI-274.3 but does not stimulate growth. In contrast, sera from mice bearing the WEHI-274.3 leukemia contained levels of CSF-1 and GM-CSF that stimulated the growth of WEHI-274.3 cells. Supernatants of cultures of WEHI-274.3 cells contained an activity that stimulated 3T3 fibroblasts to release an activity that stimulated the growth of the WEHI-274.3 cells. The 3T3-stimulatory activity released by the WEHI-274.3 cells was neutralized completely with an antiserum specific for murine IL-1 alpha, but not with antiserum specific for IL-1 beta. Moreover, WEHI-274.3 cells both in vitro and in vivo contained high levels of IL-1 alpha and IL-1 beta mRNAs. The leukemia-stimulatory activity released by the 3T3 cells was neutralized by an antiserum specific for GM-CSF. We postulate that the IL-1 alpha constitutively released by the WEHI-274.3 cells stimulates the production of GM-CSF from host cells such as fibroblasts or endothelial cells.

Autologous BMT represents a much safer medical procedure available for many patients in need in situations where allogeneic BMT is not feasible or risky. The present experiments were designed to investigate whether it might be possible to combine the therapeutic benefits of autologous BMT with additional immunotherapy after BMT. The tumor model used for investigating GVL effects was the murine B-cell leukemia (BCL1), a spontaneous, nonimmunogenic, highly lethal leukemia of BALB/c origin. BALB/c mice inoculated with 10(3) BCL1 leukemia cells were treated on day-1 with cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg and transplanted with normal syngeneic BM cells on day 0. High-dose recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) (100,000 Cetus units x 3/day intraperitoneally x 5 consecutive days) was initiated on day +1, +7, or +21 after BMT. Kinetics of lymphocyte reconstitution after syngeneic BMT indicated a steep increase in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes on days 17 through 24. All experimental groups were observed for relapse. Mice receiving no rIL-2 therapy relapsed and died within 50 days after BMT, whereas mice receiving rIL-2 showed long-term disease-free survival. Optimal time for administration of rIL-2 was noted at 3 weeks post-BMT, with 90% of the mice surviving with no evidence of disease for more than 1 year. Similarly, when 10(4) BCL1 cells were given 1 day after syngeneic BMT to simulate minimal residual disease after syngeneic BMT, rIL-2 therapy administered at 14 days post-BMT seemed effective in prolonging disease-free survival in contrast to the same regimen given at 1 day after BMT. Our data suggest that immunotherapy with rIL-2 should be further investigated as a new immunotherapeutic tool for decreasing the relapse rate after BMT for hematologic malignancies.","['Ackerstein, A', 'Kedar, E', 'Slavin, S']","['Ackerstein A', 'Kedar E', 'Slavin S']","['Department of Bone Marrow Transplantation Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, B-Cell/mortality/*therapy', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80352-8 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Sep 1;78(5):1212-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CT was 9-day 6-thioguanine, ara-C, and daunorubicin (TAD9) in newly diagnosed AML and sequential high-dose ara-C and mitoxantrone (S-HAM) for relapse. In patients whose bone marrow was free from blasts a continuous intravenous infusion of GM-CSF 250 micrograms/m2/d started on day 4 after CT. Thirty-six patients entered the study and 30 of them did receive GM-CSF. For comparison, a historical control group of 56 patients was used. Complete remission rate was 50% (18 of 36) versus 32% in controls (P = .09), and early death rate was 14% versus 39% (P = .009). Treatment with GM-CSF was not associated with major adverse events. Two patients showed a marked leukemic regrowth that was completely reversible in one patient and appeared to be GM-CSF independent in the other patient.

The CD5 antigen is heterogeneously expressed on cutaneous T-cell lymphoma tumor cells, but is not expressed on normal cells except lymphocytes. A phase I trial was therefore conducted in which 14 patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma progressive on other therapies were treated with up to three cycles of H65-RTA. The maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of H65-RTA was 0.33 mg/kg/d administered intravenously for 10 days as defined by dyspnea at rest at higher doses. Other reversible side effects included myalgia, mild hypoalbuminemia with weight gain, pedal edema, fatigue, fevers, and chills. Six patients received more than one cycle of H65-RTA without increased side effects compared with the first cycle. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that peak serum drug levels were dose-dependent, and ranged from 1.13 to 5.56 micrograms/mL, with a terminal half-life ranging from 1.0 to 2.9 hours. The development of antibodies against the immunoconjugate was associated with a lower peak drug level, but not with enhanced side effects. Partial responses lasting from 3 to 8 months were documented in four patients. Three of the responding patients received more than one cycle of H65-RTA in the presence of anti-immunoconjugate antibodies. The results from this phase I trial suggest that H65-RTA is an active drug in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The immunoconjugate may be safely administered repeatedly, even in the presence of anti-immunoconjugate antibodies, with responses noted. Additional studies at the MTD are needed to define the response rate in this disease.","['LeMaistre, C F', 'Rosen, S', 'Frankel, A', 'Kornfeld, S', 'Saria, E', 'Meneghetti, C', 'Drajesk, J', 'Fishwild, D', 'Scannon, P', 'Byers, V']","['LeMaistre CF', 'Rosen S', 'Frankel A', 'Kornfeld S', 'Saria E', 'Meneghetti C', 'Drajesk J', 'Fishwild D', 'Scannon P', 'Byers V']","['Department of Hematology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article']",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Immunotoxins/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Infusions, Intravenous', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Ricin/adverse effects/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Skin Neoplasms/*therapy']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80347-4 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Sep 1;78(5):1173-82.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A relapse study of the BFM group.,1166-72,"Between April 1985 and March 1987 130 children and adolescents up to 18 years of age with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were registered on the stratified and randomized multicentric trial ALL-REZ BFM 85 designed for patients pretreated with intensive front-line therapies. Stratification criteria were time and site of relapse: bone marrow (BM) relapse on or up to 6 months after stopping front-line therapy (group A), BM relapse beyond 6 months after therapy (group B), and isolated extramedullary relapse at any time (group C). Treatment consisted of alternating courses of polychemotherapy including randomly administered high- or intermediate-dose methotrexate (HDMTX:12 g/m2 as 4-hour infusion; IDMTX: 1 g/m2 as 36-hour infusion). During maintenance therapy the patients received daily oral thioguanine and biweekly intravenous (IV) MTX. The overall second complete remission (CR) rate was 92% (groups A, B, and C: 88%, 92%, and 100%), and the probability of event-free survival (EFS) at 6 years is 0.31 +/- 0.04 (groups A, B, and C: 0.18 +/- 0.05, 0.30 +/- 0.07, and 0.72 +/- 0.11). HDMTX did not prove to be superior to IDMTX, which led to premature stopping of randomization. Risk factor analyses showed early relapse, particularly BM relapse within 18 months, and T-cell phenotype to be independent predictors of poor outcome. The incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapses following BM relapse was 19%, indicating that reprophylaxis to the CNS with IV/intrathecal (IT) MTX was insufficient. For 17 children who received bone marrow transplantation in second CR from HLA-compatible siblings the EFS was 0.53 +/- 0.12 at 5 years. Their outcome was not influenced by the above-mentioned risk factors. With the proposed treatment regimen long-lasting second remissions can be achieved in about one third of patients even after intensive front-line treatment.","['Henze, G', 'Fengler, R', 'Hartmann, R', 'Kornhuber, B', 'Janka-Schaub, G', 'Niethammer, D', 'Riehm, H']","['Henze G', 'Fengler R', 'Hartmann R', 'Kornhuber B', 'Janka-Schaub G', 'Niethammer D', 'Riehm H']","[""Department of Hematology and Oncology, University Children's Hospital, Berlin, Germany.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,['YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Brain Neoplasms/prevention & control', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/radiotherapy/*therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Remission Induction', 'Testicular Neoplasms/prevention & control']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)80346-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Sep 1;78(5):1166-72.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bacteria and fungi were seen in the tissue specimen of the third patient. Patients with hepatosplenic abscesses had significantly prolonged fever after neutrophil recovery but did not differ from patients without abscesses in any other laboratory or clinical features. Due to the absence of specific alerting clinical and laboratory signs and symptoms of hepatosplenic abscesses, routine ultrasound examination is required for detection of this complication.

Combination of acivicin, an inhibitor of de novo biosynthesis, and dipyridamole, a transport inhibitor, provided synergistic cytotoxicity in hepatoma and colon carcinoma cells. 2. AZT, a competitive inhibitor of the salvage enzyme, thymidine kinase, and 5-FU or MTX provided synergistic cytotoxicity in hepatoma 3924A. In human colon carcinoma HT-29 cells AZT and methotrexate yielded synergistic cytotoxicity and thymidine and hypoxanthine together provided protection from the action of these drugs. 3. These observations are significant because in rat hepatoma 3924A and in human cell lines HT-29, HL-60 and K562 thymidine kinase activity was 16- to 67-fold higher than that of dTMP synthase. Therefore, inhibition of dTMP synthase activity alone may provide poor responses because the salvage pathways can circumvent this block. 4. In leukemic patients treated with tiazofurin, an inhibitor of IMP dehydrogenase, the rate-limiting enzyme of GTP biosynthesis, and with allopurinol, which inhibits GPRT activity through raising plasma hypoxanthine levels, synergistic therapeutic results were obtained. The responses in sensitive patients entailed a decrease in IMP dehydrogenase activity and GTP concentration in leukemic cells and down-regulation of the ras and myc oncogenes. The down-regulation of the ras oncogene by tiazofurin through the decrease of GTP concentration has now been shown in K562, HL-60 and hepatoma cells and in patients with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis. Tiazofurin may be useful in studies on selective depression of the expression of the ras oncogene. 5. In 27 consecutive patients 50% responded positively to tiazofurin treatment. From this group, 10 out of 12 patients (83%) with chronic granulocytic leukemia in blast crisis responded to tiazofurin treatment.","['Weber, G', 'Nagai, M', 'Natsumeda, Y', 'Ichikawa, S', 'Nakamura, H', 'Eble, J N', 'Jayaram, H N', 'Zhen, W N', 'Paulik, E', 'Hoffman, R']","['Weber G', 'Nagai M', 'Natsumeda Y', 'Ichikawa S', 'Nakamura H', 'Eble JN', 'Jayaram HN', 'Zhen WN', 'Paulik E', 'Hoffman R', 'et al.']","['Laboratory for Experimental Oncology, Walther Oncology Institute, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46202-5200.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '4B9XT59T7S (Zidovudine)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'ULJ82834RE (tiazofurin)']",IM,"['Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy', 'Pyrimidines/*metabolism', 'Ribavirin/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Thymidine Kinase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Thymidylate Synthase/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Zidovudine/pharmacology/therapeutic use']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(91)90008-a [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1991;31:45-67. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(91)90008-a.,37,['CA-42510/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

These compounds, when administered orally to mice carrying the ADJ/PC6 plasmacytoma, exhibit antitumor selectivities far superior to those of cisplatin or carboplatin (given intraperitoneally). Oral activity comparable to that of intraperitoneal cisplatin and carboplatin has also been demonstrated in a panel of human ovarian tumor xenografts. Platinum (IV) ammine/amine dicarboxylates retain cytotoxicity in cultures of L1210/cisplatin and L1210/tetraplatin acquired resistant cells. This property does not translate into a cisplatin-resistant variant of the ADJ/PC6 tumor, in the example of JM221. This result reflects experience with tetraplatin, a drug currently in phase I study, which is comparably ineffective against an ADJ/PC6/cisplatin variant. It is a moot point whether either L1210 or ADJ/PC6/cisplatin-resistant variants are clinically predictive screening models, since this issue must be determined ultimately by clinical study. We have attempted to resolve this dichotomy through the establishment of human ovarian carcinoma lines, both in vitro and in vivo, where there is evidence that response to platinum coordination complexes in the several models reflects that of the donor patient's tumor to platinum-based clinical therapy. The data herein for platinum (IV) ammine/amine dicarboxylates in these models gives encouragement to the notion that these novel compounds may be of value as oral therapeutic agents, whilst also providing an important lead to the discovery and development of a new generation of platinum drugs possessing broad clinical utility.","['Harrap, K R', 'Kelland, L R', 'Jones, M', 'Goddard, P M', 'Orr, R M', 'Morgan, S E', 'Murrer, B A', 'Abrams, M J', 'Giandomenico, C M', 'Cobbleigh, T']","['Harrap KR', 'Kelland LR', 'Jones M', 'Goddard PM', 'Orr RM', 'Morgan SE', 'Murrer BA', 'Abrams MJ', 'Giandomenico CM', 'Cobbleigh T']","['Drug Development Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,['Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Availability', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cisplatin/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Ovarian Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Plasmacytoma/*drug therapy', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Transplantation, Heterologous']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(91)90007-9 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1991;31:31-43. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(91)90007-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is a relationship that has become apparent between compound potency and both uptake via the reduced-folate carrier and FPGS substrate activity. Rapid cellular uptake and metabolism of polyglutamate forms that are approximately 100-fold more potent as inhibitors of TS can translate a modest TS inhibitor such as ICI D1694 into a very potent inhibitor of cell growth (approximately 500- and approximately 10-fold more potent than CB3717 or ICI 198583, respectively). Polyglutamation may therefore act as an almost essential activation step and ICI D1694 may be highly specific for tumors expressing both the reduced-folate carrier and FPGS. Polyglutamation of folate analogs also leads to drug retention which may play a major role in the pharmacodynamics of TS inhibition by ICI D1694 in vivo. Current studies with 3H-ICI D1694 are aimed at demonstrating metabolism to polyglutamates in tumor cells. The serious toxic limitations of CB3717, i.e., liver and kidney toxicities, are not seen with ICI D1694 reflecting the good water solubility of the drug compared with CB3717. The toxicities observed in mice are however to hematological tissues and are due to its TS inhibitory effects. Thus ICI D1694 may elicit toxicities in man more typical of an antimetabolite than of CB3717. The clinical evaluation of ICI D1694 may further our understanding of the role that metabolism to polyglutamates may have in therapeutic activity.","['Jackman, A L', 'Marsham, P R', 'Moran, R G', 'Kimbell, R', ""O'Connor, B M"", 'Hughes, L R', 'Calvert, A H']","['Jackman AL', 'Marsham PR', 'Moran RG', 'Kimbell R', ""O'Connor BM"", 'Hughes LR', 'Calvert AH']","['Drug Development Section, Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, Surrey, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Adv Enzyme Regul,Advances in enzyme regulation,0044263,"['0 (Benzene Derivatives)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Heterocyclic Compounds)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene Derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Heterocyclic Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0065-2571(91)90006-8 [doi]'],ppublish,Adv Enzyme Regul. 1991;31:13-27. doi: 10.1016/0065-2571(91)90006-8.,51,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although patients received different antibiotic combinations, all had resolutions of their lesions without fatal complications. Patients diagnosed as having cellulitis required a mean of 9.2 days of treatment with intravenous antibiotics, as compared with 17.8 days for those with ecthyma gangrenosum (P less than 0.05 by the Wilcoxon test).

LPS induced a rapid and transient accumulation of the mature 2.2-kb TF mRNA, which was maximal at 2 h. After stimulation, the rate of transcription of the TF gene was increased (3.3 +/- 1.3)fold. In addition, we observed a significant change in TF mRNA stability: at 1 h after LPS stimulation, TF mRNA was stable during a 60-min period and had a half-life of greater than 120 min, whereas at 2 h, the half-life had declined to 25 +/- 5 min.

One of these diseases is chronic myelogenous leukemia, an indolent disease arising in hematopoietic stem cells that is almost always associated with the P210 form of BCR/ABL. Acute lymphocytic leukemia, a more aggressive malignancy, can be associated with both forms of BCR/ABL. While it is virtually certain that BCR/ABL plays a central role in both of these diseases, the features that determine the association of a particular form with a given disease have not been elucidated. We have used the bone marrow reconstitution leukemogenesis model to test the hypothesis that BCR sequences influence the ability of activated ABL to transform different types of hematopoietic cells. Our studies reveal that both P185 and P210 induce a similar spectrum of hematological diseases, including granulocytic, myelomonocytic, and lymphocytic leukemias. Despite the similarity of the disease patterns, animals given P185-infected marrow developed a more aggressive disease after a shorter latent period than those given P210-infected marrow.

To test the appropriate expression and inducibility of chicken globin genes in murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells, an adult chicken beta-globin gene construct was stably transfected. The chicken beta-globin gene was found to be coregulated with the endogenous adult mouse alpha-globin gene following induction of erythroid differentiation of the transfected MEL cells by incubation with either 2% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or 1 mM sodium butyrate (NaB). In contrast, a stably transfected embryonic chicken beta-type globin gene, rho, was downregulated during DMSO-induced MEL cell differentiation. However, incubation with NaB, which induces MEL cell differentiation, or alpha-amino butyrate, which does not induce differentiation of MEL cells, resulted in markedly increased levels of transcription from the stably transfected rho gene. Analysis of histone modification showed that induction of rho gene expression was not correlated with increased bulk histone acetylation. A region of 5'-flanking sequence extending from -569 to -725 bp upstream of the rho gene cap site was found to be required for both downregulation of rho gene expression during DMSO-induced differentiation and upregulation by treatment with NaB or alpha-amino butyrate. These data are support for a novel mechanism by which butyrate compounds can alter cellular gene expression through specific DNA sequences. The results reported here are also evidence that 5'-flanking sequences are involved in the suppression of embryonic globin gene expression in terminally differentiated adult erythroid cells.","['Glauber, J G', 'Wandersee, N J', 'Little, J A', 'Ginder, G D']","['Glauber JG', 'Wandersee NJ', 'Little JA', 'Ginder GD']","['College of Medicine, University of Iowa, Iowa City.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (Butyrates)', '0 (Histones)', '107-92-6 (Butyric Acid)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)']",IM,"['Acetylation', 'Animals', 'Butyrates/*pharmacology', 'Butyric Acid', 'Chick Embryo', 'DNA/drug effects', 'Erythrocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Histones/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.9.4690-4697.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Sep;11(9):4690-7. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.9.4690-4697.1991.,,['R0I DK 29902/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],['&rgr;'],,,,PMC361361,,,,,,,,

Promoter activity is induced 14-fold during terminal differentiation of MEL cells. Three major in vitro binding sites for NF1 (-250 bp), GATA-1 (-212 bp), and a sequence at -165 bp (BB1) have been defined in this region. Site-directed mutagenesis of any one of the three sites resulted in a five- to sixfold up-regulation of promoter activity in uninduced MEL cells, but only three- to fourfold stimulation was observed from the mutant promoters during MEL cell terminal differentiation. This finding suggests that all three sites are required for repressor activity in uninduced MEL cells and that derepression occurs during MEL cell differentiation. BB1 DNA-binding activity decreases during MEL cell differentiation, suggesting a central role for this factor in modulating the effects of the repressor element. The BB1-binding factor also competes with the CCAAT-binding protein for binding the CCAAT motif. The fact that a reduced but significant stimulation of promoter activity during differentiation is observed in the absence of the repressor element raises the possibility that the BB1 factor also down-regulates transcription in undifferentiated MEL cells by displacing binding of CCAAT-binding protein to the proximal CCAAT motif.","['Macleod, K', 'Plumb, M']","['Macleod K', 'Plumb M']","['CRC Beatson Laboratories, Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,"['0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Binding Sites', 'DNA', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/metabolism', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Hematopoiesis/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.11.9.4324-4332.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1991 Sep;11(9):4324-32. doi: 10.1128/mcb.11.9.4324-4332.1991.,,,,,,,PMC361293,,,,,,,,

However, binding of fluoresceinated histamine-albumin conjugates to HL-60 cells was not dissociated by 10(-4) M unlabeled histamine, although this concentration of histamine significantly desensitized conjugate responses. These data suggest that histamine-albumin conjugates not only activate H2 receptors but also bind to HL-60 cells nonspecifically or in an H2 receptor-unrelated manner. Moreover, histamine-induced Ca2+ mobilization was transient, whereas conjugate-induced Ca2+ mobilization was sustained for more than 10 min, as a result of the influx of extracellular Ca2+.

Significantly increased SIRs were observed for cancers of the lung (SIR = 1.32; n = 105) and kidney (SIR = 1.39; n = 66). Among 10-year survivors, significantly elevated risks were seen for cancers of the stomach (SIR = 1.33; n = 58), kidney (SIR = 1.51; n = 37), and brain (SIR = 1.63; n = 30). Only the risk for stomach cancer, however, increased over time (P less than .05) and with increasing activity administered (P = not significant). The risk for malignant lymphoma was significantly below expectation (SIR = 0.53; n = 11). Overall cancer risk did not increase with administered 131I dose or with time since exposure. The absence of any increase in leukemia adds further support to the view that a radiation dose delivered gradually over time is less carcinogenic than the same total dose received over a short time.

Discrimination between hybridized and non-hybridized probes by differential hydrolysis resulted in a three log reduction of the chemiluminescence signal of the non-hybridized probe within 6 min without significant changes in the hybridized probes due to protection of the acridinium ester to hydrolysis by intercalation formation. Chemiluminescence was measured by a two-step-injection method with hydrogen-peroxide and NaOH. About 50 attomols of HIV-1 gag DNA could be detected. Chemiluminescence results, given in relative light units (RLU) of 159 HIV-1-infected patients (range 4013-458319) showed clear discrimination from 64 noninfected control samples (range 838-1477) (cut off 2000 RLU).

Discovery of tubulin-based mechanism of action by analysis of differential cytotoxicity data.",15882-9,"Data generated in the new National Cancer Institute drug evaluation program, which is based on inhibition of cell growth in 60 human tumor cell lines, were used to compare new compounds with agents of known mechanism of action in terms of their differential cytotoxicity. Two marine natural products, halichondrin B and homohalichondrin B, appeared repeatedly when the data base was probed with known antimitotic agents. We confirmed that both compounds were highly cytotoxic (IC50 values for L1210 murine leukemia cells of 0.3 and 1 nM, respectively), with accumulation of cells arrested in mitosis at toxic concentrations, that both inhibited the polymerization of purified tubulin, and that both inhibited microtubule assembly dependent on microtubule-associated proteins. Limited amounts of homohalichondrin B, the less active agent, were available, so only halichondrin B was studied in detail. Halichondrin B did not interfere with colchicine binding to tubulin, but it was a noncompetitive inhibitor of the binding of vinblastine to tubulin (apparent Ki, 5.0 microM). Halichondrin B was therefore compared with other agents which interfere with the binding of vinca alkaloids to tubulin (vinblastine, maytansine, dolastatin 10, phomopsin A, rhizoxin) in terms of its effects on tubulin polymerization, inhibition of GTP hydrolysis, inhibition of nucleotide exchange, and stabilization of tubulin, as well as the quantitative assessment of its effects on vinca alkaloid binding and inhibition of cell growth. Since halichondrin B was originally isolated from the same organism as the phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid, and since it is about 50-fold more effective than okadaic acid as an inhibitor of L1210 cell growth, perturbations of cellular microtubules observed following treatment with okadaic acid should be interpreted cautiously.","['Bai, R L', 'Paull, K D', 'Herald, C L', 'Malspeis, L', 'Pettit, G R', 'Hamel, E']","['Bai RL', 'Paull KD', 'Herald CL', 'Malspeis L', 'Pettit GR', 'Hamel E']","['Laboratory of Molecular Pharmacology, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Depsipeptides)', '0 (Ethers, Cyclic)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (Polymers)', '0 (Tubulin)', '101383-39-5 (homohalichondrin B)', '14083FR882 (Maytansine)', '269R6PFM59 (halichondrin B)', '5V9KLZ54CY (Vinblastine)', '86-01-1 (Guanosine Triphosphate)', 'EI946JT51X (dolastatin 10)', 'SML2Y3J35T (Colchicine)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antineoplastic Agents/metabolism', 'Colchicine/pharmacology', 'Depsipeptides', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Ethers, Cyclic/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Guanosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Hydrolysis', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Macrolides', 'Maytansine/pharmacology', 'Microtubules/drug effects/metabolism', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Oligopeptides/pharmacology', 'Polymers', 'Porifera', 'Tubulin/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Vinblastine/metabolism']",1991/08/25 00:00,1991/08/25 00:01,['1991/08/25 00:00'],"['1991/08/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/25 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(18)98491-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1991 Aug 25;266(24):15882-9.,,"['16049-10-12/PHS HHS/United States', 'CA-44344-01A1-02/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adozelesin, selected from a series of analogs for its superior in vivo antitumor activity and ease of formulation, is highly active when administered i.v. against i.p. - or s.c.- implanted murine tumors, including L1210 leukemia, B16 melanoma, M5076 sarcoma, and colon 38 carcinoma, and produces long-term survivors in mice bearing i.v.-inoculated L1210 and Lewis lung carcinoma. Modest activity is shown against the highly drug-resistant pancreas 02 carcinoma. Adozelesin is also highly effective against human tumor xenografts s.c.-implanted in athymic (nude) mice, including colon CX-1 adenocarcinoma, lung LX-1 tumor, clear cell Caki-1 carcinoma, and ovarian 2780 carcinoma. Its broad spectrum of in vivo activity compares favorably with three widely used antitumor drugs, i.e. cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. Adozelesin appears to be more effective than these drugs in the treatment of very resistant tumors such as s.c.-implanted mouse B16 melanoma, pancreatic 02 carcinoma, and human colon CX-1 and human lung LX-1 tumor xenografts. Based on its high potency and high efficacy against a broad spectrum of experimental tumors, adozelesin was chosen for clinical investigation and development.","['Li, L H', 'Kelly, R C', 'Warpehoski, M A', 'McGovren, J P', 'Gebhard, I', 'DeKoning, T F']","['Li LH', 'Kelly RC', 'Warpehoski MA', 'McGovren JP', 'Gebhard I', 'DeKoning TF']","['Cancer Research, Upjohn Company, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49001.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Benzofurans)', '0 (Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids)', '0 (Cyclohexenes)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Duocarmycins)', '0 (Indoles)', '6N3M4XJR2V (adozelesin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Benzofurans', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Cyclohexanecarboxylic Acids/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclohexenes', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*metabolism', 'Duocarmycins', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Indoles', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/drug therapy']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00175081 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1991 May;9(2):137-48. doi: 10.1007/BF00175081.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AMAPs that were observed to inhibit macromolecular synthesis produced nearly equipotent inhibition of DNA and RNA synthesis. Equivalent inhibition of protein synthesis generally required significantly greater concentrations of AMAP. There is a general correlation between inhibition of polynucleotide synthesis and in vivo antitumor activity. The effects of four clinical candidate AMAPs (crisnatol, 773U82, 502U83, and 7U85) on macromolecular synthesis were further compared with those of actinomycin D, doxorubicin, mitoxantrone, etoposide, amsacrine, and cisplatin in MCF-7 cells. The pattern of AMAP action was most similar to that observed for doxorubicin and mitoxantrone. Finally, the effects of these four AMAPs on the size, specific activity, and rate of incorporation of [3H]-dTTP into DNA of MCF-7 cells synchronized by pretreatment with hydroxyurea was determined. It was found that DNA synthesis was inhibited by AMAPs independent of inhibition of the uptake, phosphorylation, or retention of the metabolic precursors. These results support the theory that antitumor AMAPs interfere with the normal functioning of enzymes, such as topoisomerase II or DNA and RNA polymerases, which interact with DNA.","['Carter, C A', 'Bair, K W']","['Carter CA', 'Bair KW']","['Tumor Biology Section, Burroughs Wellcome Co., Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Invest New Drugs,Investigational new drugs,8309330,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Propylene Glycols)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)""]",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isomerism', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Phosphorylation', 'Propylene Glycols/*pharmacology', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Thymine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00175080 [doi]'],ppublish,Invest New Drugs. 1991 May;9(2):125-36. doi: 10.1007/BF00175080.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

VIP stimulated cytotoxicity against CaCo-2 human colon cancer cells, whereas less effect was seen against K-562 erythroleukemia cells. Depletion of CD16+ natural killer cells almost completely abolished cytotoxicity and subsequent VIP incubation did not change residual activity. In contrast to PHM, which hardly influenced cytotoxicity, secretin was found to be more effective especially against K-562 target cells. These observations suggest a modulating role for the neuropeptide VIP in the cellular immune response against tumour cells, especially from the colon, resulting in increased activity of CD16+ natural killer cells. Secretin, seems to be less potent in modulating cellular cytotoxicity. These findings support the concept that gastrointestinal peptides can play a role in the regulation of cellular cytotoxicity against tumor cells.","['van Tol, E A', 'Verspaget, H W', 'Pena, A S', 'Jansen, J B', 'Aparicio-Pages, M N', 'Lamers, C B']","['van Tol EA', 'Verspaget HW', 'Pena AS', 'Jansen JB', 'Aparicio-Pages MN', 'Lamers CB']","['Department of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital, Leiden, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Immunol Invest,Immunological investigations,8504629,"['0 (Peptide PHI)', '1393-25-5 (Secretin)', '37221-79-7 (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide)']",IM,"['Colonic Neoplasms/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/pathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/drug effects/*immunology', '*Neuroimmunomodulation', 'Peptide PHI/*pharmacology', 'Secretin/*pharmacology', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology', 'Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide/*pharmacology']",1991/06/01 00:00,1991/06/01 00:01,['1991/06/01 00:00'],"['1991/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/08820139109026229 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunol Invest. 1991 Jun;20(3):257-67. doi: 10.3109/08820139109026229.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results suggest that multiple positive- and negative-acting elements were present that influenced amplification activity. The deletion of regions believed to contain positive-acting elements decreased or abolished the amplification stimulatory activity of the most active 1.45-kb fragment, supporting this hypothesis. The construction of composite sequences containing multiple positive elements and lacking negative elements, however, failed to enhance the activity; maximum activity was obtained only with the original intact configuration of elements. Two of two CHO HSAG-1-like elements tested had an activity equivalent to HSAG-1, while one of 24 random CHO genomic fragments tested had an activity as high as HSAG-1. The combination of sequence and structural features needed to affect the frequency of gene amplification may therefore be quite common in the mammalian genome.","['Beitel, L K', 'McArthur, J G', 'Stanners, C P']","['Beitel LK', 'McArthur JG', 'Stanners CP']","['Department of Biochemistry and Cancer Centre, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Gene,Gene,7706761,"['9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI)', 'EC 3.1.21.- (endodeoxyribonuclease XBAI)', 'EC 3.1.21.4 (Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/*genetics', 'Deoxyribonuclease EcoRI/metabolism', 'Deoxyribonucleases, Type II Site-Specific/metabolism', '*Gene Amplification', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Restriction Mapping']",1991/06/30 00:00,1991/06/30 00:01,['1991/06/30 00:00'],"['1991/06/30 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/06/30 00:01 [medline]', '1991/06/30 00:00 [entrez]']","['0378-1119(91)90072-J [pii]', '10.1016/0378-1119(91)90072-j [doi]']",ppublish,Gene. 1991 Jun 30;102(2):149-56. doi: 10.1016/0378-1119(91)90072-j.,,,,,,,,,,,,['GENBANK/X03822'],,,

P388 could be differentiated from P388/ADR on the basis of fluorescence intensity measurements using 3 classes of cationic dyes that are sensitive to membrane potential differences: rhodamine esters, cyanines, and styrylpyridinium dyes. But fluorescence intensity differences were also observed with potential-insensitive dyes: zwitterionic rhodamines and an acridine orange derivative. In all cases, fluorescence intensity differences were caused by impaired dye accumulation, and could be eliminated by treatment of P388/ADR cells with verapamil. Moreover, fluorescence signals from 2 anionic potential-sensitive dyes, merocyanine 540 and a bis-oxonol, were identical in P388 and P388/ADR. None of these dyes could be used to delineate CCRF-CEM, a lymphoblastic leukemia of human origin from the CEM/VM-1 subline that exhibits a markedly atypical drug resistance pattern not based on an enhanced outward transport. But accumulation of both neutral and cationic dyes was impaired in CEM/VLB100, a subline of CCRF-CEM expressing mdr. These studies show that many cationic and neutral fluorescent probes are substrates for the enhanced outward drug transport system associated with P388/ADR cells, and cannot be used to probe membrane-potential differences in cells expressing the mdr phenotype. With several dyes, differences in fluorescence intensity were sufficient so that flow cytometry could be used to delineate P388 from P388/ADR and CCRF-CEM from CEM-VLB100. The latter technique may be useful for identifying malignant cell populations expressing multidrug resistance in patients with neoplastic disease.","['Kessel, D', 'Beck, W T', 'Kukuruga, D', 'Schulz, V']","['Kessel D', 'Beck WT', 'Kukuruga D', 'Schulz V']","['Department of Pharmacology, Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan 48201.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Rhodamines)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Dyes/*metabolism', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Membrane Potentials', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Rhodamines/metabolism']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Sep 1;51(17):4665-70.,,"['CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 23378/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 40570/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Mr 80,000 phosphoprotein that was specifically immunoprecipitated from Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed normal rat kidney cells was found to be identical with purified rat brain PKC that had undergone cell-free autophosphorylation. This is based on comparisons of peptides generated by partial proteolysis with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease by one-dimensional polyacrylamide-sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis and of tryptic peptides by reversed-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. These data are consistent with phosphorylation of PKC in cells having occurred via autophosphorylation. The autophosphorylation of PKC was stimulated by treatment of C3H 10T1/2 cells with the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or sn-1,2-dioctanoylglycerol. Exposure of cells to 100 nM 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 15 min increased the phosphorylation of PKC by 5-fold in the particulate fraction, while treatment with 100 microM dioctanoylglycerol enhanced phosphorylation of PKC only by 2-fold.

The data included cases born and diagnosed in Minnesota since 1969. Matched analyses were conducted using 337 cases and 1336 birth year-matched controls. There was a statistically significant increased odds of ALL for birth to older (greater than 35 years) mothers (odds ratio (OR) = 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.28, 3.58), older fathers (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.14, 2.30), mothers with at least a high school education (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.05, 2.48), and larger intervals (greater than 5 years) between the birth of the proband and the preceding sibling (OR = 1.86, 95% CI = 1.12, 3.09). The increased odds of ALL for birth by Caesarean section approached significance (OR = 1.42, P = 0.06). No overall association was found for: gender, race, paternal education, fetal-loss history, birth order, prenatal care history, pregnancy complications, inducement of labor, multiple birth, gestational age, or birth weight. Age at diagnosis was an important effect modifier of some analyses. For cases diagnosed before age 2 years, there was a 2.7-fold increased odds of ALL if the last pregnancy had resulted in a fetal loss (P = 0.03). For cases diagnosed before age 4 years, birth weight greater than 3800 g was associated with a significant 2.05-fold increased odds of ALL. These data strengthen the hypothesis that prenatal events may play a causative role in childhood ALL, particularly in those cases diagnosed at a younger age.","['Kaye, S A', 'Robison, L L', 'Smithson, W A', 'Gunderson, P', 'King, F L', 'Neglia, J P']","['Kaye SA', 'Robison LL', 'Smithson WA', 'Gunderson P', 'King FL', 'Neglia JP']","['Division of Epidemiology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Abortion, Spontaneous', 'Adolescent', 'Birth Intervals', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Cesarean Section', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Educational Status', 'Female', 'Fetal Macrosomia', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Maternal Age', 'Parity', 'Paternal Age', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy, High-Risk', '*Reproduction', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1991/09/15 00:00,1991/09/15 00:01,['1991/09/15 00:00'],"['1991/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19910915)68:6<1351::aid-cncr2820680627>3.0.co;2-j [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1991 Sep 15;68(6):1351-5. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19910915)68:6<1351::aid-cncr2820680627>3.0.co;2-j.,,"['CA01240/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA09607/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

These two new antigens, termed P145 and P120, according to their molecular weights, were found in a broad range of tumor tissues. Overall, P120 was more restricted in its distribution than P145 because it was absent from many benign tumors and some malignant tumors. Using the MAbs as probes, antigens P145 and P120 were localized to separate nucleolar components. P145 was mainly associated with high molecular weight nucleolar RNPs. Antigen P120 was localized to a novel beaded microfibril found in a nucleolar residue fraction. DNAse and high salt treatment of this fraction provided optimal extraction of the P120 antigen. P145 and P120 differed from other proliferation-associated nuclear/nucleolar antigens identified by autoimmune sera and by other MAbs. In PHA stimulated lymphocytes, both antigens were expressed in early G1 prior to or concurrent with increased RNA Pol I transcription. Microinjection of tumor cells with the P120 MAb inhibited cell proliferation and blocked the appearance of nucleolar pleomorphism that is characteristic of tumor cells. Clinical studies showed that P145 was not detected in normal bone marrow but was expressed in leukemic marrows (AML); the percentage of P145 positive cells correlated with percentage of malignant blasts (Raza et al., Am.

Quantitative data have been reported for these cell types in health and comparisons have been made with those in disease states. In monocytes, and in macrophages developing from them, subtle ultrastructural differences have been detected and quantitated in malignant lymphoma; as the mononuclear phagocytes were not themselves neoplastic, the changes may have related to defects in host defence. Change in the ultrastructural characteristics of leukaemic monoblasts have also been reported. Lymphocytes and malignant lymphoid cells have been extensively investigated: differences between different types and subsets have been shown to be present in both normal lymphocytes and their malignant counterparts in leukemias and lymphomas. Particular attention has been paid to morphometric assessment of nuclear shape and size in these disorders and to its possible value as a diagnostic tool. Granulocytes have so far been the subject of few morphometric studies, although in hypereosinophilic syndrome, cellular changes have been defined and have thrown light on the abnormal pattern of degranulation. There have also been scattered reports on the cells of acute myelogenous leukaemia. The use of computers and sophisticated statistical packages has greatly facilitated the application of multiple comparison procedures and has permitted discriminant analysis to be carried out where appropriate. This review shows that ultrastructural morphometry of leucocytes will have an increasing application in clinical pathology.","['Sokol, R J', 'Hudson, G', 'Wales, J', 'James, N T']","['Sokol RJ', 'Hudson G', 'Wales J', 'James NT']","['Department of Haematology, University of Sheffield, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Electron Microsc Rev,Electron microscopy reviews,8809169,,IM,"['Granulocytes/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Leukocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Lymphoma/ultrastructure', 'Macrophages/ultrastructure', 'Monocytes/ultrastructure']",1991/01/01 00:00,1991/01/01 00:01,['1991/01/01 00:00'],"['1991/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0892-0354(91)90020-d [doi]'],ppublish,Electron Microsc Rev. 1991;4(1):179-95. doi: 10.1016/0892-0354(91)90020-d.,152,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HL-60 clones selected for eosinophil differentiation produced eosinophil peroxidase, as judged by staining of cells for cyanide-resistant peroxidase activity; however, these cells lost their ability to produce eosinophil peroxidase in long-term culture. In contrast, eosinophil precursors from human umbilical cord blood mononuclear cells stimulated with murine EL-4 conditioned medium (EL-4 CM) were regularly induced to eosinophil protein synthesis, including eosinophil peroxidase, major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, as assessed by cyanide-resistant peroxidase and immunofluorescence staining. This induction by EL-4 CM is either at the level of gene transcription or mRNA stabilization, as shown by the increase of total mRNA for eosinophil peroxidase, major basic protein, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin by Northern blot analyses. Purified peripheral blood eosinophils incubated for 4 days with EL-4 CM had increased survival over control eosinophils. Moreover, this enhanced survival was specifically blocked by antiserum to interleukin 5.

Occasional undesirable clinical effects include eosinophilia, an increase in blasts, or thrombocytopenia. Here, we describe four patients who were treated with GM-CSF, at subcutaneous doses significantly lower than are conventional, and experienced an unusual response pattern. Three patients had severe pancytopenia associated with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and exhibited an unexpected switch in the responsive lineage on high- versus very low-dose therapy. The two CLL patients developed marked eosinophilia (up to 10.0 x 10(9) cells/l) without an increase in neutrophils on 125-300 micrograms/m2/d of GM-CSF. In contrast, when the dose was lowered to 10 micrograms/m2/d, the neutrophils rose to physiological levels, without significant eosinophilia. The MDS patient showed a rapid rise in peripheral blasts (baseline level = 0; post-therapy level = 5.0 x 10(9)/l), without a change in other cell types, when receiving 60 micrograms/m2/d of GM-CSF. After GM-CSF was held, blasts returned to baseline levels; reinstituting therapy at the very low dose of 6 micrograms/m2/d was followed by an increase in platelet counts from 50 to 185 x 10(9)/l with only a minor increase in blasts. The fourth patient, who suffered from severe aplastic anaemia complicated by recurrent gastrointestinal haemorrhage, was only treated with the low-dose regimen. He showed a predominant platelet effect with counts rising from 9 to 169 x 10(9)/l. Very low-dose GM-CSF therapy was devoid of constitutional side effects. The biological implications of these GM-CSF responses are discussed. Our results indicate that, in some patients, GM-CSF may stimulate different target cells depending on the dose. Therefore, in contrast to the results of administration of many classical drugs, there may not always be a direct relationship between the amount of GM-CSF given and the optimal effect.","['Kurzrock, R', 'Talpaz, M', 'Gomez, J A', 'Estey, E H', ""O'Brien, S"", 'Hirsch-Ginsberg, C', 'Koller, C', 'Freireich, E J', 'Gutterman, J U']","['Kurzrock R', 'Talpaz M', 'Gomez JA', 'Estey EH', ""O'Brien S"", 'Hirsch-Ginsberg C', 'Koller C', 'Freireich EJ', 'Gutterman JU']","['Department of Clinical Immunology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '83869-56-1 (Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/therapy', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Eosinophils', 'Female', 'Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/therapy', 'Neutrophils', 'Pancytopenia/*therapy', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy', 'Recombinant Proteins/therapeutic use']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04448.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1991 Jul;78(3):352-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1991.tb04448.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to achieve complete protection, a drug to antibody molar ratio of 1.5:1 was required. The neutralizing effect was specific for mitozantrone, as NO-1 antibody offered no protection of the MOLT4 cell line to the cytotoxic effects of the anthracycline drug daunorubicin when used at a near identical molar ratio.

In electroporated L1210 cells, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 causes Ca2+ release, owing to its conversion into Ins(1,4,5)P3, but this does not happen in cells permeabilized by digitonin treatment [Cullen, Irvine, Drobak & Dawson (1989) Biochem. J. 259, 931-933]. 2. If the assay medium is subjected to electroporation by using a commercially available electroporation apparatus and then the cells are added and permeabilized with digitonin, the cells behave as if they had been electroporated. 3. Electroporation causes the release of high concentrations of Al3+ into the experimental medium, and addition of these concentrations of Al3+ into the experimental medium mimics the effect of electroporation on the conversion of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 into Ins(1,4,5)P3. 4. It is concluded that the difference between electroporated and digitonin-permeabilized L1210 cells in this experimental system can be attributed to dissolution of Al3+ from the electroporation cuvette. Al3+ contamination may thus be a serious problem when using this apparatus.","['Loomis-Husselbee, J W', 'Cullen, P J', 'Irvine, R F', 'Dawson, A P']","['Loomis-Husselbee JW', 'Cullen PJ', 'Irvine RF', 'Dawson AP']","['School of Biological Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,"['0 (Cations)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '102850-29-3 (inositol-1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",IM,"['Aluminum/chemistry/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cations', 'Cell Membrane Permeability', 'Electricity', '*Electrodes', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate/*metabolism', 'Inositol Phosphates/*metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Mice', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/08/01 00:00,1991/08/01 00:01,['1991/08/01 00:00'],"['1991/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2770883 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1991 Aug 1;277 ( Pt 3):883-5. doi: 10.1042/bj2770883.,,,,,,,PMC1151327,,,,,,,,

The antibodies are of the IgM class and react with the patient's autologous cells, the B-lymphoblastoid cell line producing the antibody, normal T and B lymphocytes, B cells from chronic lymphatic leukemia patients (CLL cells), and the autoantibody-sensitive cell line K562. Screening of the monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against panels of normal T and B cells and CLL cells demonstrated that different reactivity profiles could be generated at different dilutions of the mAb. These profiles were identical to those seen with autoantibodies from different renal patients and this suggests that these profiles do not imply different antibody specificities but differing target cell sensitivity. Reactivity profiles seen in the fluorescence binding assays suggest that the target cell sensitivity is dictated not by antigen density alone but also by antibody/antigen affinity. The results from studies of enzyme treatment of target cells and lectin inhibition of the molecular specificity suggest that the autoantibodies are polyreactive, capable of binding sialic acid-dependent epitopes and other negatively-charged cell surface molecules.","['Taylor, C J', 'Ting, A', 'Morris, P J']","['Taylor CJ', 'Ting A', 'Morris PJ']","['Nuffield Department of Surgery, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Tissue Antigens,Tissue antigens,0331072,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Autoantibodies)', '0 (Autoantigens)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Autoantibodies/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Autoantigens/immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Kidney Failure, Chronic/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Subsets/immunology', 'Mice', '*Renal Dialysis']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1399-0039.1991.tb01855.x [doi]'],ppublish,Tissue Antigens. 1991 Mar;37(3):112-20. doi: 10.1111/j.1399-0039.1991.tb01855.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mechanisms governing the release of transferrin receptor by cells are poorly understood and could be better defined by tissue culture. The present investigation was undertaken to characterize the transferrin receptor released by K562 erythroleukemic cells. In contrast with maturing sheep reticulocytes, which have been shown to release transferrin receptor in small vesicles termed exosomes, we demonstrated, with a monoclonal enzyme-linked immunoassay, that less than 30% of the transferrin receptor released by K562 cells in log phase growth was in a particulate form. The relative amounts of soluble and particulate receptor released to the supernatant did not change significantly during 48 hr of incubation. Soluble receptor was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. On polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, its mobility was the same (85 kDa) as that of the truncated monomeric form recently identified in human serum. Further evidence that serum and soluble receptors released by K562 cells are identical was provided by amino acid sequence analysis, which demonstrated that 16 of the first 19 residues of the N-terminal sequence of soluble K562 receptor are homologous with the serum receptor. The remaining three were not identifiable. K562 cells provide a useful in vitro model for studying the production of membrane-bound and soluble forms of released transferrin receptor.","['Baynes, R D', 'Shih, Y J', 'Hudson, B G', 'Cook, J D']","['Baynes RD', 'Shih YJ', 'Hudson BG', 'Cook JD']","['Department of Medicine, Kansas University Medical Center, Kansas City 66103.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Soc Exp Biol Med,"Proceedings of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine.

The binding results obtained in vitro are therefore in agreement with the nonreciprocal function of Rev and Rex in vivo. Rex binds specifically to both RRE and RXRE and activates expression in both HIV-1 and HTLV-I, while Rev binds to RRE and activates only HIV-1. Binding of Rex to RRE deletion mutants previously shown to lack either the Rev-responsive or the Rex-responsive portion suggested preferential binding of Rex to a distinct target within the RRE.

It now appears that many of the genes associated with animal tumors are located near specific translocations in human cancers. The specificity of chromosomal changes have not only been used diagnostically and prognostically, but also they present key information for the molecular analysis in determining the nature of the genes of human neoplasia. In recent years, great advances have been made in our understanding of the molecular structure of the specific chromosomal translocations in certain hematologic disorders. The present report will briefly describe chromosomal rearrangements and how oncogenes or cancer related genes involved can be affected.","['Yoshida, M C']",['Yoshida MC'],"['Chromosome Research Unit, Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University, Sapporo.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,,IM,"['*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1991 May;32(5):447-52.,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We were interested in testing whether SNV could also infect primate cells. For these experiments, we used HeLa and COS-7 cells. Initially, we determined whether the SNV long terminal repeat promoter was functional in HeLa and COS-7 cells. In transient transfection assays, the SNV promoter efficiently directed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene expression in both HeLa and COS-7 cells. Using SNV- and murine leukemia virus-derived retroviral vectors containing the neomycin phosphotransferase gene, we found that SNV established a provirus in HeLa and COS-7 cells as efficiently as did an amphotropic murine leukemia virus, as judged by the number of G418-resistant HeLa and COS-7 cell colonies obtained after infection and selection. Although SNV formed a provirus in both HeLa and COS-7 cells, productive infection of these cells was not obtained with use of replication-competent SNV. These results suggest that SNV can infect, form a provirus, and stably express a transduced gene in primate cells, but there is a posttranscriptional block to its replication in these cells.","['Koo, H M', 'Brown, A M', 'Ron, Y', 'Dougherty, J P']","['Koo HM', 'Brown AM', 'Ron Y', 'Dougherty JP']","['Department of Molecular Genetics and Microbiology, Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey Rutgers, Piscataway 08854-5635.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,"['0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Birds/microbiology', 'Blotting, Northern', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorocebus aethiops', 'DNA, Viral/analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Genetic Vectors', 'HeLa Cells/microbiology', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Retroviridae/genetics/*growth & development', 'Transfection', 'Virus Replication']",1991/09/01 00:00,1991/09/01 00:01,['1991/09/01 00:00'],"['1991/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.65.9.4769-4776.1991 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1991 Sep;65(9):4769-76. doi: 10.1128/JVI.65.9.4769-4776.1991.,,"['CA16599/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA50777/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,PMC248934,,,,,,,,

We have previously described the isolation of retroviral mutants with host range properties expanded to embryonal cell lines. One of these mutants, the murine embryonic stem cell virus (MESV), is expressed in ES cell lines. Expression of MESV in these cells relies on DNA sequence motifs within the enhancer region of the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). Here we show that replacement of the Mo-MuLV enhancer region by sequences derived from the MESV LTR results in the activation of the Mo-MuLV LTR in ES cells. The enhancer regions of MESV and Mo-MuLV differ by seven point mutations. Of these, a single point mutation at position -166 is sufficient to activate the Mo-MuLV LTR and to confer enhancer-dependent expression to Mo-MuLV-derived retroviral vectors in ES cells. This point mutation creates a recognition site for a sequence-specific DNA-binding factor present in nuclear extracts of ES cells.

The records of 22 patients with BL from our institution and of 148 cases of BL and ALL3 reported in the literature with karyotypes were evaluated for clinical and cytological features. Overall survival was only 28 per cent and 88 per cent of deaths occurred within the first nine months after diagnosis. Those who survived at least 18 months were unlikely to relapse. Age and gender did not significantly affect survival. Patients presenting with advanced Ann Arbor stage, bone marrow or CSF involvement had lower survival rates. The association of translocations involving chromosome band 8q24 with this disease is confirmed. Sixty-two per cent of karyotypes had t(8;14)(q24;q32) translocations; the recognized variant translocations t(8;22)(q24;q11) and t(2;8)(p12;q24) affected 12 per cent and 9 per cent respectively. Seventeen per cent had abnormal karyotypes but no classic translocation. Patients with variant translocations had the poorest survival rates, and those with the classic t(8;14)(q24;q32) did the best. Despite a small sample size, the variant translocation t(8;22)(q24;q11) appeared to occur at an increased frequency in the patients with AIDS. In the entire group, recurrent involvement of chromosome regions 1q2, 6q11-14 and 17p1 suggests that alteration of genes at these loci, B Cell Growth Factor (BCGF) at 1q2 and p53 on 17p, may contribute to the development and progression of this tumour. Similarly, the frequent trisomies of chromosomes 7, 8, 12 and 18 may indicate an effect on tumour cell growth due to increased gene dosage. Trisomy 12 was found in eight tumours, five from patients with AIDS, suggesting that chromosome 12 has a site or gene whose allelic dosage is selected for in AIDS related lymphoma cells. Cytogenetic studies of adult Burkitt lymphoma and leukemia suggest several likely loci for gene alterations that in conjunction with myc translocations can lead to tumorigenesis.","['Kornblau, S M', 'Goodacre, A', 'Cabanillas, F']","['Kornblau SM', 'Goodacre A', 'Cabanillas F']","['Department of Medical Oncology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/complications', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/*genetics', 'Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', 'Survival Analysis', 'Translocation, Genetic']",1991/03/01 00:00,1991/03/01 00:01,['1991/03/01 00:00'],"['1991/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900090202 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1991 Mar-Apr;9(2):63-78. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900090202.,80,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among the 36 sMDS patients, 13 (36%) had only normal karyotypes whereas 23 (64%) displayed clonal chromosomal abnormalities. The most common aberrations were -7, 5q-, -5, and +8. In 10 patients (43% of the cytogenetically aberrant cases), clones with only one anomaly, mostly 5q- or -7, were found. Of the 40 sANLL patients, normal karyotypes were detected in 10 (25%). Among the 30 (75%) abnormal cases, the most frequent aberrations were -7, -5, +8, 7q-, -17, and +21. 12 patients (40%) had clones with single abnormalities, most often -7. In 4 sANLL patients cytogenetically unrelated clones were detected. A survey of all previously published secondary hematologic neoplasias reveals that the most frequent abnormalities in sMDS are -7 (41%), 5q- (28%), and -5 (11%), followed by der(21q), +8, 7q-, der(12p), t(1;7), -12, -17, der(17p), der(3p), der(6p), and -18. Clones with single aberrations have been found in 45% of the cases and cytogenetically unrelated clones have been described in 6%. The most common abnormalities in sANLL are -7 (38%), 5q- (17%), -5 (15%), +8 (13%), and -17 (11%), followed by der(3q), der(11q), der(12p), -21, 7q-, -18, der(3p), der(17p), +21, der(21q), der(6p), and -16. 38% of the sANLL patients have had clones with only one aberration and 3% have had unrelated clones. The frequencies of these nonrandom abnormalities in sMDS and sANLL are thus remarkably similar - the only exception appears to be 5q-, which is more common in sMDS. Also the mean number of abnormalities per case is similar - 5.3 in sMDS and 5.6 in sANLL. When the incidences of characteristic cytogenetic abnormalities were correlated with the type of previous therapy, -7 was found to be more frequent in sMDS and sANLL patients who had been exposed to chemotherapy whereas 5q- was associated with previous exposure to ionizing radiation in sMDS patients.","['Johansson, B', 'Mertens, F', 'Heim, S', 'Kristoffersson, U', 'Mitelman, F']","['Johansson B', 'Mertens F', 'Heim S', 'Kristoffersson U', 'Mitelman F']","['Department of Clinical Genetics, University Hospital, Lund, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/complications/*genetics', 'Neoplasms/complications/drug therapy/radiotherapy']",1991/07/01 00:00,1991/07/01 00:01,['1991/07/01 00:00'],"['1991/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1991.tb00556.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1991 Jul;47(1):17-27. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1991.tb00556.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among solid tumor cells, we found an inverse correlation between surface electronegativity, affinity for dye molecules, and susceptibility to MC 540-sensitized photoinactivation.

In older children the concentration is stable (reference interval 20-92 micrograms/L). We also investigated the possibility that PICP in CSF could reflect local fibroproliferative changes in the arachnoid in a cohort of 42 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who were monitored by repeated sampling in connection with intrathecal therapy. Initially, there was no difference in PICP between the children with newly diagnosed leukemia and the controls. PICP concentrations were significantly higher (P less than 0.01) during intrathecal methotrexate therapy, with median values above the reference interval. Continuous corticosteroid treatment was associated with a significant decrease in PICP (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.01, respectively, in two groups treated according to different protocols), close to the lower limit of the reference interval.

However, the physiological function of the endogenous p53 gene product has been difficult to ascertain. In order to examine whether p53 is involved in the regulation of proliferation and/or differentiation of hematopoietic tissue, we modified a recently developed flow cytometric assay to assess p53 protein expression in normal human hematopoietic cells, primary leukemias, and selected leukemia cell lines. In normal human bone marrow, p53 protein was not detected in the proliferative, progenitor cell populations identified by the cell surface antigens CD34 (progenitor cells of multiple lineages) or glycophorin (erythroid precursors). In contrast, low but detectable levels of p53 protein were observed in the nonproliferative, mature lymphoid, granulocytic, and monocytic cell populations. Similarly, p53 levels increased and DNA synthesis decreased during 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced differentiation of ML-1 myeloblastic leukemia cells. Both of these results suggest that endogenous, wild-type p53 protein may play a role in hematopoietic cell maturation, possibly by contributing to the inhibition of proliferation that occurs during terminal differentiation. Leukemia cells deviated from this pattern of expression: (a) in contrast to the normal, proliferative bone marrow progenitor cells, a significant percentage of patient leukemia samples expressed detectable levels of p53 protein; and (b) leukemia cell lines exhibited lineage-specific abnormalities in p53 expression, with overexpression in lymphoid cell lines and lack of expression in myeloid cell lines.","['Kastan, M B', 'Radin, A I', 'Kuerbitz, S J', 'Onyekwere, O', 'Wolkow, C A', 'Civin, C I', 'Stone, K D', 'Woo, T', 'Ravindranath, Y', 'Craig, R W']","['Kastan MB', 'Radin AI', 'Kuerbitz SJ', 'Onyekwere O', 'Wolkow CA', 'Civin CI', 'Stone KD', 'Woo T', 'Ravindranath Y', 'Craig RW']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Oligopeptides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Suppressor Protein p53)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', '*Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/pathology', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligopeptides/chemical synthesis/immunology', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Suppressor Protein p53/analysis/*genetics']",1991/08/15 00:00,1991/08/15 00:01,['1991/08/15 00:00'],"['1991/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Aug 15;51(16):4279-86.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The levels of PKC activities in the cytosol and particulate fractions from AML cells were higher than those from ALL or CLL cells. The average PKC activities of AML cells, ALL cells, and CLL cells were 18.7, 12.2, and 11.3 pmol/min/10(8) cells, respectively, in the cytosol fractions and 4.4, 3.1, and 2.6 pmol/min/10(8) cells, respectively, in their particulate fractions. M1 cells (French-American-British classification) and AML cells with T-lymphocyte-associated surface antigens, such as CD2 and CD7, had significantly lower PKC activities among AML cells. Immunoblot analyses using monoclonal antibodies against each isozyme revealed that all three isozymes were broadly distributed on leukemic cells with considerable variability in the level of expression. All lymphoid leukemic cells expressed PKC-gamma in the cytosol fractions, albeit a minor component; however, this type was observed in cells from only half the number of AML patients. Those AML cells with cytosolic PKC-gamma usually expressed lymphoid surface antigens, such as CD2, CD7, and CD19. On the other hand, cytosolic PKC-beta and PKC-alpha were commonly observed in all types of leukemic cells. AML cells expressed these two types at almost equal levels, but in lymphoid cells, expressions of PKC-beta were usually more abundant than those of PKC-alpha. These data suggest that AML cells with lymphoid antigens might have a lower PKC activity but more predominant expression of cytosolic PKC-gamma than the usual AML cells.","['Komada, F', 'Nishikawa, M', 'Uemura, Y', 'Morita, K', 'Hidaka, H', 'Shirakawa, S']","['Komada F', 'Nishikawa M', 'Uemura Y', 'Morita K', 'Hidaka H', 'Shirakawa S']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Cytosol/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Immunophenotyping', 'Isoenzymes/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/enzymology', 'Protein Kinase C/isolation & purification/*metabolism']",1991/08/15 00:00,1991/08/15 00:01,['1991/08/15 00:00'],"['1991/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Aug 15;51(16):4271-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

N-Isopropyl-p-formylbenzamide, a major metabolite of procarbazine, was found to be an excellent substrate (Km = 0.84 microM) for at least one of these enzymes, namely, mouse aldehyde dehydrogenase-2. The Km for mouse aldehyde dehydrogenase-2-catalyzed detoxification of aldophosphamide is 16 microM. Thus, competition between N-isopropyl-p-formylbenzamide and aldophosphamide for the catalytic site on the enzyme should strongly favor the former, and the rate at which aldophosphamide is detoxified should be markedly retarded. Mouse L1210/OAP and P388/CLA leukemia cells are relatively insensitive to the oxazaphosphorines because they contain large amounts of mouse aldehyde dehydrogenase-2. As predicted, N-isopropyl-p-formylbenzamide markedly potentiated the cytotoxic action of mafosfamide against these cells. Mouse L1210/0 and P388/0 lack the enzyme. Again as expected, N-isopropyl-p-formylbenzamide essentially did not potentiate the cytotoxic action of mafosfamide against these cells. Certain mouse and human hematopoietic progenitor cells also contain an aldehyde dehydrogenase that catalyzes the detoxification of aldophosphamide, but the specific identity of this enzyme remains to be established. N-Isopropyl-p-formylbenzamide potentiated the cytotoxic action of mafosfamide against these cells as well. Clinically, procarbazine and the oxazaphosphorines are used to treat certain neoplastic diseases. Frequently, they are used in combination. Our findings demonstrate the potential for both desirable and undesirable drug interactions when these agents are used concurrently. Similar drug interactions can be expected when other substrates for, or inhibitors of, the relevant aldehyde dehydrogenases, e.g., chloramphenicol, chloral hydrate, and methyltetrazolethiol-containing cephalosporins, are co-administered with the oxazaphosphorines.","['Maki, P A', 'Sladek, N E']","['Maki PA', 'Sladek NE']","['Department of Pharmacology, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Phosphoramide Mustards)', '13255-50-0 (N-isopropyl-4-formylbenzamide)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '7AM2ILM9FI (aldophosphamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'EC 1.2.1.3 (Aldehyde Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Aldehyde Dehydrogenase/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/*drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology/drug effects', 'Inactivation, Metabolic', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Leukemia P388/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Phosphoramide Mustards/metabolism', 'Procarbazine/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology']",1991/08/15 00:00,1991/08/15 00:01,['1991/08/15 00:00'],"['1991/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1991 Aug 15;51(16):4170-5.,,['CA 21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stromal macrophage that produces interleukin-1 (IL-1), a cytokine essential for hematopoiesis, is a target of BZ's toxicity. Monocyte dysfunction and decreased IL-1 production have been shown to be involved in aplastic anemia in humans.

HQ over a 10-fold concentration range had no effect on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of pre-IL-1 alpha precursor or on cell viability or DNA and protein synthesis. Stromal macrophages obtained from the femoral BM of C57Bl/6 mice exposed to BZ (600 or 800 mg/kg body weight) for 2 days were incapable of processing the 34-Kd pre-IL-1 alpha to the mature 17-Kd cytokine when stimulated in culture with LPS.

Administration of recombinant murine IL-1 alpha (rMuIL-1 alpha) to mice before a dose of BZ that causes severe depression of BM cellularity completely prevents BM depression, most probably by bypassing the inability of the stromal macrophage in BZ-treated animals to process pre-IL-1 alpha to the mature cytokine.","['Renz, J F', 'Kalf, G F']","['Renz JF', 'Kalf GF']","['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Jefferson Medical College, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (interleukin 1 precursor)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Benzene/*toxicity', 'Blotting, Western', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Hematologic Diseases/*chemically induced/prevention & control', 'Hydroquinones/*pharmacology', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-1/*metabolism/*physiology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Precursors/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1991/08/15 00:00,1991/08/15 00:01,['1991/08/15 00:00'],"['1991/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84173-1 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Aug 15;78(4):938-44.,,['ES-03724/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,

Improving the therapeutic results in acute leukemia requires detecting, and understanding the biology of, the minimal residual leukemia remaining after therapy and responsible for relapse. To investigate the biologic relevance of an in vitro assay for clonogenic leukemia (leukemia colony-forming units [CFU-L]) as a measure of minimal residual leukemia, we studied 58 consecutive patients with acute leukemia in complete remission undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) with cyclophosphamide-based therapy. CFU-L were cultured from the pretransplant remission marrows in 45 of 58 patients: 35 of 43 patients with AML and 10 of 15 with ALL. Clonal rearrangements, identical to the patients' overt leukemia when available, were detected in the occult CFU-L from four of the eight patients with ALL in whom adequate DNA for analysis could be obtained from the CFU-L. None of the uncultured pretransplant remission marrows from the 15 ALL patients showed clonal gene rearrangements. We also determined the in vitro sensitivity of the occult CFU-L to 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4HC), and correlated these results with the outcome of the patients. The sensitivity of the occult CFU-L to 4HC was the only factor that predicted relapse following BMT. The actuarial probability of relapse was 18% in the 23 patients whose CFU-L were sensitive to 4HC compared with 77% in the 22 patients whose CFU-L were resistant (P less than .001). The only factor that influenced the CFU-L sensitivity to 4HC was the type of leukemia. The CFU-L from the AML patients were more sensitive to 4HC than the CFU-L from the ALL patients (P = .001). Occult CFU-L genetically and functionally represent occult leukemia. Therefore, the CFU-L assay should provide a means for studying the biology of minimal residual leukemia and improving the therapeutic results in patients with acute leukemia.","['Miller, C B', 'Zehnbauer, B A', 'Piantadosi, S', 'Rowley, S D', 'Jones, R J']","['Miller CB', 'Zehnbauer BA', 'Piantadosi S', 'Rowley SD', 'Jones RJ']","['Bone Marrow Transplantation Program, Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Gene Rearrangement', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects/pathology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/genetics/pathology/*therapy', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1991/08/15 00:00,1991/08/15 00:01,['1991/08/15 00:00'],"['1991/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84157-3 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Aug 15;78(4):1125-31.,,"['CA-06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-09071/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15396/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bcl-2 is unique among proto-oncogenes, being localized to mitochondria and extending cell survival by blocking programmed cell death. We examined Bcl-2 protein expression in 82 hematologic malignancies and reactive lymphoid processes. All lymphomas with Bcl-2 rearrangement demonstrated high levels of Bcl-2 protein. However, most follicular and diffuse lymphomas without Bcl-2 rearrangement also displayed intense Bcl-2 staining. In these cases, mechanisms other than classic translocation may be deregulation Bcl-2. The pattern of Bcl-2 staining in follicular lymphoma is the inverse of the pattern in reactive hyperplasia, confirming a role for Bcl-2 immunolocalization in routine diagnosis. Small lymphocytic malignancies, including small lymphocytic lymphoma, mantle zone lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, expressed intermediate levels of Bcl-2. Bcl-2 protein varied in plasma cell dyscrasias. Bcl-2 protein levels in T-cell lymphomas reflected their corresponding stage of development. No substantial Bcl-2 was present in the Reed-Sternberg cells of nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. Chronic myelogenous leukemia was strongly positive for Bcl-2, consistent with the presence of Bcl-2 in normal myeloid progenitors.

The overall PB LAK activity against Raji cells was significantly lower in acute leukemia patients compared with normal controls (mean, 1,473 +/- 971 SD LU/10(8) LAK effectors v 3,340 +/- 1,862; P less than .001). The sensitivity of the blasts to autologous LAK cells was also significantly lower than to normal LAK effectors (517 +/- 593 LU/10(8) LAK effectors v 1,304 +/- 1,066; P less than .01). When the data were analyzed independently, four patterns of behavior could be recognized. The relatively largest group (9 of 26) included patients in whom effective LAK cells could be generated against the Raji line, but in whom the blasts were resistant to autologous PB-LAK effectors while being susceptible to normal LAK cells (defective specific LAK activity). In 5 of 26 cases, an incapacity to generate LAK activity against both allogeneic and autologous target cells was observed (defective LAK generation). In six further cases, the blasts were resistant to both allogeneic and autologous LAK populations, though the latter were effective against the Raji line (resistant blasts). The same defects could also be shown with bone marrow-derived LAK cells. Only in six cases did the leukemic blasts appear susceptible to autologous and allogeneic LAK cells. In four patients the analysis could be repeated at remission, and in three a restoration of the LAK function against the primary blasts was recorded. In the 10 cases studied at relapse, the blasts were resistant to autologous LAK effectors in nine and to normal LAK in seven. These data demonstrate that in most acute leukemia patients with active disease, a defect of the LAK machinery, either a deficient generation of LAK cells or the resistance of the blasts to LAK effectors, may be documented, pointing therefore to a possible contributory role of the LAK system in the control of leukemic cell growth. In view of the frequent normalization of the autologous LAK activity at the time of remission, immunotherapy with IL-2/LAK cells should be primarily aimed to patients with minimal residual disease.","['Foa, R', 'Fierro, M T', 'Cesano, A', 'Guarini, A', 'Bonferroni, M', 'Raspadori, D', 'Miniero, R', 'Lauria, F', 'Gavosto, F']","['Foa R', 'Fierro MT', 'Cesano A', 'Guarini A', 'Bonferroni M', 'Raspadori D', 'Miniero R', 'Lauria F', 'Gavosto F']","['Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche e Oncologia Umana, University of Torino, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology']",1991/08/15 00:00,1991/08/15 00:01,['1991/08/15 00:00'],"['1991/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1991/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84145-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1991 Aug 15;78(4):1041-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Neutral and acidic lipid fractions were isolated by column chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and analyzed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and an HPTLC overlay method. Murine myelogenous leukemias were found to contain globo- and ganglio-series neutral glycolipids, e.g., glucosylceramide (Glc-cer), lactosylceramide (Lac-cer), globotriaosylceramide (Gb3), globoside (Gb4), Forssman glycolipid (Gb5), and asialo-GM1 (GA1). Monoblastic leukemia cells contained increased proportions of Gb3, Gb4, Gb5, and GA1. Monocytic and myelomonocytic leukemia cells contained increased proportions of Glc-cer and Lac-cer. Especially, Glc-cer accounted for approximately 60% of the total neutral glycolipids in monocytic leukemia cells. Gb3 was the major neutral glycolipid in reticulum cell neoplasm type A, and it accounted for approximately 75% of the neutral glycolipids. GA1 was the major neutral glycolipid in myeloblastic and granulocytic leukemia cells as well as T-cell leukemias. Especially, granulocytic leukemia cells contained predominantly GA1, and it accounted for approximately 80% of the total neutral glycolipids. The pattern of gangliosides in myelogenous leukemias was more complex when compared with that of the neutral glycolipids; murine myelogenous leukemias contained at least 13 gangliosides, including such major gangliosides as GM1, GM1b containing N-acetyl neuraminic acid and N-glycolyl neuraminic acid, and Ga1NAc-GM1b.

If the former mechanism is correct, then erythrocytes which have lost their asymmetric distribution of phospholipids should display altered bilayer/cytoskeleton interactions. To test this possibility, normal erythrocytes, erythrocytes from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia or sickle disease, and lipid-symmetric and -asymmetric erythrocyte ghosts were labeled with the radioactive photoactivable analogue of phosphatidylethanolamine, 2-(2-azido-4-nitrobenzoyl)-1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho[14C]ethanolamine ([14C]AzPE), previously shown to label cytoskeletal proteins from the bilayer. The labeling pattern of cytoskeletal proteins in pathologic erythrocytes and lipid-asymmetric erythrocyte ghosts was indistinguishable from normal erythrocytes, indicating that the probe detects no differences in bilayer/cytoskeleton interactions in these cells. In contrast, in lipid-symmetric erythrocyte ghosts, labeling of bands 4.1 and 4.2 and actin, and to a lesser extent ankyrin, by [14C]AzPE was considerably reduced. Significantly, however, labeling of spectrin was unaltered in the lipid-symmetric ghosts, suggesting that its relationship with the bilayer is normal in these lipid-symmetric cells.

We also observed a transient increase in the steady-state levels of PKC-alpha and PKC-beta mRNA species in Northern blotting experiments, with maximal induction occurring 48 h after addition of 1,25-(OH)2D3. Analyses of 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced PKC mRNA expression by nuclear run-on transcription experiments suggest that the observed increases in PKC mRNA levels may occur by a posttranscriptional mechanism(s).

We have examined the effect of this agent on the metabolism and cytotoxicity of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (ara-C) in both log phase and high-density human promyelocytic leukemia cells (HL-60). Exposure of low-density cells to 12.5 nM bryostatin 1 for 24 hr prior to a 4-hr incubation with 1 or 10 microM ara-C resulted in nearly a 2-fold increase in ara-CTP formation. When cells were maintained under high-cell density conditions (e.g. 5 x 10(6) cells/mL) for 24 hr prior to ara-C exposure, a 90% reduction in ara-CTP formation and ara-C DNA incorporation was observed. However, coincubation of high-density cells with bryostatin 1 for 24 hr increased ara-CTP formation 6- to 8-fold, yielding levels essentially equivalent to those achieved in low-density cells. Smaller (but still significant) increases in ara-C DNA incorporation were also noted. Enhancement of ara-CTP formation by bryostatin 1 occurred over a broad ara-C concentration range (0.1 to 100 microM), involved a temperature-dependent process, could not be mimicked by addition of hematopoietic growth factors, and was not related to neutralization of toxic or inhibitory substances in high-density medium. Exposure of cells to bryostatin 1 did not lead to morphologic or functional evidence of HL-60 cell maturation or an increase in cell viability, but did produce a decline in cellular proliferative activity as determined by thymidine and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and cytofluorometric analysis. Bryostatin 1 did not exert its effects in high-density cells by inhibiting ara-C deamination or by interfering with ara-CTP dephosphorylation, but instead appeared to act by enhancing ara-C phosphorylation. Although cell-free extracts obtained from high-density cells exposed to bryostatin 1 exhibited levels of deoxycytidine kinase activity compared to controls, treated cells did display a significant decline in intracellular dCTP levels (e.g. 0.7 vs 1.3 pmol/10(6)), and nearly a 2-fold increase in ATP and UTP concentrations. Ara-CTP formation was also increased substantially by other PK-C activators including phorbol dibutyrate and mezerein (10-100 nM); this process was inhibited more than 70% by the PK-C inhibitor H-7 (50 microM), but not by the PK-C inhibitors staurosporine, tamoxifen, and HA1004. Finally, coadministration of ara-C and bryostatin 1 resulted in greater than expected inhibitory effects toward HL-60 cell clonogenic growth.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Grant, S', 'Boise, L', 'Westin, E', 'Howe, C', 'Pettit, G R', 'Turner, A', 'McCrady, C']","['Grant S', 'Boise L', 'Westin E', 'Howe C', 'Pettit GR', 'Turner A', 'McCrady C']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond 23298.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Diterpenes)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Terpenes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '34807-41-5 (mezerein)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)']",IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Count', 'Cytarabine/*metabolism/toxicity', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', '*Diterpenes', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Macrolides', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Phosphorylation', 'Terpenes/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1991/07/25 00:00,1991/07/25 00:01,['1991/07/25 00:00'],"['1991/07/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/07/25 00:01 [medline]', '1991/07/25 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(91)90046-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(91)90046-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1991 Jul 25;42(4):853-67. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(91)90046-8.,,"['AICR88B36/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA04875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA35601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first sign of MH was masseter spasm following succinylcholine; then tachycardia, acidosis, myoglobinuria, and CPK elevation (8953 IU) appeared. There was only moderate temperature elevation to 37.8 degree C. Rapid improvement and complete recovery occurred after dantrolene i.v. The patient's father was found to have undiagnosed muscle pain and an elevated CPK level. An in vitro contracture test with halothane and caffeine revealed susceptibility to MH and supported the patient's diagnosis and genetic predisposition. Referring to several other cases in the literature concerning MH in patients with lymphomas and leukemias, a possible correlation between the two diseases is discussed. As the MH crisis in our patient was most probably genetic in origin, a common acquired cause such as a viral infection seems less probable. We do not believe the chemotherapy our patient received between the two anesthetics was the cause since about one-half of the patients in the literature had not had chemotherapeutic pretreatment at the time of the MH crisis. We believe that a common genetic predisposition is the most likely link between the two diseases.

DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of patients with chronic disseminated candidiasis treated with fluconazole on a compassionate investigational new drug protocol. SETTING: Multi-institutional. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients received 100 to 400 mg of fluconazole per day for a median of 30 weeks. All had either failed to respond to treatment with more than 2 g of amphotericin B or had serious amphotericin B-related toxicities. RESULTS: Fourteen of 16 evaluable patients (88%) responded. Responses were observed in seven of nine patients in whom adequate doses of amphotericin B had failed and in all seven patients who had amphotericin B-related toxicities. In 12 patients, cytotoxic chemotherapy was continued without flare of the infection. Fluconazole was well tolerated with rare side effects. Aspergillus superinfection developed in three patients and contributed to the death of two of them.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Six patients (ages 3 to 44) with acute leukemia and hepatosplenic candidiasis who did not respond to prior antifungal therapy were treated with fluconazole. RESULTS: All six patients had fever and three had nausea and vomiting; computed tomographic (CT) scan showed lucencies in the liver in six, lucencies in the spleen in five, and lucencies in the kidneys in three. Prior therapy with 1.6 to 4 g of amphotericin B in the five adults and 526 mg of amphotericin B in the child (with the addition of flucytosine in four) failed to improve clinical symptoms or lucencies in the liver, spleen, and kidneys seen on CT scan. Fluconazole was given at a dose of 200 to 400 mg daily (70 to 100 mg in the child) for 2 to 14 months. All patients had resolution of fever and other symptoms in 2 to 8 weeks. Improvement of the lesions noted on CT scan was seen in 4 to 8 weeks in all patients. Total resolution of lesions noted on CT scan occurred by 4 weeks in two patients, but took 4 to 5 months for three patients and 13 months for one patient. Three patients had relapse of their acute leukemia and two died, presumably cured of their candidiasis. Two patients underwent successful bone marrow transplantation without relapse of their candidiasis.

In 219 NHML cases (96.8%), lymphoma cells reacted with more than one of these antibodies. A set of MB-1, Mx-pan B, L26, LN-1, LN-2 and anti-immunoglobulin light chain antibodies characterized each subtype of B-MLs, categorized according to the Kiel classification. Mantle-zone lymphoma (MzML) was added as one subtype. L26 stained the largest number of B-MLs (82.8%). B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) was labeled most frequently by MB-1. MzML was characterized by reactivity of lymphoma cells with LN-2 and by the appearance of monoclonal immunoglobulin light chain along the cell membrane. Follicle center cell lymphomas were stained by LN-1 and LN-2, although a small number of proliferating cells were labeled by LN-1 in B-CLL, MzML and the immunocytoma lymphoplasmacytic/cytoid variant. MT-1 and/or UCHL-1 showed various degrees of reactivity with the cell membranes of lymphoma cells in 94.8% of T-MLs. Among the T-cell pleomorphic lymphomas of Suchi and Lennert, the adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma type, defined by stippled heterochromatin distribution and peculiar huge cells, reacted selectively (p less than 0.05) with anti-phosphokinase C antibody. Anaplastic large cell T-ML reacted with a set of Ber H2, LN-2 and Leu M1. In T-zone lymphomas without hyperplastic follicles, angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia-type T-ML, lymphoepithelioid cell lymphomas and some pleomorphic lymphomas comprising clear large lymphoma cells, there were many intermingling B cells, and their constitution varied. In some lymphoblastic lymphomas of both the T cell and B-cell type, phenotypes of T cells and B cells were expressed. Consequently, it was shown that paraffin immunohistochemistry was useful for the practical histopathological diagnosis of NHML even in the area where human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 is endemic.","['Hasui, K']",['Hasui K'],"['Second Department of Pathology, Kagoshima University Faculty of Medicine, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Acta Pathol Jpn,Acta pathologica japonica,0372637,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'HTLV-I Infections/*epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/classification/*diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/*pathology', 'Phenotype']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1440-1827.1991.tb01658.x [doi]'],ppublish,Acta Pathol Jpn. 1991 May;41(5):350-62. doi: 10.1111/j.1440-1827.1991.tb01658.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the restrictive temperature, the envelope precursor polyprotein, gPr80env, is inefficiently processed intracellularly, and this is associated with the neurovirulence of ts1. To test the hypothesis that expression of the envelope proteins of ts1 alone without infectious virus production can induce paralysis, it is necessary to use either transmissible retroviral expression vectors or microinjection of eukaryotic gene expression plasmid to introduce the env gene of ts1 into germlines of mice. In this study, we have constructed three retrovirus vectors and three gene expression plasmids, all of which contain the env gene of ts1. By comparing the different expression systems, we found that one construct, pts1-env(F) can express the envelope proteins at a level comparable to the level expressed in ts1-infected cells.

Within 2 weeks she developed a maculopapular rash, fever, abnormal liver function, diarrhea, and wasting. She became septic and died 6 weeks later. Transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was suspected clinically. At autopsy, changes diagnostic of GVHD were present in the skin and liver. The remarkable feature of the case was the histopathology of the thymus, which was morphologically ""dysplastic,"" i.e., minute, lymphoid depleted, devoid of a corticomedullary demarcation, and completely lacking in Hassall's corpuscles. These changes were virtually identical to those seen in the thymus of children with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID). There was no evidence of preexisting immune deficiency. There is compelling experimental evidence that GVHD can produce changes in the thymus that are identical to those of ""thymic dysplasia."" These observations have led to the hypothesis that immunodeficiency associated with GVHD may stem, in part, from injury to thymic epithelium resulting in defective T cell maturation. As a corollary of this hypothesis, it has been suggested that the pathogenesis of some forms of SCID may involve GVHD-associated injury to the thymus by a maternal allograft acquired in utero. This report further documents thymic pathology in human GVHD and discusses these changes in the light of these ideas.","['Gartner, J G']",['Gartner JG'],"['Department of Pathology, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Pediatr Pathol,Pediatric pathology,8303527,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Child', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/etiology/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Thymus Gland/*pathology/ultrastructure', '*Transfusion Reaction']",1991/05/01 00:00,1991/05/01 00:01,['1991/05/01 00:00'],"['1991/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3109/15513819109064780 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Pathol. 1991 May-Jun;11(3):449-56. doi: 10.3109/15513819109064780.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A curious aspect is the continuous reappearance of recursive processes even at very small biologic scales. These iterations are relevant not only for the normal behavior of (hemopoietic) cells but also for amplifying hidden genomic singularities above some critical threshold. When that happens, there are sudden quali-quantitative and often clonal changes in the cell behavior. As illustrated by specific leukemic cases, many paradoxes of malignant growth seem best explained by the peculiar sensitivity to initial condition of (hemopoietic) cells. Interpreted as chaotic oscillators, these cells display a spectrum of disorders that, in spite of appearing as random, are in fact triggered by amplification of subtle preconditions with statistico-deterministic outcomes, that are predictable within certain time limits.","['Matioli, G T']",['Matioli GT'],"['USC School of Medicine, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Med Hypotheses,Medical hypotheses,7505668,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'DNA/ultrastructure', 'Genomic Library', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology/*ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', '*Models, Biological', 'Mutation', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/physiology/ultrastructure', 'Subcellular Fractions/physiology/*ultrastructure']",1991/04/01 00:00,1991/04/01 00:01,['1991/04/01 00:00'],"['1991/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1991/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1991/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0306-9877(91)90048-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0306-9877(91)90048-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Med Hypotheses. 1991 Apr;34(4):316-30. doi: 10.1016/0306-9877(91)90048-4.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
