This role is one of secondary treatment, and the drugs should not be used as a first line of attack; they should be employed only when corticosteroid resistance or toxicity is a problem. In a few patients, azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine may have a role in minimising corticosteroid toxicity, but the remission induced in relapsing children is no more durable than that after corticosteroids. Chlorambucil must be given in doses, and for periods long enough to run the risk of neoplasia, particularly leukaemia; there does not appear to be a place for its use in nephrotic children unless the duration of remission can be shown to be longer than that obtainable with cyclophosphamide. There is no evidence that any immunosuppressive agent has a place in the management of children with idiopathic glomerular disease showing structural alterations in the glomeruli. Children with systemic lupus erythematosus and nephritis may benefit from the addition of cytotoxic agents to their corticosteroid regime, although the indications for this are not clear, and controlled evidence is lacking.","['Cameron, J S']",['Cameron JS'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Switzerland,Paediatrician,Paediatrician,0352330,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '18D0SL7309 (Chlorambucil)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)']",IM,"['Azathioprine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Chlorambucil/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Glomerulonephritis/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic/complications', 'Mechlorethamine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Nephritis/drug therapy/etiology', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/*drug therapy', 'Proteinuria/drug therapy']",49,1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Paediatrician. 1979;8(5-6):364-77.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Group A was decontaminated by nonabsorbable antibiotics in strict reverse isolation, group B was isolated only and group C was treated under routine hospital conditions. There were less infections in group A and B compared with group C. 76% of patients in group A achieved remission, in contrast to 57% in group B and 59% in group C. Late evaluation three years after termination of the study showed that all patients were dead except four patients being in first remission after discontinuation of maintenance treatment. Three patients were treated in group A, one patient in group C. However, the differences of survival and remission rates were not significant. Failure to demonstrate significant advantage of isolation and decontamination in treatment of AL was caused by insufficient suppression of microbes by the applied antimicrobial measures. Thus, it is suggested to investigate better antimicrobial treatment before gnotobiotic care is accepted as routine supportive treatment in AL.","['Dietrich, M', 'Abt, C', 'Arnold, R', 'Pflieger, H', 'Hoelzer, D', 'Kurrle, E', 'Rasche, H', 'Kubanek, B', 'Heimpel, H', 'Fliedner, T M']","['Dietrich M', 'Abt C', 'Arnold R', 'Pflieger H', 'Hoelzer D', 'Kurrle E', 'Rasche H', 'Kubanek B', 'Heimpel H', 'Fliedner TM']",['ger'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",Switzerland,Onkologie,Onkologie,7808556,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', '*Germ-Free Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Patient Isolation/*methods', 'Prospective Studies', 'Random Allocation']",,1979/06/01 00:00,1979/06/01 00:01,['1979/06/01 00:00'],"['1979/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Onkologie. 1979 Jun;2(3):102-7. doi: 10.1159/000214484.,0378-584X (Print) 0378-584X (Linking),Die Wirksamkeit gnotobiotischer Massnahmen bei der Behandlung der akuten Leukamie: ergebnisse einer prospektiv randomisierten klinischen Studie.,['10.1159/000214484 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Cytostatics had no beneficial effect. Cytostatic therapy exposed some patients to the hazards of severe infections. On the contrary splenectomy lead to the improvement of some blood parameters. Leukapheresis seemed to work nearly identically. The survival of the splenectomized patients was longer than of controls.

Application to genetic toxicological testing.,391-406,"We have systematically evaluated the mouse lymphoma TK+/- leads to TK-/- mutagenesis assay to determine if this somatic-cell test system would be a useful addition to the routine screening battery already used in our laboratory for the detection of chemical mutagens. During these investigations we observed that, with certain modifications of the basic assay, mutagenicity data could be obtained in as little as 9 days once the relative cytotoxic properties of the test substance were known. By improving the culturing conditions, we were able to reduce the serum requirements by as much as 50--75% without appreciably altering either cell viability or the recovery of chemically-induced mutants. Phenotypic stability of test-derived trifluorothymidine resistant (TFTR) mutants was confirmed by demonstrating cross-resistance to bromodeoxyuridine and concomitant sensitivity to methotrexate (THMG) in TFTR cells grown for 20 generations under non-selective conditions. While reduced growth rates resulting from temporary cell-division delay in treated cells is probably not a contributing factor to the observed mutation frequencies, only TFTR colonies which formed large distinct colonies in the presence of trifluorothymidine were clearly phenotypically stable mutants when spontaneous mutants were isolated and verified. When a non-mutagen, a weak mutagen, and a well-established mutagen were compared at equitoxic doses under these modified conditions, clear quantitative differences were seen in the respective mutation frequencies induced by these 3 types of agents. With these technical modifications, we feel this assay is both reliable and amenable to the screening of diverse chemical compounds for point-mutational activity in a mammalian cell.","['Amacher, D E', 'Paillet, S', 'Ray, V A']","['Amacher DE', 'Paillet S', 'Ray VA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Mutat Res,Mutation research,0400763,"['0 (Carcinogens)', '0 (Mutagens)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Carcinogens/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/*methods', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Genes', '*Genetic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/enzymology', 'Mice', 'Mutagens/metabolism', '*Mutation', 'Thymidine Kinase/*genetics']",,1979/12/01 00:00,1979/12/01 00:01,['1979/12/01 00:00'],"['1979/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mutat Res. 1979 Dec;64(6):391-406. doi: 10.1016/0165-1161(79)90109-2.,0027-5107 (Print) 0027-5107 (Linking),,"['0165-1161(79)90109-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0165-1161(79)90109-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

Four patients with SAA had marrow transplanted from HLA-identical siblings after conditioning with cyclophosphamide (CY); three cases of AML were treated with allogeneic BMT. The medullary material was generally obtained by aspiration, but treated so as to preserve its architecture; fresh, postvital preparations were particularly useful for this purpose. In SAA, the bone marrow before transplantation showed dense infiltrates composed of macrophages and other inflammatory cells; after BMT, repopulation started at the periphery of the infiltrates, when they were not totally destroyed by CY. Granulocytic repopulation generally preceded erythropoiesis, which always occurred by way of typical erythroblastic reticulocytopoietic islands. Marked but transient dyserythropoiesis was found in two cases; in one of them, it was considered as drug-dependent. Both in SAA and in AML, but more so in the latter, a marked and sometimes imposing macrophagic hyperplasia was found after transplantation. Many macrophages were actively engulfing erythrocytes and nucleated cells. This last type appeared prominent in rejection episodes.","['Marmont, A M']",['Marmont AM'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)'],IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/pathology/*therapy', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Granulocytes/pathology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/*therapy', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1979;21(2):133-48.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results of the study to date confirm and extend previous studies. Because of the long natural history of PV, the results of studies relating to leukemia, other myeloproliferative diseases, myelofibrosis, and effects of therapy are tentative at this time, even though the study is in its eleventh year. Hypercellularity of the marrow, together with hyperplasia and hypertrophy of megakaryocytes, is an almost constant finding in untreated PV. A very few cases (7 of 281) had relatively normal cellularities and normal megakaryocytic concentrations. Whether these findings were the result of sampling errors could not be determined, since only one site was biopsied. In any event, we found no unique clinical or laboratory features to distinguish these patients. At this time, the course of these patients appears to be the same as that of the other patients. Although increases in reticulin were regularly found during the spent phase of polycythemia, the relationship was not a precise one. For example, a moderate to marked increase in reticulin was found in 12 percent of the patients early in the course of the disease and was not predictive that the spent phase with myeloid metaplasia was imminent. In addition, in a given patient with serial biopsies taken over several years, some variability in reticulin was noted among the biopsies.

Images of cells photographed at two different wavelengths (546 and 436 nm) or at two different angles of incidence allowed discrimination between reflected light and light that was both reflected and modulated by interference. Interference is involved when a change in reflected intensity (relative to glass/medium background reflected intensity) occurs on changing either the illumination wavelength or the reflection incidence angle. In cases where interference occurs, refractive indices can be determined at points where the optical path difference is known, by solving the given interference equation. Where cells are at least 50 nm distant from the glass substrate, intensities are also influenced by that distance as well as by the light's angle of incidence and wavelength. The reflected intensity at the glass/medium interface is used as a standard in calculating the refractive index of the cortical cytoplasm. Refractive indices were found to be higher (1.38--1.40) at points of focal contact, where stress fibers terminate, than in areas of close contact (1.354--1.368). In areas of the cortical cytoplasm, between focal contacts, not adherent to the glass substrate, refractive indices between 1.353 and 1.368 were found. This was thought to result from a microfilamentous network within the cortical cytoplasm. Intimate attachment of cells to their substrate is assumed to be characterized by a lack of an intermediate layer of culture medium.","['Bereiter-Hahn, J', 'Fox, C H', 'Thorell, B']","['Bereiter-Hahn J', 'Fox CH', 'Thorell B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Cell Biol,The Journal of cell biology,0375356,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured/*ultrastructure', 'Cricetinae', 'Glioma/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Kidney', 'Leukemia, Experimental/ultrastructure', 'Marsupialia', 'Microscopy, Phase-Contrast/*methods', 'Neuroglia/ultrastructure', 'Refractometry']",,1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Biol. 1979 Sep;82(3):767-79. doi: 10.1083/jcb.82.3.767.,0021-9525 (Print) 0021-9525 (Linking),,['10.1083/jcb.82.3.767 [doi]'],PMC2110483,,,,,,,,,

In view of these therapeutic hazards, the present objectives are the modification of alkylating agent therapy by the use of other drugs and sequential administration, and a reduction in the dose and field of irradiation and the duration of polychemotherapy, as in Hodgkin's disease; all present protocols are orientated in this direction.","['Auclerc, G', 'Jacquillat, C', 'Auclerc, M F', 'Weil, M', 'Bernard, J']","['Auclerc G', 'Jacquillat C', 'Auclerc MF', 'Weil M', 'Bernard J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', '*Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/therapy', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/etiology', 'Nephrotic Syndrome/drug therapy']",55,1979/12/01 00:00,1979/12/01 00:01,['1979/12/01 00:00'],"['1979/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1979 Dec;44(6):2017-25. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197912)44:6<2017::aid-cncr2820440609>3.0.co;2-a.,0008-543X (Print) 0008-543X (Linking),,['10.1002/1097-0142(197912)44:6<2017::aid-cncr2820440609>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Results of a prospective trial in 58 patients. Cooperative Group for the Study of Aplastic and Refractory Anemias.,1976-82,"The results of a prospective study of 58 patients with refractory anemia and partial blastic infiltration of the bone marrow lead to the following conclusions. The median survival (12 months from diagnosis) is shorter and the rate of acute leukemia as cause of death (60%) higher than in other retrospective series. This group of patients, however, appears to be a ""continuum"" of preleukemic states with more or less rapid evolution, so that the exclusion of the most severe cases appears unjustified. Based on the degree of bone marrow blastosis, and also on the degree of blood cytopenias, the anomalies of 59 Fe incorporation kinetics and the bone marrow stem-cell cultures, it is possible to derive a plausible prognosis for individual patients, which could aid the choice of therapy. Androgen therapy does not accelerate leukemic evolution, but does not improve the bone marrow insufficiency. Cytosine-arabinoside at low dosage exhibited no toxicity, but did not delay the appearance of overt leukemia.","['Najean, Y', 'Pecking, A']","['Najean Y', 'Pecking A']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Testosterone Congeners)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Cytarabine/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*etiology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Preleukemia/etiology', 'Prognosis', 'Testosterone Congeners/*therapeutic use']",,1979/12/01 00:00,1979/12/01 00:01,['1979/12/01 00:00'],"['1979/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1979 Dec;44(6):1976-82. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197912)44:6<1976::aid-cncr2820440603>3.0.co;2-#.,0008-543X (Print) 0008-543X (Linking),,['10.1002/1097-0142(197912)44:6<1976::aid-cncr2820440603>3.0.co;2-# [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

After remission induction and consolidation, chemotherapy was stopped in both groups but BCG was continued in the C+I group. The overall survival of the C+I group was significantly increased (P less than 0.05). There was no significant increase in the duration of first remission in the C+I group (0.05 less than P less than 0.1) nor in the time from first relapse to death (0.05 less than P less than 0.1). There was no significant difference in the incidence of first or second remissions, and the time taken to enter remission did not differ significantly between the two groups. Comparison with the results of other trials suggests that the use of maintenance chemotherapy in addition to immunotherapy produces longer remissions. Five patients in the C group developed leukaemic central-nervous-system (CSN) involvement, in comparison with none in the C+I group. CNS relapse did not produce a significant decrease in remission length (P greater than 0.1) but reduction in survival after CNS relapse was highly significant (P = 0.001).

Only continued research in cancer cell biology and basic and clinical pharmacology with carefully controlled therapeutic trials with new agents will eventually lead to the more effective use of chemotherapy in management of gastrointesinal cancer.","['Terz, J J', 'Beatty, J D']","['Terz JJ', 'Beatty JD']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Surg Annu,Surgery annual,0221302,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Carcinoid Tumor/*drug therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colonic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Esophageal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Liver Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Rectal Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'Stomach Neoplasms/drug therapy', 'United States']",180,1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Surg Annu. 1979;11:149-80.,0081-9638 (Print) 0081-9638 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine patients with severe aplastic anemia strongly immunized by previous blood transfusions received 800 cGy TBI with a lung shielding of 400 cGy. No rejection was observed and 7 patients (63%) are currently alive. One patient died of interstitial pneumonitis probably related to CMV infection, one of subacute necrotizing hepatitis, two of severe acute GVHD. It is concluded from this study that TBI remains the best immunosuppressive conditioning regimen even in strongly immunized patients.

A dose of 1000 rads TBI is generally used in man for conditionning for bone marrow transplantation. In acute leukemia, total body irradiation is usually associated with cytoreductive chemotherapy. In Seattle 110 patients underwent bone marrow transplantation for acute leukemia in relapse. 15 patients became long term survivors. The main cause of failure were GVH, interstitial pneumonitis and leukemic relapse. New attempts are being made to improve the results : (1) better cytoreductive therapy preceding transplanation, (2) bone marrow transplantation during remission of the disease, (3) prevention of interstitial pneumonitis by modifications of the TBI technique.","['Zwaan, F E']",['Zwaan FE'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Pathol Biol (Paris),Pathologie-biologie,0265365,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/radiation effects', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Gamma Rays', 'Graft Rejection/radiation effects', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/*methods', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1979/06/01 00:00,1979/06/01 00:01,['1979/06/01 00:00'],"['1979/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathol Biol (Paris). 1979 Jun;27(6):345-7.,0369-8114 (Print) 0369-8114 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

These systems fall generally into 3 classes: diploid cell strains, Syrian hamster embryo cells; cell lines, mouse BALB/c-3T3 and mouse C3H-10T1/2; and cells+virus, Fischer rat cells infected with Rauscher leukemia virus and Syrian hamster embryo cells infected with adenovirus. The results accumulated to date show a good correlation between transformation response in cell culture and carcinogenicity of chemicals in whole animal studies. The major advantages of these systems are their relative brevity (10 days-6 weeks) and resultant low costs, their agreement with whole animal bioassays, and their direct biological relevance to the carcinogenic process. The present major disadvantages are the uncertain nature of the metabolic capabilities of the target cells and the lack of a metabolic activation system that is reliable and adaptable for routine bioassays. The development of epithelial cell systems such as breast, liver, lung, and skin may solve the problem of carcinogen metabolism as well as provide target cells that are representative of major organ sites for cancer in man. The rational use of cell culture bioassays for neoplastic transformation is a valuable component of the toxicological armamentarium to assess risk to humans from exposure to chemicals.","['Sivak, A']",['Sivak A'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,J Assoc Off Anal Chem,Journal - Association of Official Analytical Chemists,7505559,['0 (Carcinogens)'],IM,"['Adenoviridae', 'Animals', 'Carcinogens/*toxicity', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Clone Cells', 'Cricetinae', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical/methods', 'Embryo, Mammalian', 'Fibroblasts', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mesocricetus', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Rats', 'Rauscher Virus']",36,1979/07/01 00:00,1979/07/01 00:01,['1979/07/01 00:00'],"['1979/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Assoc Off Anal Chem. 1979 Jul;62(4):889-99.,0004-5756 (Print) 0004-5756 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

The Moloney murine sarcoma virus-immune spleen cells, however, did not respond to other murine type C viruses, to AKR and Rauscher viruses, or to murine mammary tumor virus. The immune spleen cells also responded specifically to purified glycoprotein with molecular weights of 69,000 and 71,000 and proteins with molecular weights of 30,000 and 12,000, but not to protein with a molecular weight of 10,000, of the homologous M-MuLV. Migration inhibition factor production was also observed in response to soluble 3 M KCl extracts of leukemia cells, MBL-2, induced by M-MuLV. Similarly, the immune spleen cells responded to membrane fractions purified from the MBL-2 cells. Comparable membrane fractions prepared from a Gross virus-induced leukemia, E male G2, and a radiation-induced leukemia, RL male 1, were not active. The tumor-associated surface antigens of MBL-2 membranes could be solubilized by the detergent, Nonident P-40. Thus, C57BL/6N mice inoculated with Moloney murine sarcoma virus developed cell-mediated immunity to envelope and some internal antigens of M-MuLV and also to tumor-associated surface antigens of a tumor induced by this leukemia virus.","['Ng, A K', 'Ames, R S Jr', 'McIntire, R K', 'Herberman, R B']","['Ng AK', 'Ames RS Jr', 'McIntire RK', 'Herberman RB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, Surface', '*Antigens, Viral', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/biosynthesis', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology', 'Spleen/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",,1979/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1979/12/01 00:00'],"['1979/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1979/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1979 Dec;39(12):4887-93.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Twelve children had polymicrobial bacteremia and 14 had recurrent bacteremia which occurred during antibiotic therapy. Mortality (78%) in these children was significantly (p less than .001) greater then in children from whom one microorganism was isolated (47%). Interesting aspects include the resurgence of S. aureus, failure of development of meningitis in children with bacteremia, and unchanged antibiotic susceptibility since the last review of bacteremia in this institution.

The receptor for these hormones is common to most mammalian tissues, and yet the responses are widely divergent. Although there may be differences in the receptors to account for some of this diversity, it is likely that it is largely due to cellular programming not involving the receptors. In addition to the intertissue differences in sensitivity, it is also clear that intra-tissue differences occur. The greatest amount of information has been accumulated with lymphoid cell systems and there are sensitivity differences to specific responses such as cell killing or effects on immunological functions. In these systems, there can be major variations in either the extent of the response (e. g., from mild growth inhibition to cellular killing) or whether any effect is observed. Further, dose requirements for certain responses can vary by several orders of magnitude. Within a given tissue there may be developmental changes in sensitivity that are not due to obvious changes in the receptor, and decreased sensitivity with aging that in some cases has been associated with changes in receptor binding activity. Finally, the cellular sensitivity can either be influenced by hormones and other factors that affect the ability of the glucocorticoid to elicit a particular response (in a synergistic or antagonistic manner), or the same function regulated by the glucocorticoid can be inducible by the steroid, appearing some time after administration of the steroid and disappearing after steroid removal. Genetic variations in sensitivity to glucocorticoids also occur. In humans these may be generalized, affecting glucocorticoid action in all responsive tissues, and could be important in the pathogenesis of certain diseases. Perhaps the most striking genetic alterations, however, are observed in cultured lymphoid and fibroblastic cells and in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells ordinarily growth inhibited or killed by the glucocorticoid. Mutant cell lines arise that are highly resistant and most of these have abnormalities in the glucocorticoid receptor. In some cases binding activity is totally lost, easily expalining the resistance. In other cases, there is a more modest reduction in binding or a change in receptor properties that give it increased or decreased nuclear and DNA binding activity. An analysis of these cell lines suggests that many of the defects are in some receptor property presently not understood that makes the receptor ineffective rather than the defect being due to the quantitative changes in receptor levels detected. The frequency of emergence of steroid-resistant cells can vary widely from about 10(-5) in S49 cells to less than 10(-8) in certain thymic cell lines...","['Harris, A W', 'Baxter, J D']","['Harris AW', 'Baxter JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Germany,Monogr Endocrinol,Monographs on endocrinology,0113567,"['0 (Glucocorticoids)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cushing Syndrome/physiopathology', 'Glucocorticoids/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/pharmacology', 'Immunity', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/immunology/*physiology', 'Lymphoma/physiopathology', 'Mutation', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*physiology', 'Receptors, Steroid/*physiology']",70,1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Monogr Endocrinol. 1979;12:423-48. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-81265-1_23.,0077-1015 (Print) 0077-1015 (Linking),,['10.1007/978-3-642-81265-1_23 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

We identified specific glucocorticoid receptors in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Their presence or absence was well correlated with both in vivo and in vitro responsiveness of these target cells to glucocorticoids. These data suggest that knowledge of glucocorticoid receptor status in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia may aid in selecting patients for therapy. Furthermore, these receptors exhibit significant quantitative differences in various subtypes of human leukemia, with null-cell lymphoblastic leukemia having approximately three times the mean number of receptors per cell as T-cell leukemias. These differences in receptor levels are associated with major differences in complete remission duration independent of other prognosticators of response such as patient age, white count, and cell surface markers. Specific receptors for glucocorticoids can also be identified in normal human peripheral blood monocyte fractions including unpurified peripheral blood lymphocytes, T, and non-T subcomponents of circulating lymphocytes and circulating monocytes. By criteria of quantity, of binding affinity, and specificity, these receptors appear to be similar to other classical glucocorticoid receptors. Receptors in human peripheral blood lymphocytes may be induced threefold on a per cell basis by treatment with the mitogen phytohemagglutinin. This is associated with a marked increase in glucocorticoid responsiveness.","['Lippman, M E']",['Lippman ME'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Monogr Endocrinol,Monographs on endocrinology,0113567,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Mitogens)', '0 (Receptors, Glucocorticoid)', '0 (Receptors, Steroid)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",IM,"['Cytoplasm/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Dexamethasone/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrocortisone/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Mitogens', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Receptors, Glucocorticoid/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Steroid/*metabolism']",55,1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Monogr Endocrinol. 1979;12:377-97. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-81265-1_21.,0077-1015 (Print) 0077-1015 (Linking),,['10.1007/978-3-642-81265-1_21 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Dose response data were utilized to determine the relative potency of each of these drugs. They were then ranked based on this information. Vincristine, the most potent compound tested in the mouse lymphoma assay, was not active in the Salmonella assay, nor were DTIC and Methotrexate. Excluding these compounds from the comparison ranking, we found that the only difference in the order between the Ames and lymphoma assays was between Daunomycin and Adriamycin. Daunomycin was most potent in the Ames assay, compounds was reversed in the mouse lymphoma assay. This observation of relative activity is of interest because it underscores the ability to extrapolate between microbial and mammalian test systems, provided one keeps in mind the differences associated with chromosome structure and modes of segregation in these two cell types. Furthermore, it is suggested that relative potency ranking may provide prospective insight into expectations of risk for human populations exposed to these drugs.","['Matheson, D', 'Brusick, D', 'Carrano, R']","['Matheson D', 'Brusick D', 'Carrano R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Drug Chem Toxicol,Drug and chemical toxicology,7801723,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Mutagens)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*toxicity', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Leukemia L5178/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Mutagens', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects/*genetics']",,1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Drug Chem Toxicol. 1978;1(3):277-304. doi: 10.3109/01480547809105021.,0148-0545 (Print) 0148-0545 (Linking),,['10.3109/01480547809105021 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The cytotoxic responsiveness of the sensitized lymphocytes, as determined in vitro by the 51Cr-release assay, varied among individual lymphocyte donors and was greatly dependent on the sensitization culture conditions. Induction of cytotoxic effector cells was augmented appreciably by adding to the cultures minute amounts of the immunopotentiating agent MER-BCG. Responding lymphocytes and stimulating leukemia cells cryopreserved for several weeks in liquid nitrogen were as effective as fresh cells in generating effector lymphocytes; the cytotoxic capacity of already sensitized lymphocytes was fully retained by cryopreservation.

The immunoperoxidase method is often more suitable than immunoferritin. There are no major difficulties in staining surface antigens by immuno-EM, provided sufficient amounts of pure antibodies are available for coupling to peroxidase. Prior fixation of cells, with faxatives that preserve the antigenicity of surface components, avoids ligand-induced alterations of the surface components. It is believed that, unlike the surface, intracellular antigens are difficult to stain by immuno-EM because of the poor penetration of conjugates into fixed cells; thus, various technical approaches have been proposed by workers involved in tissue immuno-EM. In fact, the method that we initially devised for the surface staining of fixed cell suspensions has proved to detect specifically intracellular immunoglobulins in B cells obtained from patients with proliferative diseases. Thus, conjugates do penetrate into fixed cells, although by an unknown mechanism. On this basis, it is possible to study both surface and intracellular immunoglobulins at the EM level and to determine the precise localization synthesis.","['Gourdin, M F', 'Reyes, F', 'Laurent, G', 'Gorius, J B']","['Gourdin MF', 'Reyes F', 'Laurent G', 'Gorius JB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Israel,Isr J Med Sci,Israel journal of medical sciences,0013105,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Cytoplasm/immunology', 'Endoplasmic Reticulum/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Immunoglobulins/*analysis', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis']",,1979/08/01 00:00,1979/08/01 00:01,['1979/08/01 00:00'],"['1979/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Isr J Med Sci. 1979 Aug;15(8):693-7.,0021-2180 (Print) 0021-2180 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

The leucocyte count was 19.0 x 10(9)/1 at presentation and tartrate resistent acid phosphatase was present in most prolymphocytes. Immunological investigation of prolymphocytes from lymph nodes, spleen and peripheral blood revealed the surface marker phenotype: SmIg + (mu, (delta), lambda), IgG-Fc-receptor +, C3-receptor +. The prolymphocytes from lymph nodes and spleen were C3-receptor + in a high percentage, while only a few were IgG-Fc-receptor +. This proportion was reversed in the blood prolymphocytes. The histology of lymph nodes was unique and strongly suggested a preferential involvement (homing phenomenon) of the mantle zone of the lymphatic follicle. These results may indicate that emission of prolymphocytes from lymph nodes to circulation involves a change of surface receptors.

Experiments utilizing autoradiography to determine the early homing pattern of the leukemic cells revealed a pronounced localization of the labeled cells to the spleen. The cells that were seen in the white pulp showed preferential localization to the follicles or B cell domains. Tissue section immunofluorescence with antibodies to kappa- and lambda-light chains was used to study the initial mouse with this disease as well as to study the mice that were injected with in vivo passaged cells. These mice also showed predominant involvement of the spleen. Although the initial mouse with this disease had 200,000 lambda-bearing B lymphocytes per mm3 in the peripheral blood and closely resembled a human chronic lymphocytic leukemia patient, the studies described suggest that this murine B cell neoplasm is a lymphoma with a striking predilection for splenic involvement.

Direct demonstration that the response was due to tumor cell activation and not that of contaminating normal B lymphocytes was provided by karyotype analysis and by immunoprecipitation, which showed the restriction of light chains on secreted IgM molecules to the lambda isotype.","['Knapp, M R', 'Severinson-Gronowicz, E', 'Schroder, J', 'Strober, S']","['Knapp MR', 'Severinson-Gronowicz E', 'Schroder J', 'Strober S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '60-24-2 (Mercaptoethanol)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Hemolytic Plaque Technique', 'Immunoglobulin M/*biosynthesis', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*pharmacology', 'Male', 'Mercaptoethanol/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mitosis', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Time Factors']",,1979/09/01 00:00,1979/09/01 00:01,['1979/09/01 00:00'],"['1979/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1979 Sep;123(3):1000-6.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Modified in vitro induction of banding and uncoiling has been used to produce chromosomal slides from human neoplastic cells of granulopoietic origin. The chromosomes are well spread and appear either long, thin and segmented or uncoiled. It is suggested that it is the combined action of the prolonged fixation used, and the in vitro induction, which leads to the observed structural alteration of the chromosomes. A method for increasing the yield of metaphase cells when working with bone marrow has been developed on the basis of culturing the granulopoietic cells in medium containing colony stimulating factor (CSF). Comparative analysis of metaphases from primary and secondary cultures of bone marrow cells showed that the culturing conditions for the secondary cultures do not induce chromosome abnormalities in the cells during the growth period.","['Ronne, M']",['Ronne M'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cytobios,Cytobios,0207227,"['0 (Acetates)', '0 (Fixatives)', 'Y4S76JWI15 (Methanol)']",IM,"['Acetates', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosomes/*ultrastructure', '*Cytological Techniques', 'Fixatives', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Metaphase', 'Methanol']",,1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytobios. 1978;22(87-88):191-211.,0011-4529 (Print) 0011-4529 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Few cases were clearly positive for mu. The picture was invariably monoclonal with respect to light chains. Cytoplasmic Ig was present in only 3/15 cases; it was always IgM. HC did not form E-rosettes or react with a fluorescent anti-T cell antiserum. No EAIgMC-rosettes were formed. All cases showed Fc receptors, which were detected with EAIgG-rosettes (13/13) or with antigen-antibody complexes (6/6). The density of Fc receptors varied widely. Incubation with latex particles resulted in cell-associated particles in 16-63% of the HC; with Staphylococcus epidermidis, the percentage was 2-36. After enzyme treatment (lysostaphin), however, no ingested bacteria were found, which suggests that HC are essentially non-phagocytic.

For the infants, the dyadic relationship with the mothering figure, the feelings of the family about the fact of genetic transmission, and the impact of isolation on the infant's development are identified as important psychosocial variables in the infant's adjustment.

Two cases represented an unusual pattern of appearance and disappearance of the Ph1-positive clone during their clinical courses: Case No. 2 was originally Ph1-positive (46,XY,Ph1) but two months before his expiration the Ph1-positive clone was completely replaced by a newly developed Ph1-negative clone with an abnormal chromosome No. 21 (46,XY,21q+), whereas case No. 3, primarily Ph1-negative, developed a Ph1-positive clone among the previously karyotypically normal cells one month before death.

Using sensitive analytic techniques including specific antisera and Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS-1), further definition of the abnormal cell was achieved. Four different antisera were used in infestigating the cell surface characteristics of these patients: anti-p23,30, an antiserum reactive with B cells and a subset of monocytes, anti-311, which reacts only with T cells, pepsin digested anti-F(ab')2 which reacts with B cells only and pepsin digested anti-lysozyme reactive with monocytes and myeloid cells, but not with B or T cells. In all cases strong reactivity was observed with anti-p23,30 and anti-F(ab')2, but no reactivity with anti-311. Five out of the seven cases were reactive with anti-lysozyme in a pattern similar to normal monocytes. Furthermore, when cells were separated according to binding to anti-p23,30, anti-F(ab')2 and anti-lysozyme and in two cases, according to cell size, the majority of reactivity and large cells were ""hairy"" when examined under microscopy. In contrast, the small and nonreactive (dull cells) appeared as normal mature lymphocytes. Thus, our data supports the view that HCL cells bear in most cases B cell and monocytic membrane markers.","['Yanovich, S', 'Marks, S M', 'Rosenthal, D S', 'Moloney, W C', 'Schlossman, S F']","['Yanovich S', 'Marks SM', 'Rosenthal DS', 'Moloney WC', 'Schlossman SF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic', 'Antilymphocyte Serum', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/*immunology', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Fab Fragments', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Monocytes/*immunology', 'Muramidase/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1979/06/01 00:00,1979/06/01 00:01,['1979/06/01 00:00'],"['1979/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1979 Jun;43(6):2348-51. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197906)43:6<2348::aid-cncr2820430627>3.0.co;2-t.,0008-543X (Print) 0008-543X (Linking),,['10.1002/1097-0142(197906)43:6<2348::aid-cncr2820430627>3.0.co;2-t [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

No correlation with graft outcome.,13-7,"Serum samples from 66 recipients of first cadaver donor renal transplants were screened for cytotoxic antibodies to normal T and B lymphocytes and B lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia patients. In addition, the sera of 44 patients were tested with the B lymphocytes of their respective donors. Donor-specific antibodies were found in 10 of 16 (63%) recipients who had lost their transplant within 2 months, and in 17 of 28 (61%) patients with functioning transplants at 2 months. No correlation was found between the development of B lymphocyte antibodies (either against the panel or the donor) and the onset of an acute rejection episode. In the 17 patients with a successful transplant and donor-specific antibodies, six (35%) had not experienced a rejection episode and another seven patients developed their antibodies after the appearance of the first rejection episode. Thus, our results show that the appearance of donor-specific B lymphocyte antibodies after transplantation is not indicative of graft failure or predictive of acute rejection episodes. However, the common occurrence of such antibodies raises questions concerning the nature of the antigenic stimulus, the specificity of the antibodies, and their role (if any) in transplantation.","['Ting, A', 'Morris, P J']","['Ting A', 'Morris PJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",IM,"['Antibodies/*immunology', '*Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Blood Transfusion', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft Survival', 'HLA Antigens/immunology', 'Humans', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1979/07/01 00:00,1979/07/01 00:01,['1979/07/01 00:00'],"['1979/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1979 Jul;28(1):13-7. doi: 10.1097/00007890-197907000-00004.,0041-1337 (Print) 0041-1337 (Linking),,['10.1097/00007890-197907000-00004 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Phaenotyping of leukaemic cells in 138 patients via different immunmarkers has so far allowed subdivision into 6 subgroups. Clinical risk factors and correlations with the immunologically defined subgroups, as well as their significance for prognosis, are demonstrated with the help of 61 examined ALL patients. 90-95% of all acute lymphatic leukaemias can presently be identified via heterologous antisera. After corresponding absorption, these antisera show high cytotoxicity against ALL cells without displaying any aggressivity towards normal haemopoetic stem cells. The authors make therapeutic use of anti-T cell and anti-common ALL (cALL) globulin in autologous bone marrow transplantation. This method involves withdrawal of bone marrow from patients with ALL in complete remission, the marrow being then fractionated, treated with antiserum to destroy residual leukaemic cells, and then cryopreserved. The leukaemia-free bone marrow will thus be available for transplantation in relapse.","['Netzel, B', 'Rodt, H', 'Thiel, E', 'Haas, R J', 'Thierfelder, S']","['Netzel B', 'Rodt H', 'Thiel E', 'Haas RJ', 'Thierfelder S']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,['0 (Immune Sera)'],IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Humans', '*Immune Sera', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/therapy', 'Phenotype', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",,1979/03/01 00:00,1979/03/01 00:01,['1979/03/01 00:00'],"['1979/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1979 Mar;191(2):175-81.,0300-8630 (Print) 0300-8630 (Linking),Neuere Aspekte zur Anwendung spezifischer Antiseren bei der Diagnose und Therapie der akuten lymphatischen Leukamie im Kindesalter.,,,,,,,,,,,

Evidence for a precursor role of arachidonic acid and further purification.,2090-5,"The generation of slow reacting substance (SRS) from ionophore A23187-stimulated rat peritoneal mast cells was enhanced by arachidonic acid (AA). This SRS generation was inhibited by 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), an acetylenic analogue of AA and an inhibitor of both fatty acid cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. Indomethacin, a fatty acid cyclooxgenase inhibitor, had an enhancing effect upon SRS generation. This suggests SRS generation occurred through an ETYA sensitive step--perhaps a lipoxygenase. Radiolabel from [14C]-AA was incorporated into SRS with comigration of radioactivity and bioreactivity in silicic acid and thin layer chromatographies. Upon silicic acid chromatography, the active principle was eluted in the methanol fraction. Two-dimensional thin layer chromatography revealed chromatographic separation from other known spasmogenic substances and phospholipids. Mast cell SRS was found to display physiochemical properties similar to those of rat basophilic leukemia cell SRS, namely: that mast cell SRS generation was 1) enhanced by arachidonic acid; 2) inhibited by ETYA but not by indomethacin; 3) incorporation of [14C]-AA into the active principle; and 4) similar behavior during purification in silicic acid and thin layer chromatographies.","['Yecies, L D', 'Johnson, S M', 'Wedner, H J', 'Parker, C W']","['Yecies LD', 'Johnson SM', 'Wedner HJ', 'Parker CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '0 (SRS-A)', '1191-85-1 (5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic Acid)', '1343-98-2 (Silicic Acid)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)']",IM,"['5,8,11,14-Eicosatetraynoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arachidonic Acids/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Basophils/immunology', 'Calcimycin/*pharmacology', 'Chromatography', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mast Cells/*immunology', 'Rats', 'SRS-A/biosynthesis/*isolation & purification', 'Silicic Acid', 'Time Factors']",,1979/05/01 00:00,1979/05/01 00:01,['1979/05/01 00:00'],"['1979/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1979 May;122(5):2090-5.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

This may indicate different mechanisms of cell killing above and below this temperature. With all cell lines tested, M- and S-phase cells were much more heat sensitive than were G1 or G2 cells. The heat sensitivity of S-phase cells is in contrast to the resistance of these cells to X-rays. The effect of hyperthermia on cell progression is discussed.

The two dyes constitute an ideal donor-acceptor pair for fluorescence resonance energy transfer thereby permitting the determination of the proximity relationships between bound ligand molecules and the corresponding surface receptors. The transfer efficiency at saturation (about 57%) was measured in a multiparameter flow system using laser excitation at 488 nm and detection of fluorescein and rhodamine emission intensities as well as the emission anisotropy of the rhodamine fluorescence for each cell. The degree of energy transfer was estimated from the quenching of donor emission, the sensitization of acceptor emission, and the depolarization of acceptor fluorescence. The system has been modeled according to a formalism developed by Gennis and Cantor (Biochemistry 11: 2509, 1972).

373811,NLM,MEDLINE,19790725,20071115,34,4,1978 Dec,The analysis of failure times in the presence of competing risks.,541-54,"Distinct problems in the analysis of failure times with competing causes of failure include the estimation of treatment or exposure effects on specific failure types, the study of interrelations among failure types, and the estimation of failure rates for some causes given the removal of certain other failure types. The usual formation of these problems is in terms of conceptual or latent failure times for each failure type. This approach is criticized on the basis of unwarranted assumptions, lack of physical interpretation and identifiability problems. An alternative approach utilizing cause-specific hazard functions for observable quantities, including time-dependent covariates, is proposed. Cause-specific hazard functions are shown to be the basic estimable quantities in the competing risks framework. A method, involving the estimation of parameters that relate time-dependent risk indicators for some causes to cause-specific hazard functions for other causes, is proposed for the study of interrelations among failure types. Further, it is argued that the problem of estimation of failure rates under the removal of certain causes is not well posed until a mechanism for cause removal is specified. Following such a specification, one will sometimes be in a position to make sensible extrapolations from available data to situations involving cause removal. A clinical program in bone marrow transplantation for leukemia provides a setting for discussion and illustration of each of these ideas. Failure due to censoring in a survivorship study leads to further discussion.","['Prentice, R L', 'Kalbfleisch, J D', 'Peterson, A V Jr', 'Flournoy, N', 'Farewell, V T', 'Breslow, N E']","['Prentice RL', 'Kalbfleisch JD', 'Peterson AV Jr', 'Flournoy N', 'Farewell VT', 'Breslow NE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biometrics,Biometrics,0370625,,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Epidemiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', '*Models, Biological', 'Mortality', 'Regression Analysis', 'Risk', '*Statistics as Topic', 'Time Factors']",,1978/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1978/12/01 00:00'],"['1978/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1978/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biometrics. 1978 Dec;34(4):541-54.,0006-341X (Print) 0006-341X (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

In three patients the diagnosis of acute leukemia was made less than six months after the first exposure to immunosuppressive drugs and was, therefore, considered coincidental.

The underlying diagnoses in most of the 58 patients were rheumatoid arthritis or renal disease or renal transplant. Thirty patients had received alkylating agents exclusively, 10 had received antimetabolites only, while the remaining 18 patients had received multiple therapeutic modalities including antimetabolites, alkylating agents, and/or radiation. Most patients had also received large amounts of corticosteroids.

By screening a variety of parameters, including media, sera, effusion fluids, feeder layers, and chemical supplements, the nutritive growth requirements of lymphoma cells obtained from malignant effusions and lymph node biopsies were determined for each tumor. Most of these cell lines initially required human skin fibroblast or epithelial cell feeder layers from which they could be weaned after one to six weeks in culture and maintained in Roswell Park Memorial Institute Tissue Culture Medium 1640 containing 20% fetal calf serum and 10% pooled human serum. Several of these cell lines were successfully cloned on 0.5% Noble agar substrates. In the presence of human serum and selected feeder monolayers, cloning efficiencies increased significantly from less than 1% to 15 to 25%. In addition, the cloning efficiencies of certain cell lines showed a concentration-dependent increase with specific chemical supplements including L-cysteine and dithiothreitol. Placental colony-stimulating factor, nerve growth factor, epithelial growth factor, and fibroblastic growth factor were ineffective in augmenting the cloning efficiencies of the human lymphoma cell lines. After a single passage on agar, cells subpassaged from visible colonies showed markedly increased cloning efficiencies to levels as high as 50%. Such cloning efficiencies, coupled with the use of replica plating, make this technique applicable to genetic and quantitative radiobiological, immunological, and chemotherapeutic studies. Although these methods have thus far been used only with lymphoreticular tumors, they may also be applicable to the cell culture of other human neoplasms and normal tissues.","['Epstein, A L', 'Kaplan, H S']","['Epstein AL', 'Kaplan HS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,['0 (Culture Media)'],IM,"['Burkitt Lymphoma/pathology', '*Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Culture Media', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', '*Lymphoma/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Methods', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/pathology']",,1979/05/01 00:00,1979/05/01 00:01,['1979/05/01 00:00'],"['1979/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1979 May;39(5):1748-59.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Surface probes for cell differentiation.,124-30,"Of particular interest in the study of cell membrane markers of leukemic cells were cytotoxic and immunofluorescent results obtained in comparing Ia alloantigen and complement receptor (CR) expression on normal leukocytic and leukemic cell types. Using discontinuous Ficoll gradients, Ia alloantigens were found on varying numbers of leukemic myelo- and lymphoblasts, and on the early stages of normal melocytes. Ia alloantigens, however, were not detectable on mature polymorphonuclear cells. This establishes human Ia alloantigens as cell surface differentiation markers. The appearance of complement receptors was observed later than that of Ia alloantigens. CR1 (EAC1-4b) showed up later in the differentiation than CR2 (EAC1-3d). Thus, an immunological discrimination between AML blasts and CML blast crisis blasts appears to be possible: AML blasts are mostly Ia-positive but CR-negative, whilst CML blast crisis cells are only 20-30% Ia-positive and carry complement receptors in at least equal amounts. The AML blast cell would appear as the less-differentiated cell type when compared to the CML blast crisis cells. The picture, however, remains complex since in CML blast crisis at least three different types of blast cells can be identified: an Ia-positive and an Ia-negative myeloid blast as well as an Ia-positive lymphoid blast. The quantitative composition of these three elements within the myeloid differentiation profile can vary somewhat from patient to patient. Furthermore, these studies revealed a disturbed differentiation of leukemic cell types.","['Barth, P', 'Schunter, F', 'Wilms, K', 'Waller, H D', 'Wernet, P']","['Barth P', 'Schunter F', 'Wilms K', 'Waller HD', 'Wernet P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Bibl Haematol,Bibliotheca haematologica,0372513,"['0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Separation', '*Complement System Proteins', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Isoantigens/*analysis', 'Leukemia/*blood', 'Leukocytes/*immunology', 'Lymphoma/*blood', 'Receptors, Drug/*analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Bibl Haematol. 1978;45:124-30. doi: 10.1159/000402193.,0067-7957 (Print) 0067-7957 (Linking),,['10.1159/000402193 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The effect of chemotherapy on urinary AIC was studied comparing patients on vincristine and prednisone (V+P) with those on 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide (Triple Rx). Patients in remission on Triple Rx had lower levels of urinary AIC than did patients on Triple Rx in relapse or patients on V+P in either remission or relapse.

The activity of TF was measured by leukocyte migration inhibitory test (LMIT). The LMIT was a modification of the conventional agarose droplet method. To express the activity of LMIF quantitatively and simply, LMIF titer was introduced. The LMIF titer was obtained from the combination of two factors, LMIF dilution and cell migration diameter, and therefore this made the LMIT much more sensitive as compared to the conventional LMIT. The responsiveness of lymphocytes from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and from cell-mediated immunodeficiency in children to TF was assayed by LMIT. In ALL, the lymphocyte responsiveness was poor in relapse but improved with remission. The responsiveness was remarkably well in 3 patients with cell-mediated immunodeficiency. This method appears useful for the in vitro evaluation of responsiveness of lymphocytes to TF.","['Miyagawa, Y', 'Kawasaki, A', 'Komiyama, A', 'Akabane, T']","['Miyagawa Y', 'Kawasaki A', 'Komiyama A', 'Akabane T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Australia,Microbiol Immunol,Microbiology and immunology,7703966,"['0 (Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors)', '0 (Transfer Factor)']",IM,"['*Cell Migration Inhibition', 'Cell Movement', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', '*Leukocytes', '*Lymphocytes', 'Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors/biosynthesis', 'Transfer Factor/*pharmacology']",,1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Microbiol Immunol. 1978;22(11):701-10. doi: 10.1111/j.1348-0421.1978.tb00423.x.,0385-5600 (Print) 0385-5600 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1348-0421.1978.tb00423.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

All procedures have been performed under anesthesia with intravenously administered ketamine, without endotracheal intubation. A definitive diagnosis has been made in every case, with pneumonia due to Pneumocystis carinii being identified in 18 instances. Complications have been minimal and include four minor pneumothoraces, two instances of bleeding, and two instances of prolonged air leak. Mortality attributable to the procedure has been nil, although five patients have died due to their underlying diseases within 30 days of the thoracoscopic procedure.

Ionizing radiation poses some risk no matter how small the dose. 2. Concepts about the viral etiology of cancer have had to be adapted to fit observations in children concerning candidate viruses. 3. Transplacental chemical carcinogenesis has become a reality and poses an increasing threat as chemical pollution worsens. 4. Questions have been raised about the risk of breast feeding in (at present) rare instances when the mother has been heavily exposed to chemicals that are excreted in the fat of breast milk. 5. A few drugs administered to children induce cancers within the pediatric age-span. The pediatrician must take action not only against exogenous agents that induce cancer while the patient is under his care, but also against exposures that begin in utero and lie latent or accumulate throughout life to give rise to cancers in the years or decades ahead. There is much more to carcinogenesis than the effects of the environment. Important information has been gained about the origins of cancer and about human biology in general through studies of children who are unusually susceptible to certain forms of neoplasia. Knowing the mechanisms involved may lead to new modes of treatment, to screening tests for environmental carcinogens or to methods for detecting cancer early enough for treatment to be life-saving.","['Miller, R W']",['Miller RW'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Adv Pediatr,Advances in pediatrics,0370436,"['0 (Carcinogens, Environmental)', '1332-21-4 (Asbestos)', '731DCA35BT (Diethylstilbestrol)']",IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Animals', 'Asbestos/adverse effects', 'Breast Neoplasms/etiology', 'Carcinogens, Environmental/*adverse effects', 'Child', 'Diethylstilbestrol/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/*etiology/genetics', 'Parasitic Diseases/complications', 'Pregnancy', '*Radiation Effects', 'Radiation, Ionizing/adverse effects', 'Skin Neoplasms/etiology', 'Thoracic Neoplasms/etiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/etiology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*etiology', 'Vaginal Neoplasms/chemically induced']",130,1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Adv Pediatr. 1978;25:97-119.,0065-3101 (Print) 0065-3101 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

368670,NLM,MEDLINE,19790425,20190509,3,3,1978 Nov-Dec,Unique aspects of central nervous system immunology.,419-30,"In this review the authors discuss three immunologically unique aspects of the central nervous system (CNS). The first relates to whether the CNS is really an immunologically privileged site. Although still somewhat controversial, the answer to that question is that the CNS is, to a large extent, an immunologically privileged site. The second unique aspect of the CNS is the origin and significance of the microglial cell. Some microglial cells seem to originate from the systemic circulation, whereas other microglial cells seem to have a primary CNS origin. The function of the microglial cell is that of a macrophage. In addition it may play an important role in the immune response of the CNS. Present evidence suggests that the microglial cell can be classified as a lymphoreticular cell and as such is the only member of this cell type present in the CNS under normal circumstances. The final unique aspect of the central nervous system is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Under normal circumstances this fluid is essentially acellular, and the only immunoglobulins present are those that are passively derived by diffusion from the systemic circulation. However, in pathological situations (i.e., demyelinating diseases, infections, and possibly even tumors) a local immune response occurs within the CNS and can result in the production of immunoglobulins. At present the detection of such local immune responses in CSF is predominately of diagnostic value only. However, these local CNS immune responses almost certainly play an important role in the pathogenesis of the diseases in which they occur.","['Neuwelt, E A', 'Clark, W K']","['Neuwelt EA', 'Clark WK']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Neurosurgery,Neurosurgery,7802914,['0 (Immunoglobulins)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Blood-Brain Barrier', 'Brain/*immunology', 'Brain Diseases/immunology', 'Brain Neoplasms/immunology', 'Central Nervous System/immunology', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neuroglia/*immunology', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Sepsis/complications', 'Skin Transplantation', 'Transplantation Immunology']",41,1978/11/01 00:00,1978/11/01 00:01,['1978/11/01 00:00'],"['1978/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Neurosurgery. 1978 Nov-Dec;3(3):419-30. doi: 10.1227/00006123-197811000-00018.,0148-396X (Print) 0148-396X (Linking),,['10.1227/00006123-197811000-00018 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,
368507,NLM,MEDLINE,19790428,20211203,58,1,1979 Jan,Infectious complications of human bone marrow transplantation.,1-31,"Infections are an almost inevitable complication of human bone marrow transplantation and account for the majority of deaths in transplant recipients. Even prior to the initiation of the transplantation procedure, patients may present with infections complicating previously unsuccessful chemotherapy for hematological malignancy or aplastic anemia. Nevertheless, these pre-transplantation infections should not exclude the possibility of bone marrow transplantation if they can be successfully controlled with specific antimicrobial therapy and necessary adjunctive measures. The immediate post-transplantation period prior to engraftment is characterized by severe marrow aplasia that results from high-dose chemotherapy and total-body irradiation. Infections are primarily septicemias and localized processes caused by bacteria and fungi and their incidence increases as the intensity of immunosuppression is escalated. The high mortality associated with bacterial septicemia makes early, empirical antibacterial therapy mandatory. However, the reduction in mortality from bacterial infection resulting from such an aggressive approach may be offset by a higher mortality from invasive fungal infection, especially in patients with prior fungal colonization and undergoing prolonged conditioning therapy. Thus, until more specific and sensitive tests for the diagnosis of invasive fungal infection become available, empirical intravenous amphotericin should be considered in patients who are persistently febrile and deteriorate clinically in the face of appropriate antibacterial therapy. Interstitial pneumonia associated with severe GVHD is the major infectious complication after successful marrow engraftment and is the most significant barrier to long-term survival. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is effective prophylaxis against interstitial pneumonia due to Pneumocystis carinii, but one half of the patients still develop a pneumonitis either associated with CMV or of unknown etiology. Mortality from interstitial pneumonia is related to prior radiation therapy while survival is associated with a four-fold rise in CMV CF antibody titer. The latter observation supports the need to investigate passive immunization with CMV antibody as a means of preventing some interstitial pneumonias. Despite the progress made in many areas of human bone marrow transplantation, the majority of graft recipients still die of infectious complications. Thus, new approaches to the management of infections in transplant recipients are urgently needed. Better-tolerated oral nonabsorbable antibiotics, laminar-air-flow rooms, granulocyte transfusions, and chemotherapy and immunotherapy for CMV are among the prophylactic and therapeutic measures that must be critically evaluated in well-controlled, prospective studies. Continued assessment of the infectious complications of bone marrow transplantation is a critical aspect of any ongoing transplant program, not just a research goal...","['Winston, D J', 'Gale, R P', 'Meyer, D V', 'Young, L S']","['Winston DJ', 'Gale RP', 'Meyer DV', 'Young LS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Medicine (Baltimore),Medicine,2985248R,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Anemia, Aplastic/immunology/*therapy', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology/mortality/therapy', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Infections/*etiology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycoses/etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Pneumonia/etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Pneumonia, Pneumocystis/etiology/mortality/therapy', 'Transplantation, Homologous/adverse effects', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic/adverse effects']",76,1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Medicine (Baltimore). 1979 Jan;58(1):1-31. doi: 10.1097/00005792-197901000-00001.,0025-7974 (Print) 0025-7974 (Linking),,['10.1097/00005792-197901000-00001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The definition of bad-prognosis patients has been improved and includes those with T-ALL, ABLL, and Ph1+ALL, in addition to those presenting with evidence of extensive disease. In contrast to childhood ALL, induction chemotherapy should include another drug (or drugs) in addition to VCR and prednisolone, and one of the anthracycline drugs (ADR or DNR) has been employed most frequently in this context. Such therapy should result in a CR rate of 70 to 75%. Similar to the experience in childhood ALL, the improvement in haematological response rate has led to an apparent increase in CNS leukaemia, and the need for adequate CNS prophylaxis is stressed. Despite these improvements, the outlook for adults with ALL is not yet as good as it is for childhood ALL. Controlled studies involving large numbers of patients are urgently needed to provide answers to a number of questions. In induction therapy, the use of higher drug dosage, the use of more and other drugs, and the use of an individual patient's risk factors to determine drug dosage, must be assessed. The benefits of consolidation therapy and the optimal duration and intensity of maintenance therapy have yet to be established. Methods of CNS prophylaxis other than cranial irradiation and IT MTX must be carefully studied. These important questions require that adult patients with ALL should be concentrated in centres capable of providing optimal overall care and, at the same time, able to conduct the necessary clinical trials.","['Woodruff, R']",['Woodruff R'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Cancer Treat Rev,Cancer treatment reviews,7502030,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/prevention & control/therapy', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/etiology/pathology/*therapy', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",174,1978/06/01 00:00,1978/06/01 00:01,['1978/06/01 00:00'],"['1978/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rev. 1978 Jun;5(2):95-113. doi: 10.1016/s0305-7372(78)80009-7.,0305-7372 (Print) 0305-7372 (Linking),,"['S0305-7372(78)80009-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0305-7372(78)80009-7 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

The 4-drug programs gave significantly higher frequency of complete remissions (BOPP 67%, MOPP 63%) than the 3-drug regimens (BOP 40%, OPP 42%), and significantly longer duration of remission and survival. BOPP had a therapeutic activity equal to MOPP, and was accompanied by less toxicity.

She entered complete remission with an adriamycin, vincristine, cytosine arabinoside, and prednisone combination. Bone marrow remission was maintained with intermittent cytosine arabinoside; however, she developed large skin nodules which partly remitted following adriamycin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone combination. They very rapidly recurred, and she died soon after. Autopsy revealed extensive tumor in the abdomen, pelvis, and thoracic cavity, but no bone marrow involvement. Histology revealed a ""starry sky"" appearance. Cytology showed undifferentiated cells with vacuolated cytoplasm resembling Burkitt lymphoma cells. Peroxidase and esterase stains were negative. There was strong pyroninophilia and the periodic acid-Schiff reaction showed granular activity in the cytoplasm. Electron microscopic appearances also resembled Burkitt lymphoma. Cytogenetic studies were normal, with no Ph1 chromosome. Immunofluorescence demonstrated surface IgM and a little IgA. 3H-thymidine incorporation was high, indicating rapid growth. Dibutyral cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) stimulated growth, which was further evidence of the lymphoid origin of the tumor. The close resemblance of this tumor to Burkitt lymphoma emphasizes the difficulties in systematically classifying the lymphomas.","['Shaw, M T', 'Palmer, C', 'Yuhas, J M', 'Rembe, A', 'Robertson, G', 'Bankhurst, A D']","['Shaw MT', 'Palmer C', 'Yuhas JM', 'Rembe A', 'Robertson G', 'Bankhurst AD']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', '*B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*diagnosis', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*complications', 'Lymphoma/*complications/ultrastructure', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell']",,1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1978;5(2):155-62. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830050212.,0361-8609 (Print) 0361-8609 (Linking),,['10.1002/ajh.2830050212 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In the present paper, the main Ig-producing entities are considered. These are: 1. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia of the B-type (B-CLL)--a proliferation of lymphocytes and a few so-called prolymphocytes and lymphoblasts. The mean tissue IgM value is slightly increased; the serum IgM level is normal or reduced. The tumor cells bear SIg, and a majority of them have a receptor for C3d but always lack CIg and are usually devoid of receptors for C3b. 2. Lymphoplasmacytoid immunocytoma--a mixed proliferation of lymphocytes and centrocytes, blast cells, plasma cells, or plasmacytoid cells. The tissue Ig content is most often (91%) and most highly increased in this group, whereas the serum Ig level is increased in only 20% of the cases. The tissue IgM of 17 cases was shown to be monoclonal by IEF. Most tumor cells have SIg and a variable numbear CIg. The tumor cells bear both complement receptor subtypes, only a receptor for C3b, or no complement receptors at all. 3. Centroblastic/centrocytic lymphoma--usually a follicular proliferation of abundant small germinal center cells (centrocytes) and some large germinal center cells (centroblasts). The tumor cells bear SIg and both complement receptor subtypes. The C3b- and C3d-positive cells are located in the follicles, as in nonneoplastic lymphatic tissue. 4. Centrocytic lymphoma--a purebred, diffuse proliferation of the small germinal center cells (centrocytes). These cells bear SIg and receptors for C3b and C3d but usually lack CIg. 5. Centroblastic lymphoma--a proliferation of the large germinal center cells (centroblasts). 6. Lymphoblastic lymphoma of Burkitt's type. 7. Immunoblastic lymphoma--a diffuse proliferation of large basophillic cells resembling immunoblasts. The tissue IgM content is increased in 60% of the cases. It proved to be monoclonal with IEF in all five cases studied. The cells of five cases with increased tissue Ig content bore SIg. Nearly half of the cases studied showed CIg. Besides non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, paraffin sections of 87 biopsies from Hodgkin's disease were investigated for CIg in Hodgkin's and Sternberg-Reed cells. These cells stained positively in 68 cases, most often for IgG, followed by IgD. In five cases of the lymphocyte-depleted type, the staining of the Hodgkin's and Sternberg-Reed cells was restricted to one light chain type.","['Stein, H', 'Papadimitriou, C S', 'Bouman, H', 'Lennert, K', 'Fuchs, J']","['Stein H', 'Papadimitriou CS', 'Bouman H', 'Lennert K', 'Fuchs J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

Treatment of leukemic spleen cells with DNase I prior to coculture with normal AKR cells abrogates their suppressive ability. Treatment of leukemic cells with a wide range of DNase I concentrations has no effect on the viability of these cells as measured by incorporation of [(3)H]thymidine or by eosin dye exclusion. When the activating divalent cations required for DNase I action are functionally removed in the enzyme treatment medium by chelation with EDTA, the ability of DNase I to abrogate suppression is abolished. Furthermore, the effects of DNase I in overcoming suppression are not able to be mimicked by trypsin, Pronase, or ribonuclease. These results are consistent with the existence of a population of cells in the leukemic spleen that expresses a form of membrane-associated DNA that functions in the suppression of normal antibody responses. The existence of such a population was shown by treating leukemic spleen cells with anti-single-stranded-DNA and then passing them through an anti-immunoglobulin immunoadsorption column. Approximately 15% of the leukemic cells are retained on the column and can be specifically eluted with the normal immunoglobulin. The cells of this enriched population when cocultured with normal spleen cells exhibit a 10-fold greater suppressive ability than unfractionated cells. Thus, there exists in the spleens of overtly leukemic AKR mice a population of cells expressing a form of DNA on their surfaces that in some manner is necessary for immunosuppression.","['Russell, J L', 'Golub, E S']","['Russell JL', 'Golub ES']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antibodies, Antinuclear)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 3.1.- (Deoxyribonucleases)', 'EC 3.1.- (Ribonucleases)', 'EC 3.4.- (Peptide Hydrolases)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Antinuclear', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'DNA/*immunology', 'Deoxyribonucleases/metabolism', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR/*immunology', 'Peptide Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Ribonucleases/metabolism', 'Spleen/immunology']",,1978/12/01 00:00,1978/12/01 00:01,['1978/12/01 00:00'],"['1978/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1978 Dec;75(12):6211-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.75.12.6211.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),,['10.1073/pnas.75.12.6211 [doi]'],PMC393149,,,,,,,,,

Well known examples for CNS disease of nonleukemic origin are somnolence following prophylactic CNS irradiation, methotrexate-induced encephalopathy and acute infections caused by bacteria, viruses and toxoplasma gondii. Less known is the fact that also subacute CNS infections may occur in patients undergoing cytostatic therapy. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) are examples of this category of disease. Up to now 11 well documented cases of SSPE were reported occurring during treatment of ALL. Main clinical features were disorders of behaviour, consciousness and speach, seizures, paresis and inappropriate secretion of ADH. Several authors were able to demonstrate a deficiency of cellular immunity in patients with SSPE. In some cases this deficiency was consistent with reduced reactivity of T-lymphocytes against measles antigen only. The presence of inhibiting factors may be responsible for this phenomenon. Other authors found a normal or increased function of cellular immunity in SSPE; In hamsters occurrence of SSPE is induced by the simultaneous injection of hamster-adapted SSPE virus and antihamster lymphocyte serum. We, therefore, conclude that also in humans SSPE appearing during treatment of ALL is due to immunosuppression.","['Terheggen, H G', 'Lowenthal, A']","['Terheggen HG', 'Lowenthal A']",['ger'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,Monatsschrift fur Kinderheilkunde,0400751,,IM,"['Animals', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cricetinae', 'Encephalitis/chemically induced', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunosuppression Therapy/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis/*chemically induced', 'T-Lymphocytes']",77,1978/12/01 00:00,1978/12/01 00:01,['1978/12/01 00:00'],"['1978/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Monatsschr Kinderheilkd. 1978 Dec;126(12):702-8.,,Cerebrale Komplikationen der Leukamiebehandlung.

The presence of spectrin, an erythrocyte membrane protein, has been investigated in untreated and in DMSO-treated FLC by indirect immunofluorescence and by analysis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of low-ionic-strength cell extracts immunoprecipitated with a monospecific anti-spectrin serum. Spectrin is detectable in significant amounts in the ""inducible"" clones prior to DMSO stimulation, and accumulates 4- to 5-fold upon addition of this compound to the cultures. Spectrin accumulation occurs rather early (24 hours after cell seeding) and reaches its peak on the third day to decline thereafter.

Spectrin is also detectable in very low amounts in an ""uninducible"" line of FLC, and is not accumulated upon DMSO treatment thereof, whereas treatment with hemin does cause a significant increase of spectrin-positive cells.

Proliferation and differentiation of granulocytic and monocytic progenitor and immature cells have been studied in detail and are regulated by stimulatory and inhibitory molecules produced and released from the progeny of the progenitor cells. The resultant interactions between cells and cell-derived molecules suggest operable positive and negative feed-back mechanisms during normal hematopoiesis, and what one sees in the end is the net result of these interactions. The complexities of cellular regulation are partially unravelled by physical separation of the different populations and biochemical analysis of the regulatory molecules. Subpopulations of granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (CFU-c) exist and evidence suggests that they vary in responsiveness to different molecules. Stimulatory molecules are themselves chemically and physically heterogenous and, until recently, believed to have similar biological actions, but this concept must be re-evaluated. Different molecules may activate different subsets of progenitor cells, and there is now a role for substances which enhance the stimulatory interactions. Many studies on normal and leukemic cell responsiveness to stimulation must be re-examined in light of this recent information. Several inhibitory substances operate during normal hematopoiesis. Mature granulocytes, progeny of CFU-c, appear to elaborate at least two inhibitory activities. One activity influences immature, recognizable granulocytes and the other indirectly reduces progenitor cell proliferation by decreasing the production and release of molecules which stimulate CFU-c. In addition, mononuclear phagocytes produce and release E-type prostaglandins in direct response to elevated levels of the stimulatory molecules and E-type prostaglandins counteract increased stimulatory levels by decreasing the sensitivity of CFU-c to stimulators. Much of our present level of sophistication derives from in vitro experimentation and it is apparent that we are only beginning to understand these inter-relationships and their relevance to the in vivo situation. However, these in vitro studies have shed light on the interactions occurring during leukemia. Leukemic cells retain the capacity to respond to normal regulators and must therefore be considered dependent rather than autonomous neoplasms. Abnormalities do exist in leukemic cell interactions: the progenitor cells themselves may be defective and leukemic cells may respond to molecules which normal cells do not. The degree of sensitivity to stimulators and inhibitors will have to be carefully investigated to determine if and what differences may exist between normal and leukemic cells. Normal mature granulocyte derived inhibitory activity is quantitatively deficient in leukemic cells but another inhibitory activity which appears to be specifically present in cells from patients with leukemia and some cases of myelodysplasia is present...","['Broxmeyer, H E', 'Moore, M A']","['Broxmeyer HE', 'Moore MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Prostaglandins E)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Cell Communication', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/pathology', '*Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/blood/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Leukocytes/*physiology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Monocytes/pathology', 'Prostaglandins E/physiology']",269,1978/10/27 00:00,1978/10/27 00:01,['1978/10/27 00:00'],"['1978/10/27 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/10/27 00:01 [medline]', '1978/10/27 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1978 Oct 27;516(2):129-66. doi: 10.1016/0304-419x(78)90006-9.,0006-3002 (Print) 0006-3002 (Linking),,"['0304-419X(78)90006-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0304-419x(78)90006-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

The latter consists of an open-ended plastic tube, an absorbent paper with a central hole, and a glass slide which are stuck to each other with double-sided plastic adhesive tape with a central hole of equal size. The chamber is set to allow 0.5 ml of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to be absorbed in 15--20 min. The principle of the sedimentation relies on the absorption of the fluid portion into the absorbent paper with the cellular elements sedimented onto the glass slide. Thin stationery paper is used as the absorbent material which controls sedimentation speed and minimizes cellular loss. 190 CSF specimens obtained from 28 patients with acute leukaemia were processed by this method. The results obtained showed that sedimentation using this simple chamber is quite reliable for the recognition of small number of abnormal cells in the CSF producing little or no noticeable cellular damage. This technique may be applied to other clinical situations in which fluid cytology is useful in establishing a diagnosis or in evaluating clinical progress.","['Nishimura, K', 'Hosoya, R', 'Nakajima, K']","['Nishimura K', 'Hosoya R', 'Nakajima K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Cerebrospinal Fluid/cytology', 'Child', 'Cytological Techniques/*instrumentation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*cerebrospinal fluid']",,1978/12/01 00:00,1978/12/01 00:01,['1978/12/01 00:00'],"['1978/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1978 Dec;40(4):583-6. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1978.tb05834.x.,0007-1048 (Print) 0007-1048 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1978.tb05834.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

However, the improvement in survival associated with more intensive chemotherapy was substantial only for patients who had favourable prognostic features at presentation, such as a normal total leucocyte count, or absence of palpable liver, or, especially, age under 40. Indeed, for patients under 40, those allocated to the more intensive regimen (TRAP) lived considerably longer than those allocated to BARTS III (P less than 0.002) while for patients over 40 there was no material difference in survival between patients on the 2 protocols.

Effects on spleen B lymphocytes.,679-87,"Splenic immune responses having varying dependence on accessory cell co-operation have been studied after infection of mice with Friend virus. Infection has no effect on cell proliferation or antibody production in cultures stimulated with E. coli lipopolysaccharide. The response in vivo to type III pneumococcal polysaccharide is depressed only moderately. The response to sheep red blood cells is depressed severely both in vivo and in vitro. Depression in vitro is greatly reduced by co-stimulation with E. coli lipopolysaccharide. Depletion of potential suppressor lymphocyte populations by irradiation or adult thymectomy does not ameliorate depression of responses to sheep red blood cells or pneumococcal polysaccharide. Responses after adult thymectomy plus irradiation are not affected by the virus. Although it is known that macrophage and helper T-lymphocyte co-operation are not themselves impaired by infection, these results suggest that there is a direct relationship between severity of immune depression and dependence on co-operation.

Despite these encouraging results, only a small number of patients will have such donors available. Immunosuppressive therapy has been considered as an alternative, but this treatment has high risk in older patients. Past studies with androgen therapy have reported a response rate at one year similar to the current recovery rates with bone marrow transplantation. However, contemporary reports have indicated a marked decrease in the recovery rate following androgens, and some of these comparisons may be related to differences in supportive transfusion therapy. In part, the decreased rates may be related to an inadequate evaluation of residual marrow function in the aplastic patient. Patients to be treated with androgens always should have a physiological evaluation of residual erythropoietic committed bone marrow cells. In the absence of such an erythropoietic nidus, one may anticipate a poor response to any steroid therapy. Supportive blood component transfusions should be provided, especially in the initial three months of androgen treatment. In past studies the majority of patients have received only oral androgens, predominantly oxymetholone. Other androgens may be more effective in a particular patient, and there is an urgent need to develop procedures that define stem cell receptors for specific testosterone preparations. Current investigations have indicated that the 5 beta steroid metabolites of testosterone are haematopoietic without the complication of virilization. It is anticipated that a variety of these metabolites can be prepared for evaluation in the patient with aplasia. While there is continuing evaluation of the immune responses and suppressive therapies the clinician should continue to treat the aplastic patient with vigorous supportive transfusion therapy and different androgens for comparative evaluation.","['Gardner, F H']",['Gardner FH'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,['0 (Androgens)'],IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Androgens/immunology/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications/diagnosis/*drug therapy', 'Animals', 'Child', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Hematopoiesis/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Rabbits', 'Rats']",65,1978/10/01 00:00,1978/10/01 00:01,['1978/10/01 00:00'],"['1978/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1978 Oct;7(3):571-85.,0308-2261 (Print) 0308-2261 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

These cells react abnormally with the activated components of complement, resulting in the clinical symptoms. The clone of stem cells characteristic of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria may arise spontaneously without demonstrable abnormalities of the other stem cells of the bone marrow. On the other hand, the abnormal stem cells of paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria may arise as part of a prior stem cell disorder. This is especially true for aplastic anaemia. The paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria stem cell may arise at any time during the evolution from aplasia through recovery and may disappear during full recovery of the bone marrow. The paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria stem cell may arise less commonly in other disorders of the stem cell, such as refractory anaemia with excess blasts, erythroleukaemia and myelofibrosis.

Because of its limited potency, it should not be used as primary treatment for malignant disease except as local immunotherapy for certain accessible tumors. It is effective for eradication of primary neoplasms of the skin as well as cutaneous metastases of malignant melanoma and breast carcinoma. The most important role for immunotherapy is in combination with other modalities. It may help control occult micrometastases that cause recurrence and death following surgical procedures or irradiation. Results of adjuvant immunotherapy appear promising for malignant melanoma, for carcinoma of the lung, breast, and colon, and for soft-tissue sarcomas. In combination with chemotherapy, immunotherapy appears to prolong remission and survival in acute myelogenous leukemia and in disseminated tumors of the lung and breast. Clearly, immunotherapy is not a panacea for malignant disease, but it could become an important arm in a multimodality attack on cancer.","['Morton, D L', 'Goodnight, J E Jr']","['Morton DL', 'Goodnight JE Jr']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Colonic Neoplasms/therapy', 'Female', 'Humans', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Lung Neoplasms/therapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma/therapy', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Sarcoma/therapy', 'Skin Neoplasms/therapy', 'Vaginal Neoplasms/therapy']",69,1978/11/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1978/11/01 00:00'],"['1978/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1978/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1978 Nov;42(5):2224-33. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197811)42:5<2224::aid-cncr2820420521>3.0.co;2-f.,0008-543X (Print) 0008-543X (Linking),,['10.1002/1097-0142(197811)42:5<2224::aid-cncr2820420521>3.0.co;2-f [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

L-asparginase seems to be an important component of drug combinations for re-induction therapy for systemic relapse. Following reinduction therapy modification of continuation therapy is necessary. Local relapses require local treatment, i.e. radiotherapy and e.g. intrathecal drug application. Local relapse is almost always followed by hematologic relapse. Therefore, intensification of systemic therapy is also recommended. Prevention of these relapses is much more important and probably more successful than treatment.

A concept of thymic compartmentalization is proposed with origin of germinal centers in the perivascular space (extraparenchymal compartment) of the thymus. These germinal centers contain a high percentage of B lymphocytes in contrast to the true thymic parenchyma. Although the significance of germinal centers in the thymus parenchyma. Although the significance of germinal centers in the thymus in myasthenia gravis remains controversial, removal of nonneoplastic thymus in this condition is of proven therapeutic value. A variety of neoplasms originating in the thymus have previously been lumped together under the single term ""thymoma."" It is apparent, however, that thymoma, thymic carcinoid, various lymphomas, and germ cell tumors that arise in the thymus differ not only pathologically but also in their clinical behavior. Thymoma is regarded as an epithelial neoplasm and ultrastucturally is characterized by many desmosomes and tonofilaments. The lymphocytes do not behave in a malignant manner, and lymphomas of the thymus should be sharply separated from true thymoma. Poorly differentiated thymic carcinoma and histiocytic lymphoma may be distinguishable only by the electron microscopic demonstration of desmosomes and filaments in the thymic carcinoma. The evidence that Hodgkin's disease of the thymus (""granulomatous thymoma"") is not a variant of thymoma appears overwhelming. Lymphoblastic lymphoma of the thymus is a distinctive neoplasm that is especially prevalent in teenage males. High levels of terminal transferase characterize the lymphoblasts and there is a striking tendency for leukemia to occur. Thymic carcinoid is usually nonfunctional, although one-third of the reported cases are associated with Cushing's syndrome. On light microscopy a ribbon pattern and punctate necroses are characteristic of thymic carcinoids. Electron microscopic demonstration of many dense core granules is invaluable in establishing this diagnosis. An important clue to the diagnosis of thymic seminoma (a neoplasm that shows the same radiosensitivity as its testicular counterpart) is the frequent presence of epithelioid and giant cell granulomas and germinal centers. Separation of the various thymic neoplasms described not only is justifiable on pathologic grounds but is often essential for appropriate patient investigation and treatment.","['Levine, G D', 'Rosai, J']","['Levine GD', 'Rosai J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Hum Pathol,Human pathology,9421547,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Animals', 'Carcinoma/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Dysgerminoma/pathology', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/pathology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Myasthenia Gravis/etiology/pathology', 'Rabbits', 'Thymoma/*pathology', 'Thymus Hyperplasia/complications/*pathology', 'Thymus Neoplasms/*pathology/ultrastructure']",,1978/09/01 00:00,1978/09/01 00:01,['1978/09/01 00:00'],"['1978/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hum Pathol. 1978 Sep;9(5):495-515. doi: 10.1016/s0046-8177(78)80131-2.,0046-8177 (Print) 0046-8177 (Linking),,"['S0046-8177(78)80131-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0046-8177(78)80131-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

361139,NLM,MEDLINE,19790124,20041117,51,610,1978 Oct,The current role of cancer chemotherapy.,756-70,"Cancer chemotherapy has developed rapidly over the last twenty years. The majority of patients with cancer die from metastatic disease, so the major therapeutic advance now must be better systemic therapy. From its early beginning in the 1940's with oestrogen therapy for prostatic cancer, nitrogen mustards in the lymphomas, and folic acid antagonists in childhood leukaemia, there are now between thirty and forty active anti-cancer agents in clinical use. The main clinical pharmacological points of the major agents are briefly reviewed, together with their main dose-limiting toxic effects and their activity as single agents. Clinical chemotherapy has developed by the introduction of newer agents from the drug screening programmes and a better understanding of the scheduling to avoid serious toxicity. Although drug-resistance is still a major problem, by combining different active agents there has been a dramatic improvement in survival of patients with selected tumours. More recently, treatment of patients early, before they have gross clinical recurrence, has already shown some benefit in pre-menopausal patients with carcinoma of the breast and in patients with osteosarcoma. The limitations of clinical measurements in monitoring therapy are clear, and a major improvement could well be realised if therapy could be monitored on the basis of quantitative markers. The clinical impact of cancer chemotherapy has already been dramatic in drug-sensitive tumours, but these only contribute a small proportion of the total. Some of the common tumours fall into the group that are relatively drug sensitive where the lives of patients can be prolonged, but there is still a significant fraction of tumours which are insensitive to existing drugs and which will probably require the development of newer agents before chemotherapy can make any impact on the survival of patients with these tumours.","['Newlands, E S']",['Newlands ES'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Br J Radiol,The British journal of radiology,0373125,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Hormones)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/therapeutic use', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents/classification/therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Hormones/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology/surgery']",60,1978/10/01 00:00,1978/10/01 00:01,['1978/10/01 00:00'],"['1978/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Radiol. 1978 Oct;51(610):756-70. doi: 10.1259/0007-1285-51-610-756.,0007-1285 (Print) 0007-1285 (Linking),,['10.1259/0007-1285-51-610-756 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The modal chromosome number of abnormal cells from these last seven patients was hypodiploid in two, hyperdiploid in four, and near-triploid in one. Complete banding studies of six cases and partial analysis of the seventh indicate that (1) every patient had a distinct cell line with common markers, with a few cells showing minor variants; (2) although certain chromosomes (Nos. 1, 2, 3, 9, 12, and 14) were structurally affected more often than others, no markers with the same banding pattern were noted among them; and (3) the cytologic type of lymphoma could be correlated with the karyotype in all seven patients. When the Lukes and Collins classification was used, three patients whose tumors were composed predominantly of large noncleaved cells showed a 14q translocation leading to the formation of a 14q+ marker chromosome.

The patients in whom more than 60% of the abnormal cells were immunoglobulin-bearing cells were considered to have B-cell lymphoproliferative malignancy. The diagnosis of a T-cell disorder was made in those patients in whom more than 70% of the cells formed E rosettes (T cells). Those patients in whom 30% and more of the abnormal cells did not show B- and T-cell surface markers were regarded as suffering from ""null"" cell disorder. The B-cell type of lymphoproliferative malignancy was the most commonly encountered (63%) with an equal male to female ratio. In addition, 4 male patients with ""hairy-cell"" leukaemia were shown to have a B-cell disorder. T-cell disorders were found in 3 male patients; 1 patient had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and in the other 2 the histopathological diagnosis was well-differentiated lymphoma and Sternberg sarcoma. Four patients with ""null"" cell lymphoma were found, the histopathological diagnoses in all were poorly-differentiated lymphocytic lymphoma, and 3 of the 4 patients were males. Further haematological investigations of the B-cell and the non-B-cell disorders showed that although the bone marrow was equally extensively infiltrated in both groups, the non-B-cell disroders were more commonly associated with complications of anemia and thrombocytopenia. It is therefore postulated that the abnormal lymphoid cell involved in B-cell disorders is an end-stage cell and not the haemopoietic stem cell.","['Katz, J', 'Lea, R', 'Livni, N', 'Lewis, D', 'Lynch, S R', 'Skikne, B', 'Bezwoda, W']","['Katz J', 'Lea R', 'Livni N', 'Lewis D', 'Lynch SR', 'Skikne B', 'Bezwoda W']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",South Africa,S Afr Med J,South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,0404520,,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Rosette Formation', 'Sex Factors', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,1978/05/20 00:00,1978/05/20 00:01,['1978/05/20 00:00'],"['1978/05/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/05/20 00:01 [medline]', '1978/05/20 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,S Afr Med J. 1978 May 20;53(20):789-92.,0256-9574 (Print),,,,,,,,,,,,

The extensive homology of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) products that exists for the mouse and guinea pig suggested that a similar homology might exist for products of genetic regions closely linked to the MHC. By taking advantage of the selective association of beta2mu with H-2, Qa-2, and TL antigens, and by using the technique of sequential immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated two previously undescribed guinea pig molecules reactive with anti-guinea pig beta2mu. The first molecule was composed of a 36,000 dalton glycoprotein associated with beta2mu and was found on guinea pig thymocytes, but not lymphocytes. The second molecule was composed of a 40,000 dalton glycoprotein associated with beta2mu, and was found on both guinea pig thymocytes and lymphocytes. By structure, chemical composition, association with beta2mu, and tissue distribution, the first molecule is an attractive candidate for the guinea pig homologue of TL antigen, whereas the second fits the criteria for the guinea pig homologue of Qa-2 antigen.","['Schwartz, B D', 'Cigen, R', 'Berggard, I', 'Shevach, E M']","['Schwartz BD', 'Cigen R', 'Berggard I', 'Shevach EM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Isoantigens)', '0 (beta 2-Microglobulin)', '57KD15003I (Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Glycoproteins', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Isoantigens/*isolation & purification', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Phenylmethylsulfonyl Fluoride/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology', 'beta 2-Microglobulin']",,1978/09/01 00:00,1978/09/01 00:01,['1978/09/01 00:00'],"['1978/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1978 Sep;121(3):835-9.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

The conclusions drawn are: (1) Cell cycle time and S-phase duration for proliferating granulocyte precursors in human bone marrow are poorly defined but are probably shorter than median values for most human tumors, including leukemia. (2) Most drugs have greater toxicity for cycling cells and some variation in toxicity at different phases of the cell cycle. There is a special need for chemotherapy directed at slowly proliferating and hypoxic tumor cells. (3) Pretreatment indices of tumor cell kinetics are of little value in choosing drugs or in predicting response. (4) Experiments in animals have demonstrated that therapeutic index may depend on schedule. Knowledge of cell kinetics in animals rarely allows prediction of the optimal schedule and is unlikely to do so in man. Optimal schedules in mice are not directly relevant to man. (5) Measurement of tumor labeling index or DNA histogram by flow microfluorimetry to detect cell synchrony is of little benefit in scheduling if concurrent changes in bone marrow are ignored; these methods are invalid at short intervals after treatment because surviving clonogenic cells are indistinguishable from a larger number of drug-damaged cells prior to their lysis. (6) The major factor determining the outcome of chemotherapy is the availability of drugs with activity for the tumor and acceptable host toxicity. Claims that complex schedules using several drugs are effective because of synchrony or kinetic differences of tumor and normal tissue are at present unsubstantiated.","['Tannock, I']",['Tannock I'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer Treat Rep,Cancer treatment reports,7607107,['VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Autoradiography', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Thymidine']",164,1978/08/01 00:00,1978/08/01 00:01,['1978/08/01 00:00'],"['1978/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Treat Rep. 1978 Aug;62(8):1117-33.,0361-5960 (Print) 0361-5960 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Most patients had splenomegaly without adenopathy or pancyotpenia. Nine of the patients had undergone splenectomy prior to referral; their median WBC count was 6600/mm3. The median WBC count for the 14 patients who had no prior therapy was 3550/mm3, and their median platelet count was 80,500/mm3. Spleen weights ranged from 618 to 3780 g; there appeared to be no relationship between the size of the spleen and the response in the blood counts after splenectomy. Four patients in whom the majority of the WBC were hairy cells underwent splenectomy, which produced no real change in their WBC count; however, there was improvement in the platelet count in three. In contrast, the presence of leukopenia with a low percentage of hairy cells predicted a beneficial response to splenectomy. The study of surface immunoglobulins (SIg) in 16 patients demonstrated that resynthesis had occurred in each case. Phagocytosis of zymosan was studied in 15 patients; in 8 of these, 25% or more of the hair cells were capable of phagocytosis; in 6 others, 0--9%; and in one, 13%. The resynthesis of SIg is a feature usually associated with B-lymphocytes, but the phagocytosis of zymosan is not. Thus, the existence of either a spectrum of functional capabilities of hairy cells or several distinct subtypes is suggested by these data. Platelet aggregation with epinephrine was abnormal in 7 of 14 patients studied but there were no clinically significant bleeding problems. A chromosome abnormality was present in 2 of the 19 patients from whom adequate samples were obtained; the abnormality probably involved chromsome 12 in both patients as well as absent Y and was associated with a rapidly progressive clinical course. The presence of a predominant number of hairy cells with a normal or increased peripheral blood WBC count or of a chromosomal abnormality suggests that splenectomy might not be beneficial as the initial therapy and that chemotherapy should be considered.","['Golomb, H M']",['Golomb HM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/blood', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*pathology/physiopathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Pancytopenia/pathology', 'Phagocytosis', 'Platelet Aggregation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Rosette Formation', 'Splenectomy', 'Zymosan/metabolism']",46,1978/08/01 00:00,1978/08/01 00:01,['1978/08/01 00:00'],"['1978/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1978 Aug;42(2 Suppl):946-56. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197808)42:2+<946::aid-cncr2820420718>3.0.co;2-k.,0008-543X (Print) 0008-543X (Linking),,['10.1002/1097-0142(197808)42:2+<946::aid-cncr2820420718>3.0.co;2-k [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

An eighteen year old type O male with acute leukemia was prepared to receive type A HLA identical marrow using large volume plasma exchange prior to and following cyclophosphamide administration. Saline agglutinating anti-A antibody was initially present at a titer of 1:128. The initial antiglobulin titer of dithiothreitol (DTT) treated serum was 1:64. Initially the T 1/2 of 51Cr labeled type A red blood cells was less than five minutes. The first plasma exchange removed large quantities of anti-A antibody but 51Cr survival of type A red blood cells was unchanged. A second plasma exchange after an interval of three days, increased the T 1/2 of 51Cr labeled cells to 20 minutes. Saline agglutinating anti-A was not present at a titer of 1:8 and the antiglobulin titer of DTT treated serum was 1:4. Reaction to subsequent transfusion of type A red blood cells (5 units) was limited to a single febrile episode during the first unit. Survival of 51Cr labeled red blood cells increased to T 1/2 equal to 21 hours. These data indicate that plasma exchange and infusion of ABO incompatible red blood cells effectively reduce antibody concentration and prolong survival of ABO incompatible erythrocytes. It is suggested that the prolongation of 51Cr survival of ABO-incompatible red blood cells to a point that extravascular destruction is predominant be used to establish the safety of ABO-incompatible marrow infusion.","['Berkman, E M', 'Caplan, S', 'Kim, C S']","['Berkman EM', 'Caplan S', 'Kim CS']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Transfusion,Transfusion,0417360,"['0 (ABO Blood-Group System)', '0 (HLA Antigens)', 'T8ID5YZU6Y (Dithiothreitol)']",IM,"['ABO Blood-Group System', 'Adolescent', '*Blood Group Incompatibility', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Separation', 'Dithiothreitol', 'HLA Antigens', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Male', 'Patient Isolators']",,1978/07/01 00:00,1978/07/01 00:01,['1978/07/01 00:00'],"['1978/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transfusion. 1978 Jul-Aug;18(4):504-8. doi: 10.1046/j.1537-2995.1978.18478251251.x.,0041-1132 (Print) 0041-1132 (Linking),,['10.1046/j.1537-2995.1978.18478251251.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

There was increased resistance to the suppressive effects of FV in spleen cells from 'preamyloid' mice receiving CAS injections and nonamyloid mice receiving 10-40 BSA injections. Amyloid mice appeared to be as susceptible to the effects of FV-induced suppression as control (untreated) animals. These data indicate that alterations in marrow dependent function may be related to the pathogenesis of amyloid disease.","['Yonkosky, D', 'Kumar, V', 'Cathcart, E S', 'Bennett, M']","['Yonkosky D', 'Kumar V', 'Cathcart ES', 'Bennett M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,['0 (Caseins)'],IM,"['Amyloidosis/chemically induced/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Caseins', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Graft Rejection', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Mice', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1978/07/01 00:00,1978/07/01 00:01,['1978/07/01 00:00'],"['1978/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1978 Jul;35(1):133-9.,0019-2805 (Print) 0019-2805 (Linking),,,PMC1457224,,,,,,,,,

Chemotherapy consisted of monthly intensification therapy for 2 months and bimonthly therafter. Immunotherapy with 200 microgram of oil-attached BCG-CWS mixed with 10(7) autochthonous leukemic cells was given intradermally at either of upper or lower extremities every week, except when the patients were on maintenance therapy. No serious systemic side effect attributable to BCG-CWS was noted. Six patients developed mild and transient temparature elevation. Most importnat side effect was local skin reaction. Indulated papules developed in all patients, resulting in draining ulcerations in 26 patients. Increase of immunological reactivity of the patients receiving BCG-CWS was noted.

For patients with ALL we must be able to identify clearly the standard and the varieties of high risk patients. For the patient with standard risk features life expectancy is long and therapy regimens must be designed to provide optimal control of the disease with minimal short and long-term toxicity. For patients with the high risk features of those varieties of ALL associated with poor prognosis methods must be found to circumvent the problem of early acquisition of drug resistance by the leukaemic lymphoblasts. For children with AML the results of remission induction regimens must still be improved to match those obtained in ALL. The major problem awaiting solution, however, is the maintenance of remission once obtained. As disease-free survival in AML is improved then consideration of CNS prophylaxis and the timing of cessation of therapy must be considered.","['Mauer, A M']",['Mauer AM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Central Nervous System/drug effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Time Factors']",44,1978/06/01 00:00,1978/06/01 00:01,['1978/06/01 00:00'],"['1978/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1978 Jun;7(2):245-58. doi: 10.1016/s0308-2261(78)80004-6.,0308-2261 (Print) 0308-2261 (Linking),,['10.1016/s0308-2261(78)80004-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The first chloroma contained host cells by fluorescent Y-chromatin body analyses of interphase nuclei. All metaphase cells and karyotypes from peripheral blood and marrow samples showed no evidence of host cells from 3 wk after transplant through the time of marrow relapse. Data from autosomal and sex chromosome studies indicate that the marrow relapse occurred in cells of donor origin.

The in vitro-synthesized M-MLV double-stranded DNA was used as the source of the viral DNA. Restriction endonucleases Sal I and Hind III cleave viral DNA at only one site and, thus, generate two DNA fragments. The two DNA fragments generated by Sal I are Sal IA (molecular weight, 3.5 x 10(6)) and Sal IB (molecular weight, 2.4 x 10(6)) and by Hind III are Hind IIIA (molecular weight, 3.6 x 10(6) and Hind IIIB (molecular weight, 2.3 x 10(6)). Restriction endonuclease Bam I generates four fragments of molecular weights of 2.1 x 10(6) (Bam IA), 2 X 10(6) (Bam IB), 1.25 X 10(6) (Bam IC), and 0.24 x 10(6) (Bam ID), whereas restriction endonuclease Hpa I cleaves the M-MLV double-stranded DNA twice to give three fragments of molecular weights of 4.4 x 10(6) (Hpa IA), 0.84 X 10(6) (Hpa IB), and 0.74 x 10(6) (Hpa IC). Digestion of M-MLV double-stranded DNA with restriction endonuclease Sma I produces four fragments of molecular weights of 3.9 x 10(6) (Sma IA), 1.3 X 10(6) (Sma IB), 0.28 X 10(6) (Sma IC), and 0.21 x 10(6) (Sma ID). A mixture of restriction endonucleases Bgl I and Bgl II (Bgl I + II) cleaves the viral DNA at four sites generating five fragments of approximate molecular weights of 2 x 10(6) (Bgl + IIA), 1.75 X 10(6) (Bgl I + IIB), 1.25 X 10(6) (Bgl I + IIC), 0.40 X 10(6) (Bgl I + IID), and 0.31 x 10(6) (Bgl I + IIE). The order of the fragments in relation to the 5' end and 3' end of the genome was determined either by using fractional-length M-MLV double-stranded DNA for digestion by restriction endonucleases or by redigestion of Sal IA, Sal IB, Hind IIIA, and Hind IIIB fragments with other restriction endonucleases.

Further studies indicated that glucan administration not only enhanced survival of leukemic mice, but also increased survival of leukemic mice with experimentally induced staphylococcal speticemia.

352894,NLM,MEDLINE,19780915,20190819,2,1,1978 Jan,The bone marrow in Hodgkin's disease: the non-involved marrow.,31-46,"One hundred and nineteen methacrylate-embedded trephine biopsy specimens from 80 patients with Hodgkin's disease are reviewed. Although marrow involvement was found in 4% of the untreated patients, the present study was mainly concerned with the marrow unaffected by specific infiltrates and in negative specimens. The non-involved bone marrow in Hodgkin's disease invariably showed alterations of three types; stromal damage, inflammatory infiltration, and disturbed haematopoiesis. Each of these features can be found in the absence of one or both of the others. In severe examples, all three of these components usually occur simultaneously, giving histological pictures that mimic Hodgkin-specific infiltrates, sometimes in association with clinical suggestions of bone marrow involvement or replacement. But trephine biopsies of sufficiently high histological quality offer alternative explanations for the pancytopenia, for instance intramedullary phagocytosis, reactive sclerosing inflammation resembling auto-immune disorders, or a disturbance of haematopoiesis itself. This disturbance could be due to a defect inherent in the haematopoiesis associated with Hodgkin's disease, possibly predisposing for leukaemia in longterm survivors who have received chemotherapy and/or irradiation.

The eosinophil chemotactic factor (ECF) is highly specific for eosinophils and resembles the ECF activity obtained from human polymorphonuclear neutrophils after stimulation with the Ca ionophore or during phagocytosis. In this regard, AA-induced ECF represents a biological activity distinct from oxidized AA and its conversion products. AA may therefore have a dual function: it represents an important mechanism of cell activation; as AA is converted into prostaglandins, it appears likely that they exert a modulatory and a suppressive role on biological functions, such as chemotaxis and phagocytosis.","['Konig, W', 'Tesch, H', 'Frickhofen, N']","['Konig W', 'Tesch H', 'Frickhofen N']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,"['0 (Arachidonic Acids)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Arachidonic Acids/*pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', '*Chemotaxis, Leukocyte', 'Eosinophils/*immunology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Neutrophils/*drug effects/immunology/metabolism', 'Phagocytosis', 'Rats']",,1978/06/01 00:00,1978/06/01 00:01,['1978/06/01 00:00'],"['1978/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1978 Jun;8(6):434-7. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830080612.,0014-2980 (Print) 0014-2980 (Linking),,['10.1002/eji.1830080612 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The C1498 cells were unresponsive to colony-stimulating activity, and, above a critical threshold, they inhibited normal granulocyte progenitors in agar culture. C1498 cells added to normal marrow in diffusion chambers progressively reduced granulocyte progenitors. The larger, more rapidly growing, C1498 cells showed the most inhibitory effect. Transmembrane culture of C1498 cells adjacent to normal marrow in double diffusion chambers for five to 14 days led to reduction of recovery of granulocyte progenitors (72 +/- 7 per cent of control) and pluripotent stem cells (45 +/- 7 per cent of control) from the normal marrow chambers. These results indicate that leukemic mouse cells inhibit normal mouse-marrow stem cells by releasing a diffusible substance, and this inhibition occurs primarily at the level of the pluripotent stem cell.","['Quesenberry, P J', 'Rappeport, J M', 'Fountebouni, A', 'Sullivan, R', 'Zuckerman, K', 'Ryan, M']","['Quesenberry PJ', 'Rappeport JM', 'Fountebouni A', 'Sullivan R', 'Zuckerman K', 'Ryan M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Count', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytological Techniques', 'Female', 'Granulocytes/cytology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*blood/metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Micropore Filters']",,1978/07/13 00:00,1978/07/13 00:01,['1978/07/13 00:00'],"['1978/07/13 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/07/13 00:01 [medline]', '1978/07/13 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1978 Jul 13;299(2):71-5. doi: 10.1056/NEJM197807132990204.,0028-4793 (Print) 0028-4793 (Linking),,['10.1056/NEJM197807132990204 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Tumor cells were grown in the presence of fatty acids that could be expected, on the basis of their physical properties, either to stiffen or fluidize the plasma membrane. Substitution of EL-4 cell membrane phosphatides with as much as 74% nonadecanoic acid (19:0) had no effect on either conjugation with effector cells or subsequent cytolysis by the effector cells. Substitution with linolenic acid (18:3) or elaidic acid (18:1trans) likewise affected neither conjugation nor cytolysis. Substitution with these fatty acids also had no effect on the susceptibility of EL-4 cells to cytolysis by antibody plus complement. On the other hand, the rate of patching of H-2 surface antigens was very sensitive to substitution by both 19:0 and 18:3. Although not conclusive, these results suggest that alterations of the fluid state of the membrane that affect lateral movements of surface proteins may not affect cytolytic processes.","['Mandel, G', 'Clark, W']","['Mandel G', 'Clark W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Phospholipids)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', '*Phospholipids']",,1978/05/01 00:00,1978/05/01 00:01,['1978/05/01 00:00'],"['1978/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1978 May;120(5):1637-43.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 27 patients with acute leukemia, four achieved complete remission, two achieved partial remission, and two achieved hematologic improvement. However, no responses occurred in ten patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Thus, the response rate was 47% (eight responses among among 17 patients, in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute undifferentiated leukemia. Seven of the 15 patients with malignant lymphoma responded. Most responses (five of six patients) occurred in patients with diffuse histiocytic lymphoma. Twenty-one of the 42 patients had received prior therapy with cyclophosphamide and 12 of these patients (two with leukemia and ten with lymphoma) responded, thus suggesting that as in the treatment of L1210 leukemia, isophosphamide is effective for tumors resistant to prior cyclophosphamide therapy.

The patient presented is a 22-year-old white male who, following two renal transplants and prolonged immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine and methylprednisolone, developed chronic granulocytic leukemia. Chromosome karyotyping demonstrated the somewhat unusual development of a Philadelphia chromosome with translocation to the No. 7 of the C group. A review of transplantation centers revealed that five cases of chronic granulocytic leukemia have occurred in a population of 25,000 renal transplant patients, a 5-fold increased incidence over the general population. Possible etiologies that may be responsible for the development of chronic granulocytic leukemia in patients on immunosuppressive therapy are discussed. It is our hope that by the introduction of these reports of chronic granulocytic leukemia into the medical literature, the need for caution in the use of immunosuppressive drugs in nonmalignant disease will again be emphasized.","['Adler, K R', 'Lempert, N', 'Scharfman, W B']","['Adler KR', 'Lempert N', 'Scharfman WB']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)', 'X4W7ZR7023 (Methylprednisolone)']",IM,"['Adult', 'Azathioprine/adverse effects', 'Cadaver', 'Chromosomes, Human, 21-22 and Y', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*adverse effects', '*Kidney Transplantation', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*etiology/genetics', 'Male', 'Methylprednisolone/adverse effects', 'Translocation, Genetic', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1978/06/01 00:00,1978/06/01 00:01,['1978/06/01 00:00'],"['1978/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1978 Jun;41(6):2206-8. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197806)41:6<2206::aid-cncr2820410620>3.0.co;2-0.,0008-543X (Print) 0008-543X (Linking),,['10.1002/1097-0142(197806)41:6<2206::aid-cncr2820410620>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The most common underlying diseases were Hodgkin's disease (29 per cent), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (19 per cent) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (17 per cent). Sixty-three per cent of the patients had received cytotoxic drugs, and 57 per cent had taken corticosteroids. Widely disseminated infection occurred in 88 per cent of the patients, with predominant involvement of lungs and organs of the reticuloendothelial system. Localized pulmonary infection was present in the remaining patients. The most useful diagnostic method was bone marrow biopsy with microscopic examination for the intracellular yeast form of H. capsulatum. Biopsy of oral lesions, lung, liver and lymph node also proved diagnostically helpful. Growth of H. capsulatum in culture was frequently too slow to be beneficial in diagnosing histoplasmosis in ill patients. Serologic methods were of little diagnostic help in this population of immunosuppressed patients. The response to amphotericin B therapy was excellent (6.7 per cent mortality rate) in those patients in whom the diagnosis was established early and in whom a full course of antifungal therapy could be given.

In contrast, the majority of the B-lymphocytes, characterized by surface bound IgM and/or IgD(SIg)lack these receptors. Double marker experiments with fluorochrome labelled reagents have now shown that a minor fraction (3--24%) of the IgM/d bearing lymphocytes in normal human blood also have HP-receptors. These HP+ B-cells constitute approximately 1% of the HP+ lymphocytes in adult blood. Fractionation on HP-Sepharose columns showed that the HP+ B-cells are readily eluted with buffer containing 0.1 mg N-acetyl-D-galactosamine. In contrast, the majority of the HP+-SIg--cells require higher concentrations of the competing hapten for elution (1 mg D-Ga1NAc/ml buffer). This indicates that the HP-receptors on these B-cells differ qualitatively or quantitatively from those on the majority of the T-cells. Previous findings of HP-receptors on the SIg+ leukaemic cells in the blood of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia suggested that these structures are expressed on an immature variety of B-cells. This assumption is favoured by the present finding that approximately 80% of the lymphocytes with surface bound IgM/D in cord blood also have HP-receptors. Therefore, the HP-receptors seems to fall in the category of differentiation markers and constitutes a useful tool for characterization and separation of human lymphocytes within both the T- and the B-compartments.","['Hellstrom, U', 'Perlmann, P', 'Robertsson, E S', 'Hammarstrom, S']","['Hellstrom U', 'Perlmann P', 'Robertsson ES', 'Hammarstrom S']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,"['0 (Agglutinins)', '0 (Hemagglutinins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",IM,"['Adult', '*Agglutinins', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Helix, Snails/*immunology', '*Hemagglutinins', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin D', 'Immunoglobulin Fc Fragments', 'Immunoglobulin G', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Middle Aged', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', '*Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'Rosette Formation']",,1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1978 Mar;7(3):191-7. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1978.tb00443.x.,0300-9475 (Print) 0300-9475 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1978.tb00443.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Capillaries filled with labelled cells are placed in liquid scintillation counting vials, along with the MIF-containing sample and are removed at the end of a five-hour incubation period. The residual, labelled cells which have migrated out of the tubes are solubilized and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. While cultured lymphoblast cells are routinely used in the assay, the method was checked against mouse and guinea pig peritoneal exudate cells in both the labelled cell technique and the conventional chamber assay. The assay is technically simple to perform and a useful tool for laboratory research purposes because of the short span of time needed to obtain the results. These advantages indicate a potential for automation and use of this assay in a clinical immunology laboratory. Statistical analysis of data from both assays demonstrated that the relative variation among replicates is lower in the labelled cell assay. The new assay also measured a significant difference between controls and MIF-containing samples when the migration index (MI) was greater than 80%. Criteria for significant inhibition of migration are discussed in regard to the use of analysis of variance (ANOVA) and other statistical procedures, and the inadequacy of a single measure, such as the MI, is discussed.","['McDaniel, M C', 'Robbins, C H', 'Hokanson, J A', 'Papermaster, B W']","['McDaniel MC', 'Robbins CH', 'Hokanson JA', 'Papermaster BW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,"['0 (Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Cell Migration Inhibition', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Macrophage Migration-Inhibitory Factors', 'Mice', '*Scintillation Counting', 'Statistics as Topic', 'Tritium']",,1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1978;20:225-39. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(78)90258-2.,0022-1759 (Print) 0022-1759 (Linking),,"['0022-1759(78)90258-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(78)90258-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

The role of the carrier should be to deliver the drug preferentially to the tumor site. Potential carriers are either (1) nonspecific macromolecules whose preferential activity is due to the inherently higher permeability and pinocytic activity of tumor cells, (2) lysosomotropic agents such as DNA or liposomes, or (3) the more specific agents--antitumor antibodies. Conjugates of daunomycin to antitumor antibodies, prepared either by direct binding or by binding via dextran, were shown to retain both the antibody and the drug activity. Thus they exert specific cytotoxic activity toward tumor cells that the antibodies recognize. In vivo, these complexes are more active than the free drug in prolongation of survival of mice transplanted with the tumor cells. Conjugates of daunomycin with normal immunoglobulin or with dextran also show higher therapeutic efficacy in vivo, probably due to their capacity to reduce the cytotoxicity of daunomycin and/or to the higher permeability of neoplastic cells. But under certain conditions, mainly at low drug concentrations, the drug-antibody conjugates have an advantage over all others.","['Arnon, R']",['Arnon R'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Compr Ther,Comprehensive therapy,7605837,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Lysosomes/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Plasmacytoma/immunology']",12,1978/04/01 00:00,1978/04/01 00:01,['1978/04/01 00:00'],"['1978/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Compr Ther. 1978 Apr;4(4):68-73.,0098-8243 (Print) 0098-8243 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

A single dose of 100 mg/m2 of CCNU or 150 mg/m2 of methyl-CCNU was given orally every 6 weeks. In patients with leukopenia or thrombocytopenia, due to prior treatment, this dose was reduced to 70 mg/m2 of CCNU and 100 gm/m2 of methyl-CCNU. Of 109 evaluable patients, 60 received CCNU and 49 received methyl-CCNU. Response rates (complete and partial) to CCNU and methyl-CCNU were respectively 42% (14/33) and 15% (3/20) in HD, 21% (3/14) and 21% (3/14) in LYS, 15% (2/13) and 27% (4/15) in RCS. Responses to methyl-CCNU, but not to CCNU, were seen only in patients who developed significant hematologic toxicity. Responses to both drugs were generally of short duration due to the advanced stage of the disease. Renal, hepatic or neurological toxicity was not observed.

This has been objectively documented by numerous examples illustrating: (1) different in vitro and in vivo reaction products; (2) greater than additive, additive, and less than additive cytotoxicity of drug combinations for vital normal cells in the mouse; (3) readily reproducible and often marked therapeutic synergism between a variety of 2-drug combinations of alkylating agents against a wide variety of histologic types of murine tumors, and (4) observed resistance and cross-resistance of a variety of murine tumors, selected for resistance to specific alkylating agents, compatible with recognized chemical and functional differences between these drugs. The most important observations on resistance and cross-resistance reported are: (a) L1210 cells selected for complete resistance to cyclophosphamide (CPA) retain full sensitivity to selected nitrosoureas (BCNU, CCNU, MeCCNU), chlorozotocin), dianhydrogalactitol, and cis-DDPt, while retaining marked but somewhat reduced sensitivity to L-PAM, piperazinedione, and thioTEPA. (B) L1210 cells selected for resistance to BCNU retain full sensitivity to CPA, L-PAM, and dianhydrogalactitol. They show complete cross-resistance to BIC and variable cross-resistance to other selected nitrosoureas and piperazinedione. (c) L1210/L-PAM has incomplete but marked resistance to L-PAM. It is similar to the parent drug-sensitive line (L1210/0) in response to BCNU, CCNU, MeCCNU, and BIC. It is variably (usually moderately) cross-resistant to CPA, chlorozotocin, dianhydrogalactitol, and thioTEPA, but is completely cross-resistant to cis-DDPt. These resistance and cross-resistance patterns, which are consistent with most other biological and chemical principles established with these alkylating agents, may be useful in selecting alkylating drug combinations for inclusion in chemotherapy protocols in man which, on the basis of diverse observations in animal tumor systems, appear to be clearly indicated.","['Schabel, F M Jr', 'Trader, M W', 'Laster, W R Jr', 'Wheeler, G P', 'Witt, M H']","['Schabel FM Jr', 'Trader MW', 'Laster WR Jr', 'Wheeler GP', 'Witt MH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",Switzerland,Antibiot Chemother (1971),Antibiotics and chemotherapy,1305576,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'U68WG3173Y (Carmustine)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Carmustine/therapeutic use', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Melphalan/therapeutic use', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy']",43,1978/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antibiot Chemother (1971). 1978;23:200-15. doi: 10.1159/000401484.,0066-4758 (Print) 0066-4758 (Linking),,['10.1159/000401484 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The increased knowledge of physiological development of hematopoetic cells allows to classify these diseases according to the degree of differentiation of the cells involved. Immunological cell-membrane structures are used as for markers differentiation. In this way, 4 types of lymphoblastic leukemias and 5 types of myeloid leukemias can be diagnosed. This classification can help to answer clinical and theoretically important questions. In ALL and during the blast crisis of CML, new groups with increased risk are defined, important for the choise of initial therapy, and evaluation of therapeutic trials.

The significance attributed to those early observations is seriously challenged by the negative findings of 3 independent investigators, by 2 out of 3 negative cooperative experiments in which Sugiura participated, and particularly by the blind experiment in which he and others under blind readings found no anticancer activity. Treatment of Swiss albino mice showed no destructive effect upon their spontaneous mammary adenocarcinomas. Of the treated mice, 22% were found by macrovisual observation to have lung metastases while 91% were noted among the controls. The results are subject to questions raised in the discussion. Amygdalin at 2,000 mg/kg/day was ineffective both in treating and preventing the development of spontaneous leukemia in AKR mice. At 1,000 mg/kg/day it was not found effective in preventing or significantly delaying the development of spontaneous mammary tumors in CD8F1 mice.

The data were analyzed in terms of: 1) the nonparametric, Kaplan-Meier (K-M) adjusted survival function; 2) its logarithmic transform, the cumulative force of mortality (cumFM) function; 3) a disease model called ""early terminating,"" applied to causes M and T; and 4) a ""late-terminating"" model, applied to causes L and R. For any given cause and group, two estimators were used, which measured, respectively: a) the relative lateness of the corrected (or adjusted) time course and b) the relative corrected incidence. For causes M and T, these were: a) the mean age of the force of mortality distribution (MAF), or corrected mean latent period; and b) the final cumFM. For causes L and R, the estimators were: a) the adjusted mean age at death (adjMAD), given an upper limit (as %) of adjusted mortality (adjMAD, 50% for L; adjMAD, 100%--the K-M estimator--for R) and b) the cumFM at a cutoff time of 640 days. For causes M and T, the MAF values showed highly significant decreases of the latent periods with dose, through 300 rads. The final cumFM data showed a marked increase of corrected incidence with dose, for both M and T. In addition, the data for cause M were consistent with a three-parameter, leukemogenic cell model that incorporated two opposing radiation effects: leukemogenic cell potentiation and cell killing. For cause R, the adjMAD, 100% data showed a general decrease with dose and considerable scatter. For cause L, the adjMAD, 50% values showed: for treatment A, a gradual decrease with dose through 300 rads; for treatment B, a highly significant drop for 150 rads, with little change for higher doses. The cumFM, 640-day values for both L and R showed a general increase of corrected incidence with dose. The mortality curves for all causes combined showed the expected life shortening, i.e., decreases of the mean age at death with dose, in the 0- to 300-rad range. In addition, the standard deviations of the mortality curves were significantly less for animals irradiated at age range B than at age range A, for each of the doses--150, 300, and 450 rads.","['Robinson, C V', 'Upton, A C']","['Robinson CV', 'Upton AC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,,IM,"['Animals', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*etiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/etiology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/etiology', 'Risk', '*Statistics as Topic', 'Thymus Neoplasms/etiology', 'Time Factors', 'X-Rays']",,1978/05/01 00:00,1978/05/01 00:01,['1978/05/01 00:00'],"['1978/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1978 May;60(5):995-1007. doi: 10.1093/jnci/60.5.995.,0027-8874 (Print) 0027-8874 (Linking),,['10.1093/jnci/60.5.995 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Supernatants obtained from unstimulated normal spleen cells, concanavalin A-treated nu/nu spleen cells, or Bacillus Calmette-Guerin-immune spleen cells in the absence of sensitizing antigen did not enhance macrophage tumoricidal function and lacked interferon.

It is still a unique method of treating cancer. The treatment of thyroid cancer begins with a systematic approach to the most common first symptom or sign; a neck mass. Data have accumulated to show that well-differentiated thyroid cancer does kill commonly enough to warrant aggressive treatment, even in young individuals. There is also evidence that the more complete the thyroidectomy, the lower the death and recurrence rate of the thyroid cancer, and the more effective the use of 131I in both detecting and treating metastases. There are now considerable data demonstrating that 131I after surgery decreases both the recurrence rate and death rate from well-differentiated thyroid cancer. After uptake is ""ablated"", there is a 1%--2% recurrence rate in patients with the most extensive disease at the time of the initial treatment. This recurrence is effectively retreated with another dose of 131I. Surgery and 131I should be used as long as they are effective before resorting to teletherapy. There are now considerable data to show that the morbidity of surgical and 131I treatment is reasonable in contrast to the recurrence and death rate from nonaggressively treated well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Serious consideration should be given to using a low iodine diet before treatment with radioiodine.","['Beierwaltes, W H']",['Beierwaltes WH'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Semin Nucl Med,Seminars in nuclear medicine,1264464,"['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '9002-71-5 (Thyrotropin)']",IM,"['Goiter, Nodular/radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/radiotherapy', 'Methods', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Radionuclide Imaging', 'Recurrence', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/diagnostic imaging/drug therapy/*radiotherapy/surgery', 'Thyroidectomy', 'Thyrotropin/therapeutic use']",57,1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Semin Nucl Med. 1978 Jan;8(1):79-94. doi: 10.1016/s0001-2998(78)80009-9.,0001-2998 (Print) 0001-2998 (Linking),,"['S0001-2998(78)80009-9 [pii]', '10.1016/s0001-2998(78)80009-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,,,

The 191,827 children, 1-18 years of age, initially enrolled in the study were skin-tested with tuberculin to determine their eligibility for vaccination. A total of 82,269 children were classified as reactors and not vaccinated. Of the 109, 558 nonreactors, 31,586 refused vaccination, 50,634 were vaccinated with BCG, and 27,338 were left unvaccinated as controls. We ascertained the incidence of cancer over an average follow-up period of 23.3 years in the latter two groups using the Puerto Rico Central Cancer Registry. By the end of December 1973, a total of 77 cancers had been diagnosed among the controls and 150 among the vaccinees. The overall incidence of cancer among the two groups was similar. Although a number of differences existed between the vaccinee group and the controls in regard to the incidence of cancer at various ""sites"", none of these differences was statistically significant. However, when cases of lymphosarcoma and Hodgkin's disease were combined for analysis, a statistically significant excess of cases occurred among the vaccinees. We concluded that BCG vaccination had no protective effect on the subsequent development of cancer in this population. The slight excess of cases of lymphosarcoma and Hodgkin's disease among the vaccinees raised the possibility that BCG may have had an adverse effect.","['Snider, D E', 'Comstock, G W', 'Martinez, I', 'Caras, G J']","['Snider DE', 'Comstock GW', 'Martinez I', 'Caras GJ']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Controlled Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,['0 (BCG Vaccine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'BCG Vaccine/adverse effects/*pharmacology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/etiology', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/epidemiology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/epidemiology/etiology', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/epidemiology/*prevention & control', 'Puerto Rico']",,1978/04/01 00:00,1978/04/01 00:01,['1978/04/01 00:00'],"['1978/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1978 Apr;60(4):785-8. doi: 10.1093/jnci/60.4.785.,0027-8874 (Print) 0027-8874 (Linking),,['10.1093/jnci/60.4.785 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

All three cell lines continued to produce tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, the enzymatic marker of hairy cells. Two of these cell lines were B lymphoid in nature. They carried Fc and C receptors, had surface and internal immunoglobulin, and did not form spontaneous sheep red blood cell rosettes. Experiments employing biosynthetic radiolabeling of immunoglobulin demonstrated distinctive immunoglobulin kinetics for each of these two hairy cell lines. One cell line remained quite similar to the original hairy cells from which it was derived whereas the other B lymphoid hairy cell line had undergone a switch in the immunoglobulin isotype produced. The third hairy cell leukemia line was shown to be of thymic derivation. These cells formed spontaneous sheep red blood cell rosettes and did not carry Fc or C receptors. The spontaneous sheep red blood cell rosette-forming cells contained tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase. They did not possess surface on internal immunoglobulin and did not synthesize immunoglobulin in vitro.

In this respect they more closely resemble normal B cells than chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. In addition, in sequential studies, the appearance of these characteristics among the circulating cells of patients with lymphoma has been shown at a time when the appearance of a leukemic phase was equivocal morphologically. Thus these cellular characteristics may be helpful in the early diagnosis of a leukemic phase of lymphoma as well as distinguishing these cells from those in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.","['Cohen, H J']",['Cohen HJ'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Ann Intern Med,Annals of internal medicine,0372351,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Movement', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnosis/pathology', '*Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell']",,1978/03/01 00:00,1978/03/01 00:01,['1978/03/01 00:00'],"['1978/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Ann Intern Med. 1978 Mar;88(3):317-22. doi: 10.7326/0003-4819-88-3-317.,0003-4819 (Print) 0003-4819 (Linking),,['10.7326/0003-4819-88-3-317 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Their role as a possible cause of pulmonary disease is a frequent consideration, particularly in patients receiving immunosuppressive or long-standing antimicrobial therapy. At Memorial Hospital and New York Hospital, 30 patients with histologic evidence of Candida pulmonary infection were identified over a two year period. These infections reached the lungs by hematogenous spread in 10 patients and by aspiration in 16 patients. Most the patients had malignant neoplastic disease. The Candida pulmonary disease appeared to be significant clinical factor in only three cases. Experience from our institutions and from the literature indicates that Candida species rarely cause significant pulmonary disease.

Uniform ""windows"" of denuded dermis were produced by a suction device applied to the forearm skin, eliciting delineated areas of epidermal separation by blister formation. The acellular blister fluid, roof and basement membrane were removed, and the blister base was covered with a rubber chamber containing autologous serum as leucocyte attractant. Duplicate chambers were harvested at prescribed intervals during the first 24 hours. In 15 healthy individuals, virtually no cells were observed after 2 hours, a median of 1.9 X 10(6) after 4 hours, increasing to 3.8 X 10(7) after 24 hours. Subnormal LLM was demonstrated in three of seven patients with severe bacterial infections and in three of seven leukaemia patients. LLM was normal in eight patients with other malignancies. Ninety to 98 per cent of the cells were polymorphonuclear neutrophils and less than 1 per cent were erythrocytes. In the chamber neutrophils, vacuolization of the cytoplasm was prominent, bactericidal capacity reduced and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction increased, thus indicating functional derangement of emigrated cells compared to peripheral blood neutrophils. Simplicity and good reproducibility should make this method a valuable tool in the study of leucocyte migration.","['Hellum, K B', 'Solberg, C O']","['Hellum KB', 'Solberg CO']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Denmark,Acta Pathol Microbiol Scand C,"Acta pathologica et microbiologica Scandinavica.

Evidence is provided suggesting that normal erythroid cell precursors require erythropoietin as a growth factor that regulates the number of precursors capable of differentiating. Murine erythroleukemia cells proliferate without need of erythropoietin; they show a variable, generally low, rate of spontaneous differentiation and a brisk rate of erythropoiesis in response to a variety of chemical agents. Present studies suggest that these chemical inducers initiate a series of events including cell surface related changes, alterations in cell cycle kinetics, and modifications of chromatin and DNA structure which result in the irreversible commitment of these leukemia cells to erythroid differentiation and the synthesis of red-cell-specific products.","['Rifkind, R A', 'Marks, P A', 'Bank, A', 'Terada, M', 'Reuben, R C', 'Maniatis, G M', 'Fibach, E', 'Nudel, U', 'Salmon, J E', 'Gazitt, Y']","['Rifkind RA', 'Marks PA', 'Bank A', 'Terada M', 'Reuben RC', 'Maniatis GM', 'Fibach E', 'Nudel U', 'Salmon JE', 'Gazitt Y']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,In Vitro,In vitro,0063733,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Hemoglobins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromatin/metabolism', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Globins/biosynthesis', 'Hemoglobins/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis']",54,1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,In Vitro. 1978 Jan;14(1):155-61. doi: 10.1007/BF02618182.,0073-5655 (Print) 0073-5655 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF02618182 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Several aspects of this developmental sequence may be studied in murine erythroleukemic cells infected with Friend virus complex. These cells are arrested at the proerythroblast stage, yet capable of continuous growth in vitro. Maturation along an erythroid pathway is induced after treatment with a variety of agents (e.g. dimethylsulfoxide, butyric acid, hemin, ouabain). Following induction, the cells morphologically resemble normoblasts, accumulate globin mRNAs and strain-specific globins, increase heme synthesis and acquire erythrocyte membrane antigens. Cloned populations of erythroleukemic cells mature in a nonhomogeneous fashion upon induction, indicative of a stochastic response in the inductive process. This ""probability of differentiation"" phenotype is formally analogous to stem cell development in which hematopoietic precursor cells form a constant, dividing population from which cells are continuously maturing. Although the sequence of events involved in triggering differentiation is uncertain, cloning and cell hybridization experiments demonstrate that this phenotype is under rather stable genetic (or epigenetic) control. Recent molecular analysis shows that induced differentiation is accompanied by transcriptional activation of the globin genes rather than posttranscriptional stabilization of the globin RNAs. Further application of cellular, molecular and genetic approaches in this system may help to define specific control mechanisms in erythroid development.","['Orkin, S H']",['Orkin SH'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,In Vitro,In vitro,0063733,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5ACL011P69 (Ouabain)', '743LRP9S7N (Hemin)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",IM,"['Cell Differentiation', '*Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Globins/*biosynthesis', 'Hemin', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Ouabain', 'RNA, Messenger/*biosynthesis', 'Transcription, Genetic']",40,1978/01/01 00:00,1978/01/01 00:01,['1978/01/01 00:00'],"['1978/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1978/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1978/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,In Vitro. 1978 Jan;14(1):146-54. doi: 10.1007/BF02618181.,0073-5655 (Print) 0073-5655 (Linking),,['10.1007/BF02618181 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

This disease appears to differ from ""spontaneous"" AML in being associated with lesser degrees of leukemic infiltration of the marrow and more frequent chromosomal aberrations. Only one of the nine patients who received chemotherapy attained remission status, and the mean and median survivals from the initiation of chemotherapy were 2.7 months and one month respectively. Nine of the 10 patients died as a result of infection. The refractoriness of this form of AML to chemotherapy was borne out by a review of the literature, which revealed only two remissions in 32 treated patients. The implications for the management of this disease are discussed.","['Preisler, H D', 'Lyman, G H']","['Preisler HD', 'Lyman GH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*etiology/radiotherapy', 'Time Factors']",28,1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1977;3:209-18. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830030301.,0361-8609 (Print) 0361-8609 (Linking),,['10.1002/ajh.2830030301 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Both groups had a similar age, sex distribution and duration of disease prior to the febrile episode. About two-thirds of the patients in both groups had acute myeloblastic leukemia. 94% of the patients in the transfused group and 74% of the control group survived the febrile episode. In patients with positive blood cultures all transfused patients survived as compared to only 57% in the control group (p=0.05). In patients with persistent bone marrow failure 92% of the transfused patients survived as compared to 73% in the control group. Granulocyte transfusions had no effect on the outcome of febrile episodes in patients with negative blood cultures or early recovery of marrow function.

They function in host defense reactions against micro-organisms, in interactions with lymphoid cells in immunity, in disposal of cell debris, and possible in the regulation of granulopoiesis.

The patient died 92 weeks after the marrow graft. Postmortem examination showed increased myeloblasts and promyelocytes. Cytogenetic studies before transplantation showed that all sex determination metaphases had an XX pattern, and 41% of the hyperdiploid metaphases had an additional 19-20(F) chromosome. At autopsy all hyperdiploid metaphases with XY pattern and 43% of the hyperdiploid metaphases with an XX pattern had an additional F chromosome. Occasional metaphases with 47, XX, + F or 47, XY, + F were seen during the follow-up studies. These findings indicated that an acute leukemia had developed in the XY cell line of this artifically induced sex chimeric child.

Despite the wide range of morphologic variation in both groups, strict criteria to define the subgroups have only recently been proposed. The conventional markers for B and T cells are now being applied to leukemic cells as are cytochemistry and electron microscopy, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, serum lysozyme, and surface markers, E-rosettes, membrane immunoglobulin, antinull acute lymphocytic leukemia antiserum, and Fc and C3 receptors. The myelodysplastic syndromes may mimic acute leukemia and it is important that they be identified and treated appropriately. The high incidence with which chronic myelomonocytic leukemia terminates in acute leukemia suggests that it is a preleukemic condition, whereas refractory anemia with excess blasts and acquired idiopathic sideroblastic anemia may have long, drawn-out courses.

Materials were obtained from 56 autopsy cases, composed of 47 of leukemia, 7 of reticulum cell sarcoma and 2 of lymphosarcoma. Leukemic infiltration was confirmed in 43 (19%) of all leukemic cases and the pattern was divided into three types; diffuse, patchy and perivascular. A high grade infiltration was most common in lymphocytic leukemia. The testicular involvement was unexceptionally bilateral with occasional differences in the grade of infiltration, slight to moderate. There was no regional difference in incidence of leukemic infiltration in the testicular interstitium. A thin-walled canal located closely between the proper lamina of seminiferous tubules and the interstitial cell cluster was suggested to be lymphatics, which were extremely irregular in shape and occasionally did not have endothelium. Therefore human testicular lymphatics might not be a constant canal system, but rather akin to narrow tissue space. A network of argyrophilic fibers was pronounced in the lesion of leukemic infiltration. The frequency and grade of an involvement of the testes in malignant lymphoma were lower and lesser than those in leukemia.","['Wakasa, H', 'Amano, S']","['Wakasa H', 'Amano S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Tohoku J Exp Med,The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,0417355,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*pathology', 'Lymphatic System/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Testis/*pathology']",,1977/10/01 00:00,1977/10/01 00:01,['1977/10/01 00:00'],"['1977/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Tohoku J Exp Med. 1977 Oct;123(2):147-59. doi: 10.1620/tjem.123.147.,0040-8727 (Print) 0040-8727 (Linking),,['10.1620/tjem.123.147 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

We have found (a) that infection does not reduce the percentage of T lymphocytes in the spleen, nor their ability to respond to PHA, (b) that infected spleen cells mediate allogeneic augmentation of the primary response to SRBC in vitro, even though their own depressed response cannot be restored via the allogeneic effect, and (c) that infected spleen cells restore responses to SRBC by both allogeneic and syngeneic spleen cell cultures depleted of T lymphocytes. These results suggest that FV does not affect spleen T lymphocyte proliferation of helper function.

Schedule I was prednisone plus chlorambucil (CLB) given as a once-a-month dose of 0.4-0.8 mg/kg; schedule II was both drugs, but the CLB was given as a daily dose of 0.08 mg/kg; schedule III was prednisone alone.

335894,NLM,MEDLINE,19771229,20181113,89,2,1977 Nov,Preleukemia. Cytogenetic clues in some confusing disorders.,459-76,"A number of disease states are considered ""preleukemic"" because they carry a significantly increased risk for the subsequent development of frank leukemia. These include a variety of cytopenias, myeloproliferative disorders, and childhood syndromes. Cytogenetic data suggest that these preleukemic disorders may not be qualitatively different from leukemia but simply represent quantitative differences in the degree of selective growth advantage enjoyed by a proliferating abnormal hemic population. Recent chromosome studies have indicated that a) this proliferation is characteristically clonal in both preleukemia and leukemia, apparently resulting from a heritable change in a marrow stem cell that allows it to escape to some degree from normal growth regulation; b) genetic instability in the clone, with additional genetic change, may often underlie clinical progression from the relative indolence of preleukemia or chronic leukemia to an aggressive stage comparable to acute leukemia; and c) certain specific chromosome segments carry genes important in the acquisition of growth advantage by hematopoietic stem cells, and many of these are common to both preleukemia and leukemia. Expansion of hemic clones may also be influenced significantly by alterations in the growth control mechanisms themselves. For instance, in various preleukemic states, preexisting marrow hypoplasia may permit clones with only minimal selective advantage to reach demonstrable size. Chromosome findings may help to establish the diagnosis and prognosis in preleukemic disorders, but additional long-term data are needed.","['Nowell, P C']",['Nowell PC'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,,IM,"['Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Chromosome Aberrations/genetics/pathology', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Clone Cells', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics/pathology', 'Preleukemia/*genetics/pathology']",38,1977/11/01 00:00,1977/11/01 00:01,['1977/11/01 00:00'],"['1977/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1977 Nov;89(2):459-76.,0002-9440 (Print) 0002-9440 (Linking),,,PMC2032229,,,,,,,,,

These may be detected in cell culture by developmental techniques, in which progenitors form colonies in viscid or semisolid media in response to appropriate stimulation. Certain diseases of hemopoiesis also originate in pluripotent stem cells; these include chronic myeloblastic leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, polycythemia vera, and idiopathic myelofibrosis-the clonal hemopathies. The hypothesis is advanced that the distribution of cell classes among patients with clonal hemopathies is determined both by the differentiation potential of each pluripotent stem cell maintaining an abnormal clone and by random events occurring during clonal expansion. The latter process may account for the large variations observed between patients when committed progenitors are assayed in cultures of marrow from patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML). This variation may also be used to estimate lineage relationships in the clonal hemopathies. When applied to myelopoiesis in AML, obvious differences from the normal are not detected. The analysis is consistent with the view that the blast cell population in AML is distinct from the leukemic myelopoiesis occurring within an abnormal clone. A new assay procedure is described for progenitor cells related to blast cell proliferation. Finally, these concepts are used to develop a model for the pathogenesis and cellular characteristics of AML.","['McCulloch, E A', 'Buick, R N', 'Lan, S', 'Till, J E']","['McCulloch EA', 'Buick RN', 'Lan S', 'Till JE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Am J Pathol,The American journal of pathology,0370502,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)']",IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Clone Cells', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/genetics', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Models, Biological', 'Phenotype', 'Polycythemia Vera/pathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/pathology']",42,1977/11/01 00:00,1977/11/01 00:01,['1977/11/01 00:00'],"['1977/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pathol. 1977 Nov;89(2):449-57.,0002-9440 (Print) 0002-9440 (Linking),,,PMC2032243,,,,,,,,,

T-lymphocytes are commonly identified by a surface receptor for sheep erythrocytes, and by heterologous antisera raised against human thymus cells and absorbed with human B-cell leukemias or lymphoblastoid cell lines. B-lymphocytes are routinely enumerated by immunofluorescent staining technics for surface immunoglobulin, or by assays for the receptor for C3. Null cells bear a receptor for the Fc portion of immunoglobulin, and are killer (K) cells in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Accurate quantitation of T- and B-cells in disease states has been hampered by marked contamination of monocytes in populations of peripheral blood lymphocytes purified by density gradients, binding of autologous immunoglobulin to the surface of non-B cells, and disease-associated alterations of T- and B-cell surface markers.

The presence of multople tumors was also more frequent in this group compared to the siblings which were exposed only transplacentally to ENU. The second generations also developed malignant tumors. Two successive generations of siblings which were delivered of untreated mothers but nursed by foster mothers treated with ENU on the 12th day of pregnancy, showed a higher percentage of tumors when compared to the control group. This result is of great significance as the siblings were not exposed to the carcinogen transplacentally, and the foster mothers were treated with only a single dose of ENU long before the lactating period, namely, on the 12th day of pregnancy.","['Mookenthottathil, T']",['Mookenthottathil T'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],Switzerland,Oncology,Oncology,0135054,"['0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', 'P8M1T4190R (Ethylnitrosourea)']",IM,"['Adenoma/etiology', 'Animals', 'Ethylnitrosourea/*pharmacology', 'Female', 'Lactation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/etiology', 'Lung Neoplasms/etiology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/etiology', 'Male', '*Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics/*transmission', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/transmission', 'Nitrosourea Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Pregnancy']",,1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Oncology. 1977;34(5):201-4. doi: 10.1159/000225223.,0030-2414 (Print) 0030-2414 (Linking),,['10.1159/000225223 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

There is no clinically detectable difference between patients showing usual or unusual sites of translocation of 22q. In the chronic phase the typical translocation without additional abnormalities accounts for about two-thirds of the cases. Additional abnormalities include -Y and +8; difference of prognosis in association with aneuploidy has not yet been demonstrated. The presence of Ph1-negative cells in the chronic phase may be related to the time of ascertainment. The isochromosome for the long arm of number 17 is pathognomonic of impending metamorphosis. Additional chromosomal abnormalities are found in the majority of cases in the acute phase.

One-third of patients with active CLL have experienced responses distinguished by complete resolution of symptoms and palpable disease, correction of anaemia, restoration of the leucocyte count and differential to normal, clearing of the lymphocytic bone-marrow infiltration, and recovery from immunological incompetence. A distinct correlation has been observed between the response to therapy and the subsequent clinical course. The quality of life has been improved and the duration of survival prolonged in the group of patients who obtained the most favourable response (Type 1) to treatment.

The blood CLL lymphocytes, as normal lymphocytes, exchange rapidly with an extravascular pool of lymphocytes. However, recirculation of lymphocytes--from blood to blood via the lymph node and the thoracic duct--does not proceed normally in CLL.

It is emphasized that LPD include a wide range of diseases, some being non-malignant, others of questionable malignancy, and still others being frankly malignant. Clinical, morphological and immunological data are required for diagnosis in some cases.","['Sweet, D L Jr', 'Golomb, H M', 'Ultmann, J E']","['Sweet DL Jr', 'Golomb HM', 'Ultmann JE']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",England,Clin Haematol,Clinics in haematology,0331547,"['0 (Immunoglobulin D)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunity', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunoglobulin D', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*etiology/immunology', 'Lymphatic Diseases/diagnosis/*etiology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",69,1977/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1977/02/01 00:00'],"['1977/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1977/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Haematol. 1977 Feb;6(1):141-57.,0308-2261 (Print) 0308-2261 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

While the elucidation of chromosome migration and distribution during gametogenesis (i.e., the segregation and independent assortment of chromosomes in the germ cells) provided a physical basis and a mechanism for the implementation of Mendelian principles, cytogenetics did not illuminate our practical knowledge of human biology until it was applied to eukaryotic somatic cells with ease, speed, and accuracy. As a result of these achievements of the late 1950s, the study of the chromosome complement is now routinely available. Karyotypic analysis established that genetic imbalances such as trisomies and deletions account for one-fifth or more of all spontaneous abortions and for one-fifth of all serious but viable birth defects, most of them with impaired mental development. Most chromosome errors are the result of a gametal or zygotic mishap and can be detected by fetal cell sampling through amniocentesis. In recent years more refined techniques (chromosome banding methods) have further increased the level of resolution at which anomalies can be detected. These techniques, along with the development of methods to hybridize somatic cells, have greatly assisted in the assignment of particular genes to particular chromosomes.","['Engel, E']",['Engel E'],['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Ment Defic,American journal of mental deficiency,0372647,,IM,"['Amniocentesis', 'Chromosome Aberrations/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Genes', 'Genetics, Medical', 'History, 18th Century', 'History, 20th Century', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'X Chromosome', 'Y Chromosome']",,1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Ment Defic. 1977 Sep;82(2):109-16.,0002-9351 (Print) 0002-9351 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Other forms of metabolic acidosis, especially in infants, may predispose to phycomycotic infections. CROP has also been reported in patients with leukemia or lymphoma. CROP usually begins in the palate or paranasal sinuses and rapidly spreads to the orbital contents. Proptosis, loss of vision, and ophthalmoplegia occur and death from cerebral involvement commonly ensues. The fungus tends to invade arteries and cause thrombosis and tissue infarction.

However, the increased risk of multiple primary tumors is highly selective on a site-specific basis. Table 135 presents Connecticut Registry data indicating the risk of a subsequent primary malignancy by anatomic site of the later primary in patients with a first primary cancer. Tables 136 and 137 present tabulations for anatomic sites with statistically significant excesses and deficiencies, with an analysis by time interval between the two malignancies. Finally, Table 138 presents figures showing histologic confirmation for site-group paris with significant excesses of observed-over-expected later primary malignant neoplasms. The reader should bear in mind that just as the risk of subsequent primaries varies with the anatomic site of the subsequent primary (Table 135), the risk is also highly dependent upon the anatomic site of the first primary cancer (Chapters 6-12).","['Schoenberg, B S']",['Schoenberg BS'],['eng'],"['Historical Article', 'Journal Article', 'Review']",Germany,Recent Results Cancer Res,Recent results in cancer research.

Syngeneic spleen cells from nonimmunized DBA/2 mice were cultured in the presence of graded numbers of irradiated cells of L1210 or its sublines. The stimulation elicited a T-independent primary antibody response in vitro which was measured by determining the number of plaque-forming cells by using the immunizing lymphoma cells as target. Cells of all three sublines exhibited an increased immunogenicity, as compared to that of the parental L1210 cells, in eliciting the response directed to tumor-associated antigens which were common to all sublines. Dose-response experiments showed that high doses of the parental cells did stimulate responses which were detectable with subline cells as target. The results indicated that the differential immunogenicity of L1210 and its sublines, as demonstrated in the present assay system, is primarily quantitative, and was apparently due to increased amount or density of common tumor-associated antigens on the subline cells. The implications of these observations are discussed in relation to the possible mechanisms underlying the emergence of highly immunogenic drug-resistant sublines.","['Fuji, H', 'Mihich, E', 'Pressman, D']","['Fuji H', 'Mihich E', 'Pressman D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antigens, Neoplasm', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Complement System Proteins/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Hemolytic Plaque Technique', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",,1977/09/01 00:00,1977/09/01 00:01,['1977/09/01 00:00'],"['1977/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Sep;119(3):983-6.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

The mesentery might play an important role in the recovery of the hemopoietic system in lethally irradiated mice, being the primary site of proliferation of stem cells and/or CFU before their migration to bone marrow and spleen. Bone marrow and spleen cells from animals infected with Rauscher Leukemia Virus (R-MuLV) also produce MHC and spleen colonies after ip injection into lethally irradiated mice. In addition to the undifferentiated cells in the MHC, cells with limited differentiation and/or retarded maturation were identified. The cytologic pattern of the majority of cells in MHC was of mixed type.","['Umar, M H', 'van Griensven, L J']","['Umar MH', 'van Griensven LJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,,IM,"['Animals', '*Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Cell Division/radiation effects', 'Clone Cells', 'Female', '*Hematopoiesis/radiation effects', '*Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Rauscher Virus', 'Spleen/cytology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",,1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1977;5(4):281-90.,0301-472X (Print) 0301-472X (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Assays of the plasma levels of certain of these FAAs led to the observation, in about 25% of the determinations, that a higher density of growth of Streptococcus faecium var. durans (ATCC 8043) was obtained at an FAA concentration just below the completely inhibitory level than at one-half this concentration. This and other considerations suggested that FAAs may act not only as selective agents for resistant organisms but also as mutagens. Seven FAAs including amethopterin, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim, chlorguanide triazine, an experimental quinazoline, WR-158,122, and two experimental triazines, WR-99,210 and WR-38,839, were tested for mutagenicity in the Salmonella reversion assay developed by Ames et al. (1975). All were found to be negative for strains TA1535, TA1537, TA1538, TA98, and TA100, both with and without microsomal activation. These compounds were then tested as mutagens for three traits in the folic acid-requiring S. faecium. FAAs were shown to cause mutations to folic acid independence, rifampin resistance, and FAA resistance. It is postulated that the FAAs induce mutations by causing thymine deprivation in the folic acid-requiring host.","['Genther, C S', 'Schoeny, R S', 'Loper, J C', 'Smith, C C']","['Genther CS', 'Schoeny RS', 'Loper JC', 'Smith CC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Antimicrob Agents Chemother,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,0315061,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Mutagens)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'VJT6J7R4TR (Rifampin)']",IM,"['Culture Media', 'Drug Resistance, Microbial', 'Folic Acid/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', '*Mutagens', 'Rifampin/pharmacology', 'Salmonella typhimurium/drug effects', 'Streptococcus/drug effects/growth & development', 'Time Factors']",,1977/07/01 00:00,1977/07/01 00:01,['1977/07/01 00:00'],"['1977/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1977 Jul;12(1):84-92. doi: 10.1128/AAC.12.1.84.,0066-4804 (Print) 0066-4804 (Linking),,['10.1128/AAC.12.1.84 [doi]'],PMC352158,,,,,,,,,

The age-related data from the normal children suggested that nearly 100% of children are infected with Pneumocystis during the first two years of life. Groups of patients with leukemia who had symptoms of pneumocystis pneumonia had significantly higher titers of IgG antibody than groups of patients with leukemia who did not have clinical symptoms and normal subjects.

The response was temperature, dose, and the time dependent with no activity being demonstrated in unstimulated cells. Several lines of evidence indicated that the RBL-1 product was markedly similar or identical to SRSs obtained from non-neoplastic tissues: 1) appropriate behavior in seven different chromatographic systems, 2) an appropriate profile of activity on various smooth muscle preparations, 3) an ability of low concentrations of the selective SRS inhibitor FPL 55712 to block the guinea pig ileal response, 4) failure of chymotrypsin to destroy activity, 5) loss of the activity after incubation with arylsulfatase, and 6) an ability to release activity from cells preincubated with indomethacin. Since RBL-1 cells can be grown in considerable guantity and under optimal conditions an average of 1500 SRS units/10(7) cells can be obtained, these cells should be useful as a biosynthetic source in further attempts to purify and characterize the SRS molecule.","['Jakschik, B A', 'Kulczycki, A Jr', 'MacDonald, H H', 'Parker, C W']","['Jakschik BA', 'Kulczycki A Jr', 'MacDonald HH', 'Parker CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Benzopyrans)', '0 (Chromones)', '0 (Ethers)', '0 (SRS-A)', '37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)', '8O730GH8AL (FPL 55712)', 'EC 3.1.6.1 (Arylsulfatases)', 'EC 3.4.21.1 (Chymotrypsin)', 'XXE1CET956 (Indomethacin)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*pharmacology', 'Arylsulfatases/pharmacology', 'Basophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Benzopyrans/pharmacology', 'Calcimycin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromones', 'Chymotrypsin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Ethers/pharmacology', 'Guinea Pigs', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Indomethacin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Muscle Contraction/drug effects', 'Muscle, Smooth/drug effects', 'Rats', 'SRS-A/isolation & purification/*metabolism/pharmacology']",,1977/08/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1977/08/01 00:00'],"['1977/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1977/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Aug;119(2):618-22.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

328134,NLM,MEDLINE,19770929,20190619,40,1 Suppl,1977 Jul,The mechanisms of lethal action of arabinosyl cytosine (araC) and arabinosyl adenine (araA).,509-18,"Certain D-arabinosyl nucleosides, notably arabinosyl cytosine (araC) and arabinosyl adenine (araA), are useful in the treatment of certain leukemias and some DNA virus infections, respectively. The compounds are lethal to animal cells and some bacteria. Despite extensive deamination, the parent nucleosides are transported within sensitive cells and phosphorylated to the mono-, di- and triphosphates. AraCTP and araATP are good specific competitive inhibitors of tumor cell of virus-induced DNA polymerases, competing with dCTP and dATP respectively. In addition to markedly inhibiting DNA synthesis, the aranucleotides enter newly formed DNA in internucleotide linkage. Sensitivity to the nucleosides appears to correlate with the relative ratio of formation of the triphosphate via a nucleoside kinase to degradation of the nucleoside via a nucleoside deaminase. Inhibition of the deaminase increases formation of the aranucleoside triphosphate in leukemic or virus-infected cells and markedly increases the toxicity of the nucleosides.

Particular advantages of total-body irradiation are the easy applicability, the relatively short time needed for treatment, and the lack of subjective secondary effects. Thus, ambulatory therapy can be performed without any difficulty. The only complication which may occur arises from myelotoxicity reaching its maximum not earlier than after the end of treatment. Careful follow-up of the patients, therefore, is indispensable. The indication of total-body irradiation for the treatment of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas depends on the objective findings, the stage of disease, and mainly on the histological classification.","['Ruhl, U']",['Ruhl U'],['ger'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Strahlentherapie,Strahlentherapie,1260024,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/*radiotherapy', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/radiotherapy', 'Prospective Studies']",,1977/05/01 00:00,1977/05/01 00:01,['1977/05/01 00:00'],"['1977/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Strahlentherapie. 1977 May;153(5):299-303.,0039-2073 (Print) 0039-2073 (Linking),Ganzkorperbestrahlung bei Non-Hodgkin-Lymphomen als Alternative zur Cehmotherapie.,,,,,,,,,,,

The therapeutic successes obtained with antitumor agents have led to increases in the life span of cancer patients, but have also provided the opportunity for this toxicity to become manifest. A search of the available literature was carried out, with emphasis on cases in which a malignancy developed in patients following chemotherapy for either neoplastic or non-neoplastic (e.g., renal transplantation, psoriasis) conditions; particular focus was given to the incidence of acute myelogenous leukemia in various groups of Hodgkin's disease and multiple myeloma patients. That patients with nonmalignant conditions treated with cytotoxic immunosuppressive agents are also at increased risk of developing a malignancy raises the possibility that these agents may have oncogenic potential. Therefore, one may be faced with the paradox that the patients benefiting most from chemotherapy may be at highest risk of suffering its consequences.","['Sieber, S M']",['Sieber SM'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Med Pediatr Oncol,Medical and pediatric oncology,7506654,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '35S93Y190K (Procarbazine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'MRK240IY2L (Azathioprine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",IM,"['Alkylating Agents/adverse effects', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Azathioprine/adverse effects', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Choriocarcinoma/drug therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/adverse effects', 'Dactinomycin/adverse effects', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/drug therapy', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/adverse effects', 'Kidney Neoplasms/chemically induced', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/chemically induced', 'Lymphoma/chemically induced', 'Mechlorethamine/adverse effects', 'Melphalan/adverse effects', 'Mercaptopurine/adverse effects', 'Methotrexate/adverse effects', 'Mice', 'Multiple Myeloma/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*chemically induced/drug therapy', 'Prednisone/adverse effects', 'Pregnancy', 'Procarbazine/adverse effects', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/adverse effects']",76,1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Med Pediatr Oncol. 1977;3(2):123-31. doi: 10.1002/mpo.2950030203.,0098-1532 (Print) 0098-1532 (Linking),,['10.1002/mpo.2950030203 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Modulated cells regained their susceptibility to FLV antibody-mediated complement-dependent lysis when transferred to medium containing normal mouse serum. After 48 h of culture in FLV-immune serum, 26% of the FLV erythroleukemic cells were devoid of FLV cell surface antigens as demonstrated by immunofluoresence. Antigenic modulation occurred to a greater extent in cells maintained in logarithmic growth than in cells in GO or resting phase. FLV-antigenic modulation is discussed as a possible mechanism by which antibody induces and maintains FLV-transformed cells in a dormant state.","['Genovesi, E V', 'Marx, P A', 'Wheelock, E F']","['Genovesi EV', 'Marx PA', 'Wheelock EF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,"['0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (Immunoglobulin G)']",IM,"['Animals', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', '*Antigens, Viral/analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Immune Sera/*pharmacology', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA/immunology', 'Tumor Virus Infections/*immunology']",,1977/08/01 00:00,1977/08/01 00:01,['1977/08/01 00:00'],"['1977/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1977 Aug 1;146(2):520-34. doi: 10.1084/jem.146.2.520.,0022-1007 (Print) 0022-1007 (Linking),,['10.1084/jem.146.2.520 [doi]'],PMC2180763,,,,,,,,,

The presence of these constituents in myeloid precursors from cases of acute and chronic myeloid leukaemia reflected the degree of cellular maturation, lysozyme appearing (as it does in normal myeloid cells) at the stage of primary granule production (in promyelocytes), while lactoferrin wad detectable only in more mature, secondary granule-containing myeloid cells. Auer rods stained positively for lysozyme, in keeping with their relationship to primary granules. Monocytes from five cases of leukaemia showing predominantly monocytic differentiation were indistinguishable from normal monocytes in their staining reactions for lysozyme despite the presence of raised serum and urinary lysozyme levels. In four cases of acute myeloid leukaemia circulating polymorphs deficient in lactoferrin were detected: in one of these cases a similar percentage of polymorphs was lysozyme negative.","['Mason, D Y']",['Mason DY'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,"['0 (Lactoglobulins)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Lactoferrin)']",IM,"['Humans', 'Immunoenzyme Techniques', 'Intracellular Fluid/analysis', 'Lactoferrin/*analysis', 'Lactoglobulins/*analysis', 'Leukemia, Monocytic, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/metabolism', 'Leukocytes/*analysis', 'Monocytes/analysis', 'Muramidase/*analysis', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/*metabolism', 'Neutrophils/analysis']",,1977/06/01 00:00,1977/06/01 00:01,['1977/06/01 00:00'],"['1977/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1977 Jun;30(6):541-6. doi: 10.1136/jcp.30.6.541.,0021-9746 (Print) 0021-9746 (Linking),,['10.1136/jcp.30.6.541 [doi]'],PMC476465,,,,,,,,,

If a sufficiently broad dose range is used, an irregular, nonlinear, nonmonotonic response curve is formed, generally W- or M-shaped, depending on the parameters selected for the representation, with two peaks of relative maximal effect. Accordingly, a modifying agent may exhibit, in some cases, dual effect--stimulation and depression, each at different dose levels. This typical response is defined as characteristic of the entire host defense system and therefore implies a biologically integrated system. The described dose-response relationship mandates the use of multiple doses in evaluation experiments, to establish efficacy and especially to design optimal dose schedules for experimental and clinical application of any agent modifying the host defense system activity.","['Bliznakov, E G']",['Bliznakov EG'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Biomedicine,Biomedicine / [publiee pour l'A.A.I.C.I.G.],0361342,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (BCG Vaccine)', '0 (Linoleic Acids)', '1339-63-5 (Ubiquinone)', '2880D3468G (Levamisole)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)']",IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'Animals', 'BCG Vaccine', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunity', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', '*Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Levamisole/immunology', 'Linoleic Acids/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mycobacterium bovis/immunology', 'Ubiquinone/immunology', 'Zymosan/immunology']",,1977/04/01 00:00,1977/04/01 00:01,['1977/04/01 00:00'],"['1977/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomedicine. 1977 Apr;26(2):73-6.,0300-0893 (Print) 0300-0893 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Suppression of lymphatic leukemia of syngeneic donor mice.,459-63,"""Antileukemic autotransplantation"" an approach to eradicate by antibodies residual leukemia in the bone marrow taken during remission and regrafted in relapse is proposed and is the basis of investigations on the elimination of leukemic cells transferred to syngeneic mice. Rabbit antiserum against mouse T cells killed over 99% of cells when incubated with 10-5 lymphocytes of a T cell AKR/J leukemia transferred subsequently to syngeneic hosts. Seventy-five per cent of the recipients of antibody-coated and complement-treated leukemic cells survived the observation period of 80 days. Recipients conditioned with 800 R and given syngeneic bone marrow mixed with 10-5 leukemic cells died within 11 days, while 40% survived the observation period of 100 days without leukemia if the leukemic bone marrow had been preincubated with anti-T cell globulin (ATCG) and complement. A detrimental effect of ATCG on normal T cells could only be demonstrated in thymectomized, irradiated recipients of syngeneic ATCG-treated marrow. These mice did not reject H-2-incompatible skin grafts in contrast to the controls without ATCG or without thymectomy. ATCG thus inhibited leukemic lymphocytes while sparing stem cells for hemopoietic reconstitution. At the same time it did not interfere with the recovery of cellular immunity after bone marrow transplantation.","['Thierfelder, S', 'Rodt, H', 'Netzel, B']","['Thierfelder S', 'Rodt H', 'Netzel B']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,['0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/*pharmacology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Immunotherapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",,1977/06/01 00:00,1977/06/01 00:01,['1977/06/01 00:00'],"['1977/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1977 Jun;23(6):459-63. doi: 10.1097/00007890-197706000-00001.,0041-1337 (Print) 0041-1337 (Linking),,['10.1097/00007890-197706000-00001 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The results of this study indicate that treatments with OK-432 and nucleic acid antimetabolites, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), exert a synergistic effect against L1210 leukemia probably in conjunction with the immunologic defenses of the host. This therapeutic synergism was to some extent dependent on the dose level of 5-FU and was not produced against the 5-FU-resistant L1210 subline. In mice pre-treated with OK-432 prior to the leukemia implantation, there was no synergistic effect as a result of post-treatment with 5-FU. When BDF mice had previously received X-ray irradiation or administration of corticosteroids, the synergism could not be expected either.

These cells have the structural and metabolic characteristics of a neoplastic cell line of B lymphocytes (except in cases of ""T-cell CLL""). However, they lack the immunoglobulin-secreting ability of normal B cells, and are immunologically incompetent and inert. Next to this population, there is a normal but reduced population of B cells and a periodically slightly increased T-cell population. The accumulation of pathological cells is based on a 10-fold increase in proliferation of cells that have a 5-fold increase in their life span. In addition, there is a disturbance of exchange of cells between the intra- and extravascular pools. These characteristics clarify the development of the clinical picture: through packing of the bone marrow with pathological cells on the one hand, and the spleen on the other, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and finally granulocytopenia develop. The gradual displacement of normal B cells often leads to extreme hypogammaglobulinemia as the main component of a multifactorial syndrome of immune deficiency.","['Theml, H', 'Love, R', 'Begemann, H']","['Theml H', 'Love R', 'Begemann H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Annu Rev Med,Annual review of medicine,2985151R,"['0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology/*physiology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'Lectins/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology/*physiology']",65,1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Annu Rev Med. 1977;28:131-41. doi: 10.1146/annurev.me.28.020177.001023.,0066-4219 (Print) 0066-4219 (Linking),,['10.1146/annurev.me.28.020177.001023 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Increased frequency of B-symptoms did not necessarily represent an unfavorable prognostic factor for the lymphoma entity concerned. Except for chronic lymphocytic leukemia the highest incidence of initial bone marrow involvement was seen in lymphoplasmacytoid, centrocytic and lymphoblastic lymphomas. Centrocytes have been observed in peripheral blood of patients with centrocytic and centroblastic-centrocytic lymphomas, even though lymphocytosis did not exist. Monoclonal hypergammaglobulinemia was found in only 43% of the sera from patients with lymphoplasmocytoid lymphoma. In this disease, it was possible to differentiate between a lymphonodal, a splenomegalic and an extranodal manifestation.","['Brittinger, G', 'Bartels, H', 'Bremer, K', 'Burger, A', 'Duhmke, E', 'Gunzer, U', 'Konig, E', 'Stacher, A', 'Stein, H', 'Theml, H', 'Waldner, R']","['Brittinger G', 'Bartels H', 'Bremer K', 'Burger A', 'Duhmke E', 'Gunzer U', 'Konig E', 'Stacher A', 'Stein H', 'Theml H', 'Waldner R']",['ger'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Strahlentherapie,Strahlentherapie,1260024,,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Lymph Nodes', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/pathology', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Splenomegaly']",,1977/04/01 00:00,1977/04/01 00:01,['1977/04/01 00:00'],"['1977/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Strahlentherapie. 1977 Apr;153(4):222-8.,0039-2073 (Print) 0039-2073 (Linking),Retrospektive Untersuchungen zur klinischen Bedeutung der Kiel-Klassifikation der malignen Non-Hodgkin-Lymphome,,,,,,,,,,,

Next in frequency were crepitant rales (65%), cough (41%), dyspnea (19%) and chest pain (18%). Radiographic evidence of pneumonia was found in 83% of cases and it consisted mainly of alveolar infiltrates involving both lung fields and predominantly the bases. Up to one-third of the patients had normal chestx-ray examinations at the onset of infection, though they subsequently became abnormal in 42% of them. The majority of patients (81%) whose initial chest x-rays did not reveal the presence of pneumonia were neutropenic (less than 1000 circumlating neutrophils/mm3). Klebsiella sp. and Pseudomonas sp. were the most common infecting organisms. The overall cure rate was 61%; 70% for Klebsiella sp. infections and 64% for Pseudomonas sp. infections. Pulmonary abscesses occurred in 14% of the cases. Cures were related to the antibiotic sensitivity of the infecting organisms and to the number of circulating neutrophils during the period of infection. Best results were obtained with the administration of gentamicin, the newer aminoglycoside antibiotic sisomicin, tobramycin and amikacin, or the combination of gentamicin with carbenicillin or with cephalosporins.

This was true whether the PEC and nonadherent spleen cells were in direct contact or separated by a cell-impermeable membrane which allowed the free passage of soluble mediators. CP-activated PEC also exhibited greatly increased cytostatic activity against the growth of syngeneic tumor cells in vitro. After fractionation of the PEC according to cell size by velocity sedimentation, a separation of A cell activity from anti-tumor activity was observed. Although both these functions were associated with phagocytic cells of the monocyte-macrophage series, the highest A cell activity was found in fractions containing small and medium-sized macrophages, whereas the anti-tumor activity increased with cell size to a maximum with the largest macrophages. Thus, there is a relative increase of suppressive activity over stimulatory activity with an increase in cell size. Cytochemical and morphologic evidence suggests that the A cell-rich fractions contained small and medium-sized macrophages which were derived from newly arrived monocytes, whereas the large tumor-suppressive macrophages were relatively more differentiated.","['Lee, K C', 'Berry, D']","['Lee KC', 'Berry D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/cytology/immunology', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Separation', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Female', '*Immunity', 'Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/immunology/metabolism', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred CBA', 'Phagocytosis', 'Propionibacterium acnes/*immunology', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",68,1977/05/01 00:00,1977/05/01 00:01,['1977/05/01 00:00'],"['1977/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 May;118(5):1530-40.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Survival was significantly prolonged in the BCG-treated group, and 27% of the mice were apparently cured. The tumor growth curves showed, furthermore, that BCG-rreated mice could be divided into two groups according to whether the ascitic tumor cell number was at control level or below that of the controls. By methods such as stathmokinetics, tritiated thymidine autoradiography, and cytophotometry, it was demonstrated that the proliferative activity was higher in BCG mice with a low tumor mass as compared to controls and BCG mice with a tumor mass similar to that of controls. The cytokinetic characteristics of BCG mice with a low ascitic tumor cell number were especially expressed by high mitotic activity, high initial labeling indices, short potential tumor doubling time, and a low number of G0-G1 cells. Furthermore the ascitic tumor cell loss rate was increased in these mice during the whole experimental period. It was deduced from the various parameters and especially from the cytophotometric and autoradiographic results that BCG induces a preferential kill of tumor cells in G0-G1 and the first part of the S phase. In addition, the cytological aspects of the ascitic tumor were found to be related to the cell kinetic pattern as the amount of small and large tumor cells increased and decreased, respectively, with accumulation of tumor cells in G0-G1.","['Olsson, L', 'Mathe, G']","['Olsson L', 'Mathe G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (BCG Vaccine)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)']",IM,"['Animals', '*BCG Vaccine', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/metabolism/pathology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mycobacterium bovis/*immunology']",,1977/06/01 00:00,1977/06/01 00:01,['1977/06/01 00:00'],"['1977/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Jun;37(6):1743-9.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

The skin of the trunk was most commonly involved with multiple, confluent erythematous plaques and soft, tender, non-ulcerated, violaceous nodules. Two patients had been treated for malignant lymphoma eight and nine years prior to the onset of skin lesions (Hodgkin's disease and nodular lymphocytic lymphoma, respectively), and cutaneous granulocytic leukemia developed in sites of irradiated skin. The skin biopsies in all cases were originally misinterpreted by the pathologist as malignant lymphoma and the correct diagnosis of granulocytic leukemia was not established in any of the cases until overt extracutaneous involvement was detected. The interval in the six patients from skin biopsy to definite involvement of blood and bone marrow by acute granulocytic leukemia ranged from three weeks to six months with a mean interval of 3.8 months. The mean duration of survival from the diagnosis of extracutaneous dissemination was 12.7 months (range of three months to two and one-half years). Poorly differentiated myelogenous leukemia was demonstrated at postmortem examination in all cases. Cytochemical stains of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues confirmed the granulocytic origin of the neoplasm: leukemic cells in skin biopsies, bone marrow aspirates, and autopsy specimens contained abundant naphthol AS-D chloracetate esterase. The findings indicate that granulocytic leukemia may rarely present with skin tumors as the original manifestation of the disease. Recognition of the distinctive clinical, histopathologic, and enzyme histochemical features of the lesion provide a basis for distinguishing granulocytic sarcoma of the skin from mycosis fungoides and other cutaneous malignant lymphomas.","['Long, J C', 'Mihm, M C']","['Long JC', 'Mihm MC']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,"['0 (Acetates)', 'EC 3.1.- (Esterases)']",IM,"['Acetates', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Esterases/metabolism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/blood/diagnosis/enzymology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/diagnosis', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/diagnosis', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Mycosis Fungoides/diagnosis', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/*pathology', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/pathology', 'Skin Neoplasms/diagnosis/enzymology/*pathology']",,1977/05/01 00:00,1977/05/01 00:01,['1977/05/01 00:00'],"['1977/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1977 May;39(5):2004-16. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197705)39:5<2004::aid-cncr2820390517>3.0.co;2-b.,0008-543X (Print) 0008-543X (Linking),,['10.1002/1097-0142(197705)39:5<2004::aid-cncr2820390517>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

In contrast to the literature on leukemia, there are few reported HD clusters. Statistical studies searching for time-space clustering in HD have been negative or inconclusive. The innovative Long Island school study of Vianna and Polan suggests that there is aggregation of etiologic exposures in HD. However, this study has been criticized and further confirmation is required. Additional support for the aggregation of exposures hypothesis is found in studies of familial aggregation of HD. On the other hand, teachers and physicians, groups suggested as having high exposure to HD patients, have been shown to be at no increased risk for HD. Available evidence would suggest that if HD is communicable, it is probably so only prior to manifestation of the disease and exposure must occur in childhood or adolescence. Although most studies have focused on the compatibility of their findings with interpersonal transmission of an etiologic agent, these data are equally compatible with an hypothesis of common source exposure to non-infectious etiologic agents.","['Grufferman, S']",['Grufferman S'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Child', 'Female', 'Hodgkin Disease/epidemiology/etiology/*transmission', 'Humans', 'Male', 'New York', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Time Factors']",33,1977/04/01 00:00,1977/04/01 00:01,['1977/04/01 00:00'],"['1977/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1977 Apr;39(4 Suppl):1829-33. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(197704)39:4+<1829::aid-cncr2820390815>3.0.co;2-a.,0008-543X (Print) 0008-543X (Linking),,['10.1002/1097-0142(197704)39:4+<1829::aid-cncr2820390815>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The in vitro RNA synthesized by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase has been isolated by sulfhydryl affinity column following reaction in the presence of 5-mercuriuridine triphosphate. By comparison of the Crt curves of the in vitro RNA with that of 70S viral RNA, the content of viral sequences is found to be 1.3% in nuclei product and 0.24% in chromatin product which is lower than the 2.5% found in chromatin associated RNA. This latter value, however, is very close to the in vivo viral RNA content in pulse-labeled [3H]RNA of the infected cells. Unexpectedly, it is observed that over 20% of the chromatin associated RNA prelabeled in vivo with [5-3H]uridine is elongated and tagged with Hg atoms during RNA synthesis catalyzed by the exogenous E. coli RNA polymerase in the presence of Hg-UTP. The elongation reaction is dependent on the presence of all four nucleotide triphosphates and appears to be due to E. coli RNA polymerase per se. It is suggested that most of the viral specific sequences observed in the in vitro RNA products are very likely initiated and derived from the chromatin associated species.

Of the patients who attained remission. 22 were in the chemotherapy group and in September 1975 2 remained alive, the median survival time being 270 days and after relapse 75 days. Twenty-eight patients received immunotherapy during remission, and 5 remained alive; the median survival time of the group being 510 days and after relapse 165 days. Ongoing acturial analysis precisely predicted early in the study the median survival of the two groups, but it took a 2-year follow-up after entry of the last patient before it became clear that there were very few long-term survivors. The increase in survival time produced by the immunotherapy is apparently made up of two components: prolongation of the first remission and length of survival after the first relapse. It must be notted that the chemotherapy for this study was devised 6 years ago and the results of the control arm (chemotherapy alone) may be poorer than those obtained in contemporary studies.","['Powles, R L', 'Russell, J', 'Lister, T A', 'Oliver, T', 'Whitehouse, J M', 'Malpas, J', 'Chapuis, B', 'Crowther, D', 'Alexander, P']","['Powles RL', 'Russell J', 'Lister TA', 'Oliver T', 'Whitehouse JM', 'Malpas J', 'Chapuis B', 'Crowther D', 'Alexander P']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,['0 (BCG Vaccine)'],IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'BCG Vaccine/*therapeutic use', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Time Factors']",,1977/03/01 00:00,1977/03/01 00:01,['1977/03/01 00:00'],"['1977/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1977 Mar;35(3):265-72. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1977.38.,0007-0920 (Print) 0007-0920 (Linking),,['10.1038/bjc.1977.38 [doi]'],PMC2025283,,,,,,,,,

Three independent methods, however, indicated that the acquisition of complement resistance preceded the complete disappearance of TL antigens from the cell surface. Modulated cells reduced known titers of TL antisera by absorption; they stained positively in immunofluorescence studies involving TL antibodies and fluorescence-labeled rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin. TL antigens labeled previously with 125I were recovered by immunoprecipitation from cellular extracts prepared with nonionic detergent. Continued exposure of the cells to TL antiserum led to virtually complete disappearance of the antigens. Similar results were obtained for RADA-1 cells, another murine leukemia that forms TL antigens, although in this instance the cells were resistant to the cytolytic effects of TL antisera and guinea pig complement (GPC) without prior exposure to TL antibodies. The density of TL antigens remaining on the surface of different TL(+) cell types failed to correlate with resistance to TL antibodies and GPC. Cells from F, hybrids of TL(+) and TL(-) mouse strains formed TL antigens and were susceptible to TL antibodies and GPC even though the density of TL antigens formed by the susceptible cells was less than the density of TL antigens formed by modulated cells. Stable somatic hybrids of RADA-1 cells and TL(-) cells formed TL antigens at lower density than did RADA-1 cells and lysed in the presence of aliquots of the TL antisera and GPC used in previous tests.","['Liang, W', 'Cohen, E P']","['Liang W', 'Cohen EP']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,"['0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Neoplasm', '*Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cell Membrane/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Complement System Proteins', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology']",,1977/04/01 00:00,1977/04/01 00:01,['1977/04/01 00:00'],"['1977/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1977 Apr;58(4):1079-86. doi: 10.1093/jnci/58.4.1079.,0027-8874 (Print) 0027-8874 (Linking),,['10.1093/jnci/58.4.1079 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

Although irradiation of the injected tumor prevented its overgrowth, it did not significantly alter the antigenicity of the tumor. Immunologic activities of tumor-associated host cells in the peritoneal cavity were continuously monitored, starting 48 hr after tumor administration. In vitro cell-mediated lysis of syngeneic tumors appeared as early as 3 days after irradiated tumor administration. In addition, peritoneal exudate cells from inoculated mice were capable of adoptively transferring immunity. Purification of these peritoneal exudate cells on nylon wool columns yielded a nonadherent Ig-negative lymphocyte fraction whose cytolysis was tumor-specific and T cell-associated. The macrophage-free lymphocyte fraction exhibited a higher in vitro activity against tumors than unpurified peritoneal exudates. This tumor-host system allowed the study of cells which directly interact with the tumor cells in vivo, starting shortly after tumor administration. The results reported in this paper show that tumor-associated lymphoid cells capable of mounting anti-tumor response in vivo and in vitro can be demonstrated as early as 3 days after tumor inoculation.","['Schick, B', 'Berke, G']","['Schick B', 'Berke G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Ascitic Fluid/immunology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Time Factors', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",,1977/03/01 00:00,1977/03/01 00:01,['1977/03/01 00:00'],"['1977/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Mar;118(3):986-91.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Enhanced MICC was present at various effector-to-target cell ratios and at several mitogen concentrations. Removal of adherent, phagocytic cells by carbonyl iron, glass wool, or rayon columns abolished the MICC response from the peripheral blood of both multiple myeloma patients and normal controls. Thus, the effector cell mediating MICC may be monocytic in origin and closely resembles the suppressor cell for immunoglobulin synthesis described in patients with multiple myeloma. Our data suggest that the MICC assay with chicken red blood cells as targets may provide a convenient method for identifying pathologic conditions where this cytotoxic effector cell population plays an active role.","['Yonkosky, D M', 'Silverman, S L', 'Cathcart, E S']","['Yonkosky DM', 'Silverman SL', 'Cathcart ES']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,['0 (Mitogens)'],IM,"['Adult', 'Blood Cells', 'Cell Separation', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Multiple Myeloma/blood/*immunology']",,1977/03/01 00:00,1977/03/01 00:01,['1977/03/01 00:00'],"['1977/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Mar;118(3):947-51.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Cancer is the major somatic late effect of exposure to low dose levels of radiation, and estimates of risk of cancer in man after irradiation are based entirely on human experience. The data for dose-response relationships for the induction of tumors by external irradiation in man have been obtained from a single exposure or a small number of exposures delivered at high dose rates. In contrast, exposure to environmental irradiation is mainly protracted over a long period of time and is delivered at a low dose rate. As yet no allowance has been made for the effect of protraction of the exposure time in estimating the risk of cancer, although an adjustment has been made in the case of estimates of genetic risk. Incidence of tumors has been the only parameter used for risk estimates, but latent period and degree of malignancy, which are probably both dose and dose-rate dependent, influence the nature of the risk from radiation. As the knowledge about the effects of low-level radiation has been accumulated and assimilated over the last 70 years, so has the concern for reasonable standards of safety. There are still problems in the estimation of radiation risks, but at least many of the relevant questions can now be framed. The problems of estimating risks for chemical carcinogens are clearly greater, but the experience gained from radiation studies should help in the design of the necessary experiments.","['Fry, R J', 'Ainsworth, E J']","['Fry RJ', 'Ainsworth EJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Fed Proc,Federation proceedings,0372771,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],IM,"['Age Factors', 'Animals', 'Body Burden', 'Bone Neoplasms/etiology', 'DNA/radiation effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Energy Transfer', 'Harderian Gland/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Longevity/radiation effects', 'Lymphoma/etiology', 'Mice', '*Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced', 'Osteosarcoma/etiology', '*Radiation Injuries', 'Radiation Injuries, Experimental', 'Thymus Neoplasms/etiology', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/etiology', 'Time Factors']",37,1977/04/01 00:00,1977/04/01 00:01,['1977/04/01 00:00'],"['1977/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Fed Proc. 1977 Apr;36(5):1703-7.,0014-9446 (Print) 0014-9446 (Linking),,,,,,['NASA: 77138690'],,,,,,

In this longitudinal sutdy the specific accent was put on the intensified induction treatment of 8 weeks' duration which was thought to achieve a higher remission quality. In this phase 8 effective drugs were applied up to the patient's tolerance limits; in addition prophylactic irradiation to the central nervous system was given in two modifications. After 4 weeks all patients were in complete remission. During the first 4 months 6 children died due to complications for which therapy must be at least partially responsible. 17 out of 67 patients relapsed between 4 and 59 months after diagnosis, which corresponds to a remission rate according to the life table analysis of 62% (50 out of 67 patients in first remission). The majority of patients with relapse is characterized at diagnosis by a specific pattern of clinical findings. 2 therapy groups, differently treated in respect to central nervous system irradaiation and duration of continuation therapy, do not at present statistically differ from each other. According to statistics 8 more children may be expected to suffer from relapse. The improved results are due to a lower incidence of bone marrow relapses; it seems that there is a direct relation between intensity of treatment during the induction phase and the occurrence of bone marrow relapses. The specific problems of the presented study take place during the induction phase, which, due to toxicity, regularly results in a number of side effects and severe complications. In order to realize the induction therapy, the use of prophylactic and supportive procedures is of utmost importance. Profound knowledge of possible side effects and complications is most essential as well as the knowledge of how to cope with these problems. It is the authors' opinion that the induction phase can only be performed in specialized institutions, because only at these places enough information may be obtained from an adequate number of patients and only there pediatric oncologists may share in the decisions and responsibilities. Only by using every kind of medical service this method of therapy may be justified at present, according to the results of this study, for the benefit of children with leukemia.","['Riehm, H', 'Gadner, H', 'Welte, K']","['Riehm H', 'Gadner H', 'Welte K']",['ger'],"['Clinical Trial', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Klin Padiatr,Klinische Padiatrie,0326144,,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Berlin', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Clinical Trials as Topic', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Germany, West', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Recurrence', 'Remission, Spontaneous', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Sex Factors']",,1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Klin Padiatr. 1977 Jan;189(8):89-102.,0300-8630 (Print) 0300-8630 (Linking),Die West-Berliner Studie zur Behandlung der akuten lymphoblastischen Leukamie des Kindes--Erfahrungsbericht nach 6 Jahren,,,,,,,,,,,['Klin Padiatr. 2013 May;225 Suppl 1:S16-29.

This type of antigen, referred to as human peripheral T cell antigen (HPTA), was found on peripheral T cells and medullary thymocytes, but not on cortical thymocytes and B cells. The percentage of ATS-reactive lymphocytes in human peripheral lymphoid organs was correlated with that of cells rosetting with sheep erythrocytes, but contrasted with the number of B cells defined by the presence of a complement (C) receptor or by rabbit anti-human B cell serum (ABS). ATS also reacted with T cells purified by nylon fiber column filtration but ABS did not. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells rosetted with either sheep erythrocytes or erythrocyte-antibody-complement complexes were lysed by ATS and ABS, respectively. Mitogenic responses of blood lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and concanavalin-A (Con A) were abrogated by treating them with ATS and C, whereas ABS suppressed only their response to Con A. Although numerous thymus cells rosetted with SRBC, only 14% were reactive with ATS. Quantitative absorption studies demonstrated that HPTA content of the thymus cells was much lower than that of lymph node cells. Anatomical localization of ATS-reactive lymphocytes in human lymphoid organs studied by immunofluorescence indicated that they were present in the thymus-dependent paracortical areas of lymph node and in the medullary region of thymus. ABS, on the other hand, did not stain thymocytes but reacted selectively with the cells located in the lymphoid follicles of lymph node. These data, together with that from cell suspension studies, confirmed that HPTA were shared between medullary thymocytes and peripheral T cells.","['Koshiba, H', 'Ishii, Y', 'Yamanaka, N', 'Kikuchi, K']","['Koshiba H', 'Ishii Y', 'Yamanaka N', 'Kikuchi K']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)']",IM,"['Antigens/*analysis', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Humans', 'Immunosorbent Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",,1977/02/01 00:00,1977/02/01 00:01,['1977/02/01 00:00'],"['1977/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Feb;118(2):625-9.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Cellular analysis of immunosuppression.,600-6,"Infection of adult C57BL/6 mice with variants of the radiation leukemia virus resulted in variable leukemia incidence. One variant, designated D-RadLV, induced lymphatic leukemia in 0 to 25% of mice after virus inoculation directly into the thymus of young adult mice. The leukemia incidence could be increased to 80 to 100% by host exposure to x-rays. The second variant, A-RadLV, induced lymphatic leukemia in 80 to 100% of similarly inoculated mice without the need for additional radiation treatment. Adult mice were inoculated with D-radLV or A-RadLV. Both variants reduced the immune response to sheep erythrocytes whereas only D-RadLV had an immunosuppressive effect after immunization with a thymus-independent immunogen polyvinyl-pyrrolidone (PVP). Results of transfer experiments indicated that the immunosuppressive effects were expressed at the immunocompetent cell level. Thymus-derived cells were affected by A-RadLV since their immunocompetent function was impaired, whereas D-RadLV affected the marrow cell population of immunocytes. Exposure of D-RadLV-inoculated mice to x-rays induced functional impairment of both thymus and marrow cells. Since the radiation leukemia virus induces ""T"" lymphatic leukemia it could be proposed that the initial tropism of the virus to thymocytes would lead to high leukemia induction potential, whereas virus tropism to bone marrow cells would yield a low leukemia incidence. The coleukemogenic effect of x-rays could perhaps be related with its capacity to alter and introduce a change in virus-lymphoid cells interaction.","['Haran-Ghera, N', 'Ben-Yaakov, M', 'Peled, A']","['Haran-Ghera N', 'Ben-Yaakov M', 'Peled A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Female', '*Genetic Variation', 'Hemolytic Plaque Technique', '*Immunity, Cellular', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Retroviridae/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/transplantation', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",,1977/02/01 00:00,1977/02/01 00:01,['1977/02/01 00:00'],"['1977/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Feb;118(2):600-6.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Diagnostic radiation given to pregnant women, knowingly or unknowingly, should rarely reach teratogenic levels causing brain and eye abnormalities. Evidence suggests that it does increase the risk of childhood malignancy, especially leukemia. Although rapidly growing tissues seem most susceptible, all radiation probably carries a very small risk of carcinogenesis. Genetic damage is equally difficult to estimate. Diagnostic radiation of females, even in childhood, may be related to an increased incidence of Down's syndrome in older mothers. Radiation also causes point mutations, which may explain the increase of some genetic abnormalities in progeny of older fathers. Whenever an abdominal or pelvic radiograph is ordered before the end of the reproductive period, there must be a potential benefit to balance the small risk involved.","['Houston, C S', 'Shokeir, M H']","['Houston CS', 'Shokeir MH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Canada,J Can Assoc Radiol,Journal of the Canadian Association of Radiologists,7505589,,IM,"['Animals', 'Chromosomes/radiation effects', 'Congenital Abnormalities/etiology', 'Female', 'Fetal Death/etiology', 'Fetus/radiation effects', 'Genes/radiation effects', 'Genes, Dominant/radiation effects', 'Genes, Recessive/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Mutation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/etiology', 'Pregnancy', 'Radiation Dosage', '*Radiation Effects', 'Radiography/*adverse effects', 'Sex Factors']",53,1977/03/01 00:00,1977/03/01 00:01,['1977/03/01 00:00'],"['1977/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Can Assoc Radiol. 1977 Mar;28(1):62-8.,0008-2902 (Print) 0008-2902 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

Lipopolysaccharide was effective with one line at 4 ng/ml. All four lines actively phagocytosed zymosan and latex beads. In many cases the growth inhibition was apparently immediate but only cytostatic, and cell proliferation resumed upon removal of the drug. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, live or boiled, was toxic to some of the tumor lines. Synthesis of lysozyme by all the cell lines in the monocyte series and production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor by the myelomonocytic leukemia were not inhibited during several days of zero growth conditions in the presence of drugs. Since these agents had no direct effect on other hematopoietic tumor types (myeloma, T-lymphoma, mastocytoma) at the same or up to 10(4) higher concentrations, it is proposed that the sensitive tumors retain specific receptors for immunostimulants, either at the cell surface or within the cell in the case of phagocytosable particles. The binding of these agents to physiological receptors leads to stimulation and mitogenesis in normal macrophages and lymphocytes but leads to growth inhibition without affecting differenetiated functions in the corresponding tumor lines.","['Ralph, P', 'Nakoinz, I']","['Ralph P', 'Nakoinz I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (BCG Vaccine)', '0 (Dextrans)', '0 (Latex)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Tuberculin)', '9010-72-4 (Zymosan)', 'EC 3.2.1.17 (Muramidase)']",IM,"['*Adjuvants, Immunologic', 'BCG Vaccine', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Survival', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Dextrans/immunology', 'Latex/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse/immunology', 'Microspheres', 'Monocytes/immunology', 'Muramidase/biosynthesis', 'Mycobacterium bovis/immunology', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Tuberculin', 'Zymosan/immunology']",,1977/02/01 00:00,1977/02/01 00:01,['1977/02/01 00:00'],"['1977/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1977 Feb;37(2):546-50.,0008-5472 (Print) 0008-5472 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied cell surface antigens on blasts from 12 children with untreated ALL: eight with E-ALL and four with E+ALL. Heterologous antisera were raised against thymus cells, E+ and E-ALL blasts, appropriately absorbed and tested by immunofluorescence and a radiolabeled antibody assay with normal and leukemic lymphoid cells. By both methods, anti-thymus and anti-E+ALL sera reacted with human thymocytes. Specific binding of anti-E+ALL serum to T antigens was indicated by the fact that a single absorption with thymocytes abolished its binding to allogenic thymocytes, and the reactivity of anti-E+ALL serum with thymus, blood and bone marrow lymphocytes was similar to that of anti-thymus serum. After exhaustive absorption with blood leukocytes, anti-E+ALL and E-ALL sera were negative against normal lymphocytes and bone marrow cells from children with ALL in remission. Anti-thymus and anti-E+ALL sera reacted with blasts from patients with E+ALL, but not with E-ALL. In contrast, anti-E+ALL serum reacted with 40 to 96% of blasts from all children with E-ALL, whereas of the four patients with E+ALL, two were negative and two had the lowest percentage of immunofluorescent cells (10 to 22%). These results were confirmed with the radiolabeled antibody assay. Patients with active E-ALL had cells bearing E-ALL antigen(s) in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, but the number of immunofluorescent cells was lower in blood. Cells reactive with anti-E-ALL serum did not react with thymus cells, blood lymphocytes, remission bone marrow cells, Raji cells, PWM and PHA-induced blasts and CLL cells bearing mIg (uk). These data suggest that the antigen detected on E-ALL blasts by anti-E-ALL serum is neither a HLA-related nor a cell differentiation antigen. Thus, by using antiserum to E+ALL blasts, we have confirmed the presence of a T cell-specific antigen(s) on E+ALL cells. This antiserum did not recognize other leukemia-associated antigens common to E+ and E-ALL. We have also demonstrated an antigen(s) which is regularly expressed on E-ALL blasts and is either not detectable or is present in a lower proportion of E+ALL blasts.","['Borella, L', 'Sen, L', 'Casper, J T']","['Borella L', 'Sen L', 'Casper JT']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",IM,"['Age Factors', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antilymphocyte Serum', 'Binding Sites', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Erythrocytes/*immunology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Techniques', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/analysis', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/immunology']",,1977/01/01 00:00,1977/01/01 00:01,['1977/01/01 00:00'],"['1977/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1977/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1977/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1977 Jan;118(1):309-15.,0022-1767 (Print) 0022-1767 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

The cells were rapidly lost from the animal when compared to cells injected intraperitoneally, and at a rate indistinguishable from cells deliberately killed and given intraorally. If the alloantigen used to stimulate the T cells in vitro was shared by the neonate, the T cells were lost even faster. It was also found that highly lethal labelled leukemia cells behaved in a similar fashion and did not cause excess mortality if given intraorally.

No other heterologous and isologous antisera, i.e. rabbit anti-mouse thymocyte antiserum, goat antiserum against antigens shared by thymus and B cells, anti-Thy-1.2 and anti-Ia antisera, could eliminate NK function regardless of their definite reactivity against T or B cells.

Radioresistance was found to be dominant in both the hybrid lines as was resistance to EMS and U.V. to which the parental lines also show differential sensitivity. The ability to recover from sublethal damage after X-irradiation was found to be temperature sensitive in radiosensitive cells, an inverse effect being seen when LS cells were irradiated at 20 degrees C and held at 20 degrees C between dose fractions.

This group comprehends five histological types: lymphocytic, immunocytic, plasmacytic, centrocytic, and centroblastic-centrocytic lymphomas. The lymphocytic lymphomas are second in frequency among the biopsies. The most common lymphocytic lymphoma is the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is characterized by the proliferation of small lymphocytes. The quantity and arrangement of the constantly present paraimmunoblasts and prolymphocytes allow to distinguish three histological subtypes of CLL. CLL, prolymphocytic leukemia, and hairy cell leukemia may be composed of B- or T-cells. Mycosis fungoides, Sezary's syndrome and T-zone lymphomas are T-cell lymphomas. All NHL of low-grade malignancy show a proliferation of small to medium sized lymphoid cells. Some large blast forms may be intermingled among these smaller cells. The inhomogeneity of low-grade malignant lymphomas with regard to the size of predominant cells and the admixture of blast forms determine the higher (""intermediate"") degree of malignancy of some types in the group of low-grade malignant lymphomas. The overgrowth of the intermingled blast forms probably leads to the transformation into a lymphoma of high-grade malignancy.

The following morphological features in the initial bone marrow were recorded: blast size, percentage periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and oil-red-O (ORO) positivity, percentage of blasts with vacuoles, and acid phosphatase positivity. The blasts were also coded according to the FAB (L13) classification. When analysed separately, increasing blast size was significantly related to the length of first remission (P = 0.01). However, this was almost entirely due to its association with the FAB L2 type of disease which also had a highly significant influence on length of first remission (P less than 0.0001) independent of all other factors. Patients with L3 disease had blasts with heavy vacuolation, ORO positivity and displayed monoclonal surface immunoglobulin and their prognosis was very poor. The percentage of vacuolated blasts and ORO positivity otherwise showed no influence on prognosis. Fine granularity of PAS staining in lymphoblasts showed no prognostic value but the trend of longer remission duration with increase in percentage of PAS coarse granularity and blocks, was statistically significant (P = 0.006). This relationship was partly due to a correlation with the presence of mediastinal mass and L2 disease, but was still independent of all other prognostic factors. In a smaller number (39) of the series of patients on whom cell surface markers were available, we were unable to demonstrate a correlation between T-derived blasts and the L1 and L2 classification; but there was a strong correlation with polar acid phosphatase positivity in T-derived blasts.","['Hann, I M', 'Evans, D I', 'Palmer, M K', 'Morris-Jones, P J', 'Haworth, C']","['Hann IM', 'Evans DI', 'Palmer MK', 'Morris-Jones PJ', 'Haworth C']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Lab Haematol,Clinical and laboratory haematology,7907061,['EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)'],IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/blood', 'B-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/*ultrastructure', 'Periodic Acid-Schiff Reaction', 'Prognosis', 'Rosette Formation', 'T-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure']",,1979/01/01 00:00,1979/01/01 00:01,['1979/01/01 00:00'],"['1979/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Lab Haematol. 1979;1(3):215-26. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2257.1979.tb00470.x.,0141-9854 (Print) 0141-9854 (Linking),,['10.1111/j.1365-2257.1979.tb00470.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of this procedure in correcting these complicating features and to assess the length of response and the clinical well being of the patients. Twenty such patients with either chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or lymphocytic lymphoma were studied using a Continuous Flow Cell Separator (Aminco Celltrifuge). All had persistent significant anaemia and/or thrombocytopenia prior to the institution of leukapheresis. The procedure was carried out on alternate days until significant reduction in total circulating lymphoid cells had been achieved, an average of 2.9 x 10(11) cells being removed on each occasion. Thirteen of the twenty patients showed a significant elevation of both haemoglobin and platelet level concomitant with reduction in lymphoid cells. A reduction in organomegaly was also observed. These patients were classified as ""responders,"" but the other patients failed to show correction of the haematologic parameters. This procedure permitted a number of responder patients to receive more specific treatment but in some it obviated the necessity for any further management for up to 12 months. Surface marker studies were also carried out on the lymphocytes of these patients. The patients who showed the best response to leukapheresis had cells characteristic of those seen in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The reduction of cells (82%) was greater in those who responded to this treatment than in the non-responder group (72%).

Repair in lymphocytes from chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.,329-37,"There have been conflicting reports about the capacity of lymphocytes from individuals with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) to undertake u.v.-induced DNA repair. We have examined repair in CLL cells and in control and age-matched purified B and T lymphocytes by a technique independent of incorporation of radioactive precursor, i.e. by the recovery of normal sedimentation behaviour of nucleoid bodies obtained from these cells by lysis in high salt and non-ionic detergent. Recovery of normal sedimentation is associated with restoration of DNA supercoiling. CLL cells were found to be as sensitive to u.v. and to repair at similar rates as age-matched B controls. They are considerably more sensitive than young B cells and repair less efficiently. Reasons for the reported discrepancies in CLL repair are discussed.","['Yew, F H', 'Johnson, R T']","['Yew FH', 'Johnson RT']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,J Cell Sci,Journal of cell science,0052457,,IM,"['Aged', 'Aging', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', '*DNA Repair', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism/radiation effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Mitosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Ultraviolet Rays']",,1979/10/01 00:00,1979/10/01 00:01,['1979/10/01 00:00'],"['1979/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Sci. 1979 Oct;39:329-37.,0021-9533 (Print) 0021-9533 (Linking),,,,,,,,,,,,

GM-CSF also increased colony size and content of daughter colony-forming cells. Serial recloning of WEHI-3B colonies in the presence of GM-CSF showed that when colonies differentiated completely, self-replication of the colony-forming cell was suppressed (clonal extinction). However, WEHI-3B cells exhibited clonal instability and even in the continuous presence of GM-CSF many colony-forming cells still generated cells able to form undifferentiated colonies. It appears unlikely that GM-CSF can completely suppress the progressive proliferation of a myeloid leukemic population of the WEHI-3B type.","['Metcalf, D']",['Metcalf D'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Clone Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology', 'Macrophages/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Transplantation, Isogeneic']",,1979/11/15 00:00,1979/11/15 00:01,['1979/11/15 00:00'],"['1979/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1979/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1979 Nov 15;24(5):616-23. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910240515.,0020-7136 (Print) 0020-7136 (Linking),,['10.1002/ijc.2910240515 [doi]'],,,,,,,,,,

The same effect was obtained in 1-year-old BALB/c mice. However, in 4-week-old C57BL/6 or 6-week old BALB/c mice, anti-IF IgG enhanced only the growth of early tumours but had no effect on their regression.

Among 1200 primary cultures, 60 produced an antibody that could distinguish between the immunizing leukemia cells and an isologous B lymphoblastoid cell line. Of these, two produced an antibody that detects an antigen expressed preferentially on ALL cells and on a subpopulation of normal cells found in the cortex of the thymus. Other normal human lymphoid cells from lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and peripheral blood express only low levels of this antigen. High levels of this ""thymus-leukemia"" antigen were found on T-ALL cells, T-ALL-derived cell lines, and some ""null"" ALL cells. By contrast, B-cell leukemias, B lymphoblastoid cell lines, and normal and malignant myeloid cells contain either low or undetectable amounts of this antigen. The thymus-leukemia antigen has been isolated from the membranes of leukemia cells by detergent solubilization and subsequent immunoprecipitation with the monoclonal antibody. Preliminary biochemical characterization shows the antigen to be associated with a polypeptide of Mr approximately 28,000.","['Levy, R', 'Dilley, J', 'Fox, R I', 'Warnke, R']","['Levy R', 'Dilley J', 'Fox RI', 'Warnke R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",IM,"['Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis/isolation & purification', 'Clone Cells/immunology', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Spleen/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology']",,1979/12/01 00:00,1979/12/01 00:01,['1979/12/01 00:00'],"['1979/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1979/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1979/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1979 Dec;76(12):6552-6. doi: 10.1073/pnas.76.12.6552.,0027-8424 (Print) 0027-8424 (Linking),,['10.1073/pnas.76.12.6552 [doi]'],PMC411904,,,,,,,,,
