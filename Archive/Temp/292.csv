Uninfected patients in remission had significantly better survival than infected ones and/or in relapse. Overall incidence of interstitial pneumonia was 43%. Rejection and relapse were encountered in 26% of patients. Concerning cause of death, interstitial pneumonia was the most frequent cause (44%). Uni- and multivariate analyses strongly suggested that favorable prognostic factors were remission, uninfection, preparation of low-dose-rate fractionated TBI and cyclophosphamide, and mild graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) for acute leukemia patient treated with allogeneic BMT.","['Inoue, T', 'Masaoka, T', 'Shibata, H']","['Inoue T', 'Masaoka T', 'Shibata H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Strahlenther Onkol,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ...

Southern blot hybridizations revealed that the 416B cells contain a rearranged c-Ki-ras gene in addition to an apparently normal gene. Molecular cloning and DNA sequence analyses demonstrated that the rearrangement involves the insertion of a 3.5-kilobase-pair segment of Friend virus that includes the envelope gene (env) and 3' long terminal repeat. The Friend provirus is positioned between a 5' nontranslated exon (exon phi) and the first coding exon (exon 1) of the c-Ki-ras gene in the same transcriptional orientation. Results of RNA blot analyses indicate that transcription from the rearranged gene initiates at a promoter that excludes sequences in exon phi. The data support the hypothesis that enhanced c-Ki-ras expression in the 416B cells results from integration of a Friend provirus within this gene.","['George, D L', 'Glick, B', 'Trusko, S', 'Freeman, N']","['George DL', 'Glick B', 'Trusko S', 'Freeman N']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Female', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/*physiology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Mice', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*biosynthesis', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Mar;83(6):1651-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.6.1651.,"['0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']",['10.1073/pnas.83.6.1651 [doi]'],,"['CA34462/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM32592/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC323141,"['GENBANK/M13293', 'GENBANK/M13294']",,,,

The levels of expression were determined by measuring the amounts of specific RNA in blot hybridization assays. Levels of expression of the G1 genes were compared to the level of expression of the S-phase-specific H3 gene. This method can distinguish whether an increased expression of G1 genes is truly due to deregulation or simply reflects an increase in the fraction of proliferating cells. In a normal asynchronous system provided by the bone marrow cells of three normal donors, the expressions of the four G1-specific genes 2A9, 2F1, 4F1, and c-myc, and of the S-phase-specific gene H3 were in ratios that differed little from one individual to another. In the total RNA of eight patients in the chronic phase of chronic myelogenous leukemia, a high level of expression of G1 cell-cycle genes was paralleled by a high level of expression of the S-phase H3 gene, simply reflecting an increase in the fraction of proliferating cells. In patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), the RNA levels of 2F1 and 4F1 paralleled the expression of H3-i.e., the ratios of expression 2F1/H3 and 4F1/H3 were the same as in normal bone marrow cells. However, in 9 of 10 patients with AML we found that the expression of c-myc was elevated with respect to H3 expression. The expression of 2A9 (with respect to H3) was also elevated in some of these AML patients. Two important conclusions can be drawn from these findings: increased levels of a G1-specific RNA in a tumor may not indicate overexpression of that gene but may instead simply reflect the fraction of proliferating cells; and in some patients with AML, however, the expression of certain G1 genes is truly deregulated and might contribute to the impairment of proliferative control that is associated with this phenotype.","['Calabretta, B', 'Venturelli, D', 'Kaczmarek, L', 'Narni, F', 'Talpaz, M', 'Anderson, B', 'Beran, M', 'Baserga, R']","['Calabretta B', 'Venturelli D', 'Kaczmarek L', 'Narni F', 'Talpaz M', 'Anderson B', 'Beran M', 'Baserga R']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['*Cell Cycle', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Histones/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/*genetics']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1986 Mar;83(5):1495-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.83.5.1495.,"['0 (Histones)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)']",['10.1073/pnas.83.5.1495 [doi]'],,"['AG 00378/AG/NIA NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 25898/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'SO7-RR05417/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",PMC323103,,,,,

On the basis of the frequency of positivity with the myelocytic variants (FAB M1-3) or monocytic variants (FAB M4/5) of acute myeloid leukemias, the MoAbs were assigned to one of four groups. MoAbs of Group I identified most cases of both the myelocytic and the monocytic cell lineages ('pan-myelomonocytic' reactivity) and can be used to identify acute myeloid leukemias regardless of the subtype. Group II comprised MoAbs which reacted with the majority of FAB M1-3 cases, but showed a preference in reactivity with AMMoL/AMoL cases (reactivity: myelocytic partly, monocytic predominantly). MoAbs of Group III stained most cases with monocytic phenotypes, but labelled only a small percentage of non-monocytic cases. These MoAbs are valuable tools for the detection of cases with monocytic features. Group IV MoAbs reacted with a small to intermediate percentage of myelocytic and/or monocytic cases. Besides their diagnostic application MoAbs might be used in new therapeutic approaches such as in-vivo serotherapy with MoAbs and purging of autologous bone marrow for transplantation. None of the described MoAbs appear to be leukemia-specific. Many MoAbs have been produced against non-myelomonocytic cells and were reactive with cells outside the myelomonocytic cell lineages and the hematopoietic system. Other MoAbs with apparent cell lineage-restricted reactivity regarding normal cells stained leukemic cells of other cell lineages. This phenomenon of translineage reactivity of leukemic cells with mutually exclusive markers indicating a biphenotypic marker profile might be the result of abnormal, disregulated gene expression. New classification systems of acute myeloid leukemias based on immunological marker profiles have been proposed. The analysis of reactivity of normal and malignant myelomonocytic cells with MoAbs has led to refined differentiation schemes of the normal hematopoiesis.","['Drexler, H G', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/classification/diagnosis/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1986;10(3):279-90. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(86)90025-1.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",['10.1016/0145-2126(86)90025-1 [doi]'],90,,,,,,,

In the prolymphocytic leukemia, 64% of the cells showed EBNA positivity on day 7 and giant cells with huge round or multiple nuclei appeared which were EBNA-positive.

Along with the increasing cytotoxic potential of the three therapy protocols, T-cell counts fell to lower levels. Following all three forms of cytoreductive therapy, T8+ T-cell counts decreased to lower levels than T4+ T-cell counts. The greater relative reduction of T8+ T cells may indicate that T8+ T cells are more sensitive to cytoreductive therapy than T4+ T cells, and/or that T8+ T cells have shorter survival times. The contribution of residual (mainly T4+) T cells to the T-cell repopulation was significant in the patients on standard-dosage chemotherapy, less important in those on high-dosage chemotherapy, and minor in those receiving supralethal cytoreductive therapy and ABMR. The repopulation rates of T8+ T cells following ABMR exceeded those observed after chemotherapy without ABMR. The T3- (T3 negative) T-cell subset, which comprises only 5%-10% of peripheral T cells in normal individuals, decreased rapidly to low levels and remained so for the entire six-week observation period in both chemotherapy groups. Following ABMR, however, those T3- T cells rapidly increased again to normal levels. Since the T cells in bone marrow biopsies have a large T3- fraction, that rapid recovery of T3- T cells may reflect the contribution of marrow precursors in the marrow grafts to the improved T-cell regeneration following ABMR.","['Gratama, J W', 'Lipovich-Oosterveer, M A', 'Willemze, R', 'Slats, J', ""D'Amaro, J"", 'Verdonck, L F', 'de Gast, G C', 'Jansen, J']","['Gratama JW', 'Lipovich-Oosterveer MA', 'Willemze R', 'Slats J', ""D'Amaro J"", 'Verdonck LF', 'de Gast GC', 'Jansen J']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy', 'Leukocyte Count/drug effects', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/drug therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*drug effects']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Mar;14(3):173-7.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],,,,,,,,,

We evaluated causes of death and frequency and type of complications after marrow grafting in 24 syngeneic and 39 allogeneic recipients who were 45 to 68 years old at the time of transplant. Most patients were in an advanced stage of hematologic malignancy. Among patients given syngeneic transplants, actuarial disease-free survival at 7 years is 20%. The major causes of death were relapse of leukemia and idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Among allogeneic recipients, 9 (23%) are currently alive, and actuarial disease-free survival at 7 years is 11%. Cytomegalovirus pneumonia and septicemia were the most frequent causes of death. Patients over 50 years of age had the poorest survival rate (1/13), but many of these were transplanted in an advanced stage of their disease. However, among 12 patients transplanted while in remission or at an early stage of their disease, 5 are surviving 65 to 1,160 days after transplantation, with an actuarial survival rate of 22% at 3 years. This is in contrast to those who received their transplant in relapse: 2 out of 20 patients (10%) became long-term survivors, with a probability of survival of 15% at 3 years. The actuarial incidence of grade II through IV acute graft-v-host disease (GVHD) was 30% for allogeneic recipients 45 to 50 years of age. This was not significantly different from the incidence in younger patients. In patients 51 to 62 years of age, the actuarial incidence of acute GVHD was 79%; however, this group included three partially HLA-mismatched transplants.

A flow cytometric immunofluorescence assay was developed to quantitate the expression of the cellular ras oncogenes in relation to the cell cycle in individual leukemic cells. Specific binding of a monoclonal antibody to the 21-kd protein (p21ras) encoded by the Ha-ras, Ki-ras, and N-ras genes was measured by flow cytometry and confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. P21ras was detected in 416B, a murine hematopoietic precursor cell characterized by a high level of Ki-ras expression, and in the human leukemic cell lines P-12 and KG-1. The presence of p21ras in the cell lines was also shown by immunoprecipitation. Cellular DNA content was determined simultaneously to define cell cycle phases. There was an equal distribution of p21ras in G1, S, and G2M, with considerable heterogeneity of ras gene expression in the G1 compartment. The assay allows oncogene expression to be studied in populations of intact single cells in which cell heterogeneity is maintained, requires very few cells per sample, and directly correlates oncogene expression to cell kinetic data.","['Andreeff, M', 'Slater, D E', 'Bressler, J', 'Furth, M E']","['Andreeff M', 'Slater DE', 'Bressler J', 'Furth ME']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Guanine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics/pathology', '*Oncogenes', 'Rats']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Mar;67(3):676-81.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Guanine Nucleotides)']",['S0006-4971(20)81374-3 [pii]'],,"['CA-20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29564/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Transformed recipient cells with highly amplified expression of either of two donor membrane polypeptides, gp150 or p67, were isolated with a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), using monoclonal antibodies specific for human myeloid cells. Immunoprecipitation of enzymatically radioiodinated polypeptides from the surface of transformed NIH-3T3 cells confirmed that expression of these proteins was amplified tenfold to 20-fold in comparison to their expression on human myeloid cell lines. The cellular DNA of cloned secondary and tertiary transformants expressing high levels of gp150 and p67 contained amplified sets of DNA restriction fragments that hybridized with human repetitive DNA sequences. Cytogenetic analysis of subclones overexpressing gp150 revealed extrachromosomal double minutes (DMs), whose presence correlated with the unstable expression of the membrane polypeptide. Human sequences in gp150-positive clones did not localize to chromosomes, consistent with their association with extrachromosomal DMs. By contrast, p67-positive subclones stably expressed the antigen, and in situ hybridization to metaphase spreads demonstrated that amplified human DNA sequences were integrated into a specific marker chromosome. Cytogenetic analysis of the parental NIH-3T3 subclone used in these studies disclosed DMs in a low percentage of metaphases, suggesting that the recipient cells have a propensity for amplifying donor DNA.","['Look, A T', 'Peiper, S C', 'Douglass, E C', 'Trent, J M', 'Sherr, C J']","['Look AT', 'Peiper SC', 'Douglass EC', 'Trent JM', 'Sherr CJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*genetics/immunology', 'Base Sequence', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'DNA/analysis', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Amplification', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Glycoproteins/*genetics/immunology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Metaphase', 'Mice', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Oncogenes', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Mar;67(3):637-45.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",['S0006-4971(20)81368-8 [pii]'],,"['CA 20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The primary plating efficiency of blast progenitors freshly obtained from common B-lineage ALL patients varied between 0.09 and 2.63%. Morphological, cytochemical, and immunological analyses of cells from day 7 colonies provided the evidence that they are B-lineage lymphoblasts. Immunological marker analyses of cultured blasts using BA-2 (anti-CD9), BA-3 (anti-CD10), BA-1 (anti-CD24), and B43 mAb have allowed us to define two distinct immunological groups. The first group had BA-2+, BA-3+, BA-1+, B43+ marker profiles, consistent with the phenotype of uncultured bone marrow blasts. The second group differed in that the cells in the blast colonies were BA-3 (anti-CD10)-negative, although many of the cells in the bulk population were BA-3+ before culture. Blasts from both groups were able to proliferate and form secondary colonies when recultured. A pan-B immunotoxin was synthesized by linking B43, a human B cell-specific mAb, to pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP). This study showed that B43-PAP can effectively eradicate leukemic progenitor cells freshly obtained from patients with common B-lineage ALL. B43-PAP eliminated greater than 99.96% of blast progenitors under conditions in which only minimal inhibition of normal bone marrow progenitor cells (CFU-GM, CFU-E, CFU-MK, CFU-GEMM) was observed. Our results establish that the surface determinant recognized by B43 is expressed on B-lineage progenitor cells in ALL, and that these cells are sensitive to PAP at the ribosomal level. To our knowledge, B43-PAP is the first IT to prove effective against common B-lineage ALL cells.","['Uckun, F M', 'Gajl-Peczalska, K J', 'Kersey, J H', 'Houston, L L', 'Vallera, D A']","['Uckun FM', 'Gajl-Peczalska KJ', 'Kersey JH', 'Houston LL', 'Vallera DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow/drug effects/pathology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay/*methods', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*therapy', '*Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', '*N-Glycosyl Hydrolases', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Plant Proteins/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Exp Med. 1986 Feb 1;163(2):347-68. doi: 10.1084/jem.163.2.347.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', 'EC 3.2.2.- (N-Glycosyl Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.2.2.22 (pokeweed antiviral protein)']",['10.1084/jem.163.2.347 [doi]'],,"['CA-25097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC2188031,,,,,

During the early culture period both normal and leukemic cells expressed the c-myc oncogene. In normal cells maximal expression occurred after 24 h of culture and did not occur in the absence of CSA. At this time, progranulocytes predominated in the cultured cells. Although cellular proliferation occurred for 96 h in vitro, c-myc expression ceased after 24-36 h. Terminally differentiated cells predominated in these cultures by 120 h. In contrast, although leukemic cells also expressed c-myc in vitro, transcription persisted throughout the culture period and, in the case of HL-60 cells, occurred in the absence of exogenous CSA. We also noted that normal cells with only one diploid gene copy exhibited, after 24 h of culture, only twofold fewer transcripts than did HL-60 cells in which there were 16 myc copies. Furthermore, c-myc mRNA degradation rates were similar in normal cells and in HL-60 cells. We conclude that c-myc transcription is a normal event in granulopoiesis linked to proliferative activity as well as to primitive developmental stage. Furthermore, the most consistent abnormality in leukemic cells in vitro is their failure to suppress transcriptional activity of this gene. We suggest that c-myc transcription in HL-60 cells may be appropriate for cells arrested at that developmental stage and that the amplified genes in HL-60 cells are quiescent relative to c-myc in normal cells at the same differentiation stage. The techniques described herein may be of value in identifying mechanisms by which normal hematopoietic cells suppress c-myc expression and aberrancies of these mechanisms in leukemic cells.","['Gowda, S D', 'Koler, R D', 'Bagby, G C Jr']","['Gowda SD', 'Koler RD', 'Bagby GC Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Pregnancy Proteins/pharmacology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogene Proteins/genetics/*metabolism']",1986/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1986 Jan;77(1):271-8. doi: 10.1172/JCI112287.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Pregnancy Proteins)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Proteins)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)']",['10.1172/JCI112287 [doi]'],,['CA36306/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC423336,,,,,

Many drugs have greater toxicity for cycling cells and act selectively at one or more phases of the cycle and may cause partial synchrony of surviving cells. However, these observations have been generally carried out on in vitro systems only and present a variety of complexities and pitfalls. Furthermore, human tumours are often characterized by a relatively low fraction of proliferating cells and present a large cellular heterogeneity as far as their cytogenetic, cytokinetic, and clonogenic features and their responses to drugs are concerned. Therefore, resistance to chemotherapy is due to various factors characterizing, in some instances, each individual tumour. In spite of the advent of technological advances such as flow cytometry, it is still difficult to design kinetic-orientated therapies especially for the treatment of solid tumours. Consequently, it is also difficult to design protocols based on cell cycle effective drugs. The possibility remains, at least for the moment, to stratify tumours according to their cellular heterogeneity. Different protocols could then be assigned to classes of tumours.

The uniqueness of the LPDV polypeptide pattern is consistent with the lack of genetic relatedness of LPDV genome to other retroviruses, establishing LPDV as a representative of a distinct group of retroviridae.","['Gazit, A', 'Basri, R', 'Ianconescu, M', 'Perk, K', 'Zimber, A', 'Yaniv, A']","['Gazit A', 'Basri R', 'Ianconescu M', 'Perk K', 'Zimber A', 'Yaniv A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Endopeptidases/metabolism', 'Retroviridae/*analysis', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*analysis', '*Serine Endopeptidases', 'Turkeys/*microbiology', 'Virion/analysis']",1986/02/15 00:00,1986/02/15 00:01,['1986/02/15 00:00'],"['1986/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1986 Feb 15;37(2):241-5. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910370212.,"['0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', 'EC 3.4.- (Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Serine Endopeptidases)', 'EC 3.4.21.19 (glutamyl endopeptidase)']",['10.1002/ijc.2910370212 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

At 1 1/2-9 years after treatment, 13 patients (46%) survive in the transplant group and 45 patients (75%) survive in the second group. All except one in the second group have self-sustaining hematopoiesis without need for transfusions. There is one major difference between the two therapies. Marrow transplantation restores bone marrow function completely and no late hematologic complications have been seen in this group. The majority of patients treated with antilymphocyte globulin in contrast have residual abnormalities of hematopoiesis: macrocytosis, mild granulocytopenia, and mild thrombopenia. Relapse (11 of 72 patients) and clonal hematologic disorders, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (four patients) and leukemia (one patient) can occur years after complete bone marrow reconstitution with antilymphocyte globulin. These late disorders are of concern. Despite this, we conclude that antilymphocyte globulin treatment is an effective therapy with low early mortality and morbidity and a high chance for a long, sustained remission.

Highly specific cytotoxic conjugates formed by coupling ricin A chain to monoclonal antibodies might prove useful for the selective elimination of malignant cells. Consequently, ricin A chain conjugates have been prepared with several different murine monoclonal antibodies and tested for their ability to eliminate clonogenic Burkitt's lymphoma cells from an excess of human bone marrow. The most active reagents included an antibody:A chain conjugate which bound to the nonpolymorphic chain of the la molecule and another which reacted with the mu heavy chain of cell surface immunoglobulin. Conjugates formed with anti-common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen, anti-Mr 26,000 glycoprotein, and anti-B1 were much less active on these Burkitt's cells, contrasting with results of complement-dependent tumor cell lysis. Tumor cell kill was partially inhibited by the addition of greater than 2 X 10(6) human bone marrow cells/ml but could be potentiated by increasing the concentration of conjugate or by the addition of 10 mM ammonium chloride. In the presence of ammonium chloride, at least 4 logs of clonogenic tumor cells could be eliminated within 24 h from a 20-fold excess of bone marrow using 10(-7) M ricin A chain linked to one or two different antibodies. Similar treatment of normal human bone marrow temporarily inhibited granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (cell) formation but did not compromise establishment of continuous bone marrow cultures. The degree of selective elimination of tumor cells with A chain antibody conjugates was comparable to that achieved with 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide or with multiple monoclonal antibodies and complement.","['Bregni, M', 'De Fabritiis, P', 'Raso, V', 'Greenberger, J', 'Lipton, J', 'Nadler, L', 'Rothstein, L', 'Ritz, J', 'Bast, R C Jr']","['Bregni M', 'De Fabritiis P', 'Raso V', 'Greenberger J', 'Lipton J', 'Nadler L', 'Rothstein L', 'Ritz J', 'Bast RC Jr']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Ammonium Chloride/pharmacology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*immunology/therapy', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Complement System Proteins/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Ricin/*administration & dosage']",1986/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Mar;46(3):1208-13.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '01Q9PC255D (Ammonium Chloride)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,"['CA 28740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 29039/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Our investigations have attempted to determine the biochemical basis of the selective inhibition of tumor cells and in this present study we examined the effects of these agents on thymidylate synthase. The dihydroxybenzene derivatives were found to inhibit thymidylate synthase in situ at concentrations ranging between 100 and 800 microM. The quinols did not inhibit partially purified thymidylate synthase, although the oxidized quinones did cause inhibition at concentrations between 10 and 100 microM. Time course experiments suggested that the inhibition of thymidylate synthase in situ by the dihydroxybenzene derivatives occurs after the inhibition of thymidine incorporation, indicating that an earlier event was critical to the inhibition of DNA synthesis. With the use of a novel in situ assay which measured the release of [3H]water from [5-3H] uridine in intact cells, we were able to show that one of the earliest biochemical events is the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase and that the inhibition of thymidylate synthase, which is delayed by approximately 30 min, was indirectly mediated possibly through effects on ribonucleotide reductase.","['Fitzgerald, G B', 'Wick, M M']","['Fitzgerald GB', 'Wick MM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Dopamine/analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Fluorouracil/pharmacology', 'Hydroxyurea/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Levodopa/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Ribonucleotide Reductases/*antagonists & inhibitors', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors']",1986/01/15 00:00,1986/01/15 00:01,['1986/01/15 00:00'],"['1986/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1986 Jan 15;35(2):271-5. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(86)90525-3.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '37491-68-2 (3,4-dihydroxybenzylamine)', '46627O600J (Levodopa)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (Ribonucleotide Reductases)', 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)', 'VTD58H1Z2X (Dopamine)', 'X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)']","['0006-2952(86)90525-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(86)90525-3 [doi]']",,"['AM31899/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA24988/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

In addition, the 40 patients who had not previously undergone splenectomy received radiotherapy to the spleen. To prevent graft versus host disease, cyclosporine was given either alone or in conjunction with donor marrow depleted of T cells. Of the 52 patients treated in the chronic phase, 38 are alive after a median follow-up of 25 months (range, 7 to 50); the actuarial survival at two years was 72 percent, and the actuarial risk of relapse was 7 percent.

Continuous DAVTH and DAVTH/CMFP were equivalent therapies with respect to response rates, time to treatment failure (TTF), and survival. Pretreatment CEA levels were elevated (greater than 5 ng/mL) in 42/97 patients and less than 5 ng/mL in the remaining patients. Patients with elevated pretreatment CEA levels were more likely to be estrogen receptor (ER) positive (P = .006), to have prolonged disease-free intervals (P = .017), to have hepatic (P = .004) and/or osseous (P = .01) metastases, and to have multiple sites of metastatic disease (P = .004). Pretreatment CEA levels did not significantly predict for overall response rates, TTF, or survival; nonetheless, those patients with low pretreatment CEA levels had more complete responses (CRs) (16/55 v 4/42; P = .02). Serial CEA levels during therapy revealed a number of interesting patterns. During the first 4 months of treatment, serial CEA levels in responding patients either (1) progressively declined (15/29 women with elevated pretreatment CEA levels), or (2) initially rose significantly (mean, 243% of pretreatment value) and then declined (14/29 women with elevated pretreatment CEA levels). Peak CEA levels in the latter patients were seen 27 to 135 days following initiation of cytotoxic therapy. In some patients the initial increase in the CEA level was incorrectly interpreted as evidence of impending disease progression. CEA levels frequently increased around the time of clinical disease progression. However, rising CEA levels rarely provided a clinically meaningful lead time before the appearance of other clinical evidence of disease progression. These data suggest that routine pretreatment and monthly serial CEA levels in metastatic breast cancer patients have minimal use in clinical practice. Two further noteworthy findings were observed in this prospective study.

The pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the radiation-induced late effects depend mainly on the damage produced to each of these elements. Parenchymal cell damage ends with a failure of the stem cell pool to supply an adequate number of highly differentiated functional blood cells and is clinically manifested as aplastic anaemia or leukaemia. The effects of radiation on the haemopoietic stem cell can be measured by means of spleen colony forming units (CFU-S) in rodents. The self-maintaining capacity of the CFU-S was found to be lower than normal 16 weeks after a dose of 0.64 Gy. In larger animals it is only possible to measure the activity of some of the progenitor cells, estimating the number of granulocyte-macrophage colonies in culture (CFU-GM) as an indicator of stem cell changes. Their number in the blood is about 50 per cent of normal even 160 days after about 0.78 Gy. The stromal cells are also radiosensitive if measured with respect to their capacity to support long-term cell replication in vitro. Marrow fibrosis develops after single, repeated and chronic radiation exposure, and a dose of 40 Gy impairs the capacity of the marrow to support haemopoiesis.","['Fliedner, T M', 'Nothdurft, W', 'Calvo, W']","['Fliedner TM', 'Nothdurft W', 'Calvo W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med,"International journal of radiation biology and related studies in physics, chemistry, and medicine",0374725,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/etiology', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*radiation effects', 'Dogs', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced', 'Mice', 'Rabbits', 'Radiation Injuries/pathology', 'Radiation Injuries, Experimental/pathology', 'Rats', 'Time Factors', 'Whole-Body Irradiation']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Biol Relat Stud Phys Chem Med. 1986 Jan;49(1):35-46. doi: 10.1080/09553008514552211.,,['10.1080/09553008514552211 [doi]'],42,,,,,,,

The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the probability of CNS relapse posttransplant were 13% for patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and 2% for patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia (ANL). Previous CNS disease was significantly correlated with an increased risk of CNS relapse in patients transplanted for ALL but not for ANL. In contrast, bone marrow involvement with leukemia at the time of transplant was associated with an increased risk of CNS relapse in patients with ANL but not in patients with ALL. Seventy-one patients with ALL did not receive posttransplant intrathecal methotrexate (IT-MTX) and 127 did. The probability of CNS relapse in these two groups was 38% and 7%, respectively (P less than .02). This protective benefit from IT-MTX was present in patients both with and without a history of CNS involvement or marrow involvement at the time of transplant. In patients with ANL, 116 patients did not receive posttransplant IT-MTX and 101 patients did, but no protection from CNS relapse was observed from IT-MTX irrespective of a patient's previous CNS history or marrow status at the time of transplant. Leukoencephalopathy was seen exclusively in patients who had received radiation and/or intrathecal chemotherapy to the CNS before preparation for marrow transplantation and posttransplant IT-MTX. In such patients the risk of leukoencephalopathy was 7%. From our data, it appears that posttransplant IT-MTX is a significant benefit for ALL patients in preventing CNS relapse after marrow transplantation. A similar benefit from posttransplant IT-MTX for ANL patients cannot be established from this study.

Such antibodies are operationally defined as those antibodies which bind to a particular immunoglobulin but not to other immunoglobulins of the same class in a radioimmunoassay or ELISA. The monoclonal antibodies 32D1 and 31D1 were initially defined as anti-idiotypic as they recognized an immunoglobulin preparation from the murine B cell lymphoma BCL1, but not other immunoglobulins of the same isotype as assessed by a radioimmunoassay. A potential artifact in defining anti-idiotypic antibodies in this way is the possibility of copurification of antigen and antibody, resulting in the tentative identification of anti-antigen as anti-idiotype. Previous studies have demonstrated that BCL1-IgM is involved in binding of murine leukemia virus (MuLV), and BCL1 immunoglobulin and MuLV-gp70 apparently co-purified as an immune complex. Disruption of the immune complexes with SDS and sucrose gradient purification of the immunoglobulin was adequate to prepare BCL1 immunoglobulin free of gp70 as assessed by radioimmunoassay with the monoclonal anti-gp70 RA3-4A3. This preparation of immunoglobulin was used to show that 31D1 does not bind to BCL1 immunoglobulin, but to the contaminating gp70 in the BCL1 immunoglobulin preparation. However, MAb 32D1 was definitively proven to be anti-idiotypic as it recognized SDS sucrose density gradient purified IgM and immunoisolated heavy chain and light chain from BCL1 immunoglobulin. Several other lymphomas were recognized by mAb 32D1, including the T cell lymphoma UNC1 and the B cell lymphoma Balenlm17. To determine whether mAb 32D1 recognized immunospecific receptors on these lymphoma cell lines immunoprecipitation studies were performed. Immunoisolation and molecular analysis revealed that mAb 32D1 did not recognize the antigen receptor on these two cells, but instead recognized a cell-specific gp70. This observation demonstrates that monoclonal antibodies to known antigens (in this case an anti-idiotype) can crossreact with apparently unrelated molecules. The potential significance of this cross reaction to the antigens recognized by B cell lymphomas is discussed.","['Tamura, G S', 'McGrath, M S', 'Weissman, I L']","['Tamura GS', 'McGrath MS', 'Weissman IL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Mol Cell Immunol,The Journal of molecular and cellular immunology : JMCI,8405005,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', '*Antibodies, Neoplasm', 'Antigens, Neoplasm', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Mol Cell Immunol. 1987;3(4):243-53.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)']",,,['CA 32031/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['Department of Pathology, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305.']",,

Northern blot analysis showed that expression of the mRNAs of the c-myb, c-myc, and IL-2R genes were markedly increased by addition of IL-2 into the cultures, indicating that IL-2R transduced signals for gene expression in these cells as in normal T cells. Studies on distinct HTLV-1-infected T cell clones that differed in numbers of high-affinity IL-2R, showed that the extents of increase in mRNA expression by IL-2 were correlated with the number of high-affinity IL-2R.

Here we extended these findings and compared the species distribution patterns in sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine of the receptor-bound lipids to those of the plasma membrane lipids. FC epsilon-receptor-bound sphingomyelin but not phosphatidylcholine was enriched in long-chain fatty acids. We then examined other membrane proteins with respect to sphingomyelin enrichment. RBL-2H3 cell surface proteins, immobilized on concanavalin A-Sepharose and washed under solubilizing conditions, also showed a two- to six-fold enrichment in the associated sphingomyelin. Similar observations were also derived from other cell types, such as the mouse fibroblast cell line A-9 and the pig kidney epithelial cell line PK-1. Since this has been observed in all the three cell sources, it was suggested that sphingomyelin enrichment in FC epsilon-receptor preparations, although reproducible, was not specific for this protein. That this phenomenon was not specific for a particular protein might also be concluded from experiments that have shown nonhomogenous distribution of sphingomyelin in protein-free lipid-detergent mixtures. These results are compatible with a model whereby the interaction between sphingomyelin and soluble membrane proteins results from preference to nonmicellar phases or to structures with extended hydrophobic domains, probably due to the imperfect fitness of the detergent micelles to properly accomodate these lipids. This feature makes long-chain sphingomyelin a plausible candidate for the lipid responsible for the stabilizing effect that crude lipid preparations exert on the structural and functional properties of some membrane protein, e.g., FC epsilon R.","['Barak, S', 'Fischer, G', 'Rivnay, B']","['Barak S', 'Fischer G', 'Rivnay B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Membr Biochem,Membrane biochemistry,7804153,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Glycoproteins/analysis', 'Membrane Lipids/metabolism', 'Membrane Proteins/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Phosphatidylcholines/metabolism', 'Phospholipids/analysis', 'Receptors, Fc/metabolism', 'Solubility', 'Sphingomyelins/*metabolism', 'Time Factors']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Membr Biochem. 1987-1988;7(3):153-73. doi: 10.3109/09687688709039992.,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Membrane Lipids)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Phosphatidylcholines)', '0 (Phospholipids)', '0 (Receptors, Fc)', '0 (Sphingomyelins)']",['10.3109/09687688709039992 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Membrane Research, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",,

In addition to control cultures, samples were incubated with recombinant alpha-interferon. Cytogenetic studies performed on the nonadherent hemopoietic cells demonstrated suppression of the Philadelphia chromosome-positive clones, and appearance of cells with normal diploid karyotype in two of the five patients studied; cells from the remaining three patients showed persistent Philadelphia chromosome-positive cells in 100% of the metaphases. Exposure to alpha-interferon did not enhance the suppression of the Philadelphia chromosome-positive clones. A good correlation was noted between in vitro results and in vivo cytogenetic response: the two patients whose in vitro studies showed diploid clones achieved complete hematologic remission and suppression of Philadelphia chromosome-positive metaphases with therapy. Our data suggest that long-term culture favors the growth of normal clones over Philadelphia chromosome-positive clones in the nonadherent hemopoietic cells of some patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia. The value of the procedure as an in vitro predictive test for residual normal stem cells and response to therapy and for autologous marrow in vitro purging needs further exploration.","[""O'Brien, S"", 'Kantarjian, H M', 'Talpaz, M', 'Cork, A', 'Trujillo, J', 'Beran, M']","[""O'Brien S"", 'Kantarjian HM', 'Talpaz M', 'Cork A', 'Trujillo J', 'Beran M']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Hematol Pathol,Hematologic pathology,8707764,IM,"['Adult', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cell Adhesion', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*pathology/therapy', 'Male', 'Metaphase/drug effects', 'Middle Aged', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Pathol. 1987;1(3):167-72.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,"['Department of Hematology, University of Texas, Houston 77030.']",,

This difference in the gp70 molecules encoded by WB91 and GV may account for the ability of the WB91 virus to induce leukemia in adult mice, possibly by affecting the immunogenicity of the virus.","['Jones, S M', 'Spear, B T', 'Klyczek, K K', 'Pozsgay, J M', 'Gaudet, E', 'Yao, D', 'Blank, K J']","['Jones SM', 'Spear BT', 'Klyczek KK', 'Pozsgay JM', 'Gaudet E', 'Yao D', 'Blank KJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Microb Pathog,Microbial pathogenesis,8606191,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/genetics/*immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigenic Variation', 'Antigens, Viral/genetics', 'Genetic Variation', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Mice', 'Retroviridae Proteins/genetics/*immunology', '*Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/immunology', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/genetics/*immunology']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Microb Pathog. 1986 Jun;1(3):275-82. doi: 10.1016/0882-4010(86)90052-5.,"['0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins, Oncogenic)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)']","['0882-4010(86)90052-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0882-4010(86)90052-5 [doi]']",,"['CA09140/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA29355/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['Department of Pathology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia 19104.']",,

CCNU in liposomes of different size and composition showed in lower doses a diminished therapeutic effectiveness in the P388 or L 1210 leukaemia and the B 16 melanoma, while in higher doses toxic deaths occurring with the free drug could be prevented totally by using liposomes. Liposomal encapsulation also influenced body weight change and leukocyte counts, causing them to be less drastically reduced than with use of the free drug. The entrapment of Cytostasan, an N-lost derivative, had the same effect on the increase of lifespan of tumour-bearing animals (mammary carcinoma 1142 A) as equal doses of the free drug and caused only a slight improvement of toxicity.

The purpose of the present paper was to determine a relation between cytotoxic activity of the spleen lymphocytes in ADCC assay and the MC-induced sarcoma growth in adult and aging rats. In ADCC assay the mouse leukemia L1210 labeled with Cr and sensitized with rabbit anti-L1210 serum was used as target cells. In aging rats with MC-Sa tumors the lymphocyte activity in ADCC was increased or remained unchanged in the comparison with normal animals. On the contrary, in adult rats with MC-Sa tumors ADCC activity was decreased. In comparative studies between the groups of adult and aging rats a reverse relationship between the tumor growth and the lymphocyte activity in ADCC was found. In aging rats the level of ADCC was higher than in adults, but the tumor growth was slower. We suggest that ADCC phenomenon may be involved in an antitumor response, especially effective in aging rats.","['Ziolkowska, M', 'Nowak, J J', 'Ryzewska, A']","['Ziolkowska M', 'Nowak JJ', 'Ryzewska A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Switzerland,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz),Archivum immunologiae et therapiae experimentalis,0114365,IM,"['Aging/*immunology', 'Animals', '*Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Methylcholanthrene', 'Monitoring, Immunologic', 'Rabbits', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/chemically induced/*immunology/pathology', 'Spleen/immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 1987;35(6):853-62.,['56-49-5 (Methylcholanthrene)'],,,,,,,"['Department of Pathophysiology, Institute of Rheumatology, Warsaw.']",,

Long-term (stable) gene expression in both Friend and K562 cells was measured using the recombinant plasmid Homer 6, which carries the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (aph) gene as a selectable marker under the transcriptional control of the Moloney murine sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter/enhancer sequences. Parameters such as the DNA concentration, the initial field strength, the concentration of recipient cells, and the preselection expression time were examined to obtain optimal transfection frequencies. Short-term (transient) expression was also examined using the plasmid pLW4, which carries the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene under the transcriptional control of herpes simplex virus immediate early 5 gene promoter/enhancer sequences. Conditions that gave maximal stable transformation frequency were similar to those giving highest transient gene expression in the mouse and human erythroleukemic cell lines. Under optimal conditions, electroporation gave about ten times higher transfection frequencies and levels of transient expression for both types of cells when compared with the calcium phosphate technique. Because both Friend and K562 cells can be induced to differentiate in vitro, measurement of transient or stable expression levels for genes introduced into these cells may prove to be useful in the study of developmental regulation of genes from the erythroid pathway.","['Spandidos, D A']",['Spandidos DA'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Gene Anal Tech,Gene analysis techniques,8408118,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', 'Electrophoresis/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', '*Transfection']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Gene Anal Tech. 1987 May-Jun;4(3):50-6. doi: 10.1016/0735-0651(87)90018-5.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']","['0735-0651(87)90018-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0735-0651(87)90018-5 [doi]']",,,,,,"['Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, Glasgow, Scotland.']",,

The most recent findings regarding cancer mortality and incidence in this cohort can be briefly summarized as follows: 1) An increase in leukemia mortality among A-bomb survivors peaked 5-6 years after the bombing and has decreased with time thereafter. In addition to leukemia, the incidence of cancer of the lung, breast, esophagus, stomach, colon, thyroid, ovary, urinary tract, and multiple myeloma increases with dose. At present, there is no indication of an increase in cancer of the rectum or uterus among A-bomb survivors. In general, radiation-induced solid cancers begin to appear after the age at which they are normally prone to develop, and have continued to increase with time in proportion to the natural increase in mortality of the control group. 2) There are factors which modify the effects of radiation, such as age at the time of bombing (ATB) and sex. Sensitivity to radiation, in terms of cancer induction, is higher for persons who were young ATB in general, than for those who were older ATB. 3) There was no increase in childhood cancer among those exposed while in utero, but there is a recent indication of an increase in cancer incidence among these persons as they age. 4) There seems to be no interaction in a multiplicative way between radiation and smoking and lung cancer induction.","['Kato, H']",['Kato H'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Princess Takamatsu Symp,Princess Takamatsu symposia,9301172,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Male', 'Maternal-Fetal Exchange', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology/mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Pregnancy', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Princess Takamatsu Symp. 1987;18:117-24.,,,,,,,,"['Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",,

There were 33 patients with simultaneous marrow and peripheral basophilia, which was only significantly associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (24 cases). Isolated peripheral basophilia was rarely seen (30 patients, 1.4% incidence) and it did not reflect any significant pathologic association. Marrow basophilia was significantly present in chronic myeloproliferative disorders, idiopathic myelodysplasia, certain erythrocyte disorders, such as iron deficiency anemia, and aplastic anemia. The incidence of marrow basophilia in patients with lymphoma, acute leukemia, or solid carcinoma was not significantly different from what it would be as a chance occurrence.

Changes in cytosolic calcium have been reported to regulate cellular processes. We used the fluorescent dye Quin 2 to examine the effects of vitamin D metabolites on cytosolic calcium levels in HL-60 and U-937 cells. 1,25-(OH)2D3 (20 nM) increases cytosolic calcium by 24% over a 5-min period in HL-60 but not in U-937 cells. 1,25-(OH)2D3 (0.2 nM and 4 nM) has no effect on cytosolic calcium levels in either cell type. 24,25-(OH)2D3 (20 nM) has no effect on cytosolic calcium in HL-60 cells. Nifedipine (1 mM) has no effect on cytosolic calcium levels over 30 min and likewise does not block the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced increase in cytosolic calcium in HL-60 cells. However, chelation of extracellular calcium with EGTA (10 mM) blocks the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced increment in cytosolic calcium, but does not block the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced maturational changes in HL-60 cells. The data suggest that 1,25-(OH)2D3 but not 24,25-(OH)2D3 increases cytosolic calcium in HL-60 cells within 5 min and the increment is due to increased influx of calcium. 1,25-(OH)2D3 modifies membrane permeability to calcium independent of calcium channels sensitive to nifedipine. Finally, 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced maturational changes in HL-60 cells can take place without an increase in cytosolic calcium.","['Desai, S S', 'Appel, M C', 'Baran, D T']","['Desai SS', 'Appel MC', 'Baran DT']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Bone Miner Res,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,8610640,IM,"['Aminoquinolines', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cytosol/*metabolism', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Nifedipine/pharmacology', 'Spectrometry, Fluorescence', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Bone Miner Res. 1986 Dec;1(6):497-501. doi: 10.1002/jbmr.5650010603.,"['0 (Aminoquinolines)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'I9ZF7L6G2L (Nifedipine)', 'O448IDK23O (Quin2)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",['10.1002/jbmr.5650010603 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Orthopedics, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01605.']",,

To date, only three other MoAb (MY-9, L1B2, L4F3) have been reported to react with this antigen. In peripheral blood, WM-53 and WM-54 were found to bind to monocytes, but failed to react with erythrocytes, platelets and lymphoid cells. WM-54 was also faintly reactive with granulocytes. Myeloid 'specificity' was also observed with leukaemias as both WM-53 and WM-54 were reactive with most cases of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but with only a minority of lymphoid leukaemias. Fluorescence activated cell sorting of normal bone marrow cells demonstrated that both MoAb bound to the majority of CFUgm and CFUmix progenitor cells. Immunoprecipitation studies confirmed that these MoAb, in parallel with MY-9, bound to a protein of approximately 70 KD molecular weight, together with a previously undescribed higher molecular weight component of approximately 140 KD on non-reduced gels, possibly representing a disulphide linked dimer of the lower molecular weight protein. Competitive binding assays, using MoAb WM-53 and WM-54 as well as MY-9, L1B2, and L4F3, demonstrated that all five CD-33 MoAb are capable of competing with each other for binding onto HL-60 cells, suggesting that all recognize a single epitopic site on 'gp67'.","['Favaloro, E J', 'Bradstock, K F', 'Kabral, A', 'Grimsley, P', 'Berndt, M C']","['Favaloro EJ', 'Bradstock KF', 'Kabral A', 'Grimsley P', 'Berndt MC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Dis Markers,Disease markers,8604127,IM,"['Animals', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal/biosynthesis/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*immunology', 'Binding Sites, Antibody', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Mice']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Dis Markers. 1987 Dec;5(4):215-25.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)']",,,,,,,"['Department of Haematology, Westmead Hospital, NSW, Australia.']",,

The potential of differences in the relative abundances of these three RNAs in a series of 34 leukaemias was assessed as a means of distinguishing among the myeloid leukaemias. The chronic phase CGL samples were clustered with a high pCG14 RNA, a medium to low c-myc RNA abundance, and a variable pAM6 RNA level. The ANLL samples could be distinguished from the chronic phase CGL by virtue of different relative abundances of these RNAs: low pCG14, medium to high c-myc and a variable pAM6. The acute phase CGL samples showed a variety of relative RNA abundances with some samples sited within the ANLL region.

Some cells become partially committed and give rise to differentiated as well as undifferentiated progeny. Commitment occurs asynchronously; under suboptimal inducing conditions, such as low concentration of inducer or short duration of exposure, both committed and uncommitted cells co-exist. In the present study the growth of these subpopulations was compared. Murine erythroleukaemia cells were exposed to the inducer hexamethylene-bisacetamide for 24 hr, then the inducer was removed by washing and the rate of proliferation of committed and uncommitted cells was measured. Commitment was scored by cloning the cells in inducer-free semi-solid medium and determining the cellular composition of the colonies with respect to haemoglobin content. The results indicated that following removal of the inducer the rate of proliferation was retarded similarly for both committed and uncommitted cells. Partially committed cells disappeared rapidly due to assymetrical cell division into fully committed and uncommitted cells. Both committed and uncommitted cells resumed logarithmic growth at 53 hr, but while uncommitted cells continued this pace until saturation was achieved, committed cells stopped multiplying earlier as a result of terminal differentiation.","['Fibach, E']",['Fibach E'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Cell Tissue Kinet,Cell and tissue kinetics,0174107,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Tissue Kinet. 1987 Nov;20(6):617-24. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1987.tb01371.x.,"['0 (Acetamides)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1987.tb01371.x [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,

Such gene transfer vectors help define regions of the retroviral genome that are required in cis for retroviral replication. Moloney murine leukemia virus has been used extensively in vector construction, and all of the internal protein-encoding regions can be removed and replaced with other genes while still allowing production of virions containing and transmitting the altered retroviral genome. However, inclusion of a portion of the gag region from Moloney murine leukemia virus markedly increases the titer of virus derived from these vectors. We determined that this effect was due to more efficient packaging of the vector RNA into particles and did not depend on protein synthesis from the gag region. We conclude that the retrovirus packaging signal extends into the gag region. We have found that retroviral vectors containing the complete packaging signal allow more efficient gene transfer into a variety of cell types. In addition, these results may help explain why many oncogenic retroviruses have retained gag sequences and often express transforming proteins that are gag-onc hybrids.","['Bender, M A', 'Palmer, T D', 'Gelinas, R E', 'Miller, A D']","['Bender MA', 'Palmer TD', 'Gelinas RE', 'Miller AD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Gene Products, gag', 'Genetic Complementation Test', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics/growth & development', 'Morphogenesis', 'RNA Splicing', 'RNA, Viral/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*physiology', 'Virus Replication']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1987 May;61(5):1639-46. doi: 10.1128/JVI.61.5.1639-1646.1987.,"['0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (RNA, Viral)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",['10.1128/JVI.61.5.1639-1646.1987 [doi]'],,"['CA41455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL37073/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC254146,"['GENBANK/J02255', 'GENBANK/J02256', 'GENBANK/J02257']",,,,

Consequently, it is difficult to distinguish between RNA transcripts of individual class I genes solely on the basis of nucleic acid hybridization analysis using DNA probes over 50 base pairs long. To avoid this problem, I have designed and synthesized a set of oligonucleotide probes capable of detecting transcripts of single class I genes in the MHC of C57BL/10 mice or sets of allelic class I genes at the same genetic locus in MHC disparate mouse strains. Using these probes, it is possible to determine the relative abundance of specific class I gene transcripts in a wide variety of cell and tissue types from inbred or MHC disparate mice. Examples of the use of these probes to detect different class I gene transcripts in cloned murine T cells, T cells transformed with Radiation Leukemia Virus, chemically induced thymoma cell lines and embryonic tissues are described. The results of these experiments are discussed in the light of possible roles of class I antigens in tumorigenesis or in early development.","['Mellor, A L']",['Mellor AL'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Mol Cell Probes,Molecular and cellular probes,8709751,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Clone Cells', '*DNA', '*Genes, MHC Class I', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Probes. 1987 Sep;1(3):207-20. doi: 10.1016/0890-8508(87)90034-x.,['9007-49-2 (DNA)'],"['0890-8508(87)90034-X [pii]', '10.1016/0890-8508(87)90034-x [doi]']",,,,,,"['Transplantation Biology Section, MRC Clinical Research Centre, Middlesex, UK.']",,

Induction of such antileukemia activity was specific for OKT3, since Leu-1 MoAb (directed against another T cell surface molecule, CD5) did not induce a lytic effect. The OKT3-generated antileukemia effect was displayed against various types of leukemia including chronic myelogenous leukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia of various histological subtypes (M1, M2, M5). We furthermore demonstrated that OKT3 MoAb substantially enhanced leukemia killing by interleukin-2 (IL-2)-activated killer cells obtained from peripheral blood of patients with leukemia. Of most importance was the observation that the combined treatment of effector cells with IL-2 and OKT3 MoAb resulted in the highest levels of lysis of both autologous and allogeneic fresh leukemic cells that have been observed in leukemic patients to date. Of importance was to note that OKT3 treatment was effective in induction of cytotoxic activity also in patients whose effector cells were unresponsive to stimulation with IL-2 alone. All of these observations suggest that IL-2-activated and OKT3-MoAb-treated effector cells may represent the most aggressive population of antileukemia-directed killer cells and may play a significant role in the treatment of human leukemia.","['Lotzova, E', 'Savary, C A', 'Herberman, R B', 'McCredie, K B', 'Keating, M J', 'Freireich, E J']","['Lotzova E', 'Savary CA', 'Herberman RB', 'McCredie KB', 'Keating MJ', 'Freireich EJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Switzerland,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul,Natural immunity and cell growth regulation,8407979,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocytes/immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nat Immun Cell Growth Regul. 1987;6(5):219-23.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,['CA39632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['Department of General Surgery, University of Texas System Cancer Center, M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute, Houston.']",,

Here, we extend previous findings with anti-mIg by showing that polyclonal stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus, Cowan strain I (SAC), could also translocate C-kinase from the cytosol of intact, normal human B lymphocytes. This stimulus could not, however, induce redistribution of enzyme in a prolymphocytic leukaemia (PLL) B-cell population. Despite a normal density of mIg receptors on the latter cell type, PPL cells could not be stimulated to proliferate, express interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptors, and differentiate under the influence of SAC, even in the presence of exogenous IL-2. Normal B cells could respond appropriately to the same stimuli. PLL cells had a normal content of C-kinase activity and the enzyme could be translocated under the influence of the specific agonist, 12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The same agent could induce cellular proliferation and differentiation in PLL cells, showing that its terminal C-kinase dependent pathways were intact.

In addition to 125 cases of immunologically characterized non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a range of normal tissues, reactive lymphoid proliferations, Hodgkin's disease and granulocytic sarcomas were also studied. MB1 was found to give positive results in 53.6% of B-cell lymphomas, but the staining was sometimes weak and patchy; there was also cross-reaction with 1.8% of T-cell lymphomas. MB2 reacted with 88.4% of B-cell lymphomas and the reaction was often strong and diffuse, but it showed cross-reaction with 18.2% of T-cell lymphomas. LN1 and LN2 gave positive staining of 44.9 and 46.4% of B-cell lymphomas respectively, and the results appeared to be inferior to that obtained in B5-fixed tissues; staining was sometimes weak and focal, and they also gave false-positive results in a few cases of T-cell lymphoma. This study shows that MB1, LN1 and LN2 are fairly but not entirely specific for B-cells in the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, but are not very sensitive when applied to formalin-fixed tissues. MB2 shows a high sensitivity but only moderate specificity. Therefore, when these antibodies are used to determine the immunophenotype of malignant lymphomas, the B-cell nature can be predicted with great confidence only when two, preferably three or more, of the antibodies give positive results. The potential applications of these antibodies are discussed.","['Ng, C S', 'Chan, J K', 'Lo, S T', 'Lo, D S']","['Ng CS', 'Chan JK', 'Lo ST', 'Lo DS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Histopathology,Histopathology,7704136,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Hodgkin Disease/immunology/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/immunology/pathology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/immunology/pathology', 'Tissue Preservation']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Histopathology. 1987 Dec;11(12):1243-58. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2559.1987.tb01870.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",['10.1111/j.1365-2559.1987.tb01870.x [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Morbid Anatomy, Prince of Wales Hospital.']",,

It is expressed constitutively at a low level in normal T cells and at an elevated level in the LSTRA and Thy19 Moloney murine leukemia virus-induced thymoma cell lines. It is possible that the expression of p56lck at an elevated level contributes to the transformation of these thymoma cells. The structure of the mRNAs encoding p56lck was examined by using an RNase protection assay. Both a chimeric lck mRNA containing the 5' untranslated region of Moloney virus mRNA and a normal lck mRNA were found in Thy19 and LSTRA cells. The chimeric lck transcript was 4- to 10-fold more abundant than the normal transcript. Transcription arising from a viral promoter is therefore responsible for the elevated levels of lck mRNA in these two cell lines. Surprisingly, uninfected murine T cells were also found to contain lck transcripts with differing 5' untranslated regions. One species of mRNA was colinear with the region of the chromosome just upstream of the initiation codon for p56lck. The other appeared to arise through splicing of an unidentified 5' untranslated exon to a sometimes cryptic splice acceptor just upstream of the region encoding p56lck. These data suggest that lck is expressed through the use of at least two different promoters. The promoters could be subject to different forms of regulation.","['Voronova, A F', 'Adler, H T', 'Sefton, B M']","['Voronova AF', 'Adler HT', 'Sefton BM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line, Transformed', 'Codon', 'DNA/genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus', 'Neoplasms, Experimental', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'Plasmids', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Thymoma', 'Thymus Neoplasms', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Dec;7(12):4407-13. doi: 10.1128/mcb.7.12.4407-4413.1987.,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)']",['10.1128/mcb.7.12.4407-4413.1987 [doi]'],,"['CA 14195/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 42350/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC368124,['GENBANK/M18098'],,"['Molecular Biology and Virology Laboratory, Salk Institute, San Diego, California 92138.']",,

RA SF suppressed the responsiveness of a mouse T cell line (HT-2) to IL-2, indicating that it contained an inhibitor of the IL-2 response. When RA SF was fractionated by Sephadex G-200 gel filtration, the inhibitory activity was detected mainly in fractions with a molecular weight of approximately 150,000, but was also found in a 15-19-kd fraction. Removal of IgG from the 150-kd fraction, by means of an anti-IgG affinity column, did not reduce the activity of the fraction, nor was activity found in the eluted IgG. The inhibitory fractions reduced mouse thymocyte proliferative responses to IL-1 in the presence of phytohemagglutinin, and reduced the production of IL-2 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, but did not inhibit IL-1-induced human foreskin fibroblast proliferation; this suggests that the factor was not an IL-1 inhibitor. The inhibitory activity of the RA SF factor was blocked by an antibody against an inhibitor of IL-2 that was purified from a culture of the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. This finding also supports the conclusion that RA SF contains an IL-2 inhibitory factor. The observed inhibition of both IL-2 synthesis and IL-2 response suggests that the target of the inhibition was the T lymphocyte.","['Kashiwado, T', 'Miossec, P', 'Oppenheimer-Marks, N', 'Ziff, M']","['Kashiwado T', 'Miossec P', 'Oppenheimer-Marks N', 'Ziff M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Arthritis Rheum,Arthritis and rheumatism,0370605,IM,"['Animals', 'Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*metabolism', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, Gel', 'Fibroblasts/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin G/analysis', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/biosynthesis', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/metabolism', 'Lymphokines/immunology/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Synovial Fluid/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Arthritis Rheum. 1987 Dec;30(12):1339-47. doi: 10.1002/art.1780301204.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin G)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (interleukin 2 inhibitor)']",['10.1002/art.1780301204 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center, Dallas 75235-9030.']",,

Equilibrium binding of 3H-nitrobenzylmercaptopurine riboside (3H-NBMPR), a specific ligand of the nucleoside transporter, gave 16,510 to 29,400 sites/cell for T-lymphoblasts on presentation or early in relapse compared with 2730 +/- 1570 sites/cell for non-T-lymphoblasts. Accumulation of araCTP from 1 microM araC was four times greater in T-cell than non-T-cell lymphoblasts. One patient was treated with araC (100 mg/m2 daily x 7 days, continuous intravenously) at the time of her first leukemic relapse and complete remission was achieved with this single agent. When this patient relapsed and developed advanced disease the T lymphoblasts showed a 75% reduction in their ability to accumulate araCTP which paralleled a reduction in 3H-NBMPR binding. The second patient achieved complete remission with araC given in low dose (15 mg twice daily by subcutaneous injection) for 21 days at the time of a localised relapse in the mediastinum and pleura. These studies suggest that araC may have a place in the therapy of early stage T-lymphoblastic disease.","['Wiley, J S', 'Woodruff, R K', 'Jamieson, G P', 'Firkin, F C', 'Sawyer, W H']","['Wiley JS', 'Woodruff RK', 'Jamieson GP', 'Firkin FC', 'Sawyer WH']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Australia,Aust N Z J Med,Australian and New Zealand journal of medicine,1264322,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/pharmacokinetics', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cytarabine/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy', 'Male', 'Nucleosides/metabolism', '*T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/metabolism']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Aust N Z J Med. 1987 Aug;17(4):379-86. doi: 10.1111/j.1445-5994.1987.tb00069.x.,"['0 (Nucleosides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)']",['10.1111/j.1445-5994.1987.tb00069.x [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Haematology, Austin Hospital, Heidelberg, Vic.']",,

Poly(A)+ RNA derived from M-IBDET-treated cells directed translation of equal amounts of viral gag precursors, gPr-80gag and Pr-65gag, as did poly(A)+ RNA prepared from untreated cells. The addition of M-IBDET to a cell-free translation system programmed with either total poly(A)+ RNA extracted from infected cells or hybrid-selected viral RNA inhibited the synthesis of viral protein precursors. An examination of the effect of M-IBDET on polysomes engaged in the translation of viral proteins revealed a fourfold accumulation of polysomal virus-specific RNA in drug-treated cells.

Evidences of platelet activation (spontaneous platelet aggregation or circulating platelet aggregates) were observed in 40% of the cases with ET and PV, and all these cases had low intraplatelet levels of both antigens. None of the cases with MF had evidences of platelet activation and 2 out of 14 patients with CML had platelet activation.

All sera from CML patients at diagnosis (before therapy) were tested and found to be significantly (P less than 0.001) positive for the recruitment activity. This observation led us to believe that younger or more pluripotent CFU-GM which were hitherto non-responsive to colony stimulating activity become responsive in the presence of CML sera. We investigated whether more pluripotent stem cells (CFUs) are stimulated to proliferate in the chronic phase of CML than at diagnosis (before therapy). An activity was detected which recruits more spleen colony forming cells (CFUs) from normal Swiss mouse bone marrow into the cell cycle as shown by a significant increase (P less than 0.001) in the thymidine suicide index. However both these activities were either lowered or undetectable in normal (blood groups AB) serum. These results indicate that CML sera may contain enhanced levels of early growth factors which stimulate proliferation of pluripotent stem cells resulting in an increased CFU-GM pool in CML. It is suggested that this activity may be responsible for the myeloid hyperplasia associated with CML in the chronic phase.","['Rao, S G', 'Kothari, V', 'Nadkarni, K', 'Ahuja, H', 'Advani, S']","['Rao SG', 'Kothari V', 'Nadkarni K', 'Ahuja H', 'Advani S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol,Nouvelle revue francaise d'hematologie,7909092,IM,"['*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*blood', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Monocytes']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Nouv Rev Fr Hematol. 1987;29(4):231-6.,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],,,,,,,"['Cancer Research Institute, Tata Memorial Centre, Parel, Bombay, India.']",,

It is considered that the greatly decreased hemopoiesis in these cases is responsible for their clinical picture. We studied leukemia-associated inhibitory activity (LIA), which inhibited human granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, in these patients. Peripheral blood (PB) mononuclear cells (MNC) suppressive to granulocyte-macrophage colony formation were present in 3 of 5 cases of de novo AL and in 3 of 4 cases of AL following MDS. The PB MNC-cultured media from these cases also suppressed colony formation. The elution patterns of LIA of these cases were almost identical in gel chromatography. These results suggest that LIA may be responsible for the suppression of normal granulopoiesis in some patients with AL developed from MDS, and that the profound derangement of normal hemopoietic capability in these cases may be due to multiple complex factors.","['Fukuoka, T', 'Fujita, S']","['Fukuoka T', 'Fujita S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Japan,Jpn J Med,Japanese journal of medicine,0247713,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/analysis/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacology', 'Female', '*Ferritins', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukocytes, Mononuclear/analysis', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*pathology']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Med. 1987 Aug;26(3):314-8. doi: 10.2169/internalmedicine1962.26.314.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (acidic isoferritin)', '9007-73-2 (Ferritins)']",['10.2169/internalmedicine1962.26.314 [doi]'],,,,,,"['First Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Ehime University, Japan.']",,

A highly active, partially purified batch of recombinant human IL5 was prepared and tested for BCGF activity in four laboratories. This batch gave a 50% endpoint of 1:77,450 in the human eosinophil differentiation assay, 1:983 in the mouse eosinophil differentiation assay and 1:42 in the mouse BCL1 assay, thus demonstrating that, like mouse IL5, human IL5 has cross-species activity. By comparison with the assays in the mouse this batch would be expected to have 50% maximal human BCGF activity of about 1:4000. In each assay a known positive factor was used as a positive control, and there was no inhibitory activity in the preparation. However, despite the activity towards the mouse B cell lymphoma, the results showed no detectable activity in a panel of assays used to identify human BCGF and B cell differentiation factors. These assays included (a) proliferation assays with tonsillar or splenic B cells in the presence of the co-stimulators anti-mu or phorbol myristate acetate; (b) a restimulation assay in which tonsillar B cells are first activated with either Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1 or a mixture of phorbol dibutyrate and ionomycin, or splenic B cells are first activated with anti-mu; (c) production of immunoglobulin by B cells in a restimulation assay with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1; (d) production of immunoglobulin by the Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B lymphoblastoid CESS cell line; (e) the ability to stimulate proliferation of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells freshly explanted from three different patients; (f) the ability to stimulate the B lymphoma (L4) cell line and the mature B cell (HBF1) line, and (g) the ability to replace T cells in specific antibody responses. It therefore seems unlikely that recombinant human IL5 is either a growth or a differentiation factor for human B cells, and raises the interesting question of the biological significance of the BCGF activity of this factor in the mouse.","['Clutterbuck, E', 'Shields, J G', 'Gordon, J', 'Smith, S H', 'Boyd, A', 'Callard, R E', 'Campbell, H D', 'Young, I G', 'Sanderson, C J']","['Clutterbuck E', 'Shields JG', 'Gordon J', 'Smith SH', 'Boyd A', 'Callard RE', 'Campbell HD', 'Young IG', 'Sanderson CJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Eur J Immunol,European journal of immunology,1273201,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*cytology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Eosinophils/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukin-5', 'Interleukins/*physiology', 'Lymphokines/physiology', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Immunol. 1987 Dec;17(12):1743-50. doi: 10.1002/eji.1830171210.,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Interleukin-5)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",['10.1002/eji.1830171210 [doi]'],,,,,,"['National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, London, GB.']",,

All factors stimulated optimum megakaryocyte growth at high concentrations. Immature megakaryocytes revealed the same responsiveness to titrated amounts of the various factors tested, with similar slopes to the dose-response curves. The activities of both thrombopoietic stimulating factor and megakaryocyte potentiator were additive when suboptimal doses were used. In contrast, low concentrations of recombinant interleukin 3 and thrombopoietic stimulating factor acted synergistically to stimulate an optimal response.

This immunoconjugate was found to consist of two major species, 5E9-gelonin2 and 5E9-gelonin1, and a minor species of 5E9-gelonin3 and less than 10% of either free antibody or gelonin. 5E9-gelonin was extremely toxic in vitro to human tumor cell lines expressing the 5E9 antigen, including a Burkitt's lymphoma, an adult T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia, an acute myelogenous leukemia, a promyelocytic leukemia, and a cervical carcinoma line. A 24-hour exposure to 10(-9) M immunoconjugate killed 90-99.9% of tumor cells, depending on the cell line. A 5E9-negative murine leukemia was not sensitive to this conjugate. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the disappearance of this immunoconjugate from the murine circulation revealed that it had a biphasic clearance, with an initial rapid phase with a half-life (t1/2) of 3 hours and a later, slower phase with a t1/2 of about 1 day. Analysis of blood samples by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that a substantial degree of disulfide-linker breakdown occurred in vivo and that the 5E9-gelonin2 species was cleared more rapidly than the 5E9-gelonin1. With use of the same clonogenic assays used to measure in vitro toxicity, biologically active immunoconjugate could be detected in murine plasma for up to 24 hours after iv administration, but the concentration of immunoconjugate by this measure was considerably less than that predicted by SDS-gel electrophoresis. The ability to deliver immunoconjugate to tumor cells in vivo was studied with use of the Burkitt's lymphoma Namalwa as a xenograft in nude mice. It was possible to deliver substantial amounts of immunoconjugate to Namalwa cells in xenografted ascites with direct ip inoculation; lower but significant amounts of immunoconjugate could be delivered to this xenograft after systemic iv administration, provided the tumor burden was low. The 5E9-gelonin conjugate, when administered iv at the time of ip tumor inoculation, prolonged survival of nude mice bearing Namalwa or other human tumors as ascites xenografts and delayed or prevented the growth of subcutaneous nodules of Namalwa in an antigen-specific fashion after a single iv injection. Direct intratumoral administration also inhibited the growth of visible subcutaneous nodules of Namalwa.

This clone contained the entire coding sequence of 43 amino acid residues of thymosin-beta 4 and had an initiation codon and two termination codons. The amino acid and nucleotide sequences in the coding region were well conserved between rat and human. Nine of 132 nucleotides were different in the coding sequences (93% homology), but the deduced amino acid sequences were identical. No signal peptide was found in the deduced protein sequence. Human thymosin-beta 4 mRNA, approximately 830 nucleotides in length, was about 30 nucleotides larger than rat thymosin-beta 4 mRNA. Expression of the human thymosin-beta 4 gene in various primary myeloid and lymphoid malignant cells and in a few human hemopoietic cell lines was studied. Northern blot analyses of different neoplastic B lymphocytes revealed that steady state levels of thymosin-beta 4 mRNA varied as a function of differentiation stage. Thymosin-beta 4 mRNA levels were decreased in myeloma cells as are class II human leukocyte antigen, Fc receptor, and complement receptor, suggesting a relationship between thymosin-beta 4 and the immune response. Thymosin-beta 4 mRNA was more highly expressed in mature granulocytes than in immature blastic cells. Treatment of THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, with recombinant human interferon-lambda reduced the levels of thymosin-beta 4 mRNA. Its level decreased after differentiation of THP-1 cells into Ia+ macrophages, but increased after differentiation of HL-60 cells into Ia- macrophages. The pattern of thymosin-beta 4 gene expression suggests that it may play a fundamental role in the host defense mechanism.","['Gondo, H', 'Kudo, J', 'White, J W', 'Barr, C', 'Selvanayagam, P', 'Saunders, G F']","['Gondo H', 'Kudo J', 'White JW', 'Barr C', 'Selvanayagam P', 'Saunders GF']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA/genetics', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Granulocytes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics', 'Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/*metabolism', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Neoplasm Proteins/genetics', 'Organ Specificity', 'Plasma Cells/metabolism', 'Rats/genetics', 'Recombinant Proteins/*biosynthesis/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Thymosin/*analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Dec 1;139(11):3840-8.,"['0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '549LM7U24W (thymosin beta(4))', '61512-21-8 (Thymosin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",,,['CA 34936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,['GENBANK/M17733'],,"['Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Texas System Cancer Center, M.

Either rh interleukin (IL)-3 or rhGM-CSF alone supported the long term growth of all three cell lines, and the two growth factors acted synergistically to stimulate the proliferation of the early T lymphoblastic leukemia (TALL-101) and of the monocytic leukemia (AML-193) cells. However, IL-3 antagonized the proliferation of the biphenotypic B-myelomonocytic leukemia (MV4-11) cells in the presence of GM-CSF when both factors were used at very low concentrations. The rh granulocyte (G)-CSF independently supported the long and short term growth of AML-193 and MV4-11, respectively, and synergized with GM-CSF in inducing proliferation of these cells. By contrast, G-CSF did not stimulate TALL-101 cell growth and antagonized the effect of GM-CSF such that proliferation was arrested. Although neither rh macrophage (M)-CSF nor rhIL-1 alpha independently promoted proliferation of the three leukemia cell lines, these cytokines were able to either up- or down-regulate the GM-CSF-dependent growth of these cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that leukemic cells often require the synergistic action of several cytokines for optimal growth, whereas other combinations of factors may be growth-inhibitory. This raises the possibility that multiple hemopoietic growth factors sustain or control leukemic cell proliferation also in vivo. In addition, the observation the G-CSF, M-CSF, and IL-1 alpha can, in some cases, arrest cell proliferation without inducing differentiation suggests that the programs of proliferative arrest and differentiation in leukemic cells can be dissociated.","['Santoli, D', 'Yang, Y C', 'Clark, S C', 'Kreider, B L', 'Caracciolo, D', 'Rovera, G']","['Santoli D', 'Yang YC', 'Clark SC', 'Kreider BL', 'Caracciolo D', 'Rovera G']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Drug Synergism', 'Granulocytes', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects/pathology']",1987/11/15 00:00,1987/11/15 00:01,['1987/11/15 00:00'],"['1987/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Nov 15;139(10):3348-54.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,"['CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-11036/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['Wistar Institute of Anatomy and Biology, Philadelphia, PA 19104.']",,

Herein, we investigated the signal requirement for IL-2 production, particularly concerning the role of IL-1 in this system. PHA but not IL-1 rendered marked protein kinase C (PKC) activation and IL-2 production induced by PHA plus IL-1 was totally abrogated by a potent PKC inhibitor, H-7. Concomitantly, PHA alone caused marked Ca2+ influx, whereas IL-1 neither induced Ca2+ influx nor augmented PHA-induced Ca2+ influx. As expected, a signal delivered by PHA could be substituted by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin while IL-1 was still indispensable, indicating that at least three signals, i.e., those delivered by IL-1 as well as PKC activation and Ca2+ influx were required for optimal IL-2 production. Kinetic study indicated that while PMA and ionomycin should be added at the initiation of culture, delayed addition of IL-1 up to 4 hr later induced even higher levels of IL-2 production, demonstrating the requirement for IL-1 after PKC activation and Ca2+ influx. In this system, it was revealed that IL-1 was not involved in PKC activation, Ca2+ influx, and breakdown of phosphatidylinositols. Whereas PMA, ionomycin, and IL-1 stimulated high levels of IL-2 production, those combinations of signals did not induce breakdown of phosphatidylinositols. It should be noted that IL-2 production induced by these three signals seemed to bypass hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositols in contrast to PHA plus IL-1 stimulation that was accompanied with a marked breakdown of phosphatidylinositols.","['Mukaida, N', 'Kasahara, T', 'Yagisawa, H', 'Shioiri-Nakano, K', 'Kawai, T']","['Mukaida N', 'Kasahara T', 'Yagisawa H', 'Shioiri-Nakano K', 'Kawai T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Calcium/metabolism', 'Enzyme Activation', 'Ethers/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology/*physiology', 'Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', 'Ionomycin', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/*drug effects', 'Phosphatidylinositols/metabolism', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*immunology']",1987/11/15 00:00,1987/11/15 00:01,['1987/11/15 00:00'],"['1987/11/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Nov 15;139(10):3321-9.,"['0 (Ethers)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Phosphatidylinositols)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,"['Department of Clinical Pathology, Jichi Medical School, Tochigi-ken, Japan.']",,

It is clear from these results that interferons and IL-2 may not necessarily lead to activated NK cytolytic activity, and in the present study approx. 50% of ALL patients failed to respond to lymphokine stimulation.","['Jermy, A', 'Jennings, R', 'Lilleyman, J S', 'Rees, R C']","['Jermy A', 'Jennings R', 'Lilleyman JS', 'Rees RC']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol,European journal of cancer & clinical oncology,8112045,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Female', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Type I/biosynthesis/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Staphylococcal Protein A/pharmacology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Cancer Clin Oncol. 1987 Sep;23(9):1371-7. doi: 10.1016/0277-5379(87)90122-2.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Staphylococcal Protein A)']",['10.1016/0277-5379(87)90122-2 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Virology, University of Sheffield Medical School, U.K.']",,

Both fusions resulted in highly invasive human-mouse T-cell hybrids which metastasized in nude mice. Thus the genes derived from either malignant or nonmalignant but inherently invasive cells enable the T-cell hybridomas to metastasize. By continued in vitro selection for invasive cells employing monolayers of rat embryo fibroblasts followed by subcloning, we were able to isolate invasive hybrids that had lost all human chromosomes except chromosome 7.

Since antibody mediated cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) was one of the likely mechanisms producing these observed tumor regressions, the current study was carried out to investigate the activation of ADCC by interleukin-2 (IL-2). ADCC (against human neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines in vitro) mediated by normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes was increased 100 to 330% after preincubation with IL-2. At limiting concentrations of 3F8 antibody (10 to 100 times less than the amount required by unactivated peripheral blood lymphocytes), activated peripheral blood lymphocytes still mediated efficient ADCC. Activation of ADCC was detected earlier than lymphokine activated killer cell (LAK) activity, required less IL-2 for optimum induction (50 versus 1000 units/ml), and was of equal or greater absolute magnitude (+10 to +200%) against the cell lines tested. ADCC and LAK were independent and additive when measured against the same cell line. The precursor cells for both LAK and activated ADCC bore IgG Fc receptors, but by day 4 of culture with IL-2 much of the LAK activity resided in the Fc negative, Leu11 negative population, and did not mediate ADCC.

All of the L1210 clones (L1210/1, -2, -4, and -7) maintained in vitro for 1 month were severely inhibited in their growth in the culture in which K7L was added and in mice given injections of K7L at the initial stage. This indicated that any L1210 clone tested was not a mixture of K7L-sensitive and K7L-insensitive clones at the time of cloning. By both in vivo and in vitro K7L-mediated tumor suppression assays, K7L-insensitive antigen loss variants were then found to be generated from some (L1210/4, L1210/7) but not other (L1210/1, L1210/2) originally K7L-sensitive L1210 clones during 1 month of maintenance. Ratios of variant cells to total clone cells 1 month after cloning were estimated around 0.1% for L1210/7, 0.01% for L1210/4, and less than 0.001% (undetectable) for L1210/1 and L1210/2. Neither L1210/1 nor L1210/2 generated detectable K7L-insensitive variant cells during long-term (14-month) maintenance. All of the ten subclones of L1210/7 which were obtained 7 or 11 months after the initial cloning of L1210/7 were K7L sensitive, and not all the subclones generated K7L-insensitive variants in 1-2 months of maintenance after recloning. However, all of the subclones of L1210/7 which were maintained for 7 months generated antigen loss variants. All eight clone cells obtained from original L1210 and K7L-insensitive L1210 expressed H-2Kd and H-2Dd antigens detected by H-2Kd or Dd-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte clones or monoclonal antibodies. These results suggest that the antigen loss variants arise in originally K7L-sensitive L1210 clones at different times after cloning, and the probability of generation of the variants is clonally determined. The antigen loss variants seem to be generated by rare (once per 1 to 2 months or less frequent) chance with unproportionally rapid growth rather than by more frequent development for simple accumulation. The ratio of K7L-insensitive variant cells to total L1210/7 cells did not increase progressively during long-term (13 months or more) maintenance in vivo or in vitro and was always below 0.1%. It was suggested that the population size of antigen loss variants was controlled biphasically.","['Nagase, F', 'Rahman, S M', 'Yokochi, T', 'Kawashima, K', 'Isobe, K', 'Yoshida, T', 'Nagura, E', 'Nakashima, I']","['Nagase F', 'Rahman SM', 'Yokochi T', 'Kawashima K', 'Isobe K', 'Yoshida T', 'Nagura E', 'Nakashima I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', '*Antigenic Variation', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Clone Cells', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'H-2 Antigens/analysis', 'Leukemia L1210/genetics/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology/ultrastructure']",1987/12/15 00:00,1987/12/15 00:01,['1987/12/15 00:00'],"['1987/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Dec 15;47(24 Pt 1):6494-9.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (H-2 Antigens)']",,,,,,,"['Department of Medical Technology, Nagoya University College of Medical Technology, Japan.']",,

In addition it does not require T-lymphocyte removal and batch screening. Extension of the culture for antigenic characterization of acute myeloid leukemia clonogenic cells to more patients than in a previous study confirmed the existence of a subgroup (39%) of patients whose acute myeloid leukemia clonogenic cells constantly expressed late myeloid differentiation antigens recognized by the monoclonal antibody S4-7.

Bone marrow CFU-GM from patients with CML were inhibited in a manner similar to that of normal bone marrow. Circulating cells from patients with CML were, however, less sensitive to PGE1 inhibition than CML bone marrow cells and demonstrated a pattern intermediate between normal circulating and normal marrow progenitors. These studies suggest that peripheral blood and bone marrow contain different progenitor cell populations.","['Richman, C M', 'Johnson, G D']","['Richman CM', 'Johnson GD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alprostadil/*pharmacology', 'Blood Cells', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Growth Substances/pharmacology', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology', 'Macrophages/*cytology']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Dec;70(6):1792-6.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', 'F5TD010360 (Alprostadil)']",['S0006-4971(20)84890-3 [pii]'],,['CA 27476/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['Department of Medicine, Rush Medical College, University of Chicago, IL.']",,

Due to its extreme hydrophobicity, purified p15E has not been available in a nondenatured form or in sufficient quantities for detailed studies on the mechanisms of its immunosuppressive effects. Therefore, a plasmid was constructed to direct the synthesis in Escherichia coli of the major hydrophilic region of murine p15E.

The recombinant protein also inhibited, by up to an average of 92% (EC50 = 2.1 microM), the proliferation of the murine T-cell line CTLL-2.

The same effect is obtained when irradiated PF-382 cells are co-cultured with the hemopoietic precursors. In both instances, maximal inhibitory activity is exerted on day 14 CFU-GM and BFU-E obtained from the light density nonadherent fraction of normal human bone marrow and peripheral blood; this finding suggests that the target of the inhibition is represented by the more immature elements within the progenitor cell compartment. Progressive depletion of monocytes, T, B lymphocytes, and NK cells as well as recloning experiments indicate that the inhibitory effect is directly exerted on the target cell and not via an intermediate population of accessory cells. Partial purification by gel filtration and by subsequent high performance liquid chromatography demonstrates that this factor is a protein with a molecular weight of 47 kd. The physicochemical characterization and the specific functional properties suggest that the PF-382 inhibitory factor represents a lymphokine which differs from those so far reported.

The HC2 antigen may therefore have a distinct role in normal B cell differentiation.","['Posnett, D N', 'Folkl, R J', 'Wang, C Y']","['Posnett DN', 'Folkl RJ', 'Wang CY']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4', 'Interleukins/antagonists & inhibitors', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Interleukin-4', 'Receptors, Mitogen/immunology']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Apr;1(4):383-6.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, B-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukins)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-4)', '0 (Receptors, Mitogen)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,['CA35463/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['Department of Medicine, Cornell University Medical College, New York, NY 10021.']",,

This property could not be induced in vitro by alpha-IFN or by interleukin-2 (IL-2).

The antitumor immunity, which was more potent than that induced by attenuated tumor cells alone, was manifested by transplantation resistance to challenge tumor cells, and by cytotoxic activity of spleen cells from the primed mice. The former activity was closely related to the latter, which was found to be mainly due to tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The in vivo immunoaugmentation by OK-432 was susceptible to macrophage toxins such as trypan blue and carragheenins, and was partly dependent on the activity of noncytotoxic Ia-positive peritoneal macrophages. OK-432-mediated enhancement of Ia-positive macrophage functions was confirmed by concanavalin A-blastogenesis and T cell-dependent antibody formation. Allo-reactive cytotoxicity induced in allogeneic or semiallogeneic mice, which had been primed with clonogenic or attenuated tumor cells, was also augmented by concomitant administration of OK-432.

We evaluated the reagent for selectivity in binding and protein synthesis inhibition (PSI) assays. The RIT selectively bound antigen positive leukemia T-cell lines, with minimal binding to antigen negative control lines. The IT inhibited 87% or greater protein synthesis activity at 1 microgram/ml and exhibited an IC50 (the dose inhibiting 50% activity) of 0.18 +/- 0.08 microgram/ml in the presence of lactose. RIT and nonlabeled IT showed comparable degrees of PSI at 1 microgram/ml and 10 micrograms/ml, suggesting that labeling had little overall effect on the activity of the immunoconjugate. However, indirect evidence showed that the galactose binding site of ricin was inhibited 10-fold by its exposure to 90Y. Control RIT were minimally inhibitory. IT labeled with 131Iodine (131I) by an iodine monochloride technique also retained its capability to selectively inhibit protein synthesis. When RIT were tested for potency in a clonogenic assay against human leukemia T-cell lines, they inhibited 3.61 logs of tumor cell growth at 10 micrograms/ml. This did not represent an improvement over the log elimination with radiolabeled antibody alone, which showed 4.19 log elimination of tumor cells.

These results show that the myeloid differentiation-inducing protein MGI-2 binds to cell-surface receptors that are different from the receptors for the 4 myeloid growth-inducing proteins and these cytotoxic proteins.","['Lotem, J', 'Sachs, L']","['Lotem J', 'Sachs L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Clone Cells/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism', 'Lymphotoxin-alpha/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1987/10/15 00:00,1987/10/15 00:01,['1987/10/15 00:00'],"['1987/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1987 Oct 15;40(4):532-9. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910400417.,"['0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Lymphotoxin-alpha)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '0 (monocyte-macrophage differentiation factor)']",['10.1002/ijc.2910400417 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Genetics, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",,

We have measured the effects of surface membrane factors released from unstimulated, circulating B cells of normal donors and patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia on human hematopoiesis in vitro. Leukemic cells augment erythroid burst formation by allogeneic blood cells (p less than 0.05). The stimulatory effect is increased in cultures containing a high B-cell seeding density, and is decreased in those with a high peripheral blood mononuclear cell seeding density. Medium conditioned by B cells (CM) from the circulation or bone marrow stimulates the formation of erythroid bursts, granulocyte-macrophage colonies, and mixed colonies containing granulocytes, erythroblasts, monocytes, and megakaryocytes (GEMM) in serum-free cultures of allogeneic and autologous marrow (p less than 0.05). This effect is localized primarily to surface membrane vesicle-rich pellets of CM. Screening of several hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell types reveals that membrane vesicle-associated activity is released from B cells and mitogen-stimulated, circulating T cells. In contrast, vesicles shed from freshly isolated, resting T cells, continuous T-cell leukemia cell lines, erythrocytes, and endothelial cells do not express the activity (p greater than 0.10). The stimulatory activity is augmented in cultures of marrow cells that are depleted of B4 antigen-positive lymphocytes but not of T-lymphocytes, suggesting that endogenous release of the factor(s) occurs during incubation. Furthermore, membranes partially purified from leukemic B cells also express the activity. Together with our findings that (1) the growth enhancing factor(s) is solubilized by octylglucoside, and that (2) the factor can be immunoprecipitated with BPA-neutralizing, antimembrane IgG, our results suggest that the erythropoietic activity is an integral membrane protein that may be immunologically related to BPA. The relationship of the erythroid burst stimulatory factor to other hematopoietic activities found in CM pellets is unknown.","['Dainiak, N', 'Najman, A', 'Kreczko, S', 'Baillou, C', 'Mier, J', 'Feldman, L', 'Gorin, N C', 'Duhamel, G']","['Dainiak N', 'Najman A', 'Kreczko S', 'Baillou C', 'Mier J', 'Feldman L', 'Gorin NC', 'Duhamel G']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chronic Disease', 'Culture Media', 'Erythrocytes/cytology', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1987 Nov;15(10):1086-96.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)']",,,,,,,"[""Department of Medicine, St. Elizabeth's Hospital of Boston.""]",,

It did not exhibit significant cross-resistance with cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) in either clinical AML samples (from patients who exhibited Ara-C resistance in vivo) or in HL60 in which Ara-C resistance had been induced in vitro. Deoxycytidine kinase levels were not reduced in resistant lines. Erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA), an adenosine deaminase (ADA) inhibitor, with BdA produced a simple additive response without the dramatic synergism reported when it is used with deoxyadenosine. This is consistent with the idea that BdA is a poor substrate for ADA. This group of compounds warrants further investigation to determine their suitability for clinical use, especially in situations where Ara-C resistance is likely to be a problem.","['Pemble, L B', 'Lihou, M G', 'Blakley, R L', 'Jamieson, G P', 'Smith, P J']","['Pemble LB', 'Lihou MG', 'Blakley RL', 'Jamieson GP', 'Smith PJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Cytidine Deaminase/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/metabolism', 'Demecolcine/pharmacology', 'Deoxyadenosines/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/drug therapy/*metabolism/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1987;20(2):155-61. doi: 10.1007/BF00253971.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', ""89178-21-2 (2-bromo-2'-deoxyadenosine)"", 'EC 2.7.1.74 (Deoxycytidine Kinase)', 'EC 3.5.4.5 (Cytidine Deaminase)', 'Z01IVE25KI (Demecolcine)']",['10.1007/BF00253971 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Queensland Institute of Medical Research, Brisbane, Australia.']",,

Two classes of megakaryocyte progenitor cells, the colony forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-MK) and the burst forming unit-megakaryocyte (BFU-MK), have now been detected in normal human bone marrow cells. The BFU-MK by virtue of the greater cellular content of its resultant colonies and the delayed time of appearance of these colonies appears to be a more primitive progenitor cell with a greater proliferative potential than the CFU-MK. A number of hematopoietic growth factors including megakaryocyte colony stimulating factor, (MK-CSF), recombinant erythropoietin (EPO) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) are each capable of increasing cloning efficiency of human megakaryocyte progenitor cells. It is presently unknown whether these factors act directly on the CFU-MK or whether they stimulate marrow accessory cells to elaborate growth factors that influence CFU-MK proliferation. In order to answer this question, the effect of these growth factors on the cloning efficiency of a human megakaryocytic cell line, EST-IU, was examined. Each of these factors was capable of increasing leukemia cell colony formation. One can conclude from these studies that MK-CSF, EPO, and GM-CSF act directly on cells of the megakaryocytic lineage. The physiologic significance of the lineage nonspecific effects of EPO and GM-CSF on megakaryocytopoiesis is yet to be determined. On the basis of these observations, a model of human megakaryocytopoiesis was suggested. Several factors appear able to influence multiple steps in megakaryocytic development, whereas others influence only specific stages or cellular events occurring during megakaryocytopoiesis.","['Hoffman, R', 'Straneva, J', 'Yang, H H', 'Bruno, E', 'Brandt, J']","['Hoffman R', 'Straneva J', 'Yang HH', 'Bruno E', 'Brandt J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood Cells,Blood cells,7513567,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/blood', 'Blood Platelets/*cytology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/pharmacology', 'Erythropoietin/pharmacology', 'Growth Substances/blood/physiology', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/classification/cytology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Megakaryocytes/classification/*cytology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood Cells. 1987;13(1-2):75-86.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",,,,,,,"['Department of Medicine, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis 46223.']",,

In the study of structure-activity relationship, the 15-hydroxy group was found to be not necessary, while the spermidine moiety was essential for antitumour activity. 15-Deoxy derivative of spergualin was found to be more potent in antitumour activity.","['Umezawa, K', 'Takeuchi, T']","['Umezawa K', 'Takeuchi T']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],France,Biomed Pharmacother,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,8213295,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibiotics, Antineoplastic/*pharmacology', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Guanidines/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/immunology', 'Mice', 'Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors/pharmacology', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biomed Pharmacother. 1987;41(5):227-32.,"['0 (Antibiotics, Antineoplastic)', '0 (Guanidines)', '71O2A541CU (spergualin)', 'EC 1.5.- (Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-NH Group Donors)']",,,,,,,"['Institute of Microbial Chemistry, Tokyo.']",,

A potential barrier for the use of cultured T cells in vivo has been the previously demonstrated inability of cultured T cells to survive in vivo. As an example, studies to be reviewed below showed that a small precursor population of tumor-specific T cells could be grown to large numbers in vitro by repeated supplementation of media with exogenous Interleukin 2 (IL 2) and that the resultant long-term cultured T cells could mediate specific tumor therapy in vivo. However, T cells grown with IL 2 lost the ability to proliferate in response to immune stimulation by tumor antigen, became dependent upon exogenous IL 2 for survival, and thus died rapidly in vivo without repeated administration of exogenous IL 2. By contrast, T cells grown long-term in vitro in response to antigen-stimulation, as opposed to exogenous IL 2, were able to proliferate in vivo in response to stimulation by tumor antigen, mediate tumor therapy and persist long-term in vivo as functional memory T cells. Thus, the previously demonstrated inability of cultured T cells to survive and persist in vivo apparently resulted from the culture conditions utilized and did not reflect an intrinsic defect of all cultured T cells.","['Cheever, M A', 'Klarnet, J P', 'Peace, D J', 'Greenberg, P D']","['Cheever MA', 'Klarnet JP', 'Peace DJ', 'Greenberg PD']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunization, Passive', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Immunotherapy/*methods', 'Interleukin-2/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1987;244:49-58.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,"['University of Washington, Division of Medical Oncology, Seattle.']",,

This fraction, which contained 1.8% of the proteins present in the soluble extract, greater than 30 polypeptides revealed by SDS-PAGE analysis, and known cell surface antigens such as HLA-DR and p85 glycoprotein, must include a major proportion of the glycoproteins of the CLL cells. Glycopeptides were prepared by digestion with pronase, were separated into four pools (A-D) by Bio-Gel P-6 filtration and were radiolabeled by N-14C-acetylation. Glycopeptide pools C and D (0.45 less than Kd less than 0.77) were 95-100% bound to ConA-Sepharose and 7-12% bound to Lens culinaris (Lens)-Sepharose, but did not interact with any of the other lectins tested, suggesting major amounts of high mannose structures and minor amounts of fucosylated biantennary complex structures with terminal GlcNAc on the Man alpha 1-6 arm. Structures with greater than 3 branches were suggested for pools A and B (0 less than Kd less than 0.44) which were 34-65% unbound to ConA-Sepharose and 37-40% bound to Lens-Sepharose. Analysis of the ConA-unbound glycopeptides on RCA-Agarose before and after acid hydrolysis indicated variable amounts of terminal galactose and sialic acid residues. Major components of pool A were structures with terminal GlcNAc on all branches (22%) and fully sialylated structures (20%). In pool B, 20% of the radioactivity interacted with L-Phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin (PHA)-Agarose and with Ricinus communis (RCA)-Agarose, indicative of a fully galactosylated triantennary structure with branches at C-2 and C-6 of the Man alpha 1-6 arm. Half of the L-PHA-interacting material also bound to Lens-Sepharose, indicative of a core fucose residue. A fully galactosylated biantennary complex structure in pool A (13%) was identified by weak binding to ConA-Sepharose and strong interaction with RCA-Agarose. The presence of the polylactosamine sequence (Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc beta 1-3)n on this structure was suggested by a sialic acid independent interaction with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Agarose. A sialic acid dependent WGA-interaction was observed in the ConA-unbound glycopeptides of pool A (5%). Some of the structures identified in this study may be associated with the malignant CLL phenotype and/or with a distinct stage of B cell differentiation.","['Volman, G N', 'Narasimhan, S', 'Letarte, M']","['Volman GN', 'Narasimhan S', 'Letarte M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,IM,"['Asparagine', 'B-Lymphocytes/analysis', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'Concanavalin A', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Glycopeptides/*analysis/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*metabolism', 'Oligosaccharides/*analysis']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1987 Aug;24(8):871-86. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(87)90190-8.,"['0 (Glycopeptides)', '0 (Oligosaccharides)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', '7006-34-0 (Asparagine)']",['10.1016/0161-5890(87)90190-8 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Immunology, University of Toronto, Ontario, Canada.']",,

Cells having the features of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) but also lymphocytes displaying different morphological characteristics (non LGL; e.g. high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio and few cytoplasmic organelles) were seen reactive with each of the MoAb investigated. Leu7 identified a higher proportion of LGL (60-80%) than OKM1 (10-95%) and Leu11 (20-48%), and with a stronger binding. A distinct granular structure, recognized as parallel tubular arrays, was more characteristic of the Leu7+, CD8+ LGL and was less frequently seen in the OKM1 and Leu11 positive LGL subpopulation in four out of the five donors investigated. It is of interest that the Leu11 and OKM1 positive subsets, which correspond functionally to cells with greater NK function, had relatively less LGL than the Leu7 positive subsets, raising the issue of the true morphology of NK cells in man. The existence of a minority of CD4 positive LGL was confirmed.

Our results show that, within a short period of time following administration of a therapeutic dose of methotrexate to leukemic mice, influx of this folate analogue measured in L1210 cells removed from these mice was markedly stimulated. Enhancement of [3H]methotrexate influx in these cells was observed within 15 min of drug administration, was maximum (up to 3-fold) within 2 to 3 h, then decreased with time until 24 h when influx was at the control level. Measurements of [3H]methotrexate influx in cells removed from drug-treated mice were made after a period of incubation in drug-free medium to allow for efflux of exchangeable drug. Enhanced influx of [3H]methotrexate was accounted for by an increase in influx Vmax (influx Km was unchanged) and was further enhanced (to a total of 5-fold) by coadministration of leucovorin. Also, enhancement of influx of [3H]methotrexate in L1210 cells did not occur following administration of 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytidine at a therapeutically equivalent dose to leukemic mice or following exposure of these cells to methotrexate or methotrexate with leucovorin during growth in culture. Methotrexate therapy did not affect all transport systems, since the same therapy of leukemic mice had no effect on influx of the purine nucleoside analogue, 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine, in these same L1210 cells. These findings suggest that stimulation of [3H]methotrexate influx in L1210 cells during therapy with this folate analogue was not due to transstimulation during exchange between folate compounds and was not related to the antiproliferative effect of methotrexate on these tumor cells. The coadministration of cycloheximide with methotrexate to leukemic mice at a dose which markedly inhibited 3H-leucine incorporation into L1210 cell protein severely diminished the stimulation of [3H]methotrexate influx.

Erythroid colonies with abnormal morphology and karyotype could be grown in different culture conditions. Their erythroid nature was ascertained by the presence of carbonic anhydrase I and glycophorin A. Leukemic erythroid progenitors strongly differed from normal progenitors in that spontaneous colonies were always obtained, sometimes with an extremely high plating efficiency (up to 5.7%). Colonies were found to be autonomous from exogenous hematopoietic growth factors because they were still obtained with a high plating efficiency at an average of one cell per culture in the absence of any added growth factor. No evidence for an autocrine secretion of Epo or GM-CSF emerged because Epo or GM-CSF could not be detected by biologic or radioimmunologic assays from the culture supernatant or cellular extracts of the leukemic cells and that Epo or GM-CSF antibodies did not block autonomous growth. In all cases, however, hematopoietic growth factors increased the plating efficiency of the abnormal erythroid progenitors. In the two ""de novo"" leukemias, leukemic erythroid progenitors responded primarily to Epo, whereas in the three other patients' (chronic myeloid leukemia) blast crisis they responded maximally to GM-CSF plus Epo. Recombinant erythroid-potentiating activity had no effect in any of these cases. These results suggest that the leukemic erythroid clonogenic cells arise from expansion of erythroid progenitors at different levels of differentiation (ie, CFU-E or BFU-E, depending upon the disease) and that autonomous growth is not related to a secretion of Epo or GM-CSF.","['Mitjavila, M T', 'Villeval, J L', 'Cramer, P', 'Henri, A', 'Gasson, J', 'Krystal, G', 'Tulliez, M', 'Berger, R', 'Breton-Gorius, J', 'Vainchenker, W']","['Mitjavila MT', 'Villeval JL', 'Cramer P', 'Henri A', 'Gasson J', 'Krystal G', 'Tulliez M', 'Berger R', 'Breton-Gorius J', 'Vainchenker W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Cycle', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Erythrocytes/*drug effects', 'Erythropoietin/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*blood/genetics', 'Lymphokines/pharmacology', 'Macrophages', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Oct;70(4):965-73.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)', '11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)']",['S0006-4971(20)81900-4 [pii]'],,,,,,"['Institute National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (INSERM) U.91, Hopital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.']",,

One isolated hairy cell leukemia (HCL) with low background DNA synthesis was stimulated to significant levels of DNA synthesis when cultured with high (100 micrograms/mL) concentrations of soluble anti-IgM ligands. In contrast to the activation of normal peripheral blood polyclonal B cells, this DNA synthesis was completely independent of accessory T cell factors. Although the HCL clone could also be induced to enter S phase by incubation in media supplemented with only activated T cell supernatant, culture of the clone with activated T cell supernatant plus anti-IgM Ab resulted in DNA synthesis that was significantly less than that induced by either activator alone. Factor(s) in T cell supernatant appear to modulate the leukemic clone so that the binding of ligand to membrane IgM is perceived as an inhibitory rather than a stimulatory signal for DNA synthesis. In terms of Ig Fc independence and low ligand dose requirements, anti-IgM-mediated inhibitory signal transduction in the T cell supernatant-activated HCL clone was found to mimic anti-IgM mediated suppression of the spontaneous DNA synthesis of an alternative HCL clone. The functional results suggest that the type of signal transduced anti-Ig ligands may reflect differences in the activation state of receptive leukemic B cells.","['Mongini, P', 'Blessinger, C', 'Seremetis, S', 'Winchester, R', 'Rudich, S']","['Mongini P', 'Blessinger C', 'Seremetis S', 'Winchester R', 'Rudich S']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/physiology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Clone Cells', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M/immunology/*metabolism', 'Leukemia/immunology/metabolism/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Ligands/*metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/genetics', 'Solubility', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Oct;70(4):1193-202.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Ligands)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['S0006-4971(20)81875-8 [pii]'],,['GM 35174/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,"['Department of Rheumatic Diseases, Hospital for Joint Diseases, New York University School of Medicine, NY 10003.']",,

The specific binding of radioiodinated high-mol-wt BCGF (125I-HMW-BCGF) and low-molecular-wt BCGF (125I-LMW-BCGF) to fresh marrow blasts from B cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients was initially investigated. The estimated number of radioiodinated BCGF molecules bound per blast ranged from undetectable to 24.3 X 10(3) for HMW-BCGF, and from 11.5 X 10(3) to 457.8 X 10(3) for LMW-BCGF. In 3H-TdR incorporation assays, 75% of cases showed a significant response to LMW-BCGF with a median stimulation index of 9.3. By comparison, only 33% of cases showed a significant response to HMW-BCGF with a median stimulation index of 2.4. Subsequently, B cell precursor colony assays were performed to assess and compare the biologic effects of BCGF on leukemic B lineage lymphoid progenitor cells. Among 28 cases studied, 57% responded to both HMW-BCGF and LMW-BCGF, 21% responded only to LMW-BCGF, and the remaining cases showed no proliferative response to either growth factor. The response patterns of virtually pure populations of FACS-sorted leukemic B cell precursors were essentially identical to the proliferative responses of unsorted leukemic B-cell precursors. Synergistic effects between HMW-BCGF and LMW-BCGF were observed in 80% of the cases that responded to both. The numbers of cell-bound radioiodinated BCGF molecules, the stimulation indices, as well as the number of B cell precursor colonies in BCGF-stimulated cultures showed a marked interpatient variation. Patients with structural chromosomal abnormalities (SCAs) involving 12p11-13 or patients with a Philadelphia chromosome showed a greater HMW-BCGF response at the level of leukemic progenitor cells than did other patients (P = .02). The LMW-BCGF response was significantly greater for patients with SCA than for patients without SCA (P = .04). The response of leukemic progenitor cells to HMW-BCGF or LMW-BCGF did not correlate with sex, age, disease status, FAB morphology, WBC at diagnosis, or immunophenotype. To our knowledge, this study represents the first detailed analyses of BCGF receptor expression and BCGF effects in B cell precursor ALL.

Four hundred and thirty-eight patients with leukemia were treated at the Arizona Health Sciences Center from 1976 to 1985. Fifty-five (13 per cent) had 60 major gastrointestinal complications develop. Thirty-seven were treated medically with a mortality rate of 51 per cent, while 18 who were treated surgically had a 17 per cent mortality rate. These infections usually occur during induction or consolidation chemotherapy. Positive blood cultures and white blood cell counts of less than 2,500 per millimeter are a frequent occurrence. The most common complications of the gastrointestinal tract are enterocolitis, perirectal sepsis and bleeding. Because of the combined defects in phagocytosis (neutropenia), antibody production and cell mediated immunity, opportunistic infections (such as viral, fungal, parasitic or bacterial) are frequent and often lethal, despite routine antibiotic coverage. A protocol to identify a subset of patients with septic leukemia who may require emergency surgical treatment is vital since death in this group is most commonly from undiagnosed sepsis or progression of hematologic defects. This protocol should include repeated physical examinations, daily roentgenograms of the abdomen, liberal use of endoscopy, contrast roentgenography and computed tomography (CT) or ultrasound. Extensive surgical procedures can be safely carried out in patients with leukemia. The diagnosis of leukemia should not be a deterrent to emergency surgical exploration.","['Villar, H V', 'Warneke, J A', 'Peck, M D', 'Durie, B', 'Bjelland, J C', 'Hunter, T B']","['Villar HV', 'Warneke JA', 'Peck MD', 'Durie B', 'Bjelland JC', 'Hunter TB']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Surg Gynecol Obstet,"Surgery, gynecology & obstetrics",0101370,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Infections/etiology', 'Candidiasis/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enterocolitis/etiology/mortality/surgery', 'Female', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases/etiology/mortality/*surgery', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/etiology/surgery', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*complications/immunology/therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Opportunistic Infections/etiology', 'Rectal Diseases/etiology/surgery']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Surg Gynecol Obstet. 1987 Sep;165(3):217-22.,,,,,,,,,,

RNA splicing joins sequences from a gene on chromosome 22 (BCR) across the translocation breakpoint to a portion of the ABL oncogene from chromosome 9, resulting in a chimeric protein (P210) that is an active tyrosine kinase. Although strongly correlated with this specific human neoplasm, and implicated as an oncogene by analogy to the gene product of the Abelson murine leukemia virus, the P210 gene had not been tested directly for oncogenic potential in hematopoietic cells. We have used a retroviral gene-transfer system to express P210 in mouse bone marrow cells. When infected bone marrow is plated under conditions for long-term culture of cells of the B-lymphoid lineage, cells expressing high amounts of P210 tyrosine kinase dominate the culture and rapidly lead to clonal outgrowths of immature lymphoid cells. Expression of P210 is growth-stimulatory but not sufficient for full oncogenic behavior. Some clonal lines progress toward a fully malignant phenotype as judged by increased cloning efficiency in agar suspension and frequency and rapidity of tumor induction in syngeneic mice. Such in vitro systems should be useful in evaluating the sequential and perhaps synergistic involvement of the P210 gene and other oncogenes as models for the progressive changes observed in human chronic myelogenous leukemia.","['McLaughlin, J', 'Chianese, E', 'Witte, O N']","['McLaughlin J', 'Chianese E', 'Witte ON']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*genetics', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/genetics', '*Oncogenes', '*Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/genetics']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Sep;84(18):6558-62. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.18.6558.,['EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)'],['10.1073/pnas.84.18.6558 [doi]'],,,PMC299118,,,,,

After 16 months of observation, the patient developed acute myelomonocytic leukemia. During the preleukemic phase and after progression to overt leukemia, serial in-vitro analyses of megakaryocytic, granulocytic, erythrocytic and T-lymphocytic colony growth were carried out in a microagar culture system. At presentation, a marked diminution of CFU-M was observed, whereas CFU-E, BFU-E, CFU-C and CFU-TL were in the normal range. The CFU-M number remained at its low level during the whole observation period. The CFU-C number declined steadily during the preleukemic period, while BFU-E, CFU-E and CFU-TL remained constant until January 1985 when the patient developed AML. After progression to overt leukemia, a distinct reduction became evident in all colony-forming cells. Cytogenetic studies performed during the preleukemic phase indicated the presence of a 5q- chromosome. The authors submit evidence here that the patient was not only characterized by defective megakaryocytic colony formation but also by a deficiency of functional megakaryocyte colony-stimulating activity. No humoral or cellular inhibitors of CFU-M colony formation were found. It is concluded that in preleukemia with a 5q- chromosome the megakaryocytic cell lineage may be involved in the process that precedes overt leukemia at an earlier time than cells of granulocytic and erythrocytic lineages. In addition, it is shown here that megakaryocytopoiesis during the preleukemic period can be characterized by two different defects: first, an intrinsic megakaryocytic stem cell defect and, second, a deficiency of functional megakaryocytic colony-stimulating activity.","['Geissler, D', 'Thaler, J', 'Konwalinka, G', 'Peschel, C']","['Geissler D', 'Thaler J', 'Konwalinka G', 'Peschel C']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Chromosome Deletion', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/metabolism', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/metabolism/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Megakaryocytes/metabolism/*pathology', 'Preleukemia/*diagnosis/genetics/metabolism', 'Purpura, Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic/*diagnosis', 'Syndrome', 'T-Lymphocytes/pathology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(8):731-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90010-5.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)']",['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90010-5 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The S phase percentage, expression of CD19 antigen, and relapse status were also correlated with PE. Significantly, colony blasts had slightly different surface marker profiles in each case and were common ALL antigen negative in 33% of cases, which indicates the existence of a marked immunological heterogeneity at the level of leukemic progenitor cells.","['Uckun, F M', 'Kersey, J H', 'Gajl-Peczalska, K J', 'Heerema, N A', 'Provisor, A J', 'Haag, D', 'Gilchrist, G', 'Song, C W', 'Arthur, D C', 'Roloff, J']","['Uckun FM', 'Kersey JH', 'Gajl-Peczalska KJ', 'Heerema NA', 'Provisor AJ', 'Haag D', 'Gilchrist G', 'Song CW', 'Arthur DC', 'Roloff J', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytogenetics', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Lymphoid Tissue/*pathology', 'Male', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1987 Sep;80(3):639-46. doi: 10.1172/JCI113116.,,['10.1172/JCI113116 [doi]'],,"['5R29 CA-42111-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31618/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-36725/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC442285,,,,,

Similarly, iron transferrin at concentrations of 0.1-0.5 microgram/ml did not alter protein kinase C activity, while concentrations of iron transferrin of 1-100 micrograms/ml induced a maximal increase in enzyme activity. Apotransferrin and iron in the form of ferric citrate, as well as complexes of transferrin with copper, nickel, zinc, manganese, and cobalt did not increase protein kinase C activity. Additionally, CCRF-CEM cells pretreated with either actinomycin D or cycloheximide and then incubated with iron transferrin did not exhibit increased enzyme activity. Treatment with iron transferrin was found to have no effect on protein kinase C activity in normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in HL60, Daudi, and U937 cells. However, normal lymphocytes stimulated with phytohemagglutinin for 48 hr exhibited a 2-fold increase in protein kinase C activity following treatment with iron transferrin.

DMSO produced dose-dependent inhibition of HL-60 growth in liquid and semisolid media. Growth was partially to completely restored by the addition of GCT CM to cultures. Experiments in which cell volume, cell cycle kinetics, tritiated thymidine (3HTdr) incorporation, cell number, and nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) reduction were compared during culture indicated that DMSO inhibited the spontaneous increase in cell volume and flow of cells through the cell cycle which occurred in the first day of culture, the increase in 3HTdr incorporation which was detectable by day 2; and the increment in cell counts which occurred by day 3. These effects were opposed by GCT CM. In contrast, the DMSO-induced increase in NBT reduction which occurred by day 6 was not influenced by GCT CM. The major principle opposing DMSO was GM-CSF, since (1) highly purified GM-CSF from GCT cells and recombinant GM-CSF from COS cells transfected with the Mo cell GM-CSF gene overcame greater than 50% of DMSO inhibition; and (2) conditioned media from cells not producing CSF, G-CSF from GCT cells, and recombinant G-CSF from Escherichia coli transfected with the G-CSF gene from 5,637 cells were inactive. DMSO had little or no effect on the elaboration of autostimulatory activity by HL-60 cells.

TPA induced two main features, namely the development of ""plasmacytoid"" or ""hairy cell"" leukemia features that clearly depended on the dose and duration of treatment with the phorbol ester. The plasmacytoid features were more frequently encountered with lower doses (1 ng/ml) of TPA and were more evident after shorter exposures to TPA (1-2 days). Nevertheless, the hairy cell features were more striking after incubation with higher concentrations of TPA (10-100 ng/ml) after longer periods of incubation (up to 6 days) with lower doses of TPA. The various features of differentiation measured including cell morphology, surface membrane markers, Ig secretion, and TRAP staining, were frequently independent of each other, suggesting an autonomous pathway of differentiation for some of these features.

Our results confirm the extensive phenotypic heterogeneity of the cells from acute T cell malignancies, which contrast with the more limited phenotypic diversity of subacute or chronic T cell malignancies. Our study of normal children and fetal thymus cells shows that the extensive phenotypic heterogeneity of the malignant cells reflects the heterogeneity of the thymic subpopulations and shows that most of the phenotypes observed on malignant T cells have a normal counterpart, particularly in the fetal thymus. Moreover, we demonstrate that the CD1a molecules, which can form three different types of noncovalent intermolecular complexes on the surface of normal thymus cells, do not form any noncovalent intermolecular complexes on the surface of leukemic cells. We also show that CD1a molecules can form covalent intermolecular complexes with CD8 molecules on some but not all malignant cells.","['Amiot, M', 'Dastot, H', 'Schmid, M', 'Bernard, A', 'Boumsell, L']","['Amiot M', 'Dastot H', 'Schmid M', 'Bernard A', 'Boumsell L']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Ly/immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis/*genetics', 'Cell Line', 'Fetus/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/pathology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Thymus Gland/cytology/embryology/*immunology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Sep;70(3):676-85.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",['S0006-4971(20)78652-0 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

TCR alpha gene transcription was also studied. TRG gamma and TCR beta genes were found to be rearranged in all but one case. The TRG gamma rearrangement pattern seen in most cases is compatible with biallelic rearrangement by loop excision involving the J gamma 2 regions. The sizes of all but two rearranged bands were identical to those of the rearranged bands seen in polyclonal T lymphocytes also studied in this work. One identical-sized band was found in 11 of the 18 rearranged cases. The expression of TRG gamma mRNA (transcripts of 1.6 kilobases [kb]) was highly variable from case to case and did not correlate with the stage of differentiation of the malignant cells, the expression of the molecules CD4 and CD8, the expression and size of the transcripts of the TCR beta genes, and the transcription of TCR alpha genes. In one CD3 + case, strong expression of the TRG gamma transcripts coexisted with the exclusive presence of TCR beta mRNA of 1.0 kb. The cells from this case did not react with anti-Ti antibody and exhibited no natural killer activity. These findings are suggestive of a malignancy that may express the recently isolated CD3-TRG gamma complex.","['Le Paslier, D', 'Chen, Z', 'Loiseau, P', 'Cohen, D', 'Sigaux, F']","['Le Paslier D', 'Chen Z', 'Loiseau P', 'Cohen D', 'Sigaux F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Blast Crisis', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Collodion', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/metabolism/pathology', 'Paper', 'RNA, Messenger/*metabolism', 'Receptors, Immunologic/genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/metabolism/*physiology']",1987/09/01 00:00,1987/09/01 00:01,['1987/09/01 00:00'],"['1987/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Sep;70(3):637-46.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '9004-70-0 (Collodion)']",['S0006-4971(20)78646-5 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

Generation and characterization of biologically active monoclonal anti-idiotopes.,1354-60,"A murine monoclonal anti-tumor antibody termed SN2 (Ab1), isotype IgG1-kappa, that defines a unique human T cell leukemia-associated cell-surface glycoprotein, gp37 (m.w. 37,000), was used to generate monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies (Ab2) in syngeneic BALB/c mice. The Ab2 were screened on the basis of their binding to the F(ab')2 fragments of SN2 and not to the F(ab')2 of pooled normal BALB/c mice sera IgG1 or to an unrelated BALB/c monoclonal antibody of the same isotype. Fifteen Ab2, obtained from two fusions, were specific for the SN2 idiotope and not against isotype or allotype determinants. To find out whether these Ab2 are directed against the paratope of SN2, the binding of radiolabeled SN2 to leukemic MOLT-4 and JM cells which contain gp37 as a surface constituent was studied in the presence of these anti-idiotopes. Clone 4EA2 inhibited the binding 100% at a concentration of 50 ng and 4DC6 inhibited 90% at a concentration of 250 ng. A third clone 4DD6 gave about 50% inhibition. Similar was the inhibition of SN2 binding to insolubilized MOLT-4 antigen or cell membrane preparation. The binding of SN2 (Ab1) to 4EA2 and 4DC6 was also inhibited by semipurified preparation of gp37 antigen. These results demonstrate that at least two of the anti-idiotope antibodies are binding either at or near the binding site idiotope of SN2. Next, the purified Ab2 was used to immunize syngeneic mice to induce antibody binding to MOLT-4 cells or gp37. Sera from mice immunized with 4EA2 and 4DC6 coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin contained antibodies which bind to semipurified gp37 antigen and MOLT-4 cells. Immune sera inhibited the binding of iodinated Ab2 and Ab1 indicating that an anti-anti-idiotopic antibody (Ab3) in mice shares idiotopes with Ab1 (SN2). Also, the binding of iodinated Ab2 to Ab1 was inhibited by rabbit antisera specific for gp37. Collectively, these data suggest that anti-idiotype antibodies 4EA2 and 4DC6 may be useful in the generation of idiotype vaccines against human T cell leukemia.","['Bhattacharya-Chatterjee, M', 'Pride, M W', 'Seon, B K', 'Kohler, H']","['Bhattacharya-Chatterjee M', 'Pride MW', 'Seon BK', 'Kohler H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens/*immunology', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Glycoproteins/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Vaccines, Synthetic/*immunology']",1987/08/15 00:00,1987/08/15 00:01,['1987/08/15 00:00'],"['1987/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Aug 15;139(4):1354-60.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Vaccines, Synthetic)']",,,['CA 41636/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

We wished to determine if TCR rearrangement and expression was lineage restricted, showed any developmental hierarchy, or could identify new subsets of T cells. Rearrangement of gamma and beta TCR genes occurred early in development but in no set order, and most T-ALLs (22/26) were of sufficient maturity to have rearranged both genes. T-ALLs preferentially rearranged C gamma 2 versus the C gamma 1 complex; no preference within the beta locus was apparent. Once rearranged, the beta TCR continued to be expressed (11/13), whereas the gamma TCR was rarely expressed (3/14). The alpha TCR was expressed only in more mature T-ALLs (8/14) that usually displayed T3. The 3A-1 T cell associated antigen appeared earliest in development followed by T11 and T3. Within pre-B cell ALL a higher incidence of lineage spillover was noted for gamma TCR rearrangements (8/17) than for beta rearrangements (3/17). This also contrasts with the only occasional rearrangement of immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chains (3/25) in T-ALL. However, in pre-B ALL the pattern of gamma TCR usage was distinct from that of T cells, with the C gamma 1 complex utilized more frequently. Almost all ALLs could be classified as pre-B or T cell in type by combining Ig and TCR genes with monoclonal antibodies recognizing surface antigens, although examples of lineage duality were noted. Unique subpopulations of cells were discovered including two genetically uncommitted ALLs that failed to rearrange either Ig or TCR loci. Moreover, two T lymphoblasts were identified that possessed the T3 molecule but failed to express alpha plus beta TCR genes. These T-ALLs may represent a fortuitous transformation of T cell subsets with alternative T3-Ti complexes.","['Felix, C A', 'Wright, J J', 'Poplack, D G', 'Reaman, G H', 'Cole, D', 'Goldman, P', 'Korsmeyer, S J']","['Felix CA', 'Wright JJ', 'Poplack DG', 'Reaman GH', 'Cole D', 'Goldman P', 'Korsmeyer SJ']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/genetics', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics/pathology', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', 'Transcriptional Activation']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1987 Aug;80(2):545-56. doi: 10.1172/JCI113103.,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",['10.1172/JCI113103 [doi]'],,,PMC442268,,,,,

While only the s.c. methylcholanthrene-induced tumor exhibited regression and/or cures in response to immunomodulatory therapy with either agent alone, the simultaneous administration of a maximally tolerated dose of TNF and IL-2 given daily from within 1 day (B16 melanoma), 3 days (L1210 leukemia and P815 mastocytoma) or 5 and 10 days (EL-4 lymphoma and methylcholanthrene-induced sarcoma) after tumor cell implant resulted in no tumor takes (growth). The TNF dose was apparently rate limiting in that reduction of the amount of TNF in the combination by 50% resulted in the loss of curative effects, while IL-2 doses could be reduced by 90% (depending upon tumor type) and still result in an efficacious combination. The synergy seen in combination IL-2 and TNF therapy appeared to be dependent upon tumor burden, but somewhat independent of tumor location. For example, no tumors were seen in the artificial pulmonary metastasis model of the B16 melanoma, and the percentage of extension of median lifetime (test versus control) greater than 150% was seen in the i.p. B16 melanoma, as well as several other i.p. models of the five tumor types. On the other hand, no significant extension of lifetime (greater than 150%) was seen with either lymphokine alone when administered i.p. at maximally tolerated dose for any of the five tumors tested here.

Three cases had a low (less than 30%) expression of the T1 antigen. Functional studies showed that the proliferative response to PHA and the NK function were reduced in four of the seven cases. Molecular analysis, performed in six cases, revealed a monoclonal rearrangement of the T-cell receptor beta-chain gene in three, a polyclonal T-cell configuration in two and a germ-line arrangement in the last. All three monoclonal cases showed a depressed NK activity and two a reduced PHA response.

Bestatin exhibited antitumor effect against murine syngeneic tumors including mouse colon 26 and C1498 leukemia, and also it was active against MNNG-induced rat tumor by oral administration. Combination treatment of mouse colon 26 with bestatin and mitomycin C, 5-FU or CDDP was effective for the life prolongation of the treated mice compared to mono-therapy alone. Bestatin was found to exhibit the antitumor effect through T lymphocyte stimulation, macrophage activation and bone marrow stem cell stimulation were also observed by bestatin treatment experimentally. Values of T cell subsets in cancer patients recovered to the normal levels by Bestatin treatment. Release of Interleukin-1 and -2 was enhanced by Bestatin treatment in vitro. In the phase I study, clinical optimal daily dose was estimated as 10-100 mg to give 2-3 times weekly or daily continuously. In the comparative clinical trials, Bestatin was found to be effective for the prolongation of survival time of the patients with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia after induction of complete remission in combination with maintenance chemotherapy.

Quantitative bone biopsy performed in two patients (one with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and one with Waldenstrom's disease) demonstrated a dramatic increase in osteoclastic resorption close to tumor cells in both cases, similar to or even more marked than that observed in multiple myeloma. Finally, significant production of bone resorbing activity was found in short-term liquid culture specimens of tumor cells in eight of the nine cases. These observations clearly indicate that in B cell disorders other than multiple myeloma, the malignant B cells can produce significant bone resorbing activity in vitro and result in excessive osteoclastic resorption and lytic bone lesions, frequent hypercalcemia, and an overall disease picture clinically mimicking multiple myeloma.","['Rossi, J F', 'Bataille, R', 'Chappard, D', 'Alexandre, C', 'Janbon, C']","['Rossi JF', 'Bataille R', 'Chappard D', 'Alexandre C', 'Janbon C']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Bone Neoplasms/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Bone Resorption/diagnosis/pathology', 'Bone and Bones/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hypercalcemia/diagnosis/pathology', 'Lymphoma/*diagnosis/drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Multiple Myeloma/*diagnosis/pathology']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1987 Jul;83(1):10-6. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(87)90491-8.,,"['0002-9343(87)90491-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(87)90491-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The 57-kilodalton protein encoded by HCK resembles the product of the proto-oncogene c-src and is therefore likely to be a peripheral membrane protein. HCK is located on human chromosome 20 at bands q11-12, a region that is affected by interstitial deletions in some acute myeloid leukemias and myeloproliferative disorders.

Recently, however, IL 2-activated NK cells were suggested as the major source of LAK reactivity in human peripheral blood (PBL). Because certain T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells are phenotypically similar to LAK precursors, we have asked whether these leukemic cells can be induced toward LAK-cytotoxicity and express NK reactivity before stimulation. Five out of seven T-ALL preparations were induced by IL 2 to kill target cells. The cytotoxicity of the leukemic-LAK cells resembled that of normal LAK effectors as they lysed efficiently the NK-resistant target Daudi, as well as fresh human sarcoma, carcinoma, and renal cancer cells but not normal PBL. The ALL-LAK precursors phenotype was T3-, T4-, T8-, and T11+, similar to most normal LAK precursors. In contrast to normal PBL that generated LAK effectors when their proliferation was inhibited, the irradiated, nonproliferating T-ALL leukemic cells did not respond to IL 2. Therefore, the T-ALL LAK cytotoxicity was attributed to the leukemic cells rather than to residual normal lymphocytes. The IL 2-responding T-ALL cells did not express autonomous NK type cytotoxicity, suggesting that they reflect LAK precursors of non-NK origin. The homogeneous leukemic preparations with inducible LAK cytotoxicity described herein provide a model system for studying normal LAK cells.","['Kaufmann, Y', 'Levanon, M', 'Davidsohn, J', 'Ramot, B']","['Kaufmann Y', 'Levanon M', 'Davidsohn J', 'Ramot B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Phenotype', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/drug effects']",1987/08/01 00:00,1987/08/01 00:01,['1987/08/01 00:00'],"['1987/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Aug 1;139(3):977-82.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,

The antibody YE6/6 initially produced against Moloney leukemia virus-transformed T lymphoma line MBL-2, reacted with several other lymphoma lines including non-T lymphoma lines as well as thymocytes from leukemic AKR mice, but it did not show significant reactivities with resting or mitogen-activated normal lymphocytes by flow cytometric analysis. The antibody did not bind to some Abelson leukemia-transformed cells, which express Moloney virus antigens, suggesting that the antigen is unlikely to be encoded by Moloney virus genome. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the antigen molecules immunoprecipitated by the antibody revealed three major polypeptides. Two of the polypeptides, with approximate m.w. of 95,000 and 35,000, can be labeled by the cell surface iodination and, therefore, seem to be exposed on the cell surface. The third polypeptide, with approximate m.w. of 65,000, is not labeled by the surface iodination but it is readily detected by [35S]methionine labeling. The third polypeptide was labeled with [32P]orthophosphate indicating that it is a phosphoprotein. Western blot analysis showed that YE6/6 antibody primarily reacts with 35,000 m.w. polypeptide. Furthermore, the same 35,000 m.w. protein was also detected in concanavalin A-activated spleen cells at a low level by Western blot, but normal resting lymphocytes were negative.

Moreover, the NK activity of PBMC and E+ lymphocytes from some treated patients that have achieved the stage 0 according to Rai's classification after chemotherapy can be found within the range of the lytic activity shown by PBMC and E+ cells from normal donors.","['Alvarez-Mon, M', 'Casas, J', 'Laguna, R', 'Jorda, J', 'Durantez, A']","['Alvarez-Mon M', 'Casas J', 'Laguna R', 'Jorda J', 'Durantez A']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Blood Cells/physiology', 'Erythrocytes/immunology', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology/*physiology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology/*physiopathology', 'Neoplasm Staging', 'Neuraminidase', 'Rosette Formation', 'Sheep/blood']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1987 Mar;38(3):268-73. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1987.tb01175.x.,['EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)'],['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1987.tb01175.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

We report 2 cases, 1 CLL and 1 WDLL, in which the peripheral lymphocytes not only expressed monotypic SIg but also reacted with the T3-specific Mabs UCHT1 and OKT3 by indirect immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase staining. False-positive staining by both UCHT1 and OKT3 was excluded by showing that lymphocytes sensitized with an irrelevant mouse Mab did not stain with second layer antibodies and that lymphocytes stained with second layer antibodies alone were always completely unreactive. Also, in 1 case the determinants demonstrated by both anti-Ig and UCHT1 were re-expressed after capping and shedding, i.e. appeared to be endogenous. The B cell origin of the CLL lymphocytes was supported by the finding of CK gene rearrangement in the absence of T beta gene rearrangement.

In 16 cases rGM-CSF was able to induce AML colonies. In eight cases maximal clonogenic cell proliferation was obtained with 100 U rGM-CSF/ml alone (type I response). In eight other cases, however, maximal colony numbers were reached only after the addition of low concentrations of PHA-leukocyte conditioned media (PHA-LCM) to the rGM-CSF containing cultures (type II response). These values could not be obtained with higher doses of rGM-CSF (500 U/ml) or PHA-LCM separately. Thus in this subgroup, optimal AML colony formation depended on rGM-CSF plus an additional factor. Finally, in 4 of 20 cases rGM-CSF alone (100 U, 1000 U/ml) was not capable of inducing any AML colonies in vitro (type III). In these latter cases proliferation of AML-CFU could be achieved only by supplementing PHA-LCM. We conclude that GM-CSF is a stimulator of the in vitro proliferation of AML clonogenic cells. However, in a majority of these cases, i.e., 12 out of 20, AML-CFU require an additional factor for optimal proliferation which is produced by PHA-stimulated leukocytes.","['Vellenga, E', 'Delwel, H R', 'Touw, I P', 'Lowenberg, B']","['Vellenga E', 'Delwel HR', 'Touw IP', 'Lowenberg B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Communication', '*Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/blood/*pathology', 'Leukocytes/physiology', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Macrophages/cytology/drug effects', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', '*Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1987/07/01 00:00,1987/07/01 00:01,['1987/07/01 00:00'],"['1987/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1987 Jul;15(6):652-6.,"['0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,

This immunotoxin preparation was judged to contain less than 5% free antibody or gelonin. It was highly toxic in vitro in an antigen-specific fashion to the Thy-1 expressing RADA leukemia of A/J mice. The IC50 of this preparation on RADA in vitro was 10(-12) M, while the IC50 on the Thy-1 negative S1509a fibrosarcoma of A/J mice was 10(-7) M. The toxicity of this immunoconjugate was also measured in a direct proliferation and it was found that a 4-h exposure and a 24-h exposure of RADA cells to a 1 nM concentration of immunotoxin killed 90% and 99.9% of cells, respectively. Furthermore, efficacy in vitro was not due to the intrinsic susceptibility of RADA cells to tis type of immunotoxin, as one prepared with gelonin and an antibody recognizing the TLa determinant on this leukemia had no efficacy in vitro. Clearance of the anti-Thy-1-gelonin immunoconjugate from the circulation of A/J mice after i.v. injection was rapid, especially during the first 8 h after injection, possibly because of binding to Thy-1 expressing tissue. Delivery of immunoconjugate to ascitic tumor in vivo was substantially better if the immunoconjugate was given by i.p. injection, rather than by the i.v. route. When given either i.v. or i.p. at the time of i.p. tumor inoculation in vivo, the anti-Thy-1-gelonin immunotoxin showed potency in an antigen-specific fashion; while this immunoconjugate prolonged survival and frequently cured RADA-inoculated mice, neither anti-Thy-1 antibody, gelonin, a combination of the two, nor immunotoxin of irrelevant specificity had any significant effect on survival. Anti-Thy-1-gelonin also had no effect on survival of A/J mice inoculated i.p. with S1509a. Furthermore, it was determined that a single i.p. dose of anti-Thy-1-gelonin killed 90% to 99% cells in vivo, and that the immunoconjugate was about as effective in this model as either adriamycin or cytoxan.","['Scott, C F Jr', 'Goldmacher, V S', 'Lambert, J M', 'Chari, R V', 'Bolender, S', 'Gauthier, M N', 'Blattler, W A']","['Scott CF Jr', 'Goldmacher VS', 'Lambert JM', 'Chari RV', 'Bolender S', 'Gauthier MN', 'Blattler WA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*administration & dosage', 'Cell Survival', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage', 'Isoantibodies/*administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred A', 'Plant Proteins/*administration & dosage', 'Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1']",1987/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1987;25(1):31-40. doi: 10.1007/BF00199298.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Isoantibodies)', '0 (Plant Proteins)', '0 (Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1)', '0 (anti-Thy antibody)', '75037-46-6 (GEL protein, Gelonium multiflorum)']",['10.1007/BF00199298 [doi]'],,['CA-14723/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Successful cloning and amplification of natural killer cells.,213-20,"Defective natural killer (NK) cell populations from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), that reacted with both HNK-1+ and B73.1+ antibodies, were obtained by a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). These fractions, along with NK fractions from normal donors which reacted with both antibodies, were expanded as bulk cultures or clones by limiting dilution, for 4 weeks in the presence of 10% interleukin 2 (IL 2), human type AB plasma, and irradiated human allogeneic mononuclear cells. Successfully established clones from patients with CML, with lytic activity against autologous and more differentiated neoplastic granulocytes, were generated more efficiently from B73.1+ than from HNK-1+ subsets. However, there were no significant differences among the generations of B73.1+ and HNK-1+ clones for both patients and normal donors with lytic activity against NK susceptible K-562 targets. Fresh myeloblast preparations from a blast crisis were found to be more susceptible to lysis by IL 2-proliferative B73.1+ and HNK-1+ clones than were fresh myelocyte preparations from a chronic phase CML patient, which were lytically susceptible to only B73.1+ clones. B73.1+ and HNK-1+ subsets from CML patients demonstrated major histocompatibility complex nonrestricted killing, and showed the following predominant phenotypes: B73.1+T3+T8+ or B73.1+T3+T8- from B73.1+ subsets; and HNK-1-T3+T8+ (initially HNK-1+) from HNK-1+ subsets. In contrast, B73.1+ and HNK-1+ clones from normal donors showed the following predominant phenotypes: B73.1+T3-T8-; and HNK-1-T3-T8- or HNK-1-T3-T8+ (initially all HNK-1+). Short-term in vitro IL 2 or interferon treatment of fresh NK defective subsets from CML patients resulted in minimal cytotoxic augmentation. In contrast, defective NK cells from CML patients, whether HNK-1+ or B73.1+ subsets, proliferated with complete regeneration of cytolytic activity after a 3-4 week exposure to IL 2, but differed in phenotypic profiles as compared to those of normal donors. These observations imply that not only fresh defective NK cells but also the cytotoxically restored clones from CML patients are derived from different NK subsets and may represent undifferentiated forms of NK cells that may be arrested at an early stage of development by yet unknown mechanism(s). In vitro substantiation of autologous leukemia cell killing by IL 2-proliferative NK cell clones is encouraging and may allow for new in vivo immunotherapeutic modalities in CML patients.","['Fujimiya, Y', 'Chang, W C', 'Bakke, A', 'Horwitz, D', 'Pattengale, P K']","['Fujimiya Y', 'Chang WC', 'Bakke A', 'Horwitz D', 'Pattengale PK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Immunol Immunother,"Cancer immunology, immunotherapy : CII",8605732,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Separation', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', '*Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/immunology/therapy', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/pathology/therapy']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Immunol Immunother. 1987;24(3):213-20. doi: 10.1007/BF00205632.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",['10.1007/BF00205632 [doi]'],,"['AM-29846/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-29910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Two of the GM-CSF-dependent cell lines were derived from patients with undifferentiated T- and a biphenotypic B-myelomonocytic leukemia, which suggests that GM-CSF might maintain proliferation of leukemias originating from immature progenitor cells. Cytogenetic analysis indicated that all established leukemic cell lines were aneuploid, with six lines containing chromosomal alterations related to those observed in the leukemic cells of the patient. Two patients did not have an abnormal clone identified in the marrow but did yield an aneuploid cell line.

Those patients whose cells expressed surface IgM kappa were significantly more likely to be stage A at presentation and significantly less likely to have a lymphocyte count greater than 50 X 10(9)/l, to have progressive disease or to require treatment than those with other classes of surface Ig. Patients whose cells express surface IgM kappa have a significantly longer actuarial survival than others and this is also so when only patients in Binet stage A or when only patients presenting below the age of 75 are studied.

Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis showed that the IL-2-induced phosphoprotein was of Mr 67,000 with a pI of 5.8 (pp67) and was distinct from the IL-2 receptor. IL-2 also stimulated phosphorylation of four other proteins, with an Mr of 63,000 and pI values 5.3-6.1 (pp63s). The stimulation of pp67 phosphorylation was observed within 5 min after addition of IL-2 and was maximal after 15 min. The maximal phosphorylation was more than 10-fold that observed initially. In IL-2-dependent cells, IL-2 dose responses of pp67 phosphorylation and cell proliferation were exactly correlated. Phosphoamino acid analysis showed that the phosphorylation site of pp67 and pp63s was a serine residue. Subcellular-fractionation studies indicated that pp67 was localized in cytosol, whereas pp63s phosphorylation was induced by IL-2 in nuclear and cytosol fractions. Similar phosphorylation of pp67 and pp63s was observed when the cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate instead of IL-2. These results suggest that IL-2-IL-2-receptor interaction leads to activation of protein kinase(s), resulting in phosphorylation of certain cellular proteins such as pp67 and pp63s, and that this phosphorylation could be an early event in the transmission of intracellular growth signalling from the IL-2 receptors.","['Ishii, T', 'Kohno, M', 'Nakamura, M', 'Hinuma, Y', 'Sugamura, K']","['Ishii T', 'Kohno M', 'Nakamura M', 'Hinuma Y', 'Sugamura K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Phosphorylation', 'Proteins/*metabolism', 'Stimulation, Chemical', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1987/02/15 00:00,1987/02/15 00:01,['1987/02/15 00:00'],"['1987/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochem J. 1987 Feb 15;242(1):211-9. doi: 10.1042/bj2420211.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Proteins)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['10.1042/bj2420211 [doi]'],,,PMC1147685,,,,,

After complete remission was achieved, 27 patients received 38 consolidation courses consisting of high-dose Ara-C either alone or in combination with amsacrine with or without VP16-213 and prednisone. Seven (11%) of 66 induction courses and eight (21%) of 38 consolidation courses were complicated by respiratory failure that was considered a pulmonary reaction to Ara-C therapy. The initial findings on chest radiographs in the 15 cases included a diffuse interstitial pattern (two), a mixed interstitial-alveolar pattern (eight), an alveolar pattern (three), and a normal pattern (two). In 11 cases, the abnormalities were diffuse throughout both lungs with a preference for the lower lobes in five. The changes were localized in two cases. A small pleural effusion was observed in two patients. In the majority of cases, the initial radiographic changes progressed to a predominantly alveolar pattern. Thirteen patients recovered clinically within 2-9 days, and two patients died of pulmonary complications. Radiologic recovery took 7-21 days. Rapid regression of alveolar consolidations within 3-7 days was the first sign of radiologic improvement. The interstitial pattern gradually regressed.

Contact of RNK-16 cells with tumor cells (YAC-1) that are lysed by NK cells, but not with resistant tumor cells (EL-4, K562), led to an increase in inositol trisphosphate (InsP3), a Ca2+-mobilizing messenger. A similar increase in InsP3 could be elicited in RNK-16 cells by monoclonal antibody OX-34, when the antibody was crosslinked by F(ab')2 fragments of goat antibodies to mouse immunoglobulin. This reaction was accompanied by an increase in the concentration of cytoplasmic free calcium Ca2+, due primarily to the release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. In contrast to the stimulatory effects of crosslinked OX-34, OX-34 alone did not affect the levels of either InsP3 or cytoplasmic free Ca2+. Moreover, OX-34 alone blocked the generation of InsP3 by RNK-16 cells in response to YAC-1 cells and prevented target-cell killing. These findings demonstrate that OX-34 identifies a structure on the surface of RNK-16 cells that can stimulate the generation of InsP3, and they suggest that this structure can regulate signal transduction during target-cell recognition by NK cells.","['Seaman, W E', 'Eriksson, E', 'Dobrow, R', 'Imboden, J B']","['Seaman WE', 'Eriksson E', 'Dobrow R', 'Imboden JB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigen-Antibody Complex', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate', 'Inositol Phosphates/*biosynthesis', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology/metabolism', 'Rats', 'Sugar Phosphates/*biosynthesis']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 Jun;84(12):4239-43. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.12.4239.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigen-Antibody Complex)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)']",['10.1073/pnas.84.12.4239 [doi]'],,['R01 CA34529/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],PMC305060,,,,,

In vitro studies were done to characterize the immunotoxins (IT) and to demonstrate their specificity before use in vivo. The concentration of whole ricin IT (M6-Ricin) that inhibited protein synthesis by 50% (IC50) in L2C cells was 1.4 X 10(-9) M, in a 5-hr assay, in the presence of lactose to block non-antibody-directed toxicity. M6-Ricin did not inhibit protein synthesis in two control guinea pig cell lines that did not express the idiotype, nor did a whole ricin IT prepared with an isotype-matched monoclonal antibody of irrelevant specificity inhibit protein synthesis in L2C cells. Two recombinant ricin A chain IT, which differed from one another by a factor of 2 to 3 in the number of A chains conjugated per antibody molecule, were less effective in vitro than M6-Ricin (IC50 of greater than 5 X 10(-8) M). For in vivo experiments, the IT were given by the i.p. route 24 hr after the i.p. inoculation of 1 X 10(5) L2C cells. The highest doses of M6-Ricin and M6-Ricin A chain IT tested, 30 micrograms/kg and 3000 micrograms/kg, respectively, were within fourfold to fivefold of their maximum tolerated doses; no deaths or ill effects due to ricin toxicity were noted. These doses increased the median survival time of L2C-bearing guinea pigs to 31 to 34 days, compared with 15 days for untreated animals. This magnitude of increase in survival indicates that 99.999% (5 logs) of injected tumor cells were eliminated, thus accounting for the 12% long-term survival rate obtained. Median survival times for guinea pigs treated with 30 micrograms/kg of the A chain IT were 18 and 21 days for the two conjugates tested, and the median survival for guinea pigs treated with 3000 micrograms/kg of unconjugated antibody was 18 days. Our data demonstrate that recombinant A chain IT are active in vivo and that the B chain of ricin can potentiate IT activity in vivo. Although the potency differs by 100-fold, the therapeutic index of the intact ricin IT is similar to that of the ricin A chain IT.","['Gregg, E O', 'Bridges, S H', 'Youle, R J', 'Longo, D L', 'Houston, L L', 'Glennie, M J', 'Stevenson, F K', 'Green, I']","['Gregg EO', 'Bridges SH', 'Youle RJ', 'Longo DL', 'Houston LL', 'Glennie MJ', 'Stevenson FK', 'Green I']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibody Specificity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Immunotoxins/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Ricin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use']",1987/06/15 00:00,1987/06/15 00:01,['1987/06/15 00:00'],"['1987/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Jun 15;138(12):4502-8.,"['0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,,,,,,,

In the present study we have compared the idiotypic specificities of a panel of 39 mouse monoclonal anti-idiotype (anti-Id) antibodies developed against 16 monoclonal human immunoglobulins (Ig). The Id cross-reactivities of these antibodies with Ig products of normal and abnormal B cells were examined by immunofluorescence and immunochemical methods. The reactivity patterns of these anti-Id antibodies with a normal population of plasma cells were highly variable in the immunofluorescence assay. Six were reactive with 2 to 10% of normal plasma cells, 30 with 0.1 to 2% of plasma cells, and three with less than 0.1% of plasma cells from blood, bone marrow, spleen, or tonsils. These reactivity patterns were relatively consistent among samples from 23 Caucasian, black, and Oriental adults. Although the reactivities of most anti-Id antibodies in the panel were not restricted to a particular Ig isotype, several were preferentially reactive with a particular heavy or light chain isotype: one IgM-, two IgA-, two kappa-, and three lambda-restricted antibodies. The immunofluorescence data was confirmed by biosynthetic analysis of Id+ molecules produced by a normal plasma cell population. When the reactivity of this panel of anti-Id antibodies with nonhomologous B cell neoplasms was examined, seven of 30 myelomas or leukemia-derived products and one of nine B cell leukemias or lymphomas without paraproteins were found to be cross-reactive with one or two of the anti-Id antibodies. Although clearly significant, the cross-reactivity between the Id of these paraproteins appeared to be of lower affinity than the reactivity of the homologous Id with their respective anti-Id antibodies. The results reveal a remarkable diversity in the specificities of monoclonal antibodies classified by conventional criteria as anti-Id antibodies, and indicate the potential usefulness of a panel of antibodies for analyzing clonal diversity in normal and abnormal B cell development.","['Kiyotaki, M', 'Cooper, M D', 'Bertoli, L F', 'Kearney, J F', 'Kubagawa, H']","['Kiyotaki M', 'Cooper MD', 'Bertoli LF', 'Kearney JF', 'Kubagawa H']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adult', 'Animals', 'Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin Idiotypes/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mice', 'Myeloma Proteins/immunology', 'Plasma Cells/immunology']",1987/06/15 00:00,1987/06/15 00:01,['1987/06/15 00:00'],"['1987/06/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Jun 15;138(12):4150-8.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Immunoglobulin Idiotypes)', '0 (Myeloma Proteins)']",,,"['R01 AI014782/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 01005/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 13148/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 16673/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

We have studied the regulation of the human proIL-1 beta gene in THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induction of this gene results in an immediate and transient increase of message that rapidly falls to a low, but constant, level within 6 hr. This decrease results from a specific repression of transcription by 2 hr after stimulation. Cycloheximide inhibition of new protein synthesis causes a superinduction of IL 1 message, but does not alter the initial kinetics of message production. This presumably delays the synthesis of a labile transcriptional repressor protein and implies that the proIL-1 beta gene is under the control of both a transcriptional activator and a newly synthesized transcriptional repressor. The transient increase in mRNA production and the sustained low-level synthesis beyond the initial transient response suggest that the IL 1 protein itself may act intracellularly in a manner analogous to that described for several proto-oncogenes and cellular competence factors.","['Fenton, M J', 'Clark, B D', 'Collins, K L', 'Webb, A C', 'Rich, A', 'Auron, P E']","['Fenton MJ', 'Clark BD', 'Collins KL', 'Webb AC', 'Rich A', 'Auron PE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/physiology', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Cytoplasm/physiology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Gene Expression Regulation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid', 'Lipopolysaccharides/administration & dosage', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Protein Precursors/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1987/06/01 00:00,1987/06/01 00:01,['1987/06/01 00:00'],"['1987/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Jun 1;138(11):3972-9.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Protein Precursors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (interleukin 1 precursor)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,,,,,,['NASA: 87224049']

Novitsky, P.F. Roslansky, G.R. Siber, and H.S. Warren, J. Clin. Microbiol. 21:211-216, 1985). Studies since have shown that serum samples drawn from patients with leukemia and fever, gram-negative or gram-positive bacterial infections, or shock caused by gram-negative bacteria neutralize approximately 10-fold more lipopolysaccharide than do samples from normal controls. These findings suggested that the increased neutralization might reflect an acute-phase response and raised the question of whether it might be under the control of interleukin-1. To answer this question, we studied the neutralization of lipopolysaccharide in serum samples drawn from rabbits before and after the administration of crude interleukin-1, prepared from activated macrophage supernatants, and recombinant human interleukin-1. Crude interleukin-1 induced a 5.7-fold increase in serum neutralization 24 h after intravenous injection, and cloned interleukin-1 induced a 3.0-fold increase (P less than or equal to 0.01 and 0.05, respectively). In individual rabbits given identical doses of crude interleukin-1 on a weight basis, the serum-neutralizing ability correlated significantly with three activities of interleukin-1: rise in temperature (r2 = 0.558; P less than or equal to 0.01), decrease in serum iron (r2 = 0.534; P less than or equal to 0.01), and increase in serum copper (r2 = 0.323; P less than or equal to 0.05). We conclude that the increase in neutralization of bacterial lipopolysaccharide by serum samples drawn from patients with inflammatory states is mediated, at least in part, by interleukin-1, presumably through the induction of acute-phase serum proteins.","['Riveau, G R', 'Novitsky, T J', 'Roslansky, P F', 'Dinarello, C A', 'Warren, H S']","['Riveau GR', 'Novitsky TJ', 'Roslansky PF', 'Dinarello CA', 'Warren HS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Microbiol,Journal of clinical microbiology,7505564,IM,"['Animals', 'Copper/blood', 'Fever/etiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/*physiology', 'Iron/blood', 'Limulus Test', 'Lipopolysaccharides/*immunology', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Male', 'Rabbits']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Microbiol. 1987 May;25(5):889-92. doi: 10.1128/jcm.25.5.889-892.1987.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",['10.1128/jcm.25.5.889-892.1987 [doi]'],,['AI-06960/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],PMC266111,,,,,

The high cytosolic free Ca2+ level induced by anti-T3 or PHA declined more rapidly after addition of phorbol ester, phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). PMA did not affect cytosolic free Ca2+ changes induced by ionomycin indicating that the effect of PMA is due to a direct inhibitory effect on a transduction mechanism and not to activation of Ca2+ extrusion. Our data suggest that a regulatory N-protein is involved in the transduction of the PHA and anti-T3 response into a rapid and sustained elevation of cytosolic free Ca2+.

These observations were extended to normal human B cells and demonstrate that human B cells can secrete immunoglobulin in the absence of clonal expansion.","['Gallagher, G', 'Christie, J F', 'Stimson, W H', 'Guy, K', 'Dewar, A E']","['Gallagher G', 'Christie JF', 'Stimson WH', 'Guy K', 'Dewar AE']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Division', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Female', 'Growth Substances/*immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*biosynthesis', 'Interleukin-4', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*immunology', 'Male', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1987 Apr;60(4):523-9.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,PMC1453283,,,,,

These estimations and the serum concentrations of IgG, IgA, and IgM were correlated to clinical stage (International Workshop System) and pretreatment observation time. For all patients together, the mean counts of Leu5+, Leu3+, and Leu2+ cells were significantly increased compared with the mean counts in 12 healthy controls (Mann-Whitney). In patients with advanced disease (stage B + C), both T-subset mean cell counts were significantly increased, whereas in patients with early-stage disease (stage A), although some high T-helper cell counts were noted, only the T-suppressor/cytotoxic mean cell count increase reached significance. Thus a trend was observed of a more frequent T-suppressor/cytotoxic cell predominance in early-stage disease, which is the opposite of the findings in most other prognostic studies. However, there was no significant difference in pre-treatment observation time according to T-helper: T-suppressor cell ratio below vs. above 1.0, irrespective of stage, whereas according to clinical stage, the pretreatment observation time in stage A was highly significantly longer than in stage B + C (logrank test). Thus, no independent prognostic significance of T-subset counts was found as judged by pretreatment observation time. No correlation was found between the occurrence of hypogammaglobulinaemia, T-subset ratios or T-subset counts.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Geisler, C H', 'Larsen, J K', 'Plesner, T', 'Hansen, M', 'Hansen, M M']","['Geisler CH', 'Larsen JK', 'Plesner T', 'Hansen M', 'Hansen MM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/analysis', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/classification/*pathology', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1987 Jan;38(1):67-74. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1987.tb01427.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunoglobulins)']",['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1987.tb01427.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

The cytotoxic activity of spleen cells was diminished by treatment with anti-Thy-1.2 or anti-Lyt-2.1 antibody and complement. Therefore, the effector cells involved in the immunological rejection should be regarded as cytotoxic T-lymphocytes.

In nine cases, no colonies formed with either CSF. In seven cases colonies formed only in response to G-CSF and in 11 cases only in response to GM-CSF. In 21 cases colonies formed in response to either GM-CSF or G-CSF, and in 12 of these cases there was an additive effect between the two CSFs in determining maximum colony size. For cases responding to both GM- and G-CSF, the total number of colonies formed in response to the combination of both CSFs was almost always less than additive compared with the number of colonies formed in response to the individual CSFs. Further, the AML-CFU responding to either GM-CSF or G-CSF could not be distinguished by surface markers or by the cytochemical staining pattern of the colonies. These results suggest that there is considerable overlap between the GM-CSF- and G-CSF-responsive AML-CFU subpopulations in most cases. For five of seven cases, the combination of GM-CSF and G-CSF could replace a leukocyte feeder layer in providing maximum growth stimulation.

We now report that spontaneous T-cell colonies could also be obtained during complete remission of 13 out of 21 patients with T-ALL and T-NHL, but none of eight patients with common (pre-B) ALL (cALL). Colony cells were mainly E+T3+, with a variable expression of other T cell markers. Spontaneous T-CFC did not possess self-renewal capacity in the absence of added growth factors. Moreover, incubation of spontaneous colonies with colchicine yielded mitoses in only two out of seven patients, with one normal and one abnormal karyotype. In five patients tested, recombinant interleukin 2 (IL2) could also induce the proliferation of some T-CFC. Both spontaneous and IL2-induced colonies were inhibited by an anti-IL2 receptor monoclonal antibody, suggesting that interaction of IL2 with its receptor may be involved in the proliferation of some T-CFC from these patients. A study of 14 T-ALL patients tested during their first remission indicated that patients who developed no or few spontaneous colonies during their first remission (less than 20 colonies/10(5) mononuclear cells) seemed to relapse later and to have a significantly longer survival than patients with a high number of spontaneous colonies. These data suggest that the spontaneous proliferation capacity of T-CFC might be of prognostic value in the clinical evaluation of T-ALL.","['Allouche, M', 'Georgoulias, V', 'Bourinbaiar, A', 'Dupuy, I', 'Clemenceau, C', 'Gaget, H', 'Mathe, G', 'Jasmin, C']","['Allouche M', 'Georgoulias V', 'Bourinbaiar A', 'Dupuy I', 'Clemenceau C', 'Gaget H', 'Mathe G', 'Jasmin C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cell Division', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/immunology', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*blood/genetics', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*blood/genetics', 'Male', 'Prognosis', 'Stem Cells/*pathology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*pathology']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1987 Apr;65(4):411-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb04142.x.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1987.tb04142.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

I. Specific suppression of alloreactive cytotoxic and delayed-type hypersensitivity responses as well as allograft rejection.,538-43,"BALB/c mice receiving allogeneic C3H/He spleen cells via portal venous (p.v.) route or a single administration of cyclophosphamide (Cy) were capable of rejecting allogeneic X5563 tumor cells (C3H/He origin). In contrast, the combined treatment of p.v. inoculation with C3H/He cells and Cy administration abrogated the capability of rejecting allogeneic X5563 tumor cells. The dose of Cy and interval between p.v. presensitization and Cy injection needed to be more than 1.5 mg Cy/mouse and less than 2 days, respectively. Such abrogation of alloreactivity was alloantigen-specific, since p.v. inoculation of C3H/He cells followed by Cy injection resulted in selective inhibition of rejecting allogeneic C3H/He tumor cells (X5563 plasmacytoma) without suppressing the capability of rejecting allogeneic C57BL/6 tumor cells (EL4 leukemia). Most important, the induction of alloantigen-specific unreactivity by p.v. presensitization plus Cy injection contrasted with the failure of intravenous or subcutaneous presensitization plus Cy injection to induce tolerance that permits the growth of allogeneic tumor cells inoculated. This was substantiated by the finding that p.v. presensitization with C3H/He cells prior to Cy injection eliminated anti-C3H/He cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) potentials under conditions in which appreciable CTL and DTH responses are induced in mice inoculated via the i.v. route before Cy injection. These results demonstrate that p.v. inoculation of allogeneic cells followed by a single administration of Cy results in more efficient elimination of antialloantigen CTL and DTH reactivities, leading to the abrogation of potential to reject the allogenic tumor graft.","['Qian, J H', 'Kokudo, S', 'Sato, S', 'Hamaoka, T', 'Fujiwara, H']","['Qian JH', 'Kokudo S', 'Sato S', 'Hamaoka T', 'Fujiwara H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Transplantation,Transplantation,0132144,IM,"['Animals', 'Cyclophosphamide/*pharmacology', 'Graft Rejection/drug effects', 'Hypersensitivity, Delayed/immunology', '*Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', '*Immunosuppression Therapy', 'Isoantigens/*administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Portal System', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1987/04/01 00:00,1987/04/01 00:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Transplantation. 1987 Apr;43(4):538-43. doi: 10.1097/00007890-198704000-00017.,"['0 (Isoantigens)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",['10.1097/00007890-198704000-00017 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

By using somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization, we localized this gene to human chromosome 5 at bands q31 to q35, a chromosomal region that is frequently deleted [del(5q)] in patients with myeloid disorders. By in situ hybridization, the CSF-1 gene was found to be deleted in the 5q- chromosome of a patient with refractory anemia who had a del(5)(q15q33.3) and in that of a second patient with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia de novo who had a similar distal breakpoint [del(5)(q13q33.3)]. The gene was present in the deleted chromosome of a third patient, with therapy-related acute nonlymphocytic leukemia, who had a more proximal breakpoint in band q33 [del(5)(q22q33.1)]. Hybridization of the CSF-1 probe to metaphase cells of a fourth patient, with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia de novo, who had a rearrangement of chromosomes 5 and 21 [ins(21;5)(q22;q31.3q33.1)] resulted in labeling of the breakpoint junctions of both rearranged chromosomes; this suggested that CSF-1 is located at 5q33.1. Thus, a small segment of chromosome 5 contains GM-CSF (the gene encoding the granulocyte-macrophage CSF), CSF-1, and FMS, which encodes the CSF-1 receptor, in that order from the centromere; this cluster of genes may be involved in the altered hematopoiesis associated with a deletion of 5q.","['Pettenati, M J', 'Le Beau, M M', 'Lemons, R S', 'Shima, E A', 'Kawasaki, E S', 'Larson, R A', 'Sherr, C J', 'Diaz, M O', 'Rowley, J D']","['Pettenati MJ', 'Le Beau MM', 'Lemons RS', 'Shima EA', 'Kawasaki ES', 'Larson RA', 'Sherr CJ', 'Diaz MO', 'Rowley JD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adult', 'Anemia/*genetics', '*Chromosome Deletion', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*genetics', 'Female', '*Genes', 'Hematopoiesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1987 May;84(9):2970-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.84.9.2970.,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],['10.1073/pnas.84.9.2970 [doi]'],,"['CA 16910/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 38187/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM-35377/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",PMC304782,,,,,

These immunotoxins were prepared by conjugating ricin A chain (RA) with our monoclonal antibodies, SN1 and SN2, directed specifically to the human T-cell leukemia cell surface antigens TALLA and GP37, respectively. We have shown that these monoclonal antibodies are highly specific for human T-cell leukemia cells and do not react with various normal cells including normal T and B cells, thymocytes, and bone marrow cells. Ascitic and solid human T-cell leukemia cell tumors were generated in nude mice. The ascitic tumor was generated by transplanting Ichikawa cells (a human T-cell leukemia cell line) i.p. into nude mice, whereas the solid tumor was generated by transplanting s.c. MOLT-4 cells (a human T-cell leukemia cell line) and x-irradiated human fibrosarcoma cells into x-irradiated nude mice. To investigate the efficacy of specific immunotoxins in suppressing the in vivo growth of the ascitic tumor, we divided 40 nude mice that were injected with Ichikawa cells into four groups. Each group of 10 mice was injected with one of the following mixtures: 40 micrograms of purified control mouse IgG [IgG1(kappa)] (group 1), 40 micrograms of control RA conjugate (group 2), 20 micrograms of purified SN1 antibody [IgG1(kappa)] and 20 micrograms of purified SN2 antibody [IgG1(kappa)] (group 3), or 20 micrograms of SN1-RA and 20 micrograms of SN2-RA (group 4). Mice in groups 1 and 2 formed large ascitic tumors, and died 5.8-7.0 weeks after the transplantation. Group 3 mice also formed large ascitic tumors and died 6.4-7.8 weeks after the transplantation. However, none of the mice in group 4 that were treated with SN1-RA and SN2-RA showed any signs of a tumor or undesirable toxic effects for the 20 weeks that they were followed after the transplantation; these mice were indistinguishable from healthy control nude mice that were not injected with Ichikawa cells. Treatment with SN1-RA plus SN2-RA completely suppressed solid tumor growth in 4 of 10 nude mice carrying solid tumors and partially suppressed the tumor growth in the remaining 6 nude mice.

Five patients (20 percent) expressed T-cell antigens (B-T+My+), and one My+ patient expressed both B-cell and T-cell antigens. Only myeloid antigens (B-T-My+) were expressed in four patients (16 percent); three who were tested had germ-line immunoglobulin and T-cell-receptor gene configurations.

The functional and structural characters of the former were strikingly different from those of the latter. In fact the normal B-cell population with B-CLL-like phenotype showed an homogeneous enzyme pattern with predominant ANAE and a strictly lymphocytic cell morphology. In contrast, the leukaemic cells showed various and unrelated morphological and cytochemical features, thus forming apparent subgroups of B-CLL. The development of an irregular ""switch on"" mechanism in the blocked malignant cell clone, may account for these functional and structural maturation discrepancies. Moreover, the fact that in the leukaemic cells ANAE activity could be demonstrated only after the appearance of the other hydrolases, makes it a marker of functionally differentiated B lymphocytes.","['Palestro, G', 'Novero, D', 'Godio, L', 'Micca, F B', 'Resegotti, L', 'Stramignon, A']","['Palestro G', 'Novero D', 'Godio L', 'Micca FB', 'Resegotti L', 'Stramignon A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/*metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/cytology/*enzymology', 'Glucuronidase/*metabolism', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology/pathology', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/*metabolism']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(5):429-36. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90074-9.,"['EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.31 (Glucuronidase)']",['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90074-9 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Of particular interest was that lower dosages of CP (5 and 25 micrograms) gave longer protection than dosages of 50 and 250 micrograms. Using in vitro 125I-iododeoxyuridine release assay, these lower dosages were shown to selectively enhance the cytotoxicity associated with T lymphocytes, whereas higher dosages appeared to primarily augment the activity of phagocytes. Moderate natural killer cell activity was observed with both the lower and higher dosages of CP.

In these experiments we have investigated the effect of AF on the binding of phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu) to human chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells. AF enhanced binding of PDBu to its receptor in CLL cells by a) causing an increase in the affinity of PDBu receptors from Kd 20.3 nM to 7.3 nM, and b) enhancing translocation of PDBu receptors to the cell membrane. The increase in PDBu binding induced by AF in whole cells was only partially reversible by EGTA or the intracellular Ca++ antagonist TMB-8. Studies performed with quin-2-labeled cells showed that 100 microM AF caused a mean (+/- SD) rise in cytosolic Ca++ levels from 0.41 (0.12) to 0.85 (0.33) (n = 5). Thus the mechanism by which AF increases binding of PDBu to its receptor appears to be partially dependent on Ca++. These effects of AF occurred at cellular levels achieved in mononuclear cells during chrysotherapy of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","['Zalewski, P D', 'Forbes, I J', 'Valente, L', 'Hurst, N P']","['Zalewski PD', 'Forbes IJ', 'Valente L', 'Hurst NP']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Auranofin/*pharmacology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', '*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Compartmentation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'Phorbol Esters/*metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*metabolism', '*Receptors, Drug', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 May 1;138(9):3005-9.,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', '3H04W2810V (Auranofin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",,,,,,,,,

The proliferation of several lymphoid and nonlymphoid cell lines also was inhibited in the presence of CM. The inhibitor(s) in CM was not toxic to any of the cultures studied. CM inhibited the mitogen-stimulated proliferation of lymphocytes when added to cultures up to 52 hr after addition of mitogen. Normal responsiveness to mitogens could be restored by washing the CM-treated lymphocytes with medium during the first 6 hr of culture. The addition of exogenous IL-2 to lymphocyte cultures did not overcome the CM-mediated suppression of mitogen- or antigen-stimulated proliferation. CM also inhibited the IL-2-dependent proliferation of murine CTLL-2 cells. Preincubation of guinea pig lymphocytes in CM did not inhibit the capacity of these cells to release IL-2 after exposure to mitogen. The antiproliferative activity of CM was stable to heating at low pH (100 degrees C, 10 min, pH 4.0), was resistant to treatment with papain, pronase, DNase, and RNase and did not bind to Con A-Sepharose. Incubation of the L2C cells in indomethacin did not inhibit the release of the inhibitor(s). The inhibitor(s) in CM had an apparent molecular weight of 500-3500 Da as determined by dialysis and ultrafiltration analysis. The inhibitory activity was recovered in the organic phase after extraction with chloroform:methanol and eluted distinct from the thymidine standard after gel filtration on Sephadex-G 25. These data suggest that the inhibitor(s) in CM is a nonspecific, low molecular weight, lipid-like component (not prostaglandin) that exerts its antiproliferative effects subsequent to cell activation. The inhibitor(s) did not appear to suppress other biologic functions associated with activation, such as IL-2 secretion. The inhibitor in CM may be important in promoting tumor survival in vivo by suppressing potential anti-tumor cellular immune responsiveness.","['Collins, D P', 'Cook, D J', 'Ricardo, M J Jr']","['Collins DP', 'Cook DJ', 'Ricardo MJ Jr']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cell Line', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Culture Media/analysis', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Immune Tolerance/drug effects', 'Interleukin-2/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/cytology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*isolation & purification', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Molecular Weight']",1987/04/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/04/01 00:00'],"['1987/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1987 Apr 1;105(2):397-410. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(87)90087-6.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (suppressive B cell factor)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)']","['0008-8749(87)90087-6 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(87)90087-6 [doi]']",,"['CA09422/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA31828/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Clinical responses to therapy varied: Patient A had a minimal response; whereas Patient D showed an 85% decrease in lymphocyte count at 2 wk; and Patients B and C had intermediate responses. The pretreatment mononuclear cell adenosine deaminase activities, which ranged from 1.6 to 44.6 nmol adenosine/h/10(6) cells, decreased to approximately 1 nmol adenosine /h/10(6) cells 24 h following 2'-deoxycoformycin, and increased to 15 to 50% of the pretreatment activity prior to the second drug treatment. The clinical response to 2'-deoxycoformycin was unrelated to the pre- or posttreatment adenosine deaminase activities or to the rate of return of enzyme activities following treatment. The plasma deoxyadenosine levels and the leukemic cell dATP concentrations rose slightly with therapy, but there was no correlation between the magnitude of increase and clinical response. No significant levels of DNA strand breaks were observed in the leukemic cells following treatment, although the NAD levels decreased slightly in two patients. When peripheral mononuclear cells from the patients and two controls were incubated in vitro for 24 h with 2'-deoxycoformycin and increasing concentrations of deoxyadenosine, a concentration-dependent increase in dATP and decrease in NAD were observed in both the patients and normals. The normal cells, and cells from two patients, developed a significant number of DNA strand breaks. However, there was no relationship between the formation of DNA breaks and the degree of accumulation of dATP or depletion of NAD, or between any of these changes and subsequent clinical responses to 2'-deoxycoformycin. Based on this study, it appears that the antitumor activity of 2'-deoxycoformycin in chronic lymphocytic leukemia is unrelated to the induction of DNA strand breaks or to changes in the levels of dATP or NAD in the leukemic cells.","['Begleiter, A', 'Glazer, R I', 'Israels, L G', 'Pugh, L', 'Johnston, J B']","['Begleiter A', 'Glazer RI', 'Israels LG', 'Pugh L', 'Johnston JB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors', 'Aged', 'Coformycin/*adverse effects/analogs & derivatives', 'DNA/*drug effects', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Deoxyadenosines/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/drug therapy/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Monocytes/drug effects', 'NAD/metabolism', 'Pentostatin', 'Ribonucleosides/*adverse effects']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 May 1;47(9):2498-503.,"['0 (Adenosine Deaminase Inhibitors)', '0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '0 (Deoxyadenosines)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '0U46U6E8UK (NAD)', '11033-22-0 (Coformycin)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', ""K8KCC8SH6N (2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate)""]",,,,,,,,,

Purified human IL 1 beta appeared to be growth inhibitory (maximum, 50%) for M1 cells based on cell counts and [3H]thymidine incorporation. The replication of M1 cells was also inhibited by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and as little as 1 unit/ml IL 1 augmented the growth inhibition by LPS. Although IL 1 inhibited M1 cell growth, it did not induce cell differentiation by the criteria of either effect on expression of Fc receptors or on phagocytic ability. However, IL 1 augmented M1 cell differentiation in conjunction with LPS. At low doses of LPS, addition of IL 1 induced differentiation even though LPS and IL 1 by themselves did not induce differentiation. Cells treated with IL 1 for 1 day and then with LPS for an additional 2 days showed considerable augmentation of Fc receptor expression, while cells treated with the same stimuli in the reverse sequence exhibited only a low level of differentiation. Cells treated with medium alone followed by LPS showed moderate increase in Fc receptor expression. In addition, exposure of cells to IL 1 for at least 16 h was required for IL 1 augmenting effect. Therefore, IL 1 appeared to primarily influence M1 cells to become more sensitive to LPS. Treatment with both of IL 1 and LPS induced differentiation of a LPS-resistant clone of M1 cells, and IL 1 pretreatment rendered the resistant clone to become responsive to the differentiation inducing effect of LPS. Culture supernatants of M1 cells after stimulation with LPS contained IL 1-like activity by thymocyte comitogenic assays. In addition, mouse recombinant IL 1 alpha appeared to have the same activity as purified human IL 1 beta on the growth and differentiation of M1 cells. These results suggest that IL 1 may play an important role in mouse myeloid leukemic cell differentiation by acting as an autostimulating factor. IL 1 has been shown to be growth inhibitory and cytocidal for several tumor cell lines. Our results therefore suggest that the effects of IL 1 may result in the induction of terminal differentiation of some tumor cells.","['Onozaki, K', 'Tamatani, T', 'Hashimoto, T', 'Matsushima, K']","['Onozaki K', 'Tamatani T', 'Hashimoto T', 'Matsushima K']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Interleukin-1/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Macrophages/cytology/immunology', 'Mice', 'Phagocytosis/drug effects', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology']",1987/05/01 00:00,1987/05/01 00:01,['1987/05/01 00:00'],"['1987/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 May 1;47(9):2397-402.,"['0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,

The cells possess immature monocytic features, both cytochemical and immunochemical. It was found that a high level of interleukin 1 (IL-1) was produced by JOSK-I cells without any stimulation. The IL-1 production by JOSK-I cells has the following characteristics: constitutive; cell concentration dependent; and minimal at the logarithmic growth phase and maximal at the saturation density of cell growth. This constitutive production of IL-1 was little affected by the addition of polymyxin B. Partial purification of JOSK-I-derived IL-1 was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography on HPHT hydroxylapatite and TSK gel G3000 SW columns. The activity was found in the molecular weight range of 14,000 to 30,000 and over 70,000. In chromatofocusing, JOSK-1-derived IL-1 exhibited two isoelectric points, pI 6.9 and pI 5.9. Nearly 90% of the activity was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-human IL-1 antibody. These characteristics are consistent with those of human monocyte-derived IL-1.

The leukemic cells grew spontaneously although a better yield of metaphases could be obtained after PHA stimulation.

An isochromosome 8q was detected in a subclone at an early analysis, which was lost during clonal evolution. At the time of the last analysis, 6 months before the patient died, the diploid metaphases disappeared completely. The karyotype of the final chromosome study showed a monoclonal condition with the following abnormalities: 44,X,-Y,4q-,6p-,14q-,19p+,20q+,-20,22q-. Loss of the Y chromosome was limited to the leukemic cells. Comparing our data with the chromosome abnormalities reported in the literature, breakpoints at band 14q11-12 (location of the gene for the alpha chain of the T-cell receptor), loss of a normal chromosome #20, as well as structural abnormalities of the remaining chromosome 20p seem to be nonrandom in T-CLL arising in patients with ataxia telangiectasia.

The morphologic shifts correlated well with changes in the Moab reaction pattern. In Group 1 the activity of all Moab decreased significantly. In Group 2, only cells expressing Leu 3a and Leu 11a (a marker of natural killer cells) showed a significant shift, the latter increasing from 170/microliter to 360/microliter.

The target cells used in the CSA assays were from peripheral blood or bone marrow. Unstimulated B cells produced CSA in amounts similar to those present in the GCT-conditioned medium used as a positive control. The B cell-derived CSA predominantly promoted the growth of colonies that contained macrophages alone or macrophages and granulocytes. CSA eluted in a single peak from a G-75 Sephadex column with an approximate molecular weight (mw) of 65 to 70 kilodaltons (kd). Fractionation of tonsil B lymphocytes on Percoll density gradients showed that large B cells, probably already activated in vivo, were the main source of CSA. By contrast, small, resting B cells recovered from a different fraction of the Percoll gradient released minimum amounts or no CSA. However, these B cells became CSA producers following stimulation with Staphylococcus aureus Cowan (SAC) in vitro. B cells purified from the peripheral blood of nine out of 12 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) also released CSA in vitro in the absence of stimuli.

Because patients with leukemia and preleukemic disorders manifest low NK activity, it is possible that NK cell impairment may contribute to leukemogenesis. In view of this possibility, it was important to characterize the NK cell defect of leukemic patients and to design new approaches for its correction. Analysis of the mechanism of NK cell defect demonstrated that NK cells of leukemic patients were impaired in their tumor-binding and lytic activity and did not display ability to recycle or to produce cytotoxic factor. However, deficient NK activity could be corrected by culture of peripheral blood effector cells with IL 2. IL 2-activated NK cells manifested restoration of all measured parameters of the cytotoxic mechanism, as exemplified by normalized tumor-binding and lytic activity, as well as the rate of lysis and ability to recycle. Importantly, such in vitro stimulated cytotoxic cells displayed reactivity against fresh leukemic cells of autologous as well as allogeneic origin. Another interesting observation from these studies was that the NK activity was also induced in the leukemic bone marrow, a tissue with a very low frequency of cytotoxic NK cells. It is important to note that cultured NK cells did not represent a stationary cell population, but proliferated in vitro quite actively (doubling time 3 to 6 days) for at least 5 wk. Characterization of the in vitro generated cytotoxic cells indicated that these cells displayed large granular lymphocyte morphology and CD16 and Leu-19 cell surface phenotype. Our data demonstrate that the NK cell defect of leukemic patients is not a permanent phenomenon, but can be reversed in culture with IL 2, and that fully cytotoxic NK cells can be maintained and expanded in vitro. Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that adoptive transfer of autologous NK cells to the patients may represent a promising new therapy for treatment of leukemia.","['Lotzova, E', 'Savary, C A', 'Herberman, R B']","['Lotzova E', 'Savary CA', 'Herberman RB']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes/etiology/immunology/pathology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology/pathology', 'Leukemia/complications/*immunology/pathology']",1987/04/15 00:00,1987/04/15 00:01,['1987/04/15 00:00'],"['1987/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Apr 15;138(8):2718-27.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],,,['CA 39632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

By radioimmunoassay, SN3 reacted with four of four non-T/non-B, two of two pre-B and one of three leukemic B cell lines. The reagent was unreactive, however, with established leukemic T and myelomonocytic cell lines or normal B cell lines. On immunohistochemical assays on frozen sections of nine reactive lymph nodes and three spleens, SN3 showed a preferential binding to 50-95 per cent mantle zone (MZ) cells and 5-20 per cent interfollicular or red pulp B-lymphocytes. This was uninhibited by pre-incubation with heterologous anti-HLA-DR or anti-delta reagents. SN3 was unreactive with normal germinal centre (GC), epidermal or Langerhans cells but did react with less than 1 per cent thymic B-lymphocytes. In eight follicular small cleaved cell lymphomas tested SN3 exhibited three patterns of reactivity: peripheral follicular, combined peripheral and central follicular, and combined follicular and interfollicular. Three follicular lymphomas were essentially SN3-. In three diffuse small lymphocytic lymphomas, SN3 showed patchy areas of reactivity unassociated with proliferation centres. In four diffuse B-cell lymphomas (one mixed small and large cell, two large non-cleaved cell, and one small non-cleaved (Burkitt) cell), SN3 reactivity was uniformly distributed in the majority (60-90 per cent) of the cells. SN3 was unreactive with one diffuse B-large cell lymphoma, three nodal T-cell lymphomas and three cases of mycosis fungoides. The findings indicate that SN3 detects an antigen that is present in subpopulations of normal MZ cells, the antigen is also detected in GC cells undergoing lymphomatous transformation but is not readily detected in normal GC cells, and the antigen is also expressed in subpopulations of diffuse B- but not T-cell lymphomas.","['Barcos, M', 'Pollard, C', 'Fukukawa, T', 'Seon, B K']","['Barcos M', 'Pollard C', 'Fukukawa T', 'Seon BK']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Adult', '*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes/*cytology/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*blood/ultrastructure']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1986 Oct-Dec;4(4):251-9. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900040402.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",['10.1002/hon.2900040402 [doi]'],,"['CA 19304/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 37131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

NK activity of MNC and isolated lymphocyte subsets in normal donors is shown to exceed that of CLL patients. The absence of preincubation effect on NK activity level of MNC, T- and non-T-cells in CLL patients has been also found.

Two other antigens (L22 and L30) appeared to be expressed mainly on small resting B cells but not on large activated B cells. In contrast with L22 and L30, L29 and L4, the latter of which corresponds to OKT10, were not or little expressed on resting B cells, but were found on these B cells after activation either in-vivo or in-vitro with staphylococcal protein-A (SAC) plus interleukin-2 (IL-2) or with pokeweed mitogen (PWM). We also produced MAb (L10) that detected IL-2 receptors (IL-2R) consistently expressed on in-vitro activated B cells as described above. In contrast with L4, L10 and L29, L30 was lost from in-vitro-activated B cells, following the appearance of either L10 or L29 on these in-vitro-activated B cells.

Even after fractionation on hydroxyapatite HPLC the IL 1-dependent D-factor was co-chromatographed with TNF. Recombinant human TNF as well as the partially purified guinea pig TNF induced differentiation of Ml cells in conjunction with either the partially purified guinea pig IL 1 or recombinant human IL 1 alpha, although these factors by themselves did not induce differentiation.

Among the 23 cases of T-cell lymphoma, 22 were of peripheral T-cell type; most were of helper-cell (T4) phenotype and a significant number expressed J5 (CALLA) and I2 (HLA-DR). The present study shows that the percentage of T-cell lymphoma in Chinese is higher than in Caucasians, but lower than in Japanese. However, when the age-adjusted incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is considered, the incidence rates of T-cell lymphoma in Hong Kong Chinese and Japanese in areas non-endemic for adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia are similar; the incidence in Americans is similar or slightly lower. The major difference between the races is that B-cell lymphoma, particularly the follicular type, is much rarer in Asians than Americans.","['Ng, C S', 'Chan, J K', 'Lo, S T', 'Poon, Y F']","['Ng CS', 'Chan JK', 'Lo ST', 'Poon YF']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Pathology,Pathology,0175411,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface', 'Asians', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Hong Kong', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/genetics/*immunology/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology/pathology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Pathology. 1986 Oct;18(4):419-25. doi: 10.3109/00313028609087562.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",['10.3109/00313028609087562 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

This heterogeneity which had been identified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining has been further characterized by immunological techniques. Using as substrates two Moloney (M) MLV chronically infected cell lines (MJD-54 and clone 2 cells), we found that (i) all p30s had the antigenicity of M-MLV p30, when analysed by immunoblotting of virion proteins with anti-p30 sera, and (ii) when cells were labelled with [35S]methionine, a 14C-amino acid mixture, or [14C]serine and lysates of purified virions were immunoprecipitated with goat anti-p30 sera, four p30 spots (pI 6.0, 6.1, 6.3 and 6.6) could be clearly identified. These results strongly support the viral origin of the heterogeneous p30 spots. We next examined infected cell lysates in an attempt to pinpoint the molecular basis of this heterogeneity. When we immunoprecipitated p30s from labelled cell lysates utilizing goat anti-p30 sera it was observed that in contrast to the four virion p30s, there were only three intracellular p30s (pI 6.0, 6.3 and 6.6), there was a threefold greater amount of the intracellular compared to the virion form of p30 with pI 6.0, tryptic peptide maps of both virion and intracellular p30s labelled either with [35S]methionine or 125I showed basically similar patterns with only slight differences in intensity among certain peptides for the p30s with pI 6.1, 6.3 and 6.6, and the intracellular p30 with pI 6.0 had a peptide that was not present in any of the other p30s. These results suggest that due to some as yet uncharacterized modification(s) of p30 and/or some structural differences between different p30s, a heterogeneity in pI exists. This may be important for assembly of the virion capsid. However, it is also possible that the p30 heterogeneity reflects the presence of multiple M-MLV proviruses within each of the infected cell clones.","['Ikuta, K', 'Luftig, R B']","['Ikuta K', 'Luftig RB']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,J Gen Virol,The Journal of general virology,0077340,IM,"['Antibodies, Viral/immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Intracellular Fluid', 'Isoelectric Point', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*analysis/immunology', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Retroviridae Proteins/immunology/*isolation & purification', 'Virion/*analysis']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Gen Virol. 1987 Feb;68 ( Pt 2):487-98. doi: 10.1099/0022-1317-68-2-487.,"['0 (Antibodies, Viral)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)']",['10.1099/0022-1317-68-2-487 [doi]'],,['CA-37380/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

In order to apply the enzyme-substrate analogy to clonal cytolytic reactions, it was first established that the lytic reactions exhibited initial steady-state velocity of lysis at the effector and target cell concentrations used. The lytic reaction maintained linearity for velocity of lysis during the first 90 min of incubation, then plateaued. Vmax (the maximal rate of target cell lysis achieved by a given effector population) and Km (the target cell number resulting in 1/2Vmax) values were determined over a wide range of target and effector cell concentrations. Both parameters were found to be directly proportional to the number of effector cells. At a given concentration of cloned CTL, the lytic parameters of Vmax and Km were not significantly different for normal or leukaemic target cells that express Qa-1b. Additional kinetic parameters for lysis of normal and leukaemic target cells by a cloned CTL were also compared. The lytic efficiency of the CTL clone (i.e. maximal killing rate with an infinite number of targets) and the intrinsic affinity between effector and target cells were the same with either normal or leukaemic targets. However, the maximal lysis of target cells at an infinite number of effectors was significantly less for normal compared with leukaemic targets. This suggests that the normal target cells were more heterogeneous in their expression of the target (Qa-1b) antigen.

In contrast, the response to SAC was low or negligible in seven of the eight patients, and only one patient responded well to this mitogen. Bc was also effective in inducing secretion of IgM in cells from seven of the eight patients, and this was unaffected by removal of T cells. Fractionation of CLL cells on density gradients showed that the highest level of IgM production was induced in cells with a low buoyant density, whilst cells with a high buoyant density secreted little or no immunoglobulin in response to Bc.

Thin-layer chromatography of the isolated ganglioside fraction from T-cell lymphoblasts revealed two major resorcinol-positive bands. One ganglioside comigrated with II3-alpha-N-acetylneuraminosyllactosylceramide (GM3), the major ganglioside in normal lymphoid tissue, and the other ganglioside comigrated with authentic II3-alpha-N-acetylneuraminosyl-alpha 2----8-N-acetylneuraminosyllactosylceramide (GD3) in three different solvent systems. Neuraminidase treatment of the latter ganglioside yielded GM3 and lactosyl ceramide, hydrolysis products of GD3. Scanning densitometry revealed that whereas thymus cells contained 97% GM3 and 3% GD3, T-cell lymphoblasts contained from 22 to 86% GD3 and a corresponding decrease in GM3. The shift to increased GD3 was observed in the blasts from all seven T-cell patients, but not in the blasts from the non-T, non-B patients studied. Only trace quantities of GD3 were detected from two continuous T-ALL cell lines, HSB2 and RPMI 8402. The results demonstrate a consistently significant increase in ganglioside GD3 in uncultured, patient-derived T-cell ALL lymphoblasts when compared to non-T-cell ALL and normal lymphoid tissue.

At diagnosis, blast cells were morphologically undifferentiated, had nondiagnostic cytochemistry, showed an abnormal karyotype (t[4;11]), expressed markers of B cell lineage, and demonstrated C mu gene rearrangement. Tissue culture of marrow or blood cells yielded colonies of leukemic blasts. Increasing concentrations of DFO produced a dose-dependent suppression of patient's blast colony growth in vitro, and blasts within colonies showed a marked change in surface antigen expression from lymphoid to myelomonocytic markers, became monocytic in appearance, and developed intense staining for nonspecific esterase. When DFO was given intravenously to the patient as a single agent for 48 hours, blasts no longer expressed lymphoid antigens and became strongly positive for myelomonocytic markers, identical to the in vitro findings. Intravenous DFO halted rising peripheral blood blast cell numbers and allowed a several-fold increase in normal hematopoietic progenitor colony growth.

We found that, in clinically stable MDS, growth patterns and dose-response to CM's were mostly within the normal range. With progressive blastic transformation, these features became abnormal with an increase in cluster growth. Clusters responding to a high dose of LCM, persisting after 14 d and enhanced by PCM may represent 'early' clonogenic cells. These clusters were found in progressive MDS with increased numbers of blast cells. Clusters formed by 'late' clonogenic cells were found in normal bone marrow and stable MDS. In ANLL the disturbance of proliferation and maturation seems to be much more pronounced than in progressive MDS with blastic transformation.

This problem is compounded by the development of cross-resistance to other useful chemotherapeutic agents which severely limits treatment alternatives. Development of approaches to overcome and/or circumvent drug resistance will depend on the precise understanding of the mechanism(s) of resistance not only at the target tumor cell level (in vitro) but also in vivo. The data on L1210 sensitive to araC transplanted s.c. demonstrated that although target cells are highly sensitive to araC, the lack of in vivo response of solid L1210 cells (s.c.) is primarily due to limited drug delivery to the target. Approaches that would modify these processes should improve on the therapeutic selectivity of this agent. In contrast, in cells where the mechanism of resistance is deletion of a key anabolic enzyme (e.g. CdR kinase), these cells are collaterally sensitive in vitro and in vivo to DAUR. This type of resistance, however, could not be overcome by liposome encapsulation of araC or araCTP. With respect to AM resistance, the concentration of VRP for in vitro reversal of resistance of P-388/AM was difficult to achieve in vivo without significant host toxicity. Continuous infusion of VRP, however, demonstrated that at the maximally tolerated doses of VRP it was not possible to achieve any significant therapeutic effects against P-388/AM. The use of liposomes or modulation by VRP does not appear to be a fruitful approach in overcoming AM resistance, especially in cells which possess a high degree of resistance. Metabolic modulation of FU by dLCF appears to be a promising area of investigation and deserves further investigation concerning quantitation of the intracellular pools of folate and ways to modulate them.","['Rustum, Y M', 'Radel, S', 'Campbell, J', 'Mayhew, E']","['Rustum YM', 'Radel S', 'Campbell J', 'Mayhew E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['3-Deazauridine/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Synergism', 'Fluorouracil/therapeutic use', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Liposomes/administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Verapamil/pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1986;223:187-202.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Liposomes)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', '263CU738ZY (3-Deazauridine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'CJ0O37KU29 (Verapamil)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'U3P01618RT (Fluorouracil)']",,,"['CA18420/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA28494/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

DIA inhibited cell proliferation and induced distinct morphological changes which were more pronounced in the myelomonocytic and erythroleukemia cell lines than in the lymphoid cell lines. DIA triggered in the myelomonocytic and erythroleukemia cell lines an increase in the number of NBT-reducing cells and caused strong adherence to plastic surface. The T-cell lines showed aggregation of cells in floating clusters. In the isoenzyme analysis of the enzymes carboxylic esterase and acid phosphatase, it was found that DIA stimulated the new expression of isoenzymes and a stronger staining intensity of several isoenzyme bands in all cell lines, however, at varying degrees.

The mAb, beta Framework 1 (beta F1) is capable of immunoprecipitating the TCR alpha beta complex from 125I-labeled human T cell tumors, immunocompetent T cell clones, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL). beta F1 recognizes the separated TCR beta subunit in Western blotting. Because it does not bind to the surface of viable T cells but does react with the plasma membrane form of the TCR after treatment with membrane solubilizing agents, the beta F1 mAb reacts with a ""hidden"" determinant on the TCR beta subunit. After solubilization with 70% ethanol, the TCR alpha beta complex is shown to exist on greater than 92% of T3+ human PBL, whereas 2 to 8% of T3+ PBL do not react with the mAb. The beta F1 mAb demonstrates the existence of differently glycosylated surface 125I-labeled TCR alpha-chains (alpha, alpha', alpha"") in association with a common TCR beta-chain on the HPB-MLT T cell leukemia. Reactivity of the beta F1 mAb on thymus tissue sections is similar to that of anti-Leu-4 (anti-T3). The beta F1 mAb should prove useful as a research tool for both the immunochemical characterization and isolation of virtually any alpha beta T cell receptor, whether from individual T cell clones or polyclonal populations of T lymphocytes. Recognition of T cell receptors in histologic tissue sections suggests that the beta F1 mAb may be useful in the clinical diagnosis of T cell lineage neoplasms. In failing to recognize all T3+ lymphocytes, it allows the identification of novel populations of T3+ lymphocytes that may express non-alpha, non-beta T cell receptors.","['Brenner, M B', 'McLean, J', 'Scheft, H', 'Warnke, R A', 'Jones, N', 'Strominger, J L']","['Brenner MB', 'McLean J', 'Scheft H', 'Warnke RA', 'Jones N', 'Strominger JL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Chemical Precipitation', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Point', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Weight', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology']",1987/03/01 00:00,1987/03/01 00:01,['1987/03/01 00:00'],"['1987/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Mar 1;138(5):1502-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,"['1K08AM01598-01/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States', '2P050AI21163/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Here we additionally characterize the functional signal given by antibody binding to Bp50 on both normal and malignant B cells. A monoclonal anti-Bp50 antibody could augment the proliferation of B cells activated by anti-IgM, anti-CD20, or 12-O-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) stimulation, but was not co-stimulatory with B cell growth factor (BCGF), interleukin 1, or interleukin 2. The signal did not depend on the Fc portion of the antibody, because F(ab')2 fragments of anti-Bp50 were still functionally active. Both anti-Bp50 and a low m.w. BCGF preparation were similar in that both were co-stimulatory with the same agents and both anti-Bp50 and BCGF affected activated B cells but not resting B cells. However, a panel of B cell malignancies differed in their responsiveness to anti-Bp50 vs BCGF: some tumors proliferated in response to anti-Bp50 but not BCGF, whereas other tumors had the opposite pattern. Bp50 was found to have several properties in common with HLA class II molecules: both Bp50 and class II were expressed at lower levels on blood B cells than on tonsillar B cells; the expression of both Bp50 and class II was increased after activation of blood B cells with TPA or anti-IgM; and the expression of both Bp50 and class II was increased after activation of non T, non-B acute leukemias with BCGF. Thus class II and Bp50 expression may be under common regulatory control. The fact that BCGF modulated the expression of Bp50 on leukemic cells suggests that BCGF and Bp50-mediated signals may be coordinately regulated.","['Ledbetter, J A', 'Shu, G', 'Gallagher, M', 'Clark, E A']","['Ledbetter JA', 'Shu G', 'Gallagher M', 'Clark EA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Carcinoma/immunology', 'Growth Substances/analysis/*immunology/physiology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/immunology', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Lymphokines/analysis/*immunology/physiology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*physiology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1987 Feb 1;138(3):788-94.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",,,"['AI23267/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'RR00166/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Furthermore, the pathways of glutamine metabolism in these cells were studied. Compared with resting thymocytes, glucose metabolism of proliferating thymocytes was 36-fold increased during the incubation; 92% of the amount of glucose utilized was converted into trioses mainly lactate, whereas resting cells metabolized only 38% to trioses. However, the latter oxidized 19% of glucose to CO2, as opposed to 1.1% by the proliferating cells. Rates of glucose uptake and degradation to products by the malignant T lymphoblastoid cell line (Jurkat) were nearly identical with those observed with proliferating rat thymocytes, whereas the benign B lymphoblastoid cell lines (DHg-B-1 and LV-B-1) showed significantly higher rates of glucose metabolism. All three transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines, however, metabolized glucose almost completely to lactate as did the proliferating rat thymocytes. Lymphocytes are able to utilize glutamine with glutamate, aspartate and ammonia being the major end-products. A complete recovery of glutamine carbon in the products was obtained with all cells. Glutamine utilization by incubated proliferating rat thymocytes was 8-fold increased as compared to the resting cells. Again the human T lymphoblastoid cell line showed the same rates of glutamine uptake and conversion into products as did the proliferating rat thymocytes, whereas both B lymphoblastoid cell lines had about 2.5-fold enhanced rates as compared to the T cell line. The results indicate that during lymphocyte proliferation caused by mitogen stimulation as well as by permanent transformation into lymphoblastoid cell lines glucose metabolism is altered not only quantitatively but also qualitatively by changing from partly aerobic to almost complete anaerobic glucose breakdown. Glutamine has been found to be a suitable energy source for lymphocytes. About 75% of the amount of glutamate derived from glutamine entered into the citric acid cycle via the aspartate aminotransferase, and the remaining 25% via the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. The changes in metabolic rates observed in proliferating as well as in transformed or leukemic lymphocytes appear to be reliable parameters to characterize the state of lymphocyte activation or to evaluate the efficacy of lymphokines.","['Brand, K', 'Leibold, W', 'Luppa, P', 'Schoerner, C', 'Schulz, A']","['Brand K', 'Leibold W', 'Luppa P', 'Schoerner C', 'Schulz A']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Netherlands,Immunobiology,Immunobiology,8002742,IM,"['Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Concanavalin A/pharmacology', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Glucose/*metabolism', 'Glutamine/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/metabolism', '*Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mitogens/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/immunology/*metabolism', 'Thymus Gland/cytology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunobiology. 1986 Oct;173(1):23-34. doi: 10.1016/S0171-2985(86)80086-9.,"['0 (Mitogens)', '0RH81L854J (Glutamine)', '11028-71-0 (Concanavalin A)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)']","['S0171-2985(86)80086-9 [pii]', '10.1016/S0171-2985(86)80086-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The current review will present data from our laboratory demonstrating in animal models the feasibility of both potential approaches. Studies to be reviewed show that: IL 2 can induce the proliferation and expansion in number of tumor-reactive T cells in vitro; T cells grown in culture in IL 2 can be effective reagents in vivo for specific tumor therapy; the administration of exogenous IL 2 can induce the growth and augment the function of cultured T cells in vivo; however, as a corollary, T cells cultured long-term in vivo with IL 2 are functionally limited in vivo without the administration of exogenous IL 2 in vivo; by contrast, T cells grown in vitro with specific antigen, as opposed to IL 2, as the major stimulus for proliferation are able to proliferate rapidly in vivo, distribute widely in host lymphoid organs, and mediate therapy of disseminated murine leukemia; importantly, such antigen-driven long-term cultured T cells can survive long-term in vivo and provide specific immunologic memory, and, the administration of low-dose IL 2 in vivo can induce the growth of antigen-driven long-term cultured T cells in vivo and thereby increase the number of functional memory T cells; the culture of lymphoid cells in high concentrations of IL 2 can induce LAK cells in vitro capable of lysing leukemia in vitro; LAK cells generated in vitro can mediate a small but detectable anti-tumor effect in vivo against disseminated leukemia as an adjunct to chemotherapy; and, high-dose IL 2 administered in vivo can activate LAK cells in vivo and cure disseminated murine leukemia.

Since the sensitive and resistant target cell lines had been induced with the same carcinogen and in mice of the same genotype, they represent a very useful model for investigation of target cell structures responsible for the sensitivity to the LAK cell effect.","['Indrova, M', 'Bubenik, J', 'Toulcova, A']","['Indrova M', 'Bubenik J', 'Toulcova A']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Czech Republic,Folia Biol (Praha),Folia biologica,0234640,IM,"['Animals', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*drug effects/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Sarcoma, Experimental/immunology/*therapy']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Folia Biol (Praha). 1986;32(6):392-8.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,

Cell proliferation was measured by 3H-thymidine uptake and Ig production by the plaque forming cell (PFC) response. Whole PBML responded to UM with proliferation and an increase in PFC. The PFC response was at best equal to and frequently synergistic with that produced by pokeweed mitogen and occurred in the three major Ig classes. To test the effect of UM on subpopulations of PBML, adherent cells (AC) were isolated by plastic adherence and T and B enriched populations by rosetting with sheep red blood cells. The proliferative response of T cells needed the presence of AC whilst the effect on Ig production by B cells required both T cell help and the presence of AC. Human thymocytes also responded to UM by proliferation. The results show that, in addition to being a T cell mitogen, UM is also a T cell dependent polyclonal B cell activator.","['Wangel, A G', 'Kayhko, K', 'Reitamo, S', 'Jokinen, I']","['Wangel AG', 'Kayhko K', 'Reitamo S', 'Jokinen I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/biosynthesis', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Mitogens/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Urine/*analysis']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1986 Oct;66(1):248-53.,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Mitogens)']",,,,PMC1542655,,,,,

Parameters evaluated included: frequency of effector CTL, specificity of binding to and lysis of target cells, killing and recycling ability of individual CTL, and the avidity of effector-target conjugation. While the frequency of effector CTL in the peritoneal cavity of BALB/c mice immunized against leukemia EL4 of C57BL/6 origin increases from 0 to 35% in 11 days of priming, a paradoxically lower frequency has been observed usually after 2 degrees and repeatedly after 3 degrees immunizations both in the peritoneal cavity and in the spleen. The H-2 haplotype and H-2 sub-loci specificity of CTL is preserved upon repeated immunizations. Likewise, the rate of killing and recycling of individual CTL do not change throughout immunizations, suggesting that the cytolytic activity of individual effector CTL is discrete (""quantal"") and not subject to maturation upon repeated immunizations. On the other hand, inhibition of conjugate formation and of lysis by antibodies against target major histocompatibility complex (MHC) or effector Lyt-2 determinants is consistently less effective with 3 degrees CTL, suggesting an increase in avidity of effector/target interaction upon repeated immunizations. A striking increase in apparent avidity has been observed during CTL priming in mixed lymphocyte reaction, as deduced from blocking by target cell MHC antibodies. These results suggest that alloimmune CTL undergo maturation with respect to their ability to interact with the target, and that the composition of the responding population is subject to moderate selective processes driven by repeated antigenic stimuli.","['Moscovitch, M', 'Grossman, Z', 'Rosen, D', 'Berke, G']","['Moscovitch M', 'Grossman Z', 'Rosen D', 'Berke G']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Graft Rejection', 'Immunization', 'Immunologic Memory', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains/immunology', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*cytology/immunology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1986 Oct 1;102(1):52-67. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(86)90325-4.,,"['0008-8749(86)90325-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(86)90325-4 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

These effector cells had the morphology of lymphoblasts and were able to lyse murine P815 tumor cell targets. Fresh, unstimulated, guinea pig effectors were not capable of lysing these targets. The therapy of the L2C leukemia, an acute B-lymphoblastic leukemia of strain 2 guinea pigs, using LAK cells and recombinant IL-2 was examined. Antitumor effects were demonstrated by premixing LAK and tumor cells prior to intradermal injection in Winn type assays and then measuring the growth of local tumor and survival of the animals. In further experiments i.p. administration of LAK cells, 4 h following tumor cell inoculation by the i.p. route, prolonged the survival of treated animals. The best results in this i.p. therapy model were obtained with a 10-fold excess of LAK cells over tumor cells plus additional treatment with 1000 units of IL-2 for 20 days. This resulted in a 10-day increase in median survival of treated animals. Despite these in vivo antitumor effects, lytic activity of LAK effector populations against L2C targets could not be demonstrated in vitro. The potential synergy between LAK cells, IL-2, and a monoclonal antibody directed against the idiotype of the neoplastic cell surface immunoglobulin was also investigated. In these experiments enhanced survival of the combined treatment group, beyond that of either singly treated group, was not found. This study shows that LAK cells are useful agents in the therapy of a widely disseminated, aggressive, B-cell lymphoblastic leukemia. The use of such effectors, even in cases where in vitro lysis of the target tumor cell cannot be demonstrated, is encouraged by these results.","['Gregg, E O', 'Gregg, I C', 'Green, I']","['Gregg EO', 'Gregg IC', 'Green I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Female', 'Guinea Pigs', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Lymphokines/*immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/immunology', 'Recombinant Proteins/*pharmacology', 'Spleen/immunology']",1987/02/01 00:00,1987/02/01 00:01,['1987/02/01 00:00'],"['1987/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Feb 1;47(3):723-9.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether DNA methylation plays a role in expression of DR genes in leukemia, we analyzed methylation patterns of the DR-alpha and D/DR-beta genes in the DR antigen-positive and -negative B-cell lines, in normal adults and in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients using Southern blot hybridization of DNA digested with Msp I and Hpa II. The DR-alpha and D/DR-beta genes of a DR antigen positive B-cell line, T5-1, were heavily methylated, while those of DR antigen-negative variant, 6.1.6, were hypomethylated. Blood cells collected from four normal adults contained different levels of DR-alpha and D/DR-beta mRNAs, but their relative amounts were about the same among the individuals. By contrast, the relative amounts of these mRNAs in CLL cells varied widely, indicating aberrant expression of one or both of these genes in CLL. The DR-alpha gene in four normal adults and six CLL patients produced only a 3 kb hybridizable band after Msp I digestion. Normal adult DR-alpha genes were resistant to Hpa II digestion, suggesting that all Hpa II sites are methylated. In contrast, digestion of CLL DNA with Hpa II yielded various bands of larger sizes which differed among the CLL patients, suggesting that Hpa II sites are differentially methylated in the CLL DNA. In the case of D/DR-beta genes, normal adult DNA gave Msp I bands which were slightly polymorphic among four individuals tested. In contrast, CLL DNA showed a high degree of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) on Msp I digestion. We speculate that the high RFLPs in the CLL DNA may result from differential methylation in CpG clusters in the D/DR-beta genes, and that this characteristic may be of use for diagnosis of CLL.","['Tobe, H', 'Ruether, B A', 'Jerry, L M', 'Tamaoki, T']","['Tobe H', 'Ruether BA', 'Jerry LM', 'Tamaoki T']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cancer Biochem Biophys,Cancer biochemistry biophysics,7506524,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*genetics', '*Genes', 'HLA-D Antigens/*genetics', 'HLA-DR Antigens/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/genetics/*immunology', 'Methylation', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Reference Values', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Biochem Biophys. 1986 Oct;8(4):313-26.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (HLA-D Antigens)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)']",,,,,,,,,

Prognostic implication of bone marrow histology in 120 patients experience from a single hematology unit.,767-71,"The available staging systems for B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) do not always predict the clinical course and the prognosis of the disease. In these systems, the pattern of bone marrow histology is not incorporated. In the current report we investigate the prognostic value of the diffuse or nondiffuse pattern of bone marrow involvement in 120 B-CLL patients in relation to their actuarial survival, and we compare these results with the actuarial survival based on the International Workshop system. In addition, we analyze the influence of the diffuse or nondiffuse pattern on the actuarial survival, in relation to the individual clinical stages (A, B, C). All patients were diagnosed and followed-up in the same Unit. Our patients were divided into Stage A (64), Stage B (22), and Stage C (34). They were also subdivided into those with a diffuse (46) and those with a nondiffuse (74) pattern of bone marrow histology. The difference in the actuarial survival in relation to their clinical stage (A, B, C) was statistically significant (P less than 0.025). A greater statistical difference (P less than 0.005) was found when the actuarial survival was analyzed in relation to the diffuse or nondiffuse pattern of bone marrow histology. No statistically significant differences could be found (P greater than 0.1), when the actuarial survival was calculated in every stage (A, B, C), on the basis of the diffuse or nondiffuse pattern of bone marrow histology. When our Stage A and B patients were analyzed for disease progression, in relation to the diffuse or nondiffuse bone marrow histology, it was found that 66.6% of the diffuse Stage A patients and 88% of the diffuse Stage B patients had disease progression as compared to only 8.6% for the nondiffuse Stage A patients and 33% for the nondiffuse Stage B patients. Our findings indicate that: the pattern of bone marrow histology in B-CLL patients is the single most important prognostic parameter in this disease; a clinicopathologic staging system for B-CLL may be justified; and the diffuse pattern of bone marrow histology could be considered as the best criterion for initiation of therapy in these patients.","['Pangalis, G A', 'Roussou, P A', 'Kittas, C', 'Kokkinou, S', 'Fessas, P']","['Pangalis GA', 'Roussou PA', 'Kittas C', 'Kokkinou S', 'Fessas P']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis']",1987/02/15 00:00,1987/02/15 00:01,['1987/02/15 00:00'],"['1987/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Feb 15;59(4):767-71. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870215)59:4<767::aid-cncr2820590417>3.0.co;2-6.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19870215)59:4<767::aid-cncr2820590417>3.0.co;2-6 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Before the introduction of the regimen, the primary tumor in two patients was treated by immediate amputation and in 13 with preoperative intra-arterial CDP. Among these 13 patients, responses (healing) were observed in 11 (one required the addition of radiation therapy). In three patients, the responses were so dramatic that, at their request, surgery was deferred and treatment exclusively with chemotherapy was instituted. Based on this experience, treatment exclusively with chemotherapy was also administered to an additional five patients who were admitted without pathologic fractures. In the course of such treatment, pathologic fractures also developed; notwithstanding, chemotherapy was maintained and healing also occurred. One of the 20 patients had pulmonary metastases at diagnosis; these were resected after treatment and pathologic examination revealed no evidence of viable tumor. The remaining 19 patients were free of pulmonary metastases but these later developed in seven patients. These data were compared to a historical control series in which 16 of 21 patients with pathologic fractures developed pulmonary metastases. Three of the chemotherapy treated patients died of nonosteosarcoma related causes (leukemia, generalized varicella, and a metabolic complication). Overall, survival was improved in the chemotherapy treated patients as compared to the historical control series: 10 of 20 versus 6 of 21, respectively. Pathologic fractures in osteosarcoma may heal under treatment with chemotherapy, which also has a favorable impact on the eradication of pulmonary metastases and survival.","['Jaffe, N', 'Spears, R', 'Eftekhari, F', 'Robertson, R', 'Cangir, A', 'Takaue, Y', 'Carrasco, H', 'Wallace, S', 'Ayala, A', 'Raymond, K']","['Jaffe N', 'Spears R', 'Eftekhari F', 'Robertson R', 'Cangir A', 'Takaue Y', 'Carrasco H', 'Wallace S', 'Ayala A', 'Raymond K', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Neoplasms/*complications/drug therapy/mortality', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Fractures, Spontaneous/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Lung Neoplasms/secondary', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Osteosarcoma/*complications/drug therapy/mortality']",1987/02/15 00:00,1987/02/15 00:01,['1987/02/15 00:00'],"['1987/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Feb 15;59(4):701-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870215)59:4<701::aid-cncr2820590407>3.0.co;2-v.,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19870215)59:4<701::aid-cncr2820590407>3.0.co;2-v [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Pretreatment and follow-up marker studies were performed on 14 of 16 evaluable patients. Peripheral blood and bone marrow mononuclear cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for reactivity with monoclonal antibodies to B cell associated surface antigens (B1, B2, B4, BL1, BL3, and BL7) and two hairy cell (HC) antibodies, anti-HCL1 and HCL3. B cell monoclonality was determined by clonal excess calculation of immunoglobulin light chains. Right angle scatter analysis showed that HCs are scattered between lymphocytes and monocytes. Nine of the 14 patients achieved a partial remission, three patients achieved a minimal response, and two patients failed therapy. Phenotypically, ten patients had kappa clonal excess and four had lambda clonal excess. These cases expressed a mature B cell phenotype, ie, BL1-, BL7+, BL3+, B1+, B2-, B4+, HCL1+, HCL3+. All 12 responders became nonreactive with monoclonal antibodies 4 to 8 weeks after therapy; in five of these cases, reactivity with monoclonal antibodies was again detected at the time of maximum clinical response (2 to 8 months), without affecting clinical response status. In four of 12 responders, clonal excess disappeared 4 to 8 weeks after therapy; in three more patients, clonal excess disappeared at the time of maximum clinical response (2 to 4 months); in three patients, clonal excess disappeared from the peripheral blood, but not from the bone marrow at the time of maximum clinical response (3 to 5 months); two patients had persistent clonal excess. In the two failures, there was persistence of clonal excess and reactivity with monoclonal antibodies. This study shows that phenotypic analysis is a sensitive and objective method of assessing response of HCL to alpha interferon.

Since the NK cells have been suggested to play a role in natural resistance to leukemia, we considered it of importance to investigate the approaches leading to the correction of NK defect of leukemic patients. Our studies demonstrate that culture of effector cells with interleukin-2 (IL-2) resulted in restoration of cytotoxic defect. This was indicated by normalization of tumor-binding as well as lytic NK activity, by normal frequency of cytotoxic cells and their ability to recycle. The NK cell nature of cytotoxic cells was shown by abrogation or depletion of cytotoxicity by antibody directed against NK cell-associated, but not T cell-associated antigen. The generation of NK cell activity against fresh leukemic cells suggests that adoptive transfer of IL-2 activated NK cells may be a new approach to leukemic treatment.","['Lotzova, E', 'Savary, C A']","['Lotzova E', 'Savary CA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis,"Comparative immunology, microbiology and infectious diseases",7808924,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/*immunology/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology/therapy']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Comp Immunol Microbiol Infect Dis. 1986;9(2-3):169-75. doi: 10.1016/0147-9571(86)90009-3.,['0 (Interleukin-2)'],"['0147-9571(86)90009-3 [pii]', '10.1016/0147-9571(86)90009-3 [doi]']",,['CA 39632/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Large tumors (3 to 6 cm3) were induced by s.c. injection of the acute lymphoblastic leukemia T-cell line CEM. Transient tumor inhibition could be achieved by intratumoral injection of an intact-ricin immunotoxin that specifically recognizes a determinant CD5 (T,p67) expressed on the cell surface. Injection of the in vitro active cyclophosphamide congener mafosfamid had little effect on the progression of tumor growth. A combination regimen of immunotoxin and mafosfamid induced the most dramatic antitumor effect; a 72 to 100% reduction in tumor volume was observed within 3 to 4 days posttreatment. However, tumors relapsed within 5 to 13 days. Persistent, tumor regression was observed only when protocols using successive injections of combined immunotoxin/mafosfamid were used. All seven mice undergoing this treatment had a precipitous decrease in tumor size, and 86% survived greater than 30 days posttreatment. No residual tumor was detectable on Day 30 in five of seven mice. Regression was partly attributed to the selective activity of immunotoxin, since successive injections of an irrelevant control immunotoxin coupled to ricin in combination with mafosfamid did not reduce tumor size. Thus, we have demonstrated that a combination of anticancer chemotherapy and immunotoxin therapy yielded a greater antitumor effect than either therapy alone.","['Weil-Hillman, G', 'Uckun, F M', 'Manske, J M', 'Vallera, D A']","['Weil-Hillman G', 'Uckun FM', 'Manske JM', 'Vallera DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/administration & dosage', 'Cell Line', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*analogs & derivatives', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Immunotoxins/*administration & dosage/adverse effects', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy/pathology/*therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Nude', 'Ricin/*administration & dosage']",1987/01/15 00:00,1987/01/15 00:01,['1987/01/15 00:00'],"['1987/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1987 Jan 15;47(2):579-85.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '88746-71-8 (Asta Z 7557)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)']",,,"['1 R23CA-42111-01/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R0-1 31618/PHS HHS/United States', 'R0-1 36725/PHS HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The sodium fluoride-sensitive isoenzyme was separated by isoelectric focusing on horizontal thin-layer polyacrylamide gels. The esterase isoenzyme was not detected in untreated or TPA-treated lymphoid, erythroid, or Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines, but was seen in leukemia cell lines of monocytic origin. TPA induced the new expression of this marker isoenzyme in two leukemia cell lines of promyelocytic and erythroid origin that are known to differentiate along the monocytic-macrophage cell lineage; TPA stimulation increased the staining intensity of the band in monocytoid cell lines. This esterase isoenzyme was found in 92% of the cases classified morphologically as acute myelomonocytic or monocytic leukemia, but only in 3% of the non-monocytic acute myeloid leukemias. All lymphoid or erythroid leukemias or lymphomas were negative. Treatment with TPA of AML and CML cells, which commonly differentiate to monocyte/macrophage-like cells, showed de novo the monocyte-specific isoenzyme. It is concluded that this isoenzyme is a characteristic marker for monocytic leukemia cells and will be a useful tool for the discriminatory identification of the monocytic element in normal and leukemic cells.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gaedicke, G', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Gaedicke G', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/*analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme Activation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Leukemia/*enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/enzymology', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology', 'Monocytes/*enzymology', 'Naphthol AS D Esterase/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1987 Jan 1;59(1):77-82. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19870101)59:1<77::aid-cncr2820590118>3.0.co;2-a.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.1.- (Naphthol AS D Esterase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19870101)59:1<77::aid-cncr2820590118>3.0.co;2-a [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Preclearing of radiolabeled cell lysates with MoAb specific for HLA-DQ and -DP molecules demonstrated that the complexity of the HLA-DR pattern is not the result of antibody cross-reactivity with alpha and beta chains from other class II products. Immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that two beta chain bands are observed with each of the parental HLA-DR molecules on the ALL but not the B-lymphoblastoid cell line from an HLA-DR3,7-positive individual. We conclude that the HLA-DR molecules expressed on ALL and B-lymphoblastoid cell lines from the same individual can differ chemically. Neuraminidase treatment reduced these electrophoretic differences, indicating that these molecules differ in their sialic acid content.

Breakpoints were variable but tended to cluster in either the proximal or the terminal 7q region, depending on the immunophenotype of the cells. The 7q32-q36 region, the locus of the T cell receptor beta-chain gene, was the site of breakpoints in four of 31 cases of T cell ALL but was not involved in any of the 166 cases originating from B cell precursors (P less than .0004). In three of the four T cell cases it was possible to identify the chromosomal segment that had been translocated to the 7q32-q36 region: 1p32, 2p21, and 6p21. The 1p32 and 6p21 bands are particularly interesting, as they contain the sites of two known protooncogenes, c-L-myc and hpim, respectively. Our findings suggest that the locus of the beta-chain gene of the T cell receptor is a preferential site for certain chromosomal rearrangements in leukemic T lymphoblasts, analogous to the T cell receptor alpha-chain gene on human chromosome 14. Translocation of proto-oncogenes to a site near the beta-chain regulatory sequences provides a potential mechanism for oncogene activation.","['Raimondi, S C', 'Pui, C H', 'Behm, F G', 'Williams, D L']","['Raimondi SC', 'Pui CH', 'Behm FG', 'Williams DL']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Chromosome Banding', 'Chromosome Mapping', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1987 Jan;69(1):131-4.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",['S0006-4971(20)76554-7 [pii]'],,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

However, after induction with DMSO or 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3, HL60 cells showed dose-dependent increases in proliferation with crude and purified CSFs. CSF responses and macrophage differentiation were induced in KG1 cells by treatment with tetradecanoylphorbol-acetate (TPA). When cells were exposed to inducing agents for varying periods, washed and exposed to CSF, proliferative responses were related to time of exposure. Cells exposed for 1-4 d showed post-induction CSF-induced proliferation, but cells induced for 5-6 d were inhibited by CSF. Induction of CSF response appeared linked to differentiation, since KG1 cells differentiated with TPA and developed CSF-induced proliferative responses, but showed no differentiation or CSF induced proliferation after treatment with vitamin D3. When HL60 cells were continuously exposed to DMSO or vitamin D3, overall cell production was increased by placenta conditioned medium, but cultures still became senescent and died after several weeks. Cells continuously cultured with DMSO were predominantly macrophages, indicating lineages of DMSO-induced differentiation were modified by continuous culture or the presence of CSF. After treatment with chemical inducers, proliferation of myeloid leukaemia lines is stimulated by CSF, providing a model for post-deterministic regulation of normal and malignant myeloid cell production.","['Rhyner, K', 'Taetle, R']","['Rhyner K', 'Taetle R']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Calcitriol/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1986 Nov;64(3):601-12. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb02216.x.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb02216.x [doi]'],,"['CA32094/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32100/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Southern blot analyses of seven human T-cell tumor lines and normal human T-lymphocyte clones revealed that most of these T-cell lines rearrange their Ti beta genes differently. The T-cell tumor line HPB-MLT rearranges and transcribes both of its Ti beta genes. Cloning and sequencing of the Ti beta cDNAs corresponding to these rearrangements revealed that one of the rearranged Ti beta genes is defective, while the other is functional and corresponds to the Ti beta protein expressed on the surface of these cells. Thus, this cell line displays a pattern of allelic exclusion of Ti beta gene expression. A comparison of four C beta 2-containing Ti beta cDNAs from three different cell lines revealed that three of the four utilize the same J beta 2.5 gene segment joined to different D beta and V beta genes, suggesting that there may be preferential use of this J gene during J beta 2 rearrangements. Hybridization analyses with probes for the alpha and beta genes of the T-cell receptor and the T-cell-specific T gamma gene revealed that HPB-MLT cells appear to express approximately equivalent amounts of RNA corresponding to each of the rearranged Ti alpha and Ti beta genes.

Analysis by alkaline sucrose gradients and alkaline elution indicated that 3H-DNA that had been labeled for 15 min distributed into progressively smaller DNA fragment sizes in a drug concentration-dependent manner from 0 microM to 50 microM piritrexim. This phenomenon was observed regardless of the labeled nucleotide precursor employed for detection of newly synthesized DNA [( 3H]deoxyuridine, [3H]deoxyadenosine, or [3H]deoxycytidine). In contrast, formaldehyde denaturation and sedimentation of DNA in neutral denaturing sucrose gradients released only 3-4% of the newly synthesized DNA as 3S-6S fragments (80-200 nucleotides), whereas the remaining population of newly synthesized DNA pelleted to the bottom of the tube. Failure to detect DNA fragmentation under neutral conditions to the extent observed under alkaline conditions indicated the presence of apurinic and apyrimidinic sites in DNA--lesions which would be expected in DNA undergoing excision-repair of misincorporated dUMP. Cytotoxicity resulting from dUMP misincorporation was consistent with the enhanced toxicity of piritrexim which was observed when HL-60 cells or MOLT-4 cells were exposed concurrently to exogenous deoxyuridine. Deoxyuridine-enhanced toxicity was demonstrated to be concentration dependent for both cell lines when piritrexim concentrations were marginally toxic. The cytotoxic effect of dUMP misincorporation was further substantiated by the observation that MOLT-4 cells treated with 0.5 microM piritrexim alone eventually developed resistance to the drug, whereas treatment with both piritrexim and 10 microM deoxyuridine prevented the selection of piritrexim-resistant cells.","['Richards, R G', 'Brown, O E', 'Gillison, M L', 'Sedwick, W D']","['Richards RG', 'Brown OE', 'Gillison ML', 'Sedwick WD']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Pharmacol,Molecular pharmacology,0035623,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Cell Line', '*DNA Damage', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Deoxyribonucleosides/metabolism', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Pyrimidines/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/drug effects', 'Tritium']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Pharmacol. 1986 Dec;30(6):651-8.,"['0 (Deoxyribonucleosides)', '0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Pyrimidines)', '10028-17-8 (Tritium)', 'MK2A783ZUT (piritrexim)']",,,"['R01-CA-31110/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA-09111/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-CA-09307/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Treatment commenced with a fractionated schedule of intravenous (IV) cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2 every 12 hours for six doses) followed immediately by Adriamycin (50 mg/m2) and vincristine (1.5 mg/m2) with combined intrathecal (IT) methotrexate and cytarabine. Predictably, this treatment produced virtually complete disappearance of all tumor and profound myelosuppression. Immediately on hematologic recovery, IV high-dose methotrexate (1,000 mg/m2 over 24 hours) followed by IV cytarabine (400 mg/m2 over the next 48 hours) was administered with leucovorin rescue and repeated IT treatments. The treatment sequence described above is repeated four times, with the dose of cytarabine doubled in succeeding courses, up to 3,200 mg/m2. The entire planned therapy required approximately 24 weeks. Since 1981, we treated a total of 29 children with this approach, 19 of whom had massive unresectable intraabdominal tumor. According to initial extent of disease, 17 were classified as stage III, four as stage IV non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and eight as B cell ALL. Eight of the 12 patients with stage IV NHL or B cell ALL had initial involvement of the CNS. Twenty-seven of 29 patients (93%) attained a complete remission. Fourteen of 17 stage III NHL patients remain disease free, for periods ranging from 3+ months to 4 1/2+ years. The actuarial estimate of the proportion of stage III patients remaining disease free at 2 years is 81%. Results in patients with initial involvement of the CNS and/or marrow are much less favorable, with only two of ten patients who attained remission apparently being cured. In addition to stage, the initial serum lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) level emerged as a prognostic indicator, higher levels (over 1,000 IU/L) being associated with the worst prognosis (P less than .05). Major toxicity consisted of severe hematopoietic suppression and febrile episodes associated with neutropenia. We conclude that this treatment is highly effective for advanced-stage Burkitt's tumors in children free of initial CNS involvement.","['Murphy, S B', 'Bowman, W P', 'Abromowitch, M', 'Mirro, J', 'Ochs, J', 'Rivera, G', 'Pui, C H', 'Fairclough, D', 'Berard, C W']","['Murphy SB', 'Bowman WP', 'Abromowitch M', 'Mirro J', 'Ochs J', 'Rivera G', 'Pui CH', 'Fairclough D', 'Berard CW']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Actuarial Analysis', 'Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Administration Schedule', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Staging']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1986 Dec;4(12):1732-9. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1986.4.12.1732.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['10.1200/JCO.1986.4.12.1732 [doi]'],,['CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

We examined the specificity of CTL generated against MuLV-induced tumors and identified two distinct patterns of reactivity. The first follows the traditional pattern of FMR vs GCSA reactivity as assessed on a panel of established MuLV-induced lymphomas. However, CTL exhibiting this pattern of reactivity are incapable of lysing MuLV-infected fibroblasts. CTL exhibiting the second pattern of reactivity are capable of lysing MuLV-induced lymphomas as well as MuLV-infected fibroblasts. In addition, these CTL exhibit extensive cross-reactivity between lymphomas and fibroblasts infected by both groups of MuLV. Our results suggest that CTL exhibiting the traditional FMR vs GCSA pattern of reactivity are directed against a tumor-associated antigen and not against virus-encoded antigens, and that CTL directed against MuLV-encoded antigens demonstrate extensive cross-reactivity, including the ability to lyse AKV-infected cells.","['Flyer, D C', 'Burakoff, S J', 'Faller, D V']","['Flyer DC', 'Burakoff SJ', 'Faller DV']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['AKR murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Viral/*immunology', 'Cross Reactions', 'Female', 'Fibroblasts/immunology', 'Friend murine leukemia virus/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*immunology', 'Rauscher Virus/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology']",1986/12/15 00:00,1986/12/15 00:01,['1986/12/15 00:00'],"['1986/12/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Dec 15;137(12):3968-72.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Viral)']",,,"['AI17258/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA07219/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'RR005526/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

Although antigenic modulation provides a means by which cells can escape antibody-mediated immune destruction, the physiologic significance and frequency of this phenomenon are both poorly understood. To begin to address these issues, we identified and characterized surface antigens on the malignant B cell line Laz 221 established from a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Indirect immunofluorescence analysis with the use of 26 hematopoietic cell populations and immune precipitation studies with the use of iodinated ALL cells indicate that 163 monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) identify 22 different proteins on this cell line, including at least six previously described surface molecules. Seven of these antigens are expressed by all nucleated cells examined, whereas only the mu chain of immunoglobulin is B cell specific. Incubation of specific MoAb with cultures of Laz 221 cells at 37 degrees C reduces or modulates surface expression of five of these 22 antigens (p45, immunoglobulin mu chain, transferrin receptor, common ALL antigen (CD10), and p105). Studies that made use of multiple MoAb specific for the same antigen suggest that the capacity for antigenic modulation is an intrinsic property of individual antigens. These studies also suggest that the murine immune response to shared human antigens varies from one immunizing cell population to another. For example, three of the antigens present on Laz 221 cells were only identified by MoAb raised to the Burkitt's cell line Ramos and vice-versa. Only one of these six shared antigens is present in greater amounts on the immunogenic cell population. Immunogenicity of individual human antigens in the mouse may be a function of their cell surface environment.","['Pesando, J M', 'Hoffman, P', 'Abed, M']","['Pesando JM', 'Hoffman P', 'Abed M']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*immunology', 'Antibodies, Neoplasm/immunology', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Endocytosis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Membrane Proteins/immunology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neoplasm Proteins/immunology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Dec 1;137(11):3689-95.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antibodies, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Membrane Proteins)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)']",,,"['CA 15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 34206/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

We evaluated the therapeutic potential of such lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells in vivo and high-dose II 2 in vivo against disseminated murine leukemia. To quantitate the potential anti-leukemia effect of LAK cells in vivo, B6 mice were injected i.p. with graded doses of FBL-3 leukemia cells followed by LAK cells. In this Winn-type assay, 1 X 10(7) LAK cells were able to prevent the outgrowth of 1 X 10(2) FBL-3 cells in only 50% of mice and did not prevent the outgrowth of 1 X 10(6) tumor cells. Thus LAK cells, highly cytolytic to FBL-3 in vitro, mediated only a limited anti-tumor effect when applied directly to leukemia cells in vivo. LAK cells used as an adjunct to chemotherapy induced a small but non-curative effect against FBL-3, however. In this circumstance, LAK cells were markedly less effective than were immune spleen cells from mice previously sensitized to FBL-3. To test the anti-leukemia effect of high-dose IL 2 in vivo, B6 mice were inoculated with 5 X 10(6) FBL-3 cells followed by repeated doses of IL 2 at dose levels shown to induce LAK in vivo. ""LAK-inducing"" IL 2 doses on days 5 to 9 after FBL-3 inoculation, when tumor was disseminated, cured 50% of the mice. Treatment on days 5 to 9 was far more effective than on days 0 to 4, implying that the evolution of a host-tumor interaction was essential for the therapeutic effect of IL 2. Mice cured of FBL-3 by high-dose IL 2 were found to be immune to FBL-3, suggesting that tumor eradication resulted from a collaboration between LAK activity and tumor-specific immunity.","['Thompson, J A', 'Peace, D J', 'Klarnet, J P', 'Kern, D E', 'Greenberg, P D', 'Cheever, M A']","['Thompson JA', 'Peace DJ', 'Klarnet JP', 'Kern DE', 'Greenberg PD', 'Cheever MA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Immunotherapy', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/*administration & dosage', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymph Nodes/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Spleen/immunology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Dec 1;137(11):3675-80.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,"['CA 01030/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

A newly developed variant of the WEHI-3B D+ line, named WEHI-3B D+ G, which was responsive to G-CSF but not to PMA, was also differentiated to granulocytes by 1,25-(OH)2 D3. Although vitamin D3 has been reported to induce macrophage differentiation in responsive tumor cells, this is the first demonstration that 1,25-(OH)2 D3 can induce granulocyte differentiation. In both differentiation pathways, cessation of cellular proliferation accompanies changes in morphologic and cytochemical properties of the cells. This suggests that leukemic cell lines unresponsive to differentiation agents acting at the cell surface retain their ability to differentiate in response to agents that do not act via the plasma membrane such as 1,25-(OH)2 D3, which has cytosolic/nuclear receptors. Vitamin D3 could act through different cellular pathways inducing differentiation or by bypassing only the first step of a common differentiation cascade used by agents with cell surface receptors such as CSF. These results suggest that low doses of 1,25-(OH)2 D3 may be useful in combination with hemopoietic growth factors (CSFs) as therapeutic agent to induce leukemic cell differentiation in vivo.","['Bettens, F', 'Schlick, E', 'Farrar, W', 'Ruscetti, F']","['Bettens F', 'Schlick E', 'Farrar W', 'Ruscetti F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Granulocytes/cytology', 'Histocytochemistry', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1986 Dec;129(3):295-302. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041290305.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['10.1002/jcp.1041290305 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric analysis of the cell cycle by a double staining method using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-bromodeoxyuridine and propidium iodide revealed that 1 alpha,25(OH2D3 increased the proportion and the number of cells accumulating in the G0-G1 phase and decreased those in the S phase. The phenotype of the surface antigens of the cells was of the T-cell lineage, but the cells became positive in macrophage-associated surface markers (Mac-1 and Ia) after treatment with 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3. The vitamin induced phagocytic activity, appearance of Fc receptors, nitroblue tetrazolium-reducing activity, and nonspecific esterase activity, indicating that the vitamin induces the cells to differentiate into macrophages. Furthermore, 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 inhibited interleukin-3 production by the cells in a time- and dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 inhibits proliferation of WEHI-3 cells by blocking transition of the cells from the G0-G1 to the S phase, resulting in induction of the G0-G1-arrested cells to differentiate into macrophages. The relation between the suppression by 1 alpha,25(OH)2D3 of cell growth and interleukin-3 production remains to be elucidated in the future.","['Abe, J', 'Moriya, Y', 'Saito, M', 'Sugawara, Y', 'Suda, T', 'Nishii, Y']","['Abe J', 'Moriya Y', 'Saito M', 'Sugawara Y', 'Suda T', 'Nishii Y']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/analysis', 'Interleukin-3/*biosynthesis', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/immunology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Mice']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Dec;46(12 Pt 1):6316-21.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)']",,,,,,,,,

DIF was highly purified from HUT-102-conditioned media by means of diethylaminoethanol (DEAE)-chromatography, gel chromatography, and high-resolution, ion-exchange chromatography on a MonoQ column and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). In addition to inducing differentiation of wild-type HL-60 cells, resulting in secondary inhibition of growth, DIF, at a tenfold lower concentration, inhibited the growth of some clones of the monoblastic U-937 cell line as well as that of subclones of HL-60. The latter effect was most likely a primary growth inhibition and not secondary to differentiation; 50% inhibition of clonogenic growth in agar was seen at approximately 1.0 pmol/L of DIF. In addition, the clonogenic growth of fresh leukemia cells from 10 of 12 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was inhibited with 50% inhibition at approximately 10 pmol/L of DIF. The growth of normal granulocyte-macrophage colonies was inhibited at a similar concentration, whereas early erythroid colonies were much more resistant. DIF and interferon-gamma (gamma-IFN) were shown to be separate molecules inasmuch as a neutralizing antibody for gamma-IFN did not abolish the DIF effect. The differentiation effect on wild-type HL-60 and the proliferation inhibitory effect on leukemic and normal myeloid cells cochromatographed through all purification steps suggest that both activities are exhibited by identical polypeptides. DIF may have a role in regulating normal hemopoiesis. The growth inhibitory effect of DIF and the ability to induce differentiation of some leukemia cells may suggest a clinical utility in the treatment of leukemia.","['Gullberg, U', 'Nilsson, E', 'Sarngadharan, M G', 'Olsson, I']","['Gullberg U', 'Nilsson E', 'Sarngadharan MG', 'Olsson I']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythropoiesis/drug effects', 'Glycoproteins/*pharmacology', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Hematopoiesis/*drug effects', 'Humans', '*Interleukin-6', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology', 'Lymphokines/isolation & purification/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1986/12/01 00:00,1986/12/01 00:01,['1986/12/01 00:00'],"['1986/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Dec;68(6):1333-8.,"['0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (LIF protein, human)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lymphokines)']",['S0006-4971(20)85960-6 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV differs from wild-type M-MuLV by the addition of enhancer sequences from polyomavirus in the long terminal repeat. Previous experiments indicated that Mo+PyF101 establishes infection in animals, even though it does not induce disease. In vivo infection studies with particular attention to the thymus were performed, since the thymus is the target organ for M-MuLV leukemogenesis. Mice inoculated at birth with wild-type M-MuLV developed maximal levels of thymic infection by 2 to 3 weeks. Animals inoculated with Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV showed considerably less thymic infection at early times (2 to 4 weeks); nevertheless, by 5 to 6 weeks infection equivalent to wild-type M-MuLV-inoculated animals developed. Therefore the nonpathogenicity of Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV did not simply reflect a lack of thymotropism. Furthermore, thymic infection by itself may not be sufficient to induce leukemia. The relative deficit of Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV thymic infection at early versus late times did not reflect a change in the nature of the cells in the thymus, since in vitro infection of primary thymocytes from 2- and 6-week-old animals was equally efficient. One possible explanation is that infected thymocytes normally arise from progenitor cells which were infected in the bone marrow or spleen, and the cells restricted for Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV are located in those organs. Comparison of wild-type and Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV also allowed identification of important preleukemic changes in the thymus of wild-type M-MuLV-inoculated mice. Flow cytometry with monoclonal antibodies specific for thymocyte subpopulations was used. Staining of cells for Thy-1 or Thy-1.2 antigens indicated a shift toward low or negative cells. A concomitant increase in cells positive for antigen Pgp-1 was also observed. This is consistent with an increase in the relative frequency of immature blastlike cells. Importantly, thymuses from mice inoculated with Mo+PyF101 M-MuLV did not show these shifts in thymocyte subpopulations.","['Davis, B R', 'Chandy, K G', 'Brightman, B K', 'Gupta, S', 'Fan, H']","['Davis BR', 'Chandy KG', 'Brightman BK', 'Gupta S', 'Fan H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*microbiology/pathology', 'Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*pathogenicity', 'Preleukemia/microbiology/pathology', 'Spleen/microbiology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*microbiology/pathology', 'Thymus Gland/microbiology/pathology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Virol. 1986 Nov;60(2):423-30. doi: 10.1128/JVI.60.2.423-430.1986.,,['10.1128/JVI.60.2.423-430.1986 [doi]'],,"['AI20818/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA32455/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",PMC288909,,,,,

Antigenic modulation occurred rapidly in all cases, and persisted throughout the infusion period. Peak serum T101 levels for equivalent doses were somewhat higher, and persisted longer in CTCL, perhaps because of differences in the number of circulating target cells.

We have studied the cell cycle and biochemical effects of 2'-deoxyguanosine in human lymphoblasts using the PNP inhibitor 8-aminoguanosine. We show that cytostatic 2'-deoxyguanosine concentrations cause G1-phase arrest in PNP-inhibited T lymphoblasts, regardless of their hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase status. This effect is identical to that produced by 2'-deoxyadenosine in adenosine deaminase-inhibited T cells. 2'-Deoxyguanosine elevates both the 2'-deoxyguanosine-5'-triphosphate (dGTP) and 2'-deoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate (dATP) pools; subsequently pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotide pools are depleted. The time course of these biochemical changes indicates that the onset of G1-phase arrest is related to increase of the dATP rather than the dGTP pool. When dGTP elevation is dissociated from dATP elevation by coincubation with 2'-deoxycytidine, dGTP does not by itself interrupt transit from the G1 to the S phase. It is proposed that dATP can mediate both 2'-deoxyguanosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine toxicity in T lymphoblasts.","['Mann, G J', 'Fox, R M']","['Mann GJ', 'Fox RM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/cytology/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Cells, Cultured', 'DNA/analysis', 'Deoxyadenine Nucleotides/*pharmacology', 'Deoxyguanosine/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid', 'T-Lymphocytes/*cytology/drug effects']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1986 Nov;78(5):1261-9. doi: 10.1172/JCI112710.,"['0 (Deoxyadenine Nucleotides)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)', ""K8KCC8SH6N (2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate)""]",['10.1172/JCI112710 [doi]'],,,PMC423812,,,,,

We now provide definitive evidence that these transformed lines express features characteristic of mast cells. Although these lines have been maintained in some cases for more than a year in the absence of exogenous growth factors other than those present in fetal calf serum, colony formation could consistently after 2 months, and variably after 5 months, be shown to be increased several fold when pokeweed mitogen-stimulated spleen cell conditioned medium (CM) was added to the cultures. CM from the A-MuLV-transformed lines was then tested for its ability to stimulate hematopoietic colony formation by cells from both fetal and adult tissues. Four of four randomly selected cell lines produced factors that were active on erythropoietic, granulopoietic, and in some cases pluripotent progenitors. Removal of viral particles from the CM from one of the lines (27d1) by either heat inactivation or high-speed centrifugation did not alter the colony-stimulating activity detected. When CM from 27d1 cells was tested for its ability to stimulate the proliferation of interleukin 3 (IL3) granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent FDC-P1 cells, a positive result was obtained. This stimulatory activity was not reduced in the presence of neutralizing anti-IL 3 immunoglobulin (Ig), suggesting that the activity detected was GM-CSF and not IL 3. This was confirmed by the lack of expression of the IL 3 gene in 27d1 cells as determined by Northern analysis of 27d1 cell RNA. Furthermore, S1 analysis of mRNA from 27d1 cells as well as two other lines indicated that the GM-CSF gene in all three was transcriptionally active. Taken together, these data suggest that A-MuLV transformation of normal mast cells or their precursors under certain conditions commonly activates the production of GM-CSF.","['Chung, S W', 'Wong, P M', 'Shen-Ong, G', 'Ruscetti, S', 'Ishizaka, T', 'Eaves, C J']","['Chung SW', 'Wong PM', 'Shen-Ong G', 'Ruscetti S', 'Ishizaka T', 'Eaves CJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Abelson murine leukemia virus', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Division', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Culture Media', 'Growth Substances/analysis', 'Interleukin-3/analysis/genetics', 'Mast Cells/*metabolism', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/metabolism', 'Spleen/cytology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Nov;68(5):1074-81.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Interleukin-3)']",['S0006-4971(20)79436-X [pii]'],,['A1-10060/PHS HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The frequency of cows that were seropositive to BLV-glycoprotein antigen was 51%. Twenty-three per cent of the seropositive cows were lymphocytotic. At the herd level, relative resistance to BLV-dependent B-cell proliferation and lymphocytosis among seropositive cows was associated with bovine lymphocyte antigen (BoLA)-DA7, whereas susceptibility was associated with BoLA-DA12.3. These associations were also confirmed at the family level, where BoLA phenotypes were used as haplotypic markers. Among the offspring of one BoLA-heterozygous sire (n = 33), resistance segregated with the DA7 haplotype and susceptibility with the DA12.3 haplotype. In this sire group, maternal transmission of the BoLA-w8 allele was associated with increased susceptibility to B-cell proliferation and lymphocytosis in w8/DA12.3 heterozygotes. These data provide the first evidence that subclinical progression of BLV infection is under the control of the BoLA complex, and suggest that the BoLA system can be used to select for resistance to B-cell proliferation and the development of lymphocytosis in BLV-infected herds.","['Lewin, H A', 'Bernoco, D']","['Lewin HA', 'Bernoco D']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Anim Genet,Animal genetics,8605704,IM,"['Alleles', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Cattle', 'Cattle Diseases/genetics/immunology/*microbiology', 'Disease Susceptibility', '*Genetic Linkage', 'Heterozygote', 'Immunity, Innate', 'Leukemia/genetics/immunology/*veterinary', '*Major Histocompatibility Complex']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Anim Genet. 1986;17(3):197-207. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2052.1986.tb03191.x.,,['10.1111/j.1365-2052.1986.tb03191.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

It is suggested that careful prospective studies are needed to identify the cause of the problems experienced by the leukemic children and adolescents so that programs may be developed to prevent their emergence.","['Sawyer, M', 'Crettenden, A', 'Toogood, I']","['Sawyer M', 'Crettenden A', 'Toogood I']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"['*Adaptation, Psychological', '*Adolescent', '*Child', 'Child Behavior', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', '*Family', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*psychology/therapy', 'Male', 'Sibling Relations', 'Stress, Psychological']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1986 Fall;8(3):200-7. doi: 10.1097/00043426-198623000-00005.,,['10.1097/00043426-198623000-00005 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

At the ultrastructural analysis the leukemic cell showed rather immature features, and the immunologic phenotype (absence of detectable cytoplasmic Ig, and expression only of the DR, B2 and IgD lambda molecules on the surface membrane) proved its intermediate level of maturity, its monoclonality and relative rarity. The patient presented a complex immunologic deficiency, revealed not only by the monoclonality of the B lymphocytes and their low degree of maturity, but also by the almost total absence of T helper lymphocytes, by the high reduction in NK activity, by the very scarce proliferative response to the polyclonal mitogens PHA, ConA and PWM, and by a complete anergy to the skin test of delayed reactivity. The search for antibodies against the viruses EBV, CMV, HTLV-I and HTLV-III in the serum was negative. At the HLA typing, the patient was DR5, as are most classical KS and/or B-CLL patients. The data are discussed in relation to documented non-casual association between B-CLL and KS.

Partial to complete regression of splenomegaly occurred in 9 patients. Pre-existing anaemia of production failure type improved in 6 patients and as a result the haemoglobin rose to normal or near normal levels. SI caused the loss of T-, B- and Null-lymphocytes, but the loss of B-lymphocytes predominated. CLL/PLL became quiescent for long periods in 9 patients (CLL = 8; PLL = 1) but remained progressive in the other 9, all CLL. SI had no demonstrable effects on TLC, splenomegaly or anaemia in the 3 remaining patients (2 CLL, 1 PLL). The treatment was well tolerated by all, and side effects were almost absent. Transient reduction of neutrophils and platelets occurred commonly. No patient with initially normal neutrophil and platelet counts developed irreversible neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.

Cytogenetic studies revealed a translocation t(10;19) (p12; q13) in all the metaphases analyzed. This case demonstrates that the study of neoplastic cells with a battery of monoclonal antibodies may disclose the existence of a hitherto unrecognised lymphoid cell population with atypical expression of B- and T-cell antigens.

While the rate of synthesis of the precursor of the core proteins, Pr65gag, was not affected in the starved cells, its proteolytic processing was blocked. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that glutamine was required during the synthesis of Pr65gag to facilitate its subsequent processing. In addition, the synthesis of Pr200gag-pol, the precursor of the protease, reverse transcriptase and endonuclease, was inhibited in the glutamine-starved cells. Starvation for other essential amino acids such as tyrosine and isoleucine affected neither the synthesis nor the processing of the virus proteins. These results suggest that the readthrough mechanism which enables synthesis of the Pr200gag-pol polyprotein is modulated in the chronically infected cells by glutamine levels.

The TsF was affinity purified from ascites over an immunoadsorbent column containing a monoclonal antibody (B16G) that has specificity for the TsF molecule, or over columns containing membrane extracts of the P815 mastocytoma (the tumor for which A10 is specific). The specificity control was BW5147 (the fusion partner for A10) membrane extracts treated in the same way as A10. DBA/2 mice were immunized with the affinity-purified material or PBS and were subsequently challenged with either the P815 tumor or the L1210 DBA/2 thymoma. When mice were immunized with material affinity purified over B16G, eluted material from both A10 ascites and BW5147 membrane extracts enhanced resistance to both P815 and L1210 challenge, indicating that B16G was binding immunogenic material derived from both preparations, which exerted a tumor-protective effect. However, when a P815 affinity column was used, protective material was eluted only from A10 ascites, and this bestowed resistance to both P815 and L1210. When irradiated whole cells were used as immunogens, only A10 cells stimulated anti-tumor immunity, and this appeared to be directed specifically to the P815 tumor. The implications of these findings in terms of the potential for immune modulation with anti-suppressor therapy, and the specificity of the B16G monoclonal, are discussed. The demonstration of B16G binding material (TsF) in the membranes (but not the ascites) of the BW5147 line is also of significance to investigators using BW5147 fused suppressor hybridomas.","['Steele, J K', 'Singhai, R', 'Stammers, A T', 'Levy, J G']","['Steele JK', 'Singhai R', 'Stammers AT', 'Levy JG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Animals', 'Hybridomas', 'Immune Tolerance', 'Immunization', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/prevention & control', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology/*prevention & control', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Suppressor Factors, Immunologic/*immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Nov 1;137(9):3025-30.,"['0 (Suppressor Factors, Immunologic)']",,,,,,,,,

In 4 hr 51Cr release assays, seven of seven in vivo grown human oncogene transfected NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were lysed by murine LAK effectors, whereas six of seven were lysed by human LAK effectors. There was no difference in susceptibility to lysis between cells transfected with the N-ras oncogene, the position 61 activated c-Ha-ras oncogene, or the position 12 activated c-Ha-ras oncogene. Cultured NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, as well as in vitro and in vivo grown NIH 3T3 tertiary transfectants were resistant to lysis by murine NK effectors and were relatively resistant (4/6 were not lysed) to lysis by human NK effectors. We conclude that human oncogene-transfected tumors are susceptible to lysis by both murine and human LAK cells while being relatively resistant to lysis by murine and human NK cells. Different oncogenes or the same oncogene activated by different point mutations do not specifically determine susceptibility to lysis by LAK or NK.

Stimulation by fMet-Leu-Phe within seconds transiently elevates 1,4,5-IP3 to peak values averaging 8-fold basal levels, and leads to a concomitant rise in [Ca2+]i and to degranulation. These responses are followed by a slower and more sustained rise in 1,3,4-IP3. Alterations in [Ca2+]i modulate differentially the generation of the two IP3 isomers. At [Ca2+]i lower than 30 nM, no IP3 is generated upon fMet-Leu-Phe stimulation. Working at normal resting [Ca2+]i, but preventing the fMet-Leu-Phe induced transient rise in [Ca2+]i (by prior depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores and working in calcium-free medium) the fMet-Leu-Phe stimulation of 1,3,4-IP3 levels is attenuated, whereas the response of 1,4,5-IP3 is not significantly altered. Maintained elevation of [Ca2+]i to micromolar levels with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin generates enhanced 1,3,4-IP3 levels in the absence of fMet-Leu-Phe, whereas the fMet-Leu-Phe stimulation of 1,4,5-IP3 generation is markedly inhibited. Pertussis toxin selectively abolishes the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced IP3 production, whereas ionomycin stimulation of 1,3,4-IP3 generation is unaffected. These findings indicate that in intact cells: receptor-triggered phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate phosphodiesterase activation has a minimal Ca2+ requirement, but does not depend on a previous or concomitant rise in [Ca2+]i; Ca2+ elevations above micromolar levels decrease the fMet-Leu-Phe-induced generation of 1,4,5-IP3; and 1,3,4-IP3 generation is not directly linked to receptor activation and appears to result both from increased [Ca2+]i and 1,4,5-IP3 levels.","['Lew, P D', 'Monod, A', 'Krause, K H', 'Waldvogel, F A', 'Biden, T J', 'Schlegel, W']","['Lew PD', 'Monod A', 'Krause KH', 'Waldvogel FA', 'Biden TJ', 'Schlegel W']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Ethers/pharmacology', 'Exocytosis/drug effects', 'Hexosaminidases/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate', 'Inositol Phosphates/*biosynthesis', 'Ionomycin', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine/pharmacology', 'Pertussis Toxin', 'Receptors, Formyl Peptide', 'Receptors, Immunologic/*metabolism', 'Sugar Phosphates/*biosynthesis', 'Virulence Factors, Bordetella/pharmacology']",1986/10/05 00:00,1986/10/05 00:01,['1986/10/05 00:00'],"['1986/10/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/05 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/05 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1986 Oct 5;261(28):13121-7.,"['0 (Ethers)', '0 (Inositol Phosphates)', '0 (Receptors, Formyl Peptide)', '0 (Receptors, Immunologic)', '0 (Sugar Phosphates)', '0 (Virulence Factors, Bordetella)', '56092-81-0 (Ionomycin)', '59880-97-6 (N-Formylmethionine Leucyl-Phenylalanine)', '85166-31-0 (Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate)', 'EC 2.4.2.31 (Pertussis Toxin)', 'EC 3.2.1.- (Hexosaminidases)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",['S0021-9258(18)69279-8 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

Furthermore, responder cells which had been inhibited by LMS in a primary MLC, washed, and restimulated were able to express CTL activity indicating that the suppression by LMS is reversible.

We demonstrated that effector cells (EC), after treatment with K562 for 4 hr, lost greater than 90% of their original lytic activity. In this investigation, we examined whether this functional loss of NK cell activity represented an irreversible event in the NK lytic mechanism. Initial studies focused on the ability of K562-inactivated EC (ECi), which had been separated from their TC, to recover cytolytic activity following an 18-hr incubation. Our results indicated that ECi recovered 28% of their lytic activity in complete medium (CM) alone, 64% in CM containing interferon-beta (IFN-beta), and 91% in CM supplemented with interleukin 2 (IL-2). Analysis of the data revealed, however, that neither IFN-beta nor IL-2 simply boosted the lytic capacity of NK cells which initially escaped inactivation, but also, each cytokine affected the lytic capabilities of EC that were either truly inactivated by K562 or precursor NK (pre-NK) cells. Thus, to evaluate further the basis of IFN-beta and IL-2-induced ECi augmentation, we first treated the EC with IFN-beta or IL-2 prior to their interaction with K562 so that pre-NK cell subsets would be promoted to fully competent NK cells. Both pretreated EC preparations, after interacting with K562 for 4 hr, lost greater than 90% of their original lytic activities. NK inactivation did not result from cell death nor reflect alterations in conjugate formation or the percentages of Leu-7- and Leu-11-positive EC. IL-2-pretreated ECi, as did ECi, regained some lytic activity after incubation in CM alone, but recovered significantly more activity in CM containing IFN-beta or IL-2. In contrast to the restimulation profiles obtained for ECi and IL-2-pretreated ECi, IFN-pretreated ECi regained lytic function after incubation with IL-2, but not appreciably with IFN-beta or in CM alone. Overall, these findings suggest that EC, either untreated or pretreated with IFN-beta or IL-2, significantly lose their lytic capabilities following interaction with K562 while retaining their ability to bind to the TC; IFN-beta acts predominantly on pre-NK cells, but not on ECi; and IL-2 appears to play an important role in restoring lytic potential to functionally inactive NK cells.","['Abrams, S I', 'Brahmi, Z']","['Abrams SI', 'Brahmi Z']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*immunology']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1986 Sep;101(2):558-70. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(86)90166-8.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']","['0008-8749(86)90166-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(86)90166-8 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The majority of the clones were highly tumorigenic (tum+) in normal syngeneic mice, as was the parent L1210. The rest were nontumorigenic (tum-) in such mice; these clones, however, were tumorigenic in host mice that had been immunosuppressed by irradiation with 450 rads. Moreover, these tum- variants were shown to have an ability to elicit, in syngeneic mice, strong host resistance specifically directed against challenge with the parent L1210 and tum+ cloned cells and an ability to generate an in vitro primary syngeneic cytotoxic T-cell response against L1210 clones, indicating an enhanced immunogenicity in tum- variants. The expression of TAA by tumor clones was defined by determining the reactivity of monoclonal antibody, raised in syngeneic mice against an immunogenic L1210 subline, L1210/GZL. Marked clonal variation in the expression of monoclonal antibody-defined TAA was demonstrated, while no significant variation was seen in the H-2Dd expression. There was an inverse relationship between the TAA expression and the tumorigenicity. Furthermore, the enhanced expression of the TAA and the increased immunogenicity was associated with the I-Ad expression on the tum- variants. The unique characteristics of the tumor variants were very stable and heritable although occasional revertant phenotypes were detected on some clones. The results suggest that the tumor variants bearing distinct immunological properties exist in the parent L1210 line and carry a potential to modulate host immune responses directed against tumor cells.","['Fuji, H', 'Iribe, H']","['Fuji H', 'Iribe H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Clone Cells/immunology/pathology', 'Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/*immunology', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'Immunization', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia L1210/immunology/*pathology', 'Mice', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1986/11/01 00:00,1986/11/01 00:01,['1986/11/01 00:00'],"['1986/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Nov;46(11):5541-7.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Histocompatibility Antigens Class II)']",,,['CA26479/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients and normal donors were cultured for five days, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks with medium containing 2,500 units of recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2) per mL, and their cytotoxicity was assayed by a five-hour 51Cr-release test. Of primary tumors isolated from patients with acute nonlymphoblastic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, tumors of 37 out of 40 patients tested were shown to be susceptible to normal donors' LAK, and tumors of 18 of 20 patients tested were shown to be susceptible to autologous LAK. LAK cultured for longer periods showed a tendency to have lower cytotoxicity. LAK had also low, but significant, levels of cytotoxicity for nonmalignant target cells. Because PBMC expanded in IL-2-containing medium consisted mainly of OKT3-positive pan T cells, OKT8-positive suppressor/cytotoxic cells, and Leu-11-positive natural killer (NK) cells, and treatment with OKT3 and Leu-11 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) reduced LAK activity for autologous and allogeneic tumor cells, both T and NK cells appeared to be effector cells for LAK activity. Mechanisms of target-cell recognition in the LAK system seem to be different from those in alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) based on the results that, while cytotoxicity of alloreactive CTL was inhibited by the treatment of effector cells with mAb, OKT3, and OKT8, and by the treatment of target cells with a mAb that reacts with HLA class I antigen, LAK activity was not inhibited by the above treatment. When chromosomes of IL-2-expanded PBMC in nine patients and two normal individuals were analyzed, PBMC from one patient showed chromosomes of clonal abnormalities, and PBMC from five donors showed those of nonclonal abnormalities.","['Oshimi, K', 'Oshimi, Y', 'Akutsu, M', 'Takei, Y', 'Saito, H', 'Okada, M', 'Mizoguchi, H']","['Oshimi K', 'Oshimi Y', 'Akutsu M', 'Takei Y', 'Saito H', 'Okada M', 'Mizoguchi H']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chromosome Aberrations', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/*drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Interleukin-2/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1986/10/01 00:00,1986/10/01 00:01,['1986/10/01 00:00'],"['1986/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Oct;68(4):938-48.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",['S0006-4971(20)68984-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

Katoh, Y. Yoshinaka, and R.B. Luftig, 1986, Virus Res., in press). In order to clarify the mechanism by which this decrease in virus production occurs, we analyzed the kinetics of gag and env coded protein synthesis in M-MuLV infected, cerulenin-treated cells by immunoprecipitation with monospecific antisera to p30, p12, p10, gp70, and p15(E). We found that in pulse (15 min-2 hr)-chase (0-4 hr) experiments the cleavage of not only Pr65gag to p30 and other gag coded proteins but Pr80env to gp70 and Pr15(E) as well, was greatly reduced by cerulenin treatment. Further, since the total amount of label in the Pr65gag and Pr80env bands remained about the same or was slightly decreased in 2-hr pulsed, cerulenin-treated cells, this suggests that cerulenin decreases virus production, in part, by inhibiting the cleavage of both precursor gag and env coded polyproteins during virus assembly and budding at the cell membrane. We also observed that at longer chase periods (4 hr), the effect of cerulenin could be partially overriden in that minor amounts of cleaved gag and env coded polyproteins were produced and assembled into virion particles. However, these particles contained abnormally large amounts of the uncleaved precursor Pr65gag, suggesting that maturation was incomplete. The above results suggest two independent, but not exclusive, possible mechanisms of cerulenin action to block M-MuLV production, viz. cerulenin decreases the pool of fatty acids, thereby inhibiting fatty acid acylation of Pr65gag, as well as Pr80env, and thus preventing the interaction between gag (the p15 antigenic determinant on Pr65gag) and env [the p15(E) antigenic determinant of Pr15(E)] coded gene products at the cell membrane needed for efficient virus assembly (M. Satake and R. B. Luftig, 1983, Virology 124, 259-273), and cerulenin inhibits one or more proteolytic enzymes responsible for the cleavage of Pr65gag and Pr80env.","['Ikuta, K', 'Luftig, R B']","['Ikuta K', 'Luftig RB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Virology,Virology,0110674,IM,"['Antifungal Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Compartmentation/drug effects', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Cerulenin/*pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids/metabolism', 'Gene Products, gag', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/drug effects/*physiology', 'Protein Processing, Post-Translational/*drug effects', 'Retroviridae Proteins/*genetics', 'Viral Envelope Proteins/*genetics', 'Virus Replication/drug effects']",1986/10/15 00:00,1986/10/15 00:01,['1986/10/15 00:00'],"['1986/10/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/10/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/10/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Virology. 1986 Oct 15;154(1):195-206. doi: 10.1016/0042-6822(86)90441-1.,"['0 (Antifungal Agents)', '0 (Fatty Acids)', '0 (Gene Products, gag)', '0 (Retroviridae Proteins)', '0 (Viral Envelope Proteins)', '17397-89-6 (Cerulenin)']",['10.1016/0042-6822(86)90441-1 [doi]'],,['CA-37803/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The analysis of Ig and T cell receptor gene arrangements has been of value in the study of lymphoid neoplasms. The identification of T cell receptor gene rearrangements taken in conjunction with studies of Ig gene rearrangements aids in the elucidation of the lineage (T cell or B cell) and the clonality of lymphoid populations of all series. The application of this molecular genetic approach has great potential for complementing conventional marker analysis, cytogenetics, and histopathology, thus broadening the scientific basis for the classification, diagnosis, and monitoring of the therapy of lymphoid neoplasia. IL 2 is a lymphokine synthesized by some T cells following activation. Resting T cells do not express IL 2 receptors, but receptors are rapidly expressed on T cells following the interaction of antigens, mitogens, or monoclonal antibodies with the antigen-specific T cell receptor complex. Normal resting T cells and most leukemic T cell populations do not express IL 2 receptors; however, the leukemic cells of all patients with HTLV-I-associated adult T cell leukemia examined expressed the Tac antigen. The constant display of large numbers of IL 2 receptors that may be aberrant may play a role in the uncontrolled growth of these leukemic T cells. Patients with the Tac antigen positive adult T cell leukemia are being treated with the anti-Tac monoclonal antibody directed toward this growth factor receptor.","['Waldmann, T A', 'Korsmeyer, S J', 'Greene, W C']","['Waldmann TA', 'Korsmeyer SJ', 'Greene WC']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Symp Fundam Cancer Res,Symposium on Fundamental Cancer Research,100961284,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Clone Cells', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulins/*genetics', 'Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology', 'Lymphoma/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1986/01/01 00:00,2001/02/28 10:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/02/28 10:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Symp Fundam Cancer Res. 1986;38:63-78.,"['0 (Immunoglobulins)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,

Strong specificity of mAbs SN2, SN2a and SN2b for T leukemia cells was demonstrated by radioimmunoassay and fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. GP37 was not detected on normal human peripheral blood lymphocytes, purified normal T-cells, normal thymocytes nor normal bone marrow cells. Furthermore, GP37 was barely detectable on phytohemagglutinin (PHA)- and Concanavalin A (Con A)-activated T-cells. The results indicate clinical utility of these mAbs. Competitive binding experiments show that the epitopes recognized by SN2 and SN2a are sufficiently close to each other to allow complete reciprocal inhibition of binding whereas the epitopes recognized by SN2 and SN2b are less close to allow only partial reciprocal binding inhibition. The biochemical nature of antigenic determinants defined by these mAbs was studied by treating T leukemia cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin, thermolysin, neuraminidase and mixed glycosidases. The results suggest that the antigenic determinants defined by these mAbs all consist of the protein moiety of the glycoprotein GP37. No significant antigenic modulation was observed when T leukemia cells were reacted with SN2. In a sequential immunoprecipitation experiment, a 125I-labeled leukemia antigen preparation was first treated with a rabbit anti-T leukemia antiserum. The latter had been prepared by immunizing a rabbit with a partially purified human T leukemia antigen preparation and showed a good specificity for T leukemia cells. Subsequent treatment of the labeled antigen preparation with SN2 showed that SN2 antigen had been precleared. Thus, both mouse mAb SN2 and the rabbit anti-T leukemia antiserum react with the same GP37 molecule.","['Seon, B K', 'Fukukawa, T', 'Jackson, A L', 'Chervinsky, D', 'Tebbi, C K', 'Freeman, A I', 'Matsuzaki, H']","['Seon BK', 'Fukukawa T', 'Jackson AL', 'Chervinsky D', 'Tebbi CK', 'Freeman AI', 'Matsuzaki H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Mol Immunol,Molecular immunology,7905289,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antibody Specificity', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*analysis/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'Humans', 'Hybridomas/immunology', 'Immune Sera/immunology', 'Leukemia/*immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Rabbits', 'Radioimmunoassay', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Immunol. 1986 Jun;23(6):569-80. doi: 10.1016/0161-5890(86)90093-3.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immune Sera)', '0 (glycoprotein GP37)']",['10.1016/0161-5890(86)90093-3 [doi]'],,"['CA19304/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA37131/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

Three T cell-associated rearranging genes have been described. Two, T alpha and T beta, code for the two polypeptide chains that form the T cell receptor heterodimer. The function of the third gene, the gamma-gene (T gamma), is not known. To learn more about the behavior of T gamma during lymphoid ontogeny, we compared rearrangement of T gamma and T beta genes in leukemic cells arrested at varied stages of lymphoid and myeloid development. We analyzed 38 fresh cell lines and 15 established cell lines from a total of 53 leukemic patients. Cells were immunophenotyped with a panel of monoclonal antibodies recognizing T-, B-, or myeloid-associated surface markers. Sixteen T-lineage cases were studied; 15 displayed both T beta and T gamma rearrangements. The exception (germ-line for T beta and T gamma) was an immature CD2(T11)+, CD3(T3)-, CD7(3A1)+, CD1(T6)+, CD5(T101)+ phenotype. Fourteen non-T non-B leukemias were analyzed; eight were germ-line for both T beta and T gamma, four had rearrangements involving both T beta and T gamma, and two were germ-line for T beta and rearranged to T gamma. Four cases with acute biphenotypic leukemia were studied; two had rearrangements of T beta and T gamma, and two were germ-line for both genes. Cells from nonlymphocytic leukemias were studied in 19 cases. All were found to be germ-line for both T beta and T gamma. Fifty-one of 53 genomic DNA samples were concordant for T gamma and T beta rearrangement. These results indicate that rearrangement of T gamma can occur in leukemic cells of B cell as well as T cell precursor origin, as has been reported previously for T beta.","['Greenberg, J M', 'Quertermous, T', 'Seidman, J G', 'Kersey, J H']","['Greenberg JM', 'Quertermous T', 'Seidman JG', 'Kersey JH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Antigens, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/physiology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Recombination, Genetic', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1986/09/15 00:00,1986/09/15 00:01,['1986/09/15 00:00'],"['1986/09/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Sep 15;137(6):2043-9.,"['0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,"['AI-19938/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-25097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'T32-07208/PHS HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

TPA in different concentrations completely or partially inhibited cell proliferation, but had no drug-related cytotoxicity. No increase in the number of nitro-blue-tetrazolium-reducing cells nor adherence to plastic surface was found. In all four cell lines, TPA caused an increase in number and staining intensity of esterase, acid phosphatase, and LDH isoenzymes. The resulting isoenzyme profiles corresponded to those seen at more mature intermediate stages of B-cell proliferation, but did not indicate a terminal differentiation to mature B cells. The loss of the hexosaminidase I isoenzyme, which is a marker of immature hematopoietic cells, was a further indicator of induced maturation. These results demonstrate that while TPA is capable of inducing various immature non-T/non-B and pre-B cell lines to differentiate, the differentiation progression appears to be restricted to intermediate stages, in contrast to the terminal differentiation inducible in myeloid cells.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gaedicke, G', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Gaedicke G', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Acetylglucosaminidase/metabolism', 'Acid Phosphatase/metabolism', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology/pathology', 'Carboxylesterase', 'Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases/metabolism', 'Cell Cycle', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*metabolism', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia/enzymology/*pathology', 'Lymphocytes/enzymology/*pathology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Sep;14(8):732-7.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 3.1.1.- (Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.1.1 (Carboxylesterase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.2.1.52 (Acetylglucosaminidase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,

Complete targeting of peripheral blood T cells was achieved with 1 mg of MoAb in the nonleukemic patients (WBC less than 10,000/microL), and free, bioavailable antibody was present at the next (10-mg) dose level. Even higher doses resulted in substantial antibody excess that persisted for as long as 6 weeks. Serum concentrations of MoAb decreased with increasing number of peripheral blood T cells, and 25 to 35 mg of T101 were required for induction of antibody excess in leukemic patients. Excess antibody induced antigenic modulation, which was of consequence only if MoAb excess persisted to the next treatment. In the original treatment, the rapidly administered MoAb was able to target and remove peripheral blood T cells before the development of antigenic modulation. Antimouse antibodies developed in three patients. Their presence rendered further therapy ineffective and was associated with an anaphylactic reaction in one patient. Development of these antibodies could not be predicted by lymphoproliferative assays. In these assays, however, the T101 protein strongly stimulated the mononuclear cells of the patient who reached the only complete remission of this trial. Immunologic stimulation by the MoAb thus might have played a role in this patient's antitumor response. In summary, therapy with MoAb T101 was specific but only modestly efficacious. Rapid infusion of nonmodulating doses of antibody provided excellent targeting and removal of peripheral blood T cells and might be a valid approach in future trials with immunoconjugated T101.","['Bertram, J H', 'Gill, P S', 'Levine, A M', 'Boquiren, D', 'Hoffman, F M', 'Meyer, P', 'Mitchell, M S']","['Bertram JH', 'Gill PS', 'Levine AM', 'Boquiren D', 'Hoffman FM', 'Meyer P', 'Mitchell MS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic/biosynthesis', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/adverse effects/immunology/*therapeutic use', 'Antigen-Antibody Reactions', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*immunology', 'Antigens, Surface/immunology', 'Humans', 'Immunotherapy', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphoma/*immunology/therapy', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1986/09/01 00:00,1986/09/01 00:01,['1986/09/01 00:00'],"['1986/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Sep;68(3):752-61.,"['0 (Antibodies, Anti-Idiotypic)', '0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",['S0006-4971(20)69022-X [pii]'],,['N01-CM-07421-01/CM/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

The masses were found to occur more frequently in leukaemic lymphoblasts than in normal lymphocytes, but abnormally frequent occurrence was a feature of non T rather than T or B lymphoblasts. Although these masses may be derived by phagocytosis of dead cells or cellular material, a more likely origin is by detachment of altered portions of the containing cell's own nucleus. Such in situ alterations in nuclei were seen in leukaemic lymphoblasts but not in normal lymphocytes. A close relation demonstrated between altered chromatin and VLP might suggest that VLP are a response to the presence of damaged chromatin. However, the occurrence in some VLP of solid cores and budding might make it more likely that VLP are viral, with chromatin damage as a morphologically recognizable cytopathic effect of their activity.","['Smith, H', 'Collins, R J', 'Martin, N J', 'Siskind, V']","['Smith H', 'Collins RJ', 'Martin NJ', 'Siskind V']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Exp Pathol,British journal of experimental pathology,0372543,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Bone Marrow/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Chromatin/*ultrastructure', 'Heterochromatin/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Inclusion Bodies, Viral/*ultrastructure', '*Leukemia, Lymphoid/microbiology', 'Lymphocytes/microbiology', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'T-Lymphocytes/ultrastructure', 'Thymus Gland/ultrastructure', 'Vacuoles/ultrastructure']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Exp Pathol. 1986 Aug;67(4):549-61.,"['0 (Chromatin)', '0 (Heterochromatin)']",,,,PMC2013053,,,,,

We also studied marrow cultures from 13 patients in chemotherapy-induced remission; 6 of these, including 1 obtained from a patient during successful engraftment after marrow transplantation, also yielded lymphoblast colonies in culture, with the same immunologic phenotype or abnormal karyotype as the original leukemic marrow. Four of these patients, including the one who underwent marrow transplantation, relapsed within 2 to 30 months of the abnormal cultures; the other two are still in remission, one of them 30 months after diagnosis. Bone marrow cultures from eight normal controls and from the other seven patients in remission did not yield lymphoblast colonies; all seven of the latter are still in remission. This assay appears to allow detection of small numbers of residual leukemic cells. We conclude that the technique will be valuable in monitoring the efficacy of chemotherapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, as well as in evaluating the quality of purged marrow for autologous marrow transplantation.","['Estrov, Z', 'Grunberger, T', 'Dube, I D', 'Wang, Y P', 'Freedman, M H']","['Estrov Z', 'Grunberger T', 'Dube ID', 'Wang YP', 'Freedman MH']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*pathology/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1986/08/28 00:00,1986/08/28 00:01,['1986/08/28 00:00'],"['1986/08/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/28 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/28 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1986 Aug 28;315(9):538-42. doi: 10.1056/NEJM198608283150902.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)']",['10.1056/NEJM198608283150902 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

This therapy was done on 74 patients, of whom 38 (51%) had acute myelocytic leukemia, 14 (19%) malignant lymphoma, 7 (9%) acute lymphocytic leukemia, 5 aplastic anemia, 4 adult T cell leukemia, 4 chronic myelocytic leukemia, 1 multiple myeloma and 1 histiocytic medullary reticulosis. Complicated infections included 5 cases of septicemia, 41 cases of suspected septicemia, 19 cases of respiratory tract infection, 2 with anal abscess, 1 with urinary tract infection and others. The obtained results were as follows: Clinical effectiveness of the combination therapy was excellent in 17 cases (23.0%), good in 24 (32.4%) and poor in 33 (44.6%). Total clinical efficacy rate was 55.4%. Clinical efficacy rate was 40% against septicemias, 51.2% against suspected septicemias and 57.9% against respiratory tract infections. Causative pathogens were isolated in only 21 cases (28.4%): Gram-positive bacteria in 9 cases, Gram-negative bacteria in 11 and fungus in 1. About half of the Gram-negative bacteria belonged to Pseudomonas sp. The efficacy rate of this combination therapy against Gram-negative bacterial infections was 72.7% but the rate against Gram-positive bacterial infections were only 33.3%. Only in 1 case, this combination therapy was discontinued because of drug eruption. Abnormal laboratory findings were observed in 5 cases: Elevation of BUN in 3, GOT and GPT in 1 and prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time in 1. In conclusion, this combination therapy of CMX and CFS is useful and safe against infections complicated by hematological disorders.","['Minami, N', 'Uno, N', 'Shirakawa, S', 'Ohno, R', 'Okumura, M', 'Yamamoto, M', 'Mitomo, Y', 'Hirano, M', 'Shimizu, S', 'Yamada, K']","['Minami N', 'Uno N', 'Shirakawa S', 'Ohno R', 'Okumura M', 'Yamamoto M', 'Mitomo Y', 'Hirano M', 'Shimizu S', 'Yamada K', 'et al.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Jpn J Antibiot,The Japanese journal of antibiotics,0154402,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Anemia, Aplastic/complications', 'Bacterial Infections/complications/*drug therapy', 'Cefmenoxime', 'Cefotaxime/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cefsulodin/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Female', 'Hematologic Diseases/*complications', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/complications', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications', 'Lymphoma/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Jpn J Antibiot. 1986 Mar;39(3):713-20.,"['KBZ4844CXN (Cefmenoxime)', 'N2GI8B1GK7 (Cefotaxime)', 'OV42LHE42B (Cefsulodin)']",,,,,,,,,

In the present study, we report the detection of IL-1 secreted by several cell lines of monocyte origin and compare their biological and biochemical characteristics. IL-1 activity was tested by the regular assay of phytohemagglutinin (PHA) response of mouse thymus cells. IL-1 was found to be constitutively secreted by U937 and the M20 cell lines, as well as by three of the monocyte hybrid cell lines. The activity was always augmented following dialysis and did not require the presence of serum for its secretion. We compared the IL-1 activity of the myelomonoblastic M20 and hybrid 1C4 cell lines to that of normal monocytes. We found differences in the kinetics of IL-1 secretion, the pattern of activity following dilution of concentrated supernatants, and augmentation of activity by various inducers. The differences described may be explained by concomitant secretion of IL-1 inhibitory factors, as well as the secretion of activities other than IL-1. Preliminary biochemical analysis showed that all three cell sources tested shared some species of molecules characterized by gel filtration and ion-exchange chromatography. However, some species of molecules expressing IL-1 activity were unique to the cell lines and were not found in normal monocytes.","['Barak, V', 'Yamin, M', 'Braun, S', 'Halperin, M', 'Biran, S', 'Milner, Y', 'Treves, A J']","['Barak V', 'Yamin M', 'Braun S', 'Halperin M', 'Biran S', 'Milner Y', 'Treves AJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Biol Response Mod,Journal of biological response modifiers,8219656,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Assay', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells/immunology', 'Interleukin-1/analysis/*biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphocyte Activation', 'Mice', 'Monocytes/*immunology']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Response Mod. 1986 Aug;5(4):362-75.,['0 (Interleukin-1)'],,,,,,,,,

Moreover, ESb cells converted 14C-labeled glucose or pyruvate into labeled alanine and lactate at a ratio of about 1:10, whereas ESb-D cells yielded only labeled lactate and no detectable alanine. The injection of L-alanine in combination with L-lactate into mice strongly suppressed the capacity of their spleen cells to generate cytotoxic responses. The injection of L-alanine also suppressed the immunogenicity of ESb-D cells, as demonstrated by the generation of cytotoxic activity in vivo and by the in vivo immunization (priming) for secondary cytotoxic responses against ESb-D cells in vitro. Taken together, these experiments suggest the possibility i) that the ESb cells prevent the induction of cytotoxic responses by releasing immunosuppressive alanine, and ii) that the immunogenic mutant ESb-D may have gained immunogenicity by losing this immunosuppressive property.","['Droge, W', 'Eck, H P', 'Kriegbaum, H', 'Mihm, S']","['Droge W', 'Eck HP', 'Kriegbaum H', 'Mihm S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Alanine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Glucose/metabolism', 'Lactates/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Lactic Acid', 'Leukemia L5178/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C3H', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Pyruvates/metabolism', 'Pyruvic Acid', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/drug effects/immunology']",1986/08/15 00:00,1986/08/15 00:01,['1986/08/15 00:00'],"['1986/08/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/15 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/15 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Aug 15;137(4):1383-6.,"['0 (Lactates)', '0 (Pyruvates)', '33X04XA5AT (Lactic Acid)', '8558G7RUTR (Pyruvic Acid)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'OF5P57N2ZX (Alanine)']",,,,,,,,,

To investigate the nature of the cooperativity that occurs during the elaboration of these growth factors by activated T-lymphocytes and monocytes in vitro, and to define the subsets of T cells involved in this response, we studied the production of GM-CSA and BPA by populations of T-lymphocytes isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, using the monoclonal antibodies OKT3, OKT4, and OKT8. When OKT3+, OKT4+, or OKT8+ cells were incubated for five days in liquid suspension cultures, their production of GM-CSA and BPA was undetectably low. When 5% autologous monocytes were added to the cultures, no increase in the secretion of either of these classes of growth factors was noted. In the presence of concanavalin A (Con A), measurable quantities of both GM-CSA and BPA were elaborated by all three populations of T cells in the absence of monocytes; however, when autologous monocytes were added to the Con A-stimulated T cells, the secretion of both GM-CSA and BPA was markedly enhanced. In addition, we found that supernates of unfractionated T cells incubated with Con A contained not only GM-CSA and BPA but also a potent inhibitor(s) of BPA that could be demonstrated by dilution of the media and removed by gel filtration. In contrast, no inhibitor of GM-CSA was found. By molecular sieve chromatography of the supernates, GM-CSA and BPA coeluted as a single peak. However, the two biologic activities could be separated on the basis of heat stability, since GM-CSA proved to be heat labile whereas BPA did not. Our data indicate that GM-CSA and BPA derived from human T cells are similar in their apparent molecular weights and in the pattern of their production in suspension cultures in response to lectin stimulation. The secretion of both GM-CSA and BPA by Con A-stimulated T cells is facilitated by the presence of autologous monocytes, and is not restricted to either the OKT4- or the OKT8-defined subset.","['Sullivan, R', 'Hesketh, P J', 'McCarroll, L A', 'Zuckerman, K S']","['Sullivan R', 'Hesketh PJ', 'McCarroll LA', 'Zuckerman KS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*blood', 'Lymphokines/*biosynthesis/isolation & purification', 'Reference Values', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/cytology/*physiology', 'Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Aug;14(7):659-67.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases)']",,,"['5-S07 RR05487-16/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', '5T32HL7501-03/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'AM33944/AM/NIADDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The findings were substantiated using two different methods for CSF determination, a colony assay and an isotope incorporation test. Elevated levels of CSF in serum of mice with tumors were also found. Examination of blood from tumor-bearing mice revealed that whereas total leukocyte counts remained within the normal range, all three tumors caused a reversal of the normal neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio. The severity of the reversal correlated with the propensity of the tumor to elevate serum CSF rather than with in vitro CSF-producing capacity. Thus, whereas production of CSF in vivo was not related to the ability of the tumors to metastasize, it could be causative in creating an imbalance in normal hematopoiesis.","['Schwartz, R', 'Monner, D A']","['Schwartz R', 'Monner DA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Granulocytes/*cytology', 'Leukemia L5178/blood/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Leukocyte Count', 'Lymphoma/blood/*metabolism', 'Macrophages/cytology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mutation']",1986/08/01 00:00,1986/08/01 00:01,['1986/08/01 00:00'],"['1986/08/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/08/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/08/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1986 Aug;14(7):615-20.,['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)'],,,,,,,,,

Flow cytometric techniques for determining cytoplasmic pH (pHi) have been fully described for 4MU and DCH; BCECF has previously been used for fluorimetric estimation of pHi, and was adapted to flow cytometry. For each fluorochrome, the ratio of fluorescence intensity at two wavelengths gives a measure of pHi, which may be calibrated by obtaining the fluorescence ratios for cells suspended in buffers of varying pH in the presence of a proton ionophore. Reliable calibration proved difficult using 4MU, partly because of poor retention within cells. Both DCH and BCECF could be calibrated using a fluorescence ratio and had resolutions of 0.2 and 0.4 pH units, respectively. The fluorescence of DCH is so strongly pH dependent that there were practical difficulties in its use over a wide pH range; however, pHi measurements are possible between pH 6.0 and pH 7.5 using either DCH or BCECF. Substantial dye leakage was found for 4MU and, to a lesser extent, DCH, while BCECF was retained by cells for up to 2 hours. Despite its lower resolution BCECF had a usable range of more than 1.5 pH units and this coupled with its stable fluorescence and excitation at 488 nm rather than UV suggests a wide application.","['Musgrove, E', 'Rugg, C', 'Hedley, D']","['Musgrove E', 'Rugg C', 'Hedley D']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cytometry,Cytometry,8102328,IM,"['Cell Line', 'Cytoplasm/*metabolism', '*Flow Cytometry', 'Fluoresceins', '*Fluorescent Dyes', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Hydroquinones', 'Hymecromone', 'Leukemia/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/metabolism']",1986/07/01 00:00,1986/07/01 00:01,['1986/07/01 00:00'],"['1986/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cytometry. 1986 Jul;7(4):347-55. doi: 10.1002/cyto.990070409.,"['0 (Fluoresceins)', '0 (Fluorescent Dyes)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '3T5NG4Q468 (Hymecromone)', '4733-50-0 (2,3-dicyanohydroquinone)', ""85138-49-4 (2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein)""]",['10.1002/cyto.990070409 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Seven showed abnormal epinephrine-induced aggregation, while four had impaired both ADP- and collagen-induced aggregation. The platelets of all patients aggregated with arachidonic acid, thus ruling out cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase deficiency. The intracellular concentrations of ATP and ADP were significantly below normal, and the ratio of ATP/ADP was greater than normal in all 12 patients. ATP released from platelets by Lumi-aggregometer was reduced. In four patients with abnormal ristocetin-induced aggregation, vWF:Ag, RCoF, and FVIII:C were all reduced. No significant inactivation of factor VIII was induced in normal plasma by incubation with patient's plasma. The crossed immunoelectrophoretic analysis revealed that vWF:Ag in these patients was mainly composed of more anodic component as compared with that of normal plasma. The ratio of vWF:Ag/RCoF was significantly greater than normal. A marked increase of factor VIII and a rapid return of vWF:Ag and RCoF to the baseline after the 1-deamino-8-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP) infusion were observed. Transient increase in vWF:Ag after the infusion of DDAVP appeared with less anodic forms and in the same relative proportion as that in normal plasma.

Twenty-three patients had pericardial effusion, 19 patients had pericardial thickening, and 11 patients were referred for evaluation of masses with possible pericardial involvement. The other 10 patients were referred for differentiation of constrictive pericarditis from restrictive cardiomyopathy and eventually were found to have pericardial hematoma or normal pericardium as assessed by MRI. The calculated size of pericardial effusion by MRI showed a good correlation with semiquantitative echocardiographic estimations. MRI could demonstrate fibrinous adhesions in patients with uremic pericarditis. It was also of great value in the differential diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis vs restrictive cardiomyopathy. Pericardial thickness of more than 4 mm was found in patients with constrictive pericarditis. Normal pericardial thickness was demonstrated by MRI in the three patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy. MRI diagnosed hemopericardium correctly as the cause of constrictive symptoms in two patients. Pericardial thickening in patients after cardiac surgery was commonly found by MRI and usually was not associated with clinical signs of constrictive pericarditis. MRI proved to be useful in the diagnosis of pericardial cysts and in the evaluation of paracardiac masses with possible pericardial involvement. MRI is an important technique in the evaluation of the pericardium. It can provide important additional information when diagnosis cannot be made adequately by other noninvasive imaging techniques.","['Sechtem, U', 'Tscholakoff, D', 'Higgins, C B']","['Sechtem U', 'Tscholakoff D', 'Higgins CB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,AJR Am J Roentgenol,AJR.

Fusion of this murine Ia-negative cell line to the human Ia-positive Raji cell produced an interspecies hybridoma that expressed the murine Ia. These data are further evidence for the existence of a trans-acting factor(s) that can regulate class II gene expression. Furthermore, the T-cell-derived lymphokine B-cell-stimulatory factor 1 (BSF-1) induced expression of class II genes in the R8205 cells. Exposure of R8205 cells to an antibody that has been shown to mimic BSF-1 activity on normal B cells also resulted in expression of class II genes.

These patients tolerate infection poorly. An open lung biopsy may provide prompt diagnosis. Nevertheless, a beneficial change in therapy that results in survival does not necessarily follow. Fifty-six immunosuppressed children with acute respiratory symptoms and interstitial pulmonary infiltrates underwent lung biopsy from 1974 to 1985. The most common underlying diagnosis was acute lymphocytic leukemia (60%). A specific etiology was determined in 46 (82%). Operative morbidity in 52% included prolonged intubation, recurrent pneumothorax, and hemorrhage. Overall, mortality was 34%. Those patients with solid tumor and those who required postoperative ventilation had a statistically significant higher mortality than all others. We defined biopsy ""patient benefit"" as follows: (1) the biopsy yielded an etiology for which a change of treatment was required; and (2) the child survived this acute illness. Despite the successful diagnostic results of this procedure, only 13 (23%) of the patients derived clinical benefit. Even though a specific infectious etiology was diagnosed in 39 (69%) patients only ten (18%) of these improved and survived after an appropriate change in therapy.

A phenomenon suppressed by TPA.,129-44,"Immunological and biochemical markers of leukemia/lymphoma cells have provided valuable insight into hematopoietic malignancy and normal differentiation. The general assumption is that as early lymphoid cells become committed towards terminal differentiation they lose their capacity for bimodal differentiation and cells become restricted to B or T cell development and function. We have observed that phenotypically ""late"" leukemic B cells close to secretory stage can spontaneously express mature T cell antigens (T11, T4 and T8) after culture in vitro. In further studies of these cells, it was found that the biochemical marker lactate Dehydrogenase (LD) follows the intermediate pattern expressed by thymocytes rather than that of typical B cells. The expression of T cell antigens can be blocked by incubating these cells with the phorbol ester TPA (12-0-tetradecanoyl phorbol 13 acetate) which promotes unidirectional B cell maturation to plasmacytoid cells in a way that mimics normal B cell differentiation. These observations indicate that presecretory malignant B cells are still programmed to express T cell biochemical and antigenic markers and this expression can be influenced by environmental conditions in vitro.","['Efremidis, A P', 'Haubenstock, H S', 'Papadopoulos, N M', 'Holland, J F', 'Bekesi, J G']","['Efremidis AP', 'Haubenstock HS', 'Papadopoulos NM', 'Holland JF', 'Bekesi JG']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Immunopharmacol,Journal of immunopharmacology,7901853,IM,"['Antigens, Surface', 'B-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin M', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Isoenzymes', 'L-Lactate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Leukemia/*immunology/pathology/physiopathology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/classification/*immunology', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunopharmacol. 1986;8(2):129-44. doi: 10.3109/08923978609028612.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Immunoglobulin M)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Phorbols)', 'EC 1.1.1.27 (L-Lactate Dehydrogenase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['10.3109/08923978609028612 [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Fusion of the BW5147 cell line with peripheral blood cells from a patient with a more mature T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (TdT+/HLA-DR+/Tp41+/T11+/T1+/T6-/T4+/T8+/T3-) resulted in a panel of hybrid clones that expressed not only the Tp41 antigen, but also the human T cell antigens T1 and T4; two hybrids even expressed the T3 antigen. This panel of hybrids also contained the whole human genome. The two panels of human-mouse T cell hybrids allowed us to assign the genes coding for the human T cell antigens Tp41, T1, and T4 to human chromosomes 17, 11, and 12, respectively.

This antibody was used to define differences in the lytic trigger processes of NK and other mechanisms of K562 lysis. Monoclonal antibody 13.3 inhibited lysis of K562 target cells by freshly isolated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and purified large granular lymphocytes (LGL), but had no inhibitory effect on antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity to K562 by these effectors. Lectin-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (LDCC) to this target cell was also unresponsive to 13.3. The 13.3-induced inhibition of NK-K562 lytic activity persisted when PBL were activated in culture with interleukin 2 (IL 2) for periods up to 48 hr. After 48 hr of culture, the degree of inhibition diminished progressively in medium containing fetal calf serum but not in medium containing autologous serum. This 13.3-unresponsive lytic activity in cultured PBL could be attributed to more than one cell type and was present in both the LGL and Fc gamma receptor-depleted T cell fraction. Thus, K562 lysis by freshly isolated human lymphocytes via NK, K, and LDCC mechanisms is characterized by heterogeneity of the post-binding effector cell trigger mechanism.

No increase in labeling was observed in phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, or phosphatidylserine. Based on both negative and positive selection procedures, it was demonstrated that these responses occurred in B lymphocytes. In contrast to the thymidine uptake response of the GAMIg-stimulated B lymphocytes, the phospholipid response did not require the presence of accessory cells or exogenous cytokines. The same selective changes in phospholipid metabolism were observed in neoplastic B lymphocytes (BCL1) after treatment with Sepharose anti-mu, but not with Sepharose anti-Ia or Sepharose normal Ig. The dose-response relationships of 32PO4 incorporation into phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol and [3H] thymidine uptake were nearly identical in BCL1 cells.

The expression of Hex I was examined in 87 leukemia-lymphoma cell lines, in 14 B-lymphoblastoid cell lines, in 441 cases of leukemia-lymphoma (specimens containing 80% or more tumor cells), in 22 leukemia cell lines and in 14 cases of leukemia that had been treated with phorbolesters (TPA) for induction of differentiation, and in the mononuclear cell preparations separated from peripheral blood, lymph node, thymus, bone marrow, tonsil, liver, and spleen specimens from normal donors. Hex I was detected in the leukemia cell lines arrested at early, immature or at late, mature stages of B- and T-cell differentiation, but not in cell lines blocked at intermediate stages of maturation. Most myelomonocytic leukemia cell lines and the erythroleukemia cell lines showed Hex I, whereas the B-lymphoblastoid cell lines were negative for this marker. During induction of differentiation, the expression of Hex I was lost in 13 of 15 leukemia cell lines that were originally Hex I-positive. Among the panel of the ""fresh"" leukemia-lymphoma cells, Hex I was found predominantly in cases of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute myeloblastic/monoblastic leukemia, but rarely or not at all in the mature T-, B- or myeloid malignancies. However, two out of two cases of multiple myeloma were Hex I-positive, and the Hex I expression could be induced by TPA in three of six B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia cases. Chronic myelocytic leukemia cells remained Hex I-negative during induction of differentiation. Hex I-positivity was not detected in the cell preparations from normal tissues, and peripheral blood indicating that the normal cellular counterpart of the Hex I-positive tumor cells are present at only low percentages within the respective cell populations.

Statistical analysis demonstrated that more than 55% circulating prolymphocytes (PROL) was a defining criterion for PLL, disorder characterized by marked splenomegaly without lymph-node enlargement, cells with high density of membrane-immunoglobulin (SmIg), low mouse-rosettes (M-rosettes) and strong reactivity with the monoclonal antibody FMC7. Patients with typical CLL, defined as having less than 10% PROL, were on average 10 years younger than those with PLL and showed preferential lymph-node to spleen involvement. Characteristic markers of CLL were weak SmIg, high M-rosettes and low reactivity with FMC7. Patients with 11-55% PROL, group designated as CLL/PL, were found to have intermediate features between CLL and PLL: the degree of splenomegaly was disproportionate to the lymph-node enlargement, the number of cases with strong SmIg was closer to that found in PLL, but the other markers were not significantly different from CLL. The CLL/PL group appeared to be heterogeneous and includes at least two types of CLL, one with increased proportions of PROL but otherwise typical disease, and another in 'prolymphocytoid' transformation. Our study suggests that although PLL cannot be considered as the extreme end of a continuous spectrum from typical CLL, the spleen may be the source of PROL both in PLL and in CLL/PL.","['Melo, J V', 'Catovsky, D', 'Galton, D A']","['Melo JV', 'Catovsky D', 'Galton DA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes/pathology', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/blood/*diagnosis/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Spleen/pathology']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1986 Jun;63(2):377-87.,,,,,,,,,,

This poor motility of 'normal' blood T lymphocytes is most likely physiological, since under the same conditions more than 75% of the blood lymphocytes from T-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (TCLL) cases showed motile forms. In contrast to blood T cells, a large proportion of fresh human splenic T lymphocytes from separate individuals generally showed motile behaviour within 1 h when plated on a substrate. The rate of migration of spleen T cells into a collagen matrix was higher than that of blood T cells. The poor motile behaviour therefore appeared to be a limiting factor for translocation and migration of blood T cells within a collagen matrix. Culture on a collagen matrix at 'low' cell density in the presence or absence of serum for 2 days augmented the percentage of motile blood T cells to the same level as for fresh spleen T cells, whereas culture on plastic caused a relatively moderate increase in motility. This collagen-mediated potentiation probably does not reflect polyclonal T-cell activation, since it occurred in serum-free medium and appeared independent of cell interactions, and since collagen did not induce DNA synthesis. These results demonstrate two major factors regulating the 'spontaneous' motility of T lymphocytes, namely the location of the cell within the body and the nature of the substratum.","['Sundqvist, K G', 'Otteskog, P', 'Mellstedt, H']","['Sundqvist KG', 'Otteskog P', 'Mellstedt H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Scand J Immunol,Scandinavian journal of immunology,0323767,IM,"['Antigens, Surface', '*Cell Movement', 'Collagen', 'Culture Media', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/pathology', 'Plastics', 'Spleen/cytology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*physiology']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Scand J Immunol. 1986 Jun;23(6):647-54. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-3083.1986.tb02000.x.,"['0 (Antigens, Surface)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Plastics)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)']",['10.1111/j.1365-3083.1986.tb02000.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Biological interpretation of mathematical parameters.,15-23,"This study deals with the interpretation of primary data of the 51Cr release assay for cellular cytotoxicity. In particular the dose-effect relationship between increasing numbers of lymphoid cells and the percentage of target cells killed has been considered. The number of target cells killed depends on the frequency and the activity of cytotoxic cells. These two parameters are often not distinguished from each other, which causes confusion and frequently results in vague descriptions of cytotoxicity data. Because in many cases not all cells in the target cell population can be lysed, we recommend the introduction of the plateau value for target cell kill. This maximum of target cell kill is a measure of the frequency of lysable target cells, but also depends on the cytotoxic cell activity. Description of the dose-effect curve by y = A(1 - e-kx) allows the simultaneous calculation of the maximum kill (A) and the frequency of cytotoxic cells (k) in the lymphoid cell population (x). Results are presented which indicate that A and k represent totally independent biological parameters the use of which permits a more objective description of cytotoxicity data.","['Bol, S J', 'Rosdorff, H J', 'Ronteltap, C P', 'Hennen, L A']","['Bol SJ', 'Rosdorff HJ', 'Ronteltap CP', 'Hennen LA']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,J Immunol Methods,Journal of immunological methods,1305440,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chromium Radioisotopes', '*Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Mathematics', 'Mice', 'Rats', 'Rhabdomyosarcoma/immunology', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/immunology']",1986/06/10 00:00,1986/06/10 00:01,['1986/06/10 00:00'],"['1986/06/10 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/10 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/10 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol Methods. 1986 Jun 10;90(1):15-23. doi: 10.1016/0022-1759(86)90378-9.,['0 (Chromium Radioisotopes)'],"['0022-1759(86)90378-9 [pii]', '10.1016/0022-1759(86)90378-9 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

There is considerable overlap between these disorders, which probably represent two ends of the same disease spectrum. To determine whether there are radiological differences between T-ALL and T-NHL we reviewed the clinical, haematological and radiological features of 58 children seen in one centre over a 9-year period. Splenomegaly and adenopathy were significantly more common in T-ALL than in T-NHL. Patients with T-ALL were usually anaemic and thrombocytopenic, with elevated white blood cell counts; patients with T-NHL had normal blood counts. The radiological abnormalities seen were mediastinal enlargement, pleural effusions, and tracheal compression. All patients with T-NHL had abnormal chest radiographs, whereas 10 of 39 patients with T-ALL had normal chest radiographs. When only abnormal radiographs were compared, however, there were no differences in the degree of mediastinal widening or in the size of pleural effusions. Tracheal compression was more common in T-NHL and was always most marked in the intrathoracic airway and in an antero-posterior direction. We conclude that there is little difference in the radiological abnormalities seen in T-ALL and T-NHL, which further supports the theory that they represent points along a common spectrum of disease. As airway compression is primarily intrathoracic and in an antero-posterior direction, adequate radiological evaluation should include a lateral chest radiograph.","['Mitchell, C D', 'Gordon, I', 'Chessells, J M']","['Mitchell CD', 'Gordon I', 'Chessells JM']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Radiol,Clinical radiology,1306016,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*diagnostic imaging', 'Lymphoma/*diagnostic imaging', 'Male', 'Mediastinum/diagnostic imaging', 'Pleural Effusion/diagnostic imaging', 'Prognosis', 'Radiography', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Trachea/diagnostic imaging']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Clin Radiol. 1986 May;37(3):257-61. doi: 10.1016/s0009-9260(86)80331-2.,,"['S0009-9260(86)80331-2 [pii]', '10.1016/s0009-9260(86)80331-2 [doi]']",,,,,,,,

The transport of 2 microM coformycin or 2'-deoxycoformycin, which is mediated by the same mechanism and was monitored by the adenosine deaminase titration assay, decreased 29-fold. The reduction in nucleoside transport capacity after DMF treatment was confirmed by a 19-fold decrease in the number of specific binding sites per cell (from 24-30 X 10(4) to 1.2-1.7 X 10(4)) for [3H]-6-p-nitrobenzylthioinosine, a nucleoside transport inhibitor. The binding affinity of 6-p-nitrobenzylthioinosine was not altered significantly and nucleoside transport remained sensitive to the transport inhibitors, 6-p-nitrobenzylthioinosine, dipyridamole, and dilazep after DMF-induced maturation. Time-dependence studies showed that the rate of 100 microM deoxyadenosine transport was unchanged for the first 24 h of exposure to DMF but fell to about 36% of control rates at 24-26 h and then gradually decreased further to about 4-5% of control rates after 5-6 days. In contrast, transport rates of the purine bases were reduced only 2- to 3-fold in HL-60 cells after 5 days of DMF treatment. The rates of adenosine and deoxyadenosine transport were unchanged or reduced by no more than 2-fold after 5-6 days of exposure to 0.8% DMF in the following human tumor cell lines that are not inducible with DMF: ARH-77 (multiple myeloma), KG-1 (acute myelogenous), and K-562 (chronic myelogenous).

Since human c-myc transcripts were expressed only in hybrids carrying the 8q+ chromosome but not in hybrids containing the normal chromosome 8, it is concluded that the translocation of the C alpha locus 3' to the c-myc oncogene can result in its transcriptional deregulation.","['Erikson, J', 'Finger, L', 'Sun, L', 'ar-Rushdi, A', 'Nishikura, K', 'Minowada, J', 'Finan, J', 'Emanuel, B S', 'Nowell, P C', 'Croce, C M']","['Erikson J', 'Finger L', 'Sun L', 'ar-Rushdi A', 'Nishikura K', 'Minowada J', 'Finan J', 'Emanuel BS', 'Nowell PC', 'Croce CM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,IM,"['Animals', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/genetics', 'Chromosomes, Human, 13-15', 'Chromosomes, Human, 6-12 and X', 'Humans', 'Hybrid Cells', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Middle Aged', 'Nucleic Acid Hybridization', '*Oncogenes', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*genetics', '*T-Lymphocytes', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1986/05/16 00:00,1986/05/16 00:01,['1986/05/16 00:00'],"['1986/05/16 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/16 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/16 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Science. 1986 May 16;232(4752):884-6. doi: 10.1126/science.3486470.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",['10.1126/science.3486470 [doi]'],,"['CA10815/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA25875/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA39860/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

In a similar manner, the inhibitory material suppressed proliferative responses of allogeneic and autologous lymphocytes.

They also had surface markers specific for the monocyte-macrophage lineage.

We characterized the differentiation state of the cells by immunofluorescence by using anti-cell surface differentiation-specific monoclonal antibodies (OKT3, OKT4, OKT6, and OKT8). The GSLs were extracted and separated by thin-layer chromatography and the individual bands were quantitated by a dual-wavelength densitometer or by autoradiography of GSLs labeled with [14C]glucosamine and [14C]galactose. Treatment of the CEM cells with 0.16-16 nM PMA for 6 h to 6 days resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in the amount of two neutral GSLs [ceramide monohexoside and ceramide dihexoside] and three gangliosides [monosialoganglioside (GM3), sialosylparagloboside, and disialoganglioside (GD3)]. The increase in the neutral GSLs after PMA treatment reached its maximum at 30 h while GM3 peaked at 96 h. The increases in GM3 and sialosylparagloboside are presumably due to an increase in their synthesis levels because PMA promoted an elevated incorporation of glucosamine and galactose into these GSLs. The increase in the amount of GD3, on the other hand, is due to either a decrease in its degradation or use in other metabolic pathways because no detectable increase in glucosamine and galactose incorporation into this ganglioside could be found. Incubation of control or PMA-induced CEM cells with GM3 fractions purified from either CEM cells, human brain, or dog erythrocytes caused a reduction in cell growth and prevented the increase in reactivity of the induced cells with the OKT3 antibody. Incubation with semisynthetic ceramide dihexoside, however, prevented the decrease in reactivity with the OKT4 antibody. The observed changes in GSL patterns during PMA-induced differentiation of the CEM cells into suppressor-like cells and the inhibition of CEM cell growth by GM3 fractions suggest that the GSLs play a role in the control of cell growth and differentiation in the PMA-treated CEM cells.","['Kiguchi, K', 'Henning-Chubb, C', 'Huberman, E']","['Kiguchi K', 'Henning-Chubb C', 'Huberman E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'G(M3) Ganglioside/pharmacology', 'Gangliosides/analysis', 'Glycosphingolipids/*analysis/biosynthesis/pharmacology/physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Phorbols/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology']",1986/06/01 00:00,1986/06/01 00:01,['1986/06/01 00:00'],"['1986/06/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/06/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/06/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Res. 1986 Jun;46(6):3027-33.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (G(M3) Ganglioside)', '0 (Gangliosides)', '0 (Glycosphingolipids)', '0 (Phorbols)', '0 (ceramide dihexoside)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,

Purified biosynthetic GM-CSF, which stimulates normal CFU-GM and CFU-EO, induced monocytic differentiation but no eosinophilic differentiation in the neutrophilic sublines and no neutrophilic or monocytic differentiation in the eosinophilic sublines.

In contrast to JCML, PB from six adults with Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (Ph1 + CML) yielded CSA-dependent CFU-C colonies which were composed of granulocytes, macrophages, or both, as well as exuberant growth of BFU-E colonies.

The ligands (antigens) involved in this interaction have not been clearly identified. Previously, we have shown that some monosaccharides inhibit NK mediated cytolysis in a concentration-dependent fashion and that NK cell activity involves recognition of carbohydrate structures on target cells via receptors on the effector cell surface. Using human IL-2 or recombinant IL-2, we have found that monosaccharides inhibit IL-2 enhanced functional activity in a concentration-dependent fashion; that increased expression of endogenous monosaccharide binding receptors on effector cells occurs after treatment with IL-2; and that greater quantities of monosaccharide were required to obtain equivalent inhibition of IL-2 enhanced NK activity.

The purified IL 1 stimulated the proliferative response of the D10.G4.1 cell line, a mouse IL 1 indicator T cell; caused the release of prostaglandin E2 and prostacyclin from cultured human foreskin fibroblasts and from primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells; and elicited characteristic endogenous pyrogen fever in rabbits. To stimulate IL 1 production, the histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 was incubated with the exotoxin from toxic shock strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Supernatants from stimulated U937 cells were concentrated, and were applied to a reverse-phase HPLC column. IL 1 activity was eluted from the column at high acetonitrile concentration. Subsequent chromatography over hydroxyapatite yielded a single IL 1 species with a pI of 5.5. IL 1 was then purified to homogeneity by gel exclusion HPLC migrating as a 14 kDa species. The molecular size was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and was visualized as a single molecule by silver staining; biologic activity was recovered from the same region of the gel. Limited N-terminal sequence analysis suggested some homology to the pI 7 form of the human blood monocyte IL 1. The pI 5.5 IL 1 produced by U937 cells was only partially neutralized with anti-human monocyte IL 1 antibody, suggesting that U937-derived IL 1 is structurally related to one of the molecularly cloned IL 1 species.

NK activity was measured as the percentage cytotoxicity in chromium-51 release assays with K562 target cells. The more severely burned patients had significantly depressed NK activity for the 40-day period following injury that remained reduced for the duration of the study. Patients with lesser burns had reduced NK-cell function for the initial 10-day period postburn that returned slowly to the normal range. Traumatically injured patients had depressed NK-cell function during the 3- to 6-day period postinjury. The percentage of cells bearing phenotypic markers for the groups in which NK cells are found was either normal or elevated in these patients. A correlation was found between NK activity and interleukin 2 generation by mononuclear cells from these patients. In order to investigate the mechanism of NK suppression in these patients, NK-cell function was studied following the infusion of cortisol, epinephrine, and glucagon into volunteer subjects in amounts known to reproduce serum levels seen following injury of moderate severity.

The TracP isoenzyme was seen in the following leukemia-lymphoma cell lines: 4 of 30 T-cell, 2 of 35 B-cell, 1 of 6 non-T/non-B-cell, 1 of 8 myelomonocytic, 3 of 4 erythroleukemia, and 3 of 4 Hodgkin's disease-derived cell lines. The expression of the TracP band could be induced by treatment with TPA in 3 myelomonocytic leukemia cell lines. Among the different types of leukemia-lymphoma cells freshly obtained from patients, the TracP isoenzyme was detected at a high incidence in cases of B-CLL, hairy cell leukemia (HCL), and B-lymphoma. Of the myeloid leukemias, 10% to 20% displayed the TracP isoenzyme. TracP positivity was detected in the peripheral blood, tonsil, bone marrow, spleen, and liver obtained from healthy donors, but not in the thymus. The expression of the TracP band could be newly induced by TPA in cases of CLL and in cases of CML. It is concluded that TracP activity is not specific for HCL, but is found at high incidences in cases of HCL, B-CLL and B-lymphoma. The TracP isoenzyme is not expressed by very immature lymphoid leukemia cells, but by cells arrested at later stages of differentiation of the T- or B-cell lineage, and by some myeloid cells.","['Drexler, H G', 'Gaedicke, G', 'Minowada, J']","['Drexler HG', 'Gaedicke G', 'Minowada J']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/*analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/enzymology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Isoelectric Focusing/methods', 'Isoenzymes/*analysis', 'Leukemia/*enzymology/pathology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/enzymology', 'Lymphoma/*enzymology/pathology', 'Monocytes/enzymology', 'Tartrates', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology']",1986/05/01 00:00,1986/05/01 00:01,['1986/05/01 00:00'],"['1986/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1986 May 1;57(9):1776-82. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860501)57:9<1776::aid-cncr2820570911>3.0.co;2-g.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Tartrates)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19860501)57:9<1776::aid-cncr2820570911>3.0.co;2-g [doi]'],,,,,,,,

First, we have documented that treatment of mice with the chemically defined BRM maleic anhydride divinyl ether copolymer (MVE-2), which induces CSF secretion by macrophages (M phi) and bone marrow cells (BMC), significantly increased growth and differentiation of normal myelopoietic cells and counteracted the myelosuppressive effects of cyclophosphamide (CY). Second, we established that MVE-2 may exert CSF-mediated antitumor effects on certain leukemic tumor cells. Serum from mice pretreated in vivo with MVE-2, which contained CSF, induced terminal differentiation of cloned tumor cells from the CSF responsive WEHI-3B D+ subline in vitro, but not from the WEHI-3B D- subline, which is unresponsive to CSF. In vivo experiments showed that treatment of mice bearing the WEHI-3B D+ tumor first with CY and three days later with the CSF inducer MVE-2, significantly increased their survival time and rendered 20% to 50% of the tumor-bearing mice disease free. No such effects were obtained in mice bearing the WEHI-3B D- tumor. Thus, the induction of CSF or other differentiation factors by some BRMs may result in therapeutic effects against certain leukemias based on at least two distinct mechanisms: In addition to their restorative effects on normal bone marrow functions, CSF-inducing BRMs may also prevent further leukemogenesis by induction of terminal differentiation of leukemic cells.","['Schlick, E', 'Ruscetti, F W']","['Schlick E', 'Ruscetti FW']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*biosynthesis', 'Cyclophosphamide/pharmacology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Drug Combinations', 'Glycoproteins/blood/physiology', '*Growth Inhibitors', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', '*Interleukin-6', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia Inhibitory Factor', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/*pathology', '*Lymphokines', 'Macrophages/immunology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Polymers/*pharmacology', 'Pyran Copolymer/*pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Apr;67(4):980-7.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Drug Combinations)', '0 (Glycoproteins)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (Leukemia Inhibitory Factor)', '0 (Lif protein, mouse)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Polymers)', '27100-68-1 (Pyran Copolymer)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",['S0006-4971(20)81270-1 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

The role of BCGF in the regulation of malignant B cell proliferation is unclear. Therefore, we studied the proliferative response of purified chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells to BCGF. For all CLL patients studied, CLL B cells showed a decreased proliferative response as compared with control B cells for BCGF-induced B cell proliferation (patient 291 +/- 59 cpm v control 3,942 +/- 622, mean +/- SEM). This impaired proliferative response appeared to be intrinsic to CLL B cells since it was not corrected by incubation with increasing concentrations of BCGF. Attainment of normal B cell responsiveness to BCGF requires the processing of an initial activation signal which results in the expression of cell surface receptors for BCGF. Increasing concentrations of the B cell activation signal (the F(ab')2 fragment of goat anti-human mu chain) did not improve CLL B cell responsiveness to BCGF. Three-day activated CLL B cells compared with activated control B cells demonstrated a marked impairment in their ability to absorb out the BCGF activity present in the BCGF preparation (BCGF activity absorbed out, patient 12.8% v control 53%). Pretreatment of CLL B cells with neuraminidase failed to improve either the proliferative response to BCGF or the expression of cell surface receptors for BCGF by the CLL B cells. This study suggests that the impaired responsiveness to BCGF by CLL B cells is the result of impaired expression of cell surface receptors for BCGF when CLL B cells are exposed to activation signals.","['Perri, R T']",['Perri RT'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Membrane/metabolism', 'Growth Substances/*metabolism/physiology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*metabolism/pathology', '*Lymphocyte Activation', 'Lymphokines/*metabolism/physiology', 'Neuraminidase/pharmacology', 'Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell/*analysis/drug effects']",1986/04/01 00:00,1986/04/01 00:01,['1986/04/01 00:00'],"['1986/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Apr;67(4):943-8.,"['0 (Growth Substances)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']",['S0006-4971(20)81263-4 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

The resting potential of both cell types is close to the K+ equilibrium potential. Changes from the resting level occur when mitogenic concentrations of either concanavalin A or phytohaemagglutinin are added. T-lymphocytes undergo a decrease in emission, maximal at 1 to 2 min, corresponding to a small membrane hyperpolarization. This is followed by a depolarization to approximately the resting level. HPB-ALL cells, on the other hand, respond to the mitogens by a sustained increase in fluorescence, denoting a depolarization, that is maximal at 4 to 5 min and 7 to 9 min, respectively. The Ca2+-dependence of these phenomena indicates that the membrane potential response, in both cell types, is the resultant of two opposing effects: a Ca2+-sensitive ion movement tending to hyperpolarize the cells and a Ca2+-insensitive effect that generates a depolarization. Our results suggest that Ca2+-activated K+ channels are responsible for the first effect and that an inward Na+ movement accounts for the depolarization signal in T-lymphocytes. In HPB-ALL cells only part of the depolarization is Na+-dependent.

But even in ATLL (adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma) believed to be a model of Ti/h type, the heterogeneities of surface phenotype are reported frequently. All of the pleomorphic and lymphoblastic and a part of small cell, medium-sized cell, mixed and large cell types have a T-cell phenotype. In addition to these histologies, AILD/IBL/IBL-like T lymphoma, T-zone lymphoma and So-called Lennert's lymphoma also hold T-cell nature. The heterogenecity and the existence of the borderline area between neoplasm and reactive lymphadenitis or hyperplasia often confused the clinicians and hematopathologists. From our experience, forty nine percent 5 year survival of T lymphoma other than lymphoblastic and pleomorphic type suggests the propriety of classifying T lymphoma into high grade and intermediate grade malignancies. Treatment of T lymphomas are basically distinguishable to two categories, for T1 and T2 lymphomas. The treatment of T1 lymphoma should be an aggressive one including CNS prophylaxis. At present, the recommendable treatment of T2 lymphoma is to apply the best regimens obtained from B cell lymphoma study. As aggressive treatment for ATL does not always yield favorable results, the concept of therapy will become clear near future. An intensive supportive therapy including T-S prophylaxis should be combined actively in the treatment program.","['Oyama, A', 'Ota, K']","['Oyama A', 'Ota K']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

These results indicate that K-45 cells are induced to differentiate phenotypically towards a suppressor/cytotoxic T cell. However functional maturation can not be demonstrated.

Their use as potential diagnostic reagents for hematologic disorders is also under investigation. It has been assumed throughout these investigations that the p24-specific MoAb produced by different laboratories all identify the same antigen. Our present studies indicate that at least two populations of p24 antigens, having different chemical properties and cellular distributions, exist on malignant B cells. For example, eight MoAb raised to ALL cells (ALL-MoAb) identify a p24 antigen on these cells but do not react with the Burkitt's lymphoma cell line Ramos. In contrast, six MoAb raised to Ramos (Ramos-MoAb) identify a p24 antigen on both Ramos and ALL cells. Quantitative binding of both sets of MoAb to ALL cells is comparable. The ALL-MoAb react with platelets, granulocytes, and activated but not resting T lymphocytes, whereas the Ramos-MoAb react with both resting and activated T lymphocytes but not with platelets or granulocytes. The ALL-MoAb react with 11 of 34 human hematopoietic cell lines tested; the Ramos-MoAb react with all 34. Both sets of MoAb react with most of the nonhematopoietic human cell lines tested. Reciprocal exhaustive radioimmune precipitation experiments performed with an ALL cell line indicate that the antigenic determinants recognized by these two sets of MoAb are present on different molecules. Similarly, proteolytic digests of iodinated antigens identified by these two sets of MoAb on ALL cells confirm the unique chemical identities of these molecules and suggest that they reflect the products of different genetic loci.

In adoptive chemoimmunotherapy (ACIT) of disseminated FBL leukemia with cyclophosphamide and immune T cells, the major effector T cell has been shown to be a noncytolytic Lyt-1+2- T cell that mediates its therapeutic effect without the participation of CTL. Because studies in other models have suggested that CTL can mediate an anti-tumor effect, the efficacy of Lyt-2+ T cells rendered highly cytolytic before adoptive transfer in ACIT of disseminated FBL was examined. The results demonstrated that such CTL had a detectable but limited therapeutic effect in the treatment of FBL. Because this limited activity of transferred purified CTL might have reflected a requirement for helper T cells to produce IL 2 for promotion of the in vivo survival and proliferation of the CTL, the effect of administering IL 2 to tumor-bearing hosts after transfer of CTL was examined. A dose of IL 2 previously shown to induce in vivo proliferation of transferred T cells rendered CTL that were minimally effective alone curative in ACIT of FBL leukemia. Thus, either lymphokine-producing T cells or the lymphokines produced by these cells are necessary for the full expression of the in vivo therapeutic potential of CTL.","['Greenberg, P D']",['Greenberg PD'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Adjuvants, Immunologic/administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Ly/administration & dosage/*immunology', 'Cyclophosphamide/*therapeutic use', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Immunization, Passive/methods', 'Interleukin-2/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/classification/immunology/*transplantation']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Immunol. 1986 Mar 1;136(5):1917-22.,"['0 (Adjuvants, Immunologic)', '0 (Antigens, Ly)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,"['CA 30558/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33084/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,

The cytotoxicity was dependent upon antibody binding as demonstrated by blocking toxicity with excess UCHT1. The differences in toxicity between these reagents were not due to differences in ADP-ribosylation activity of DT A chain, binding activity of the antibody moiety, extent of DT nicking, or the cross-linking method, so we conclude that the large differences in toxicity were due to the presence of different B chain domains. The large increase in toxicity by the C-terminal region of DT B did not appear to be caused by DT receptor binding.

Analysis of 1200 cases of leukemia-lymphoma.,99-109,"1255 cases of leukemia-lymphoma were tested between 1972 and 1984 by multiple marker analysis. Routine leukemia phenotyping was performed using standard morphological and cytochemical techniques in combination with clinical and histo-pathological information; the main emphasis was put on immunological surface marker analysis using erythrocyte rosette assays, TdT and a large panel of poly- and monoclonal antibody tests. The 1255 cases were divided into these major types and subtypes: 349 cases of ALL and related immature T- and Burkitt-lymphomas (cALL, pre B-ALL, B-ALL and Burkitt-lymphomas, T-ALL and immature, mostly leukemic T-lymphomas, Null-ALL), 454 cases of mature T- and B-cell malignancies (T-CLL, mycosis fungoides, Sezary-syndrome, T-lymphomas, B-CLL, hairy cell leukemia, multiple myeloma, B-lymphomas), 263 cases of acute myeloid leukemias (AML, AMMoL/AMoL), 182 cases of chronic myeloid leukemias (CML in chronic phase, CMoL, CML in blast crisis), 6 cases of erythroleukemia and 1 case of megakaryoblastic leukemia. A simplified classification scheme which has been used in our laboratories is presented. Phenotyping is of diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic relevance, most evidently for patients with ALL. Routine leukemia phenotyping should be performed with highly standardized techniques and reagents and by combining information from several fields in the multiple marker analysis. New areas of leukemia research might become very useful for the routine procedure of phenotyping.","['Drexler, H G', 'Menon, M', 'Sagawa, K', 'Tatsumi, E', 'Koshiba, H', 'Koishi, T', 'Minato, K', 'Sugimoto, T', 'Saito, M', 'Morita, M']","['Drexler HG', 'Menon M', 'Sagawa K', 'Tatsumi E', 'Koshiba H', 'Koishi T', 'Minato K', 'Sugimoto T', 'Saito M', 'Morita M', 'et al.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,IM,"['Adult', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Child, Preschool', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/classification/*pathology', 'Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blut. 1986 Feb;52(2):99-109. doi: 10.1007/BF00321072.,,['10.1007/BF00321072 [doi]'],,"['31-CB-74165/CB/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-14413/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-17609/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

Whereas CEM/O and CEM/MTX cells show a 120-fold difference in their susceptibility to methotrexate (as measured by the incorporation of tritiated deoxyuridine into DNA), both lines are equally sensitive to the liposomes. In contrast, proliferation of CEM/MTX cells is not inhibited significantly by methotrexate-gamma-glycerophosphorylethanolamine (MTX-gamma-glyceroPE), the water-soluble analog of MTX-gamma-DMPE. Both the ability of the liposomes to circumvent the transport defect, and the inability of MTX-gamma-glyceroPE to do so, were anticipated on the basis of previous experiments which show that thiamine pyrophosphate could antagonize inhibition of mouse 3T3 and L1210 cell proliferation by methotrexate and MTX-gamma-glyceroPE, but not inhibition by liposomes. Human cells (CEM/O) behave similarly. The present experiments also suggest that liposomes prepared with MTX-gamma-DMPE can partially reverse the methotrexate resistance of CEM/R1 cells that is due to overproduction of the target enzyme.","['Kinsky, S C', 'Hashimoto, K', 'Loader, J E', 'Knight, M S', 'Fernandes, D J']","['Kinsky SC', 'Hashimoto K', 'Loader JE', 'Knight MS', 'Fernandes DJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'DNA Replication/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia', '*Liposomes', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Phosphatidylethanolamines/administration & dosage/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'T-Lymphocytes/*drug effects/metabolism', 'Thiamine Pyrophosphate/pharmacology']",1986/02/21 00:00,1986/02/21 00:01,['1986/02/21 00:00'],"['1986/02/21 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/21 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/21 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1986 Feb 21;885(2):129-35. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(86)90080-7.,"['0 (Liposomes)', '0 (Phosphatidylethanolamines)', '97850-20-9 (methotrexate-gamma-glycerophosphatidylethanolamine)', '97866-97-2 (methotrexate-gamma-1,2-dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamine)', 'Q57971654Y (Thiamine Pyrophosphate)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['0167-4889(86)90080-7 [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(86)90080-7 [doi]']",,['AI-15796/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,

In 87 of these T cell cases, the leukemic cells failed to form at least 20% of sheep erythrocytic rosettes at 4 degrees C. Comparison of clinicopathologic features among PT-, E-PT+, and E+ groups of patients revealed significant differences among them. E-PT+ patients were older than PT- patients, had higher white blood cell counts (WBCs) and were more likely to have a mediastinal mass, and thus contained a higher proportion of poor-risk patients. However, the E-PT+ patients were also significantly different from the more traditionally-defined E+ patients in that they had lower WBCs and hemoglobin levels, and less frequent lymphadenopathy or mediastinal mass. In many respects, then, E-PT+ patients were intermediate in character between PT- and E+ patients. Our findings support the notion that further subclassification of ALL using antibodies recognizing lineage-specific surface determinants will permit recognition of groups of patients with distinct clinicopathologic features that may differ in prognosis or response to therapy.

Exponentially growing CCRF-CEM cells were fractionated into populations enriched for G1 phase cells and S phase cells by centrifugal elutriation. The accumulation of ara-CTP by S phase-enriched cells was 50% greater than in G1-enriched cells. However, the ability of extracts of S phase-enriched cells to phosphorylate ara-C was twice that of G1 phase-enriched cell extracts. As cells passed from G1 to S phase, this disproportionality was significant. As demonstrated in other cell types, deoxycytidine 5'-triphosphate (dCTP) also potently inhibited ara-C phosphorylation in CCRF-CEM cell extracts (Ki = 5.9 microM). Deoxynucleotide pool levels determined by high pressure liquid chromatography showed a 5 microM dCTP concentration in G1-enriched cells, whereas S phase-enriched cells contained 15 microM dCTP. These findings suggest that the lack of proportionality between the accumulation of ara-CTP in whole cells and the increase of ara-C phosphorylation in extracts during the G1 to S phase transition may be caused by more stringent regulation of ara-C phosphorylation in whole cells by the concomitant increase in cellular dCTP concentrations. Because such regulation is unlikely to be observed in cell extracts, these results indicated that assays of ara-C phosphorylating activity in cell extracts represent upper limits for that function in whole cells.

After a 3-day in vitro incubation with IL-2, there was a marked increase in NK activity of mononuclear cells obtained from each of these patients. On the basis of the results it can be hypothesized that susceptibility to infections, which are commonly encountered in HCL patients, may be due in part to a low level of NK activity.

The Pediatric Oncology Group experience with lymphocytic leukemia.,1046-51,"The Pediatric Oncology Group institutions initiated extensive subclassification of cases of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) at diagnosis into laboratory-designated categories. Included was a French-American-British (FAB) classification of all new patients, which was reviewed by a central six-member committee. In addition, on the basis of immunologic criteria, patients were defined as having T-, B-, pre-B-, or ""null"" cell leukemia. Slides from 617 patients were reviewed. Five hundred forty-six (88.5%) were classified as L1, 51 (8.3%) were classified as L2, 9 (1.5%) were classified as L3, and the remainder could not be assigned. Concordance within the committee was good: in 71% of the cases the committee was unanimous, and in an additional 17% only one member disagreed. In only 11 cases (1.8%) was diagreement such that a majority classification could not be assigned. Institutions assigned L2 more frequently. There was a strong correlation with L3 for B-cell disease only. However, four patients had unequivocal B-cell disease and unmistakable L1 morphologic type, whereas one and had L3 morphologic features and had non-B-cell disease. There was no correlation between the other immunologic markers or periodic acid-Schiff stain and FAB classification, nor between L1 or L2 and risk factors. However, for the 248 null cell and pre-B-cell patients, L2 was more frequent among patients in the poor-risk group (P = 0.008). The time to first failure was significantly shorter for patients with L3 morphologic type. The induction failure rate of L2 patients was significantly greater than that of L1 patients (P = 0.016). With analysis of the duration of remission and adjustment for risk factors, the impact of L2 morphologic characteristics on outcome was not significant (P = 0.18) in null cell patients. Even unadjusted for risk factors, there was no impact of L2 morphologic type on outcome in the pre-B-cell phenotype. It can be concluded that other risk factors overshadow the impact of L1 and L2 morphologic features in predicting duration of remission.","['van Eys, J', 'Pullen, J', 'Head, D', 'Boyett, J', 'Crist, W', 'Falletta, J', 'Humphrey, G B', 'Jackson, J', 'Riccardi, V', 'Brock, B']","['van Eys J', 'Pullen J', 'Head D', 'Boyett J', 'Crist W', 'Falletta J', 'Humphrey GB', 'Jackson J', 'Riccardi V', 'Brock B']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/ultrastructure', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/*classification/drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*classification/drug therapy', 'Lymphocytes, Null/immunology', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Prognosis', 'Risk', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology']",1986/03/01 00:00,1986/03/01 00:01,['1986/03/01 00:00'],"['1986/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Mar 1;57(5):1046-51. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860301)57:5<1046::aid-cncr2820570529>3.0.co;2-0.,,['10.1002/1097-0142(19860301)57:5<1046::aid-cncr2820570529>3.0.co;2-0 [doi]'],,"['CA-03713/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-15989/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-28572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,

Infectious complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality among these patients receiving aggressive chemotherapy. In particular, neutropenic enterocolitis or typhlitis has had a reported mortality of 50% to 100%. The authors reviewed a series of 77 previously untreated patients with acute myelogenous leukemia begun on treatment from March 1976 to June 1984 to better define the characteristics of typhlitis and its optimum management. Twenty-five patients had episodes of typhlitis, characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness, occurring during periods of neutropenia. Ten of these patients had watery diarrhea as a major additional symptom, and nine patients had a significant episode of gastrointestinal bleeding. In seven instances, blood culture results were positive, all for intestinal flora. The episodes of typhlitis occurred most frequently during the induction therapy (19 patients). Five patients experienced typhlitis during maintenance therapy, and one patient had acute appendicitis. Two patients had typhlitis during their reinduction therapy, and of note, one had had abdominal symptoms during her initial induction. All patients were treated initially with broad-spectrum antibiotics and bowel rest. Four criteria have been used for surgical intervention: (1) persistent gastrointestinal bleeding after resolution of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and correction of clotting abnormalities; (2) evidence of free intraperitoneal perforation; (3) clinical deterioration requiring support with vasopressors, or large volumes of fluid, suggesting uncontrolled sepsis; and (4) development of symptoms of an intra-abdominal process, in the absence of neutropenia, which would normally require surgery. Using these criteria, five patients required surgical intervention for typhlitis or its sequelae and one for acute appendicitis. There was one perioperative death resulting from miliary tuberculosis. Among the 21 patients managed medically, there was 1 death resulting from typhlitis in a patient in whom surgery was deferred because of her multiple failures to enter remission.","['Shamberger, R C', 'Weinstein, H J', 'Delorey, M J', 'Levey, R H']","['Shamberger RC', 'Weinstein HJ', 'Delorey MJ', 'Levey RH']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Enterocolitis/etiology/surgery/*therapy', 'Female', 'Fever/etiology', 'Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage/complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications', 'Male', 'Neutropenia/complications']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer. 1986 Feb 1;57(3):603-9. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19860201)57:3<603::aid-cncr2820570335>3.0.co;2-k.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],['10.1002/1097-0142(19860201)57:3<603::aid-cncr2820570335>3.0.co;2-k [doi]'],,,,,,,,

Alkaline phosphatase activity in CML neutrophils, assessed cytochemically, increased with the numbers of monocytes. NAP activity was not induced by the interaction between neutrophils and monocytes, but by the presence of a monocyte-derived soluble activity. NAP activity in normal neutrophils was also lowered by depletion of monocytes from culture medium. Under such monocyte-depleted conditions, both CML and normal neutrophils proliferated and differentiated to produce mature neutrophils. Thus induction of NAP activity can be modified in vitro by changing the amount of NAP-inducing activity released from monocytes. However, whether a reduction of NAP-inducing activity in CML neutrophil is the cause of low NAP activity in vivo remains uncertain.","['Matsuo, T']",['Matsuo T'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Alkaline Phosphatase/*blood', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/analysis', 'Granulocytes/enzymology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*enzymology', 'Macrophages/enzymology', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Neutrophils/*enzymology']",1986/02/01 00:00,1986/02/01 00:01,['1986/02/01 00:00'],"['1986/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Blood. 1986 Feb;67(2):492-7.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', 'EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)']",['S0006-4971(20)79028-2 [pii]'],,,,,,,,

These findings are in agreement with previous evidence of a discrepancy in B-CLL between the phenotypic expression, assessed by Leu-7 positivity, and the true functional activity of NK T-cells, and suggest that the Leu-11, A10 and AB8.28 MoAbs correlate well with the depressed NK function found in this disease.","['Foa, R', 'Fierro, M T', 'Lusso, P', 'Raspadori, D', 'Ferrando, M L', 'Matera, L', 'Malavasi, F', 'Lauria, F']","['Foa R', 'Fierro MT', 'Lusso P', 'Raspadori D', 'Ferrando ML', 'Matera L', 'Malavasi F', 'Lauria F']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*immunology', 'Phenotype', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology']",1986/01/01 00:00,1986/01/01 00:01,['1986/01/01 00:00'],"['1986/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1986/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1986/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1986 Jan;62(1):151-4. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb02911.x.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1986.tb02911.x [doi]'],,,,,,,,

On TPA induction, podosomes became clustered in sharply defined areas sitting in the cell center beneath the nucleus. In some cells, long actin-containing protrusions appeared. In HCL cells, F-actin was associated with thin microvilli responsible for the ""hairy"" appearance; occasional cells showed scattered podosomes. On TPA induction, HCL cells sprouted long dendritic processes rich in submembraneous F-actin, which made intertwined networks. Therefore, in both B-CLL and HCL cells, adhesion structures were present and the capacity for adhesion in vitro was marked, which might explain some peculiar clinical features of the diseases. Adhesion structures and adhesive properties never appeared in normal B cells.

The relationship between TS and survival was still observed when patients were stratified according to length of time from diagnosis, risk group, French-American-British (FAB) classification, or presence of organomegaly at diagnosis (p less than 0.001). Similar differences were observed between survival of patients grouped according to their first measured serum ferritin.

In addition, cells were examined for the presence of HLA-A, B, C antigens, Ia antigens and common ALL antigen, as well as Fc receptors capable of binding murine immunoglobulins. Approximately one-third of ANLL specimens lacked any of the mature-cell differentiation markers studied. These were always in the relatively undifferentiated morphological subgroups (M1 and M2). Some of the specimens in these groups also expressed little or no HLA-A, B, C and/or Ia antigen. Of the lineage-specific MAb, FMC32 and FMC34, which bind to monocytes, and monocytes plus granulocytes respectively, gave the most interesting results. Together with the anti-CALLA antibody J5, they contributed to the differential diagnosis of ANLL and ALL. In addition they detected phenotypic heterogeneity within the FAB types of ANLL, particularly the M1 and M2 groups. Binding of murine IgG2a and IgG3 antibodies, apparently via Fc receptors, was commonly observed with ANLL cells.

In 48 patients requiring treatment, there was a significant reduction of B8 when compared to 34 untreated patients, and DR7 was significantly increased in frequency in treated patients. Thirty patients presented with sub-clinical symptoms (Rai stage 0). HLA-A10 was significantly more common than in those patients presenting with more advanced disease (Rai stages 1-4). The highest frequency of any HLA antigen was found in males presenting with clinical symptoms, 71.0 per cent of whom were A2 positive; in the same group, 22.6 per cent of patients were positive for all the antigens A2,B12(44),DR7.

During the observation period of 29 to 68 months, none developed central nervous system (CNS) leukemia. On the other hand, the incidence of CNS leukemia in patients given the prophylactic intrathecal treatment once or twice just after the complete remission was 35% (7/20) compared with 24% (8/33) in patients without treatment. No statistical difference was observed in these groups. The intrathecal administration of MTX and PSL is easy to perform and no adverse reaction was observed in our series.

The supernatant, separated from the K-562 malignant cells cultured in vitro for 48 hours, was lyophilised and extracted with ethanol 80%. This ethanol extract (SE-K562) inhibited neutrophil locomotion. Both random and locomotion induced either by formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (FMLP) or serum were inhibited. SE-K562 was partially purified by Sephadex chromatography and the analysis of the eluted active fraction by SDS electrophoresis led one band of about 8 kd.

To determine the effects of BMF on granulopoiesis, normal bone marrow cells were cultured in agar medium on BMF liquid-phase cultures, and the numbers of CFU-C were counted. BMF from either normal subjects, AL at the time of complete remission (CR) or CML enhanced the growth of CFU-C in a few spontaneous CFU-C groups (less than 3 colonies/10(5) cells), whereas BMF obtained from AL at the time of diagnosis failed to enhance the growth. In contrast, BMF from either normal subjects, AL at the time of diagnosis and CR, or CML inhibited the growth of CFU-C in many spontaneous CFU-C groups (greater than 10 colonies/10(5) cells). BMF from AL at the time of diagnosis showed significantly higher inhibitory effect than those from normal subjects (p less than 0.01). When giant cell tumor-conditioned medium was used as a source of colony stimulating factor, 26 BMF in total from various subjects inhibited the growth of CFU-C except for four cases (two normal subjects and two AL patients at CR).

Clinicohematological remission was obtained in 13 patients, clinicohematological improvement in 16. Thus, a positive effect was achieved in 29 patients (64%).

The inhibition of cell division and the induced maturation produced by these agents appears to be a consequence of inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase, since growth inhibition is reversed and differentiation is prevented by the simultaneous exposure of cells treated with the agents to exogenous guanine or guanosine, which circumvents the effects of blockage of IMP dehydrogenase. However, while the effects mycophenolic acid, a pure IMP dehydrogenase inhibitor with no other biochemical effects, were completely reversed by guanine salvage supplies, cells exposed to ribavirin responded in a different manner. At levels of guanine salvage supplies below 50 microM, growth inhibition and cell differentiation were partially reversed. At salvage supply concentrations greater than 50 microM, while differentiation was completely blocked, the toxicity of ribavirin was increased and cell division was greatly diminished. These results indicate additional biochemical effects for ribavirin unrelated to the inhibition of IMP dehydrogenase, which may be related to its antiviral properties.","['Kerr, S J']",['Kerr SJ'],['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Mol Cell Biochem,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,0364456,IM,"['Benzidines/pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Globins', 'Guanine/pharmacology', 'Guanosine/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/microbiology/*pathology', 'Mycophenolic Acid/pharmacology', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis', 'Ribavirin/*pharmacology', 'Ribonucleosides/*pharmacology']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biochem. 1987 Oct;77(2):187-94. doi: 10.1007/BF00221928.,"['0 (Benzidines)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Ribonucleosides)', '12133JR80S (Guanosine)', '49717AWG6K (Ribavirin)', '5Z93L87A1R (Guanine)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'HU9DX48N0T (Mycophenolic Acid)']",['10.1007/BF00221928 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Dept. of Biochemistry, Biophysics, and Genetics, Univ. of Colo.

The quality of selective decontamination was acceptable with rapid elimination of Enterobacteriaceae from the alimentary tract, only a slight decrease in concentrations of anaerobes in faeces, and a small number of newly acquired transient (twelve isolates in seven patients) or colonizing (six strains with 28 isolates in four patients) aerobic gram-negative rods and Staphylococcus aureus (one isolate) recovered from 672 surveillance cultures from faeces, oral washings and urine. Two of three patients colonized with ofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains developed Pseudomonas infections. A total of twelve acquired infections was observed. Six were microbiologically documented infections, all caused by ofloxacin-resistant bacteria (two P. aeruginosa, two Staphylococcus epidermidis, one Aerococcus viridans, one Micrococcus sp.). Tolerance was acceptable with no serious side effects observed. Mean drug concentrations in serum and saliva were comparable to those determined in healthy volunteers and were found to be higher in saliva than in serum. We conclude that ofloxacin may be studied as an effective alternative to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for selective decontamination and infection prevention in severely granulocytopenic patients. Careful monitoring of colonizing Pseudomonas spp. with decreased ofloxacin sensitivity, however, seems necessary.","['Kern, W', 'Kurrle, E', 'Vanek, E']","['Kern W', 'Kurrle E', 'Vanek E']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Infection,Infection,0365307,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Agranulocytosis/*complications', 'Anti-Bacterial Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bacterial Infections/*prevention & control', 'Enterobacteriaceae/isolation & purification', 'Feces/microbiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Microbial Sensitivity Tests', 'Middle Aged', 'Ofloxacin', 'Oxazines/*therapeutic use', 'Pseudomonas/isolation & purification']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Infection. 1987 Nov-Dec;15(6):427-33. doi: 10.1007/BF01647222.,"['0 (Anti-Bacterial Agents)', '0 (Oxazines)', 'A4P49JAZ9H (Ofloxacin)']",['10.1007/BF01647222 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Medizinische Universitatsklinik und Poliklinik, Ulm.']",,

Dosimetric analysis in cranial radiation prophylaxis.,195-202,"The dose to the ocular lens during standard cranial irradiation prophylaxis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) has been studied both in patients and in an anthropomorphic phantom. Doses to the lens depend on patient set-up and in order that this is minimised, a simple immobilisation technique is recommended. Surface thermoluminescent dosimeter (TLD) measurements seriously underestimate the dose received by the ocular lens. Previous measurements made in a phantom have used a large volume ionisation chamber and therefore the minimum cataractogenic dose of 400 cGy for a fractionated treatment is an underestimate. The exact position of the anterior orbital field margin and thus its distance behind the surface of the eye is also important as regards lens dose. Data from the phantom demonstrate accurately the dose gradient through the eye during standard cranial prophylaxis and may explain the lower incidence of leukaemic relapse in the posterior segment of the eye, and yet explain the persistence of isolated anterior chamber relapses.","['Harnett, A N', 'Hirst, A', 'Plowman, P N']","['Harnett AN', 'Hirst A', 'Plowman PN']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Ireland,Radiother Oncol,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,8407192,IM,"['Anthropometry', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Eye/anatomy & histology/*radiation effects', 'Eye Neoplasms/*radiotherapy', 'Humans', 'Lens, Crystalline/radiation effects', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*radiotherapy', 'Models, Anatomic', 'Orbit/anatomy & histology/radiation effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Skull/anatomy & histology/*radiation effects', 'Thermoluminescent Dosimetry']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Radiother Oncol. 1987 Nov;10(3):195-202. doi: 10.1016/s0167-8140(87)80005-1.,,"['S0167-8140(87)80005-1 [pii]', '10.1016/s0167-8140(87)80005-1 [doi]']",,,,,,"[""Department of Radiotherapy, St. Bartholomew's Hospital, West Smithfield, London, U.K.""]",,

The mechanism of HMBA action is not known. Culture with HMBA causes changes in gene expression which occur during the early ""latent period"", that is, prior to commitment to terminal differentiation. The inducer causes a decrease in diacylglycerol concentration, a decrease in Ca+2 and a decrease in phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C activity (within 2 hr) (Figure 2). There is an early suppression (within 1-2 hrs) of c-myb and c-myc gene transcription and an increase in c-fos mRNA (within 4 hrs). HMBA-induced commitment to terminal differentiation is detected by 12 hrs and over 95% become committed cells by 48 to 60 hrs. Commitment is associated with persistent suppression of c-myb gene transcription and elevated levels of c-fos mRNA whereas the level of c-myc mRNA returns to that of uninduced cells. By 36 to 48 hrs, transcription of alpha 1 and beta maj globin genes is increased 10 to 30 fold, while that of rRNA genes is suppressed. It is not yet clear how the protein products of proto-oncogenes elicit or modify cellular responses. Changes in expression of c-myb, c-myc, c-fos and p53 genes which occur during HMBA-induced differentiation, as well as in several other systems, suggest that products of these genes may have a role in regulating expression of multiple genes. One possible application of the established pattern of HMBA-induced modulation of gene expression during MELC differentiation may be in following the effects of cyto-differentiation agents during treatment of cancers. Phase I and Phase II chemical trials have been initiated to evaluate HMBA as a cytodifferentiation agent in human neoplasms (65). For most human tumors, assay for cytologic evidence of induced differentiation is difficult at best. Following the effects of a differentiation inducing agent by determining c-myc, or c-myb, mRNA levels may provide useful indicators of biological activity of HMBA and be a basis for evaluating whether continued administration of the agent is of interest in terms of potential clinical efficacy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Marks, P A', 'Ramsay, R', 'Sheffery, M', 'Rifkind, R A']","['Marks PA', 'Ramsay R', 'Sheffery M', 'Rifkind RA']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Acetamides/*pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation/*drug effects', 'Genes/*drug effects', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Leukemia, Experimental', 'Mice', 'Proto-Oncogenes/drug effects']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1987;251:253-68.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '9004-22-2 (Globins)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",,,,,,,"['DeWitt Wallace Research Laboratories, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York.']",,

MEL cells normally repress the levels of endogenous mouse vimentin mRNA during inducermediated differentiation, resulting in a subsequent loss of vimentin filaments. Expression of vimentin in differentiating MEL cells reflects the disappearance of vimentin filaments during mammalian erythropoiesis in vivo. In contrast, chicken erythroid cells express high levels of vimentin mRNA and vimentin filaments during terminal differentiation. We demonstrate here that chicken vimentin mRNA levels increase significantly in differentiating transfected MEL cells, whereas similarly transfected hamster vimentin genes are negatively regulated. In conjunction with in vitro nuclear run-on transcription experiments, these results suggest that the difference in vimentin expression in avian and mammalian erythropoiesis is due to a divergence of cis-linked vimentin sequences that are responsible for transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of vimentin gene expression. Transfected chicken vimentin genes produce functional vimentin protein and stable vimentin filaments during MEL cell differentiation, further demonstrating that the accumulation of vimentin filaments is determined by the abundance of newly synthesized vimentin.","['Ngai, J', 'Bond, V C', 'Wold, B J', 'Lazarides, E']","['Ngai J', 'Bond VC', 'Wold BJ', 'Lazarides E']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Chickens', 'Cricetinae', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes', '*Genes, Regulator', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/metabolism', '*Transcription, Genetic', '*Transfection', 'Vimentin/*genetics']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Nov;7(11):3955-70. doi: 10.1128/mcb.7.11.3955-3970.1987.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Vimentin)']",['10.1128/mcb.7.11.3955-3970.1987 [doi]'],,,PMC368064,,,"['Division of Biology, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena 91125.']",,

During protein synthesis eEF-Tu promotes the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosome. To study the expression of the gene(s) for this factor, a genomic clone was isolated that contains a mouse eEF-Tu gene. We screened a phage genomic library with a synthetic oligonucleotide probe complementary to a region of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Artemia sp. eEF-Tu genes which codes for an area that is highly conserved between both yeast and Artemia sp. eEF-Tu. From approximately 75,000 phage plaques we obtained five isolates with apparently identical inserts. All five clones contained a 3.8-kilobase EcoRI fragment that hybridized to additional oligonucleotide probes corresponding to different conserved regions of eEF-Tu. We sequenced the 5' end of one genomic clone and determined the length of the cloned fragment that was protected by eEF-Tu mRNA in S1 nuclease protection assays. A quantitative S1 nuclease protection assay was used to compare the relative steady-state levels of eEF-Tu mRNA in total mRNA in total RNA isolated from hexamethylene-bisacetamide-induced murine erythroleukemia cells. The results show a dramatic reduction in the steady-state level of eEF-Tu mRNA as differentiation proceeds. A similar reduction in transcription of eEF-Tu mRNA was observed in isolated nuclei. Finally, we examined the in vivo synthesis of eEF-Tu during differentiation and found that it declined in a manner parallel to the decline in the steady-state level of eEF-Tu mRNA. In addition, we have isolated and sequenced a cDNA clone for mouse eEF-Tu. The derived amino acid sequence is compared with sequences from other eucaryotes.","['Roth, W W', 'Bragg, P W', 'Corrias, M V', 'Reddy, N S', 'Dholakia, J N', 'Wahba, A J']","['Roth WW', 'Bragg PW', 'Corrias MV', 'Reddy NS', 'Dholakia JN', 'Wahba AJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'Codon', '*Genes', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics/pathology', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Elongation Factor Tu/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Transcription, Genetic']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1987 Nov;7(11):3929-36. doi: 10.1128/mcb.7.11.3929-3936.1987.,"['0 (Codon)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.6.1.- (Peptide Elongation Factor Tu)']",['10.1128/mcb.7.11.3929-3936.1987 [doi]'],,['GM-25451/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],PMC368061,['GENBANK/M17878'],,"['Department of Biochemistry, University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson 39216.']",,

Alterations in fat metabolism with vascular occlusion due to fat embolization, as well as microtraumata and osteoporosis are discussed as etiologic factors. In contrast, aseptic bone necrosis in relation to corticosteroid treatment is rare in children and adolescents. We therefore report 3 patients, aged from 10 to 18 years, suffering from severe aplastic anemia, meningeal relapse after acute lymphocytic leukemia and acute myelocytic leukemia respectively, who developed aseptic bone necrosis 6, 11, and 20 months following the onset of corticoid therapy. The patients survive from 28+ to 50+ months after diagnosis of their initial hematologic disease, as it can be expected today for increasing numbers of patients. We therefore believe, that aseptic bone necrosis may represent a serious therapy related complication and suggest that, diagnostic examination in patients with suspicious complaints of the hip, shoulder or knee should also exclude the possibility of a bone necrosis after leucemic relapse has been ruled out. Since radiological changes only develop several weeks to months after the onset of the clinical symptoms and because of the disabling consequences for patients, misdiagnosed at the beginning, a 99 technetium bone scan should be done as early as possible.

Amputation of the rectum and a permanent abdominal colostomy was made safely, mainly because he had been in complete remission, and he recovered normally after the operation. In recent years, the survival of patients with malignancies has improved due to aggressive treatment even in cases of hematological neoplasms.

Immediately after intensive chemotherapy, the marrow was extremely hypocellular and edematous and contained widely dilated sinuses. Subsequently, areas of large uniform unilocular fat cells developed from multilocular precursor fat cells. Early aggregates of regenerating hemopoietic cells were seen closely adjacent to bony trabeculae (BT) and appeared to grow out from the endosteum in a sequential progression suggesting an origin from their endosteal progenitors. During the early part of hemopoietic regeneration, individual precursor cells appeared to migrate from these hemopoietic aggregates towards the central intertrabecular marrow space where they formed colonies of various hematopoietic cells in close association with fat and marrow sinusoids. Later, as the normal hemopoiesis was restored due to the gradual enlargement and confluence of these hemopoietic colonies, this characteristic pattern of paratrabecular proliferation and migration of cells became less obvious. These observations suggest that hemopoietic regeneration in AML after therapy is a local phenomenon and is initiated by progenitors of endosteal cells.","['Islam, A']",['Islam A'],['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med,Journal of medicine,7505566,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*physiology', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Etoposide/administration & dosage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy', 'Regeneration', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Med. 1987;18(2):108-22.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,"['Department of Medical Oncology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, NY 14263.']",,

Human NK cells are a subpopulation of non-adherent, non-phagocytic lymphocytes defined as large granular lymphocytes (Timonen, Ortaldo & Herberman, 1981). NK cells possess a receptor for the Fc region of IgG (Perussia et al., 1984) that enables them to attack antibody-loaded targets, a process called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The cytotoxic reaction of NK cells can be described as a 'stimulus-secretion' model, divided into three definable steps: binding, triggering for lysis and a killer cell-independent lytic step (Hiserodt, Britvan & Targan, 1982). The killing reaction involves a Ca2+-dependent activation, cytoskeletal rearrangement, activation of the arachidonic acid cascade, release of lysosomal enzymes and a cytotoxic factor(s) (Henkart, 1985) and, possibly, production of reactive oxygen species (Helfand, Werkmeister & Roder, 1982; Roder et al., 1982). The role and involvement of reactive oxygen species is still controversial. To study a possible participation of toxic oxygen species in NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity, we altered target cell anti-oxidant defence mechanisms and measured spontaneous NK-cell mediated cytotoxicity and ADCC reactions against tumour cells. We showed that alteration of target cell anti-oxidant systems had no effect on target cell susceptibility to NK-cell mediated killing. In contrast, the susceptibility of the anti-oxidant-depleted targets to oxygen-dependent polymorphonuclear leucocyte (PMN)-mediated cytotoxicity was increased.","['Van Kessel, K P', 'Van Strijp, J A', 'Van Kats-Renaud, H J', 'Miltenburg, L A', 'Van Der Tol, M E', 'Fluit, A C', 'Verhoef, J']","['Van Kessel KP', 'Van Strijp JA', 'Van Kats-Renaud HJ', 'Miltenburg LA', 'Van Der Tol ME', 'Fluit AC', 'Verhoef J']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Immunology,Immunology,0374672,IM,"['Antibody-Dependent Cell Cytotoxicity/drug effects', 'Antioxidants/pharmacology', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Neutrophils/immunology', 'Oxygen/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Immunology. 1987 Dec;62(4):675-8.,"['0 (Antioxidants)', 'S88TT14065 (Oxygen)']",,,,PMC1454150,,,"['State University of Utrecht, Laboratory of Microbiology, The Netherlands.']",,

Within 1-2 hr after the addition of the inducer hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA), c-myc mRNA levels decrease 10- to 20-fold and remain low until 12-24 hr, at which time the mRNA reaccumulates to its original level. Thereafter as the cells undergo terminal differentiation, c-myc mRNA again declines to a low level. We have investigated the regulation of these changes by measuring c-myc gene transcription and mRNA turnover. We find that the early rapid decline in c-myc mRNA is due to an increase in the block to elongation of transcription within the c-myc first exon. Effective c-myc transcription is then restored after 2 hr of HMBA treatment to the level present in uninduced cells and is maintained throughout the remainder of the differentiation program. These results demonstrate that, except for the rapid decline in c-myc mRNA immediately following inducer treatment, all subsequent regulation of message levels occurs through post-transcriptional mechanisms. Studies of c-myc mRNA turnover suggest that some post-transcriptional regulation is nuclear.","['Nepveu, A', 'Marcu, K B', 'Skoultchi, A I', 'Lachman, H M']","['Nepveu A', 'Marcu KB', 'Skoultchi AI', 'Lachman HM']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Line', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/genetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*genetics', 'Mice', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', '*Transcription, Genetic/drug effects', 'Transfection']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Genes Dev. 1987 Nov;1(9):938-45. doi: 10.1101/gad.1.9.938.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)']",['10.1101/gad.1.9.938 [doi]'],,"['CA16368/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA36246/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA4324601/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['Department of Biochemistry, State University of New York, Stony Brook 11794-5215.']",,

During this time we observe increases in transcriptional activity for 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase, carbonic anhydrase form II, and band 3 coordinate with the large increase in beta-globin gene transcription. The results also demonstrate an early decrease in transcription for carbonic anhydrase form I, which precedes decreases in transcription for glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase and rRNA genes.

Endogenous porphyrin biosynthesis in FELC was induced by supplementation of 5-amino levulinic acid (5-ALA) at a concentration of 5 X 10(-4) M. The main accumulated product, after 4 days culture, was uroporphyrin, while after 8 days culture the cells were loaded with protoporphyrin, up to 1.5 micrograms 10(-7) cells. Photoirradiation of the cells for 2 min, accumulating endogenous porphyrins, induced cardinal deformations and cell disintegration in greater than 95% of the cells, as examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The photodynamic destruction effects were dependent on cultivation time with 5-ALA. Flow cytometry analysis showed an immediate expansion of cell volume subsequent to irradiation, presumably a consequence of water influx. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of photosensitized cells after different time intervals of culture in 5-ALA medium, revealed initial damage to mitochondria and water influx into the nuclear envelope, after 2 days. After 3-4 days in culture the water influx phenomenon was pronounced, chromatin condensation took place and slight rupture of the outer membrane was detected. Cells photosensitized after 5-6 days of culture were completely disintegrated leaving a nuclear remnant and an enormously swollen nuclear envelope. The culture time dependence of the process, showed an interrelationship between the photodynamic effect and porphyrin accumulation sites in cellular compartments. The study presents a specific method for erythroleukaemic cell inactivation.","['Malik, Z', 'Lugaci, H']","['Malik Z', 'Lugaci H']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Aminolevulinic Acid/*metabolism', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Coproporphyrins/biosynthesis', 'Friend murine leukemia virus', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/*therapy/ultrastructure', 'Levulinic Acids/*metabolism', 'Microscopy, Electron', '*Photochemotherapy', 'Porphyrins/*biosynthesis', 'Protoporphyrins/biosynthesis', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism/*radiation effects/ultrastructure', 'Uroporphyrinogens/biosynthesis']",1987/11/01 00:00,1987/11/01 00:01,['1987/11/01 00:00'],"['1987/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1987 Nov;56(5):589-95. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1987.246.,"['0 (Coproporphyrins)', '0 (Levulinic Acids)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '0 (Uroporphyrinogens)', '88755TAZ87 (Aminolevulinic Acid)']",['10.1038/bjc.1987.246 [doi]'],,,PMC2001902,,,"['Department of Life Sciences, Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan, Israel.']",,

Assays were performed at the time CNS disease was discovered and during the subsequent 4 weeks. Three of the seven were also examined 1-3 months before CNS relapse was confirmed. Fourteen children on similar systemic therapy without CNS infiltration served as controls. Prior to and at the onset of CNS disease alpha enolase was elevated in all patients studied. The gamma form was raised in only one beforehand and only three at the time of relapse. The alpha isoenzyme was related to the blast cell count and fell during therapy in all but one child, whereas the gamma was not and showed no significant change. The three patients with raised gamma enolase were the only children with other than common lymphoblastic leukemia. There was no clear indication whether either enzyme concentration had any importance in terms of disease outcome, although one child developed a further CNS relapse 10 months later. He was the only patient whose alpha enolase rose following intrathecal methotrexate. Neuronal disruption due to common lymphoblastic leukemia in the CNS appears to be minimal. Other types of leukemia may give rise to more neuronal damage. The alpha isoenzyme, from glial tissue and malignant cells, may be elevated even in the absence of detectable blasts in the cerebrospinal fluid and may be a sensitive marker of CNS infiltration in such circumstances.","['Royds, J A', 'Collin, R C', 'Timperley, W R', 'Taylor, C B', 'Lilleyman, J S']","['Royds JA', 'Collin RC', 'Timperley WR', 'Taylor CB', 'Lilleyman JS']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Brain Neoplasms/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Child', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*cerebrospinal fluid', 'Phosphopyruvate Hydratase/*cerebrospinal fluid']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leukemia. 1987 Dec;1(12):820-1.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', 'EC 4.2.1.11 (Phosphopyruvate Hydratase)']",,,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,"['Department of Biochemistry, University of Sheffield, U.K.']",,

The activity of glyoxalase I is ca 10-20 times greater than the activity of glyoxalase II under assay conditions. When HL60 and K562 cell lines were incubated with N-methylformamide and 8-carbamoyl-3-methylimidazo-[5,1-d]-1,2,3,5-tetrazin-4(3H)-one (CCRG 81045), substantial changes in the glyoxalase activities were induced. With HL60 cells, treatment with N-methylformamide and CCRG 81045, both of which induce functional differentiation of this cell line, there is a dose-dependent decrease in glyoxalase I activity and a concomitant dose-dependent increase in glyoxalase II activity, both of which are directly proportional to the number of differentiated cells. With K562 cells, N-methylformamide and CCRG 81045 induce an increase in both glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II activities, although only CCRG 81045 induces the appearance of haemoglobin producing cells. N-Methylformamide and CCRG 81045 do not activate or inhibit the activities of glyoxalase I and glyoxalase II from HL60 and K562 cells when studied in cell-free systems. The changes in the glyoxalase activities of HL60 and K562 cells during the incubations therefore appear to be due to alteration in the synthesis and/or regulatory modification of the glyoxalase enzymes induced by N-methylformamide and CCRG 81045. Despite the apparent disparity of the effect of differentiation on the glyoxalase system in the two cell lines, in both cases the glyoxalase I/glyoxalase II activity ratio decreases with the appearance of differentiated cells. Since glyoxalase II catalyses the rate-determining step in the glyoxalase system, this suggests that immature cells have an impaired capacity to metabolise S-D-lactoylglutathione.","['Hooper, N I', 'Tisdale, M J', 'Thornalley, P J']","['Hooper NI', 'Tisdale MJ', 'Thornalley PJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', '*Dacarbazine/*analogs & derivatives', 'Formamides/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Imidazoles/pharmacology', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Lactoylglutathione Lyase/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/enzymology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Lyases/*metabolism', 'Temozolomide', 'Thiolester Hydrolases/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(12):1141-8. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90169-x.,"['0 (Formamides)', '0 (Imidazoles)', '7GR28W0FJI (Dacarbazine)', 'EC 3.1.2.- (Thiolester Hydrolases)', 'EC 3.1.2.6 (hydroxyacylglutathione hydrolase)', 'EC 4.- (Lyases)', 'EC 4.4.1.5 (Lactoylglutathione Lyase)', 'XPE4G7Y986 (methylformamide)', 'YF1K15M17Y (Temozolomide)']",['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90169-x [doi]'],,,,,,"['Pharmaceutical Research Institute, Aston University, Birmingham, U.K.']",,

Differentiation induction therapy is an attractive therapeutic approach in myelodysplasia (MDS) and in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) in the elderly, since it should be possible to increase the production of mature cells, at the expense of precursor cells, without incurring the complications of intensive cytotoxic therapy. Single agent differentiation therapy has, however, not been highly successful. We have therefore investigated the use of synergistic combinations of agents. We treated nine patients (6 with MDS, 3 with AML) with 13-cis-retinoic acid (up to 100 mg/m2/day) in combination with either 6-thioguanine (20-40 mg/day in 14-57 day courses) or with vincristine (1-2 mg as a single injection during a four-day course of RET). Seven patients responded with an increase in the mature cells of at least one haemopoietic lineage. A concomitant decrease in marrow blasts was observed in 3/4 responding patients. The retention of dysplastic and karyotypic abnormalities and lack of a hypoplastic phase all suggested that differentiation induction was occurring in vivo. Prior failure to respond to therapy with single agents (RET in two and cytosine arabinoside in five patients) suggests that the synergy observed in vitro operates in vivo. In-vitro studies on marrow cells from seven patients demonstrated synergistic differentiation induction in 6/7 samples. The seventh patient was one of the two who did not respond clinically. The second of these clinically unresponsive patients had cells which were relatively refractory to RET in vitro, suggesting that in-vivo and in-vitro responses may be related.","['Francis, G E', 'Mufti, G J', 'Knowles, S M', 'Berney, J J', 'Guimaraes, J E', 'Secker-Walker, L M', 'Hamblin, T J']","['Francis GE', 'Mufti GJ', 'Knowles SM', 'Berney JJ', 'Guimaraes JE', 'Secker-Walker LM', 'Hamblin TJ']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*drug therapy/genetics/pathology', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(11):971-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90115-9.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)']",['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90115-9 [doi]'],,['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,"['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London, U.K.']",,

Cloning of the irradiated cells in semi-solid medium showed an exponential dose-response survival curve. Above a threshold dose colony number decreased, although the rate of clonal development and the final size were not affected. The sensitivity of detecting rare surviving cells could be increased by incubating the irradiated cells for several hours in liquid culture followed by concentrating intact cells by gradient sedimentation. Using this procedure, one surviving clonogenic cell could be detected in 10(7) irradiated cells/dish. More than 10 min of irradiation at 773 microV/cm was required to photosensitize the population below detection by this method. The possibility was considered that colonies derived from cells surviving sub-maximal LUV doses represent clones that are resistant to photosensitization, a phenomenon attributed to either inability to take up or metabolize P12, or resistance to the radiation-induced toxicity. Analysis of P12 uptake in the surviving clonal populations showed no significant difference as compared to the parental population. The results suggest that surviving cells reflect a phenotypic heterogeneity caused by variation in the physiological state such as the respective position in the cell cycle and are not genetically resistant mutants.","['Fibach, E', 'Gatt, S']","['Fibach E', 'Gatt S']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Cell Membrane/pathology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Clone Cells/drug effects/radiation effects', 'DNA/biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lauric Acids/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/metabolism/*pathology', 'Microscopy, Electron, Scanning', 'Microscopy, Fluorescence', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', '*Ultraviolet Rays']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(11):1019-26. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90121-4.,"['0 (Lauric Acids)', '69168-45-2 (12-(1-pyrene)dodecanoic acid)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)']",['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90121-4 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Dept of Hematology, Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel.']",,

This paper reports characterization of the LL-1 cells and the in-vivo detection of the leukemia cells transplanted in syngeneic mice. The LL-1 cells are myeloblastic and grow well in suspension culture. Morphological analysis showed that the nucleus of LL-1 cells was almost twice as large as that of the parent line cells. The modal chromosome number of LL-1 cells was 75, and the DNA index determined by flow cytometry was 2.3. The cells were unresponsive to the inducer of differentiation of M1 cells. Transplantation experiments showed that the LL-1 cells were leukemogenic in syngeneic SL mice: ten mice inoculated i.p. with LL-1 cells (4 X 10(6)) all died of leukemia within 6 weeks. The cells in the peritoneal cavity were collected at appropriate times during progression of the leukemia. On microscopic examination the LL-1 cells were clearly distinguishable from normal host cells in the peritoneal cavity by the size of their nucleus. Counts showed that their number decreased markedly during the first 2 weeks after their transplantation, and then increased about ten times in a week. By 4 or 5 weeks after transplantation these LL-1 cells filled the peritoneal cavity. These large-sized leukemia cells that grow in syngeneic mice will be useful for investigating the mechanisms of in-vivo responses of leukemia cells to various therapeutic treatments.","['Hayashi, M', 'Okabe-Kado, J', 'Hozumi, M']","['Hayashi M', 'Okabe-Kado J', 'Hozumi M']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/pathology', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Peritoneal Cavity/pathology', '*Polyploidy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*pathology']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Leuk Res. 1987;11(11):1011-7. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(87)90120-2.,,['10.1016/0145-2126(87)90120-2 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Chemotherapy, Saitama Cancer Center Research Institute, Japan.']",,

After 1-hour activation with visible light, BPD was 10 times more cytotoxic than HP toward human adherent cell lines: A549 lung cancer, Calu-1 lung carcinoma, and CCD-19Lu normal lung, killing 100% of cells at the concentration of 70 ng/ml. Under the same conditions, BPD was 10-70 times more cytotoxic than HP toward nonadherent cells and cell lines. Tested were human leukemia cell lines HL60, K562, and KG1, normal human lymphocytes, and mouse mastocytoma cell line P815. The concentrations required to kill 100% of cells varied between 10 and 500 ng BPD/ml and between 0.2 and 10 micrograms HP/ml. The difference between the nonadherent cell lines in respect to their sensitivity to phototoxicity of both BPD and HP seemed to be related to the cell sizes, with the smallest cells being the most vulnerable. The most attractive characteristic of BPD in addition to its powerful phototoxicity is its maximum absorption around 700 nm, which is in the range of wavelengths penetrating tissues the best. This characteristic alone could make BPD a drug of choice in cancer photodynamic therapy when the safety of its use is ensured. Preliminary tests in vivo have shown that DBA/2J mice can tolerate a single ip injection of 20-60 micrograms BPD as well as the same dose of HP. The biodistribution and toxicity studies of BPD are under way in our laboratory.","['Richter, A M', 'Kelly, B', 'Chow, J', 'Liu, D J', 'Towers, G H', 'Dolphin, D', 'Levy, J G']","['Richter AM', 'Kelly B', 'Chow J', 'Liu DJ', 'Towers GH', 'Dolphin D', 'Levy JG']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Hematoporphyrins/*toxicity', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Lymphocytes/drug effects/radiation effects', 'Porphyrins/*toxicity']",1987/12/01 00:00,1987/12/01 00:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Dec;79(6):1327-32.,"['0 (Hematoporphyrins)', '0 (Porphyrins)', '113719-89-4 (benzoporphyrin D)']",,,,,,,"['Department of Microbiology, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",,

The cases either were reported to one of 17 population-based cancer registries or were treated in any of 16 oncologic clinics in Canada, Europe, and the United States. Four controls were individually matched to each of 195 cases of leukemia on the basis of age and calendar year when diagnosed with cervical cancer and survival time. Leukemia diagnoses were verified by one hematologist. Radiation dose to active bone marrow was estimated by medical physicists on the basis of the original radiotherapy records of study subjects. The risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, one of the few malignancies without evidence for an association with ionizing radiation, was not increased [relative risk (RR) = 1.03; n = 52]. However, for all other forms of leukemia taken together (n = 143), a twofold risk was evident (RR = 2.0; 90% confidence interval = 1.0-4.2). Risk increased with increasing radiation dose until average doses of about 400 rad (4 Gy) were reached and then decreased at higher doses. This pattern is consistent with experimental data for which the down-turn in risk at high doses has been interpreted as due to killing of potentially leukemic cells. The dose-response information was modeled with various RR functions, accounting for the nonhomogeneous distribution of radiation dose during radiotherapy. The local radiation doses to each of 14 bone marrow compartments for each patient were incorporated in the models, and the corresponding risks were summed. A good fit to the observed data was obtained with a linear-exponential function, which included a positive linear induction term and a negative exponential term. The estimate of the excess RR per rad was 0.9%, and the estimated RR at 100 rad (1 Gy) was 1.7. The model proposed in this study of risk proportional to mass exposed and of risk to an individual given by the sum of incremental risks to anatomic sites appears to be applicable to a wide range of dose distributions. Furthermore, the pattern of leukemia incidence associated with different levels of radiation dose is consistent with a model postulating increasing risk with increasing exposure, modified at high doses by increased frequency of cell death, which reduces risk.","['Boice, J D Jr', 'Blettner, M', 'Kleinerman, R A', 'Stovall, M', 'Moloney, W C', 'Engholm, G', 'Austin, D F', 'Bosch, A', 'Cookfair, D L', 'Krementz, E T', 'Latourette, H B', 'Peters, L J', 'Schulz, M D', 'Lundell, M', 'Pettersson, F', 'Storm, H H', 'Bell, C M', 'Coleman, M P', 'Fraser, P', 'Palmer, M', 'Prior, P', 'Choi, N W', 'Hislop, T G', 'Koch, M', 'Robb, D', 'Robson, D', 'Spengler, R F', 'von Fournier, D', 'Frischkorn, R', 'Lochmuller, H', 'Pompe-Kirn, V', 'Rimpela, A', 'Kjorstad, K', 'Pejovic, M H', 'Sigurdsson, K', 'Pisani, P', 'Kucera, H', 'Hutchison, G B']","['Boice JD Jr', 'Blettner M', 'Kleinerman RA', 'Stovall M', 'Moloney WC', 'Engholm G', 'Austin DF', 'Bosch A', 'Cookfair DL', 'Krementz ET', 'Latourette HB', 'Peters LJ', 'Schulz MD', 'Lundell M', 'Pettersson F', 'Storm HH', 'Bell CM', 'Coleman MP', 'Fraser P', 'Palmer M', 'Prior P', 'Choi NW', 'Hislop TG', 'Koch M', 'Robb D', 'Robson D', 'Spengler RF', 'von Fournier D', 'Frischkorn R', 'Lochmuller H', 'Pompe-Kirn V', 'Rimpela A', 'Kjorstad K', 'Pejovic MH', 'Sigurdsson K', 'Pisani P', 'Kucera H', 'Hutchison GB']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/radiation effects', 'Brachytherapy/adverse effects', 'Europe', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*etiology', 'Middle Aged', 'Radiotherapy/*adverse effects', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Registries', 'Risk Factors', 'United States', 'Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",1987/12/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1987/12/01 00:00'],"['1987/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1987/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1987 Dec;79(6):1295-311.,,,,"['N01-CP01047/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP11017/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'N01-CP31035/CP/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,"['Radiation Epidemiology Branch, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",,

We have copurified a membrane-associated tyrosine kinase (p93) and an activity associated with both the cytosol and membrane fractions (p60). Triton X-100 extracts from HL-60 cells treated with dimethyl sulfoxide were subjected to tyrosine-agarose chromatography, polypropyl aspartamide high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and HPLC using an antiphosphotyrosine IgG-derivatized column. Overall purification was 2700-fold for p93 and 1800-fold for p60. p60 and p93 are phosphorylated exclusively on tyrosine residues and can use poly(Glu,Tyr)4:1, histone H1 and vasoactive intestinal peptide as substrates. Poly(Glu,Tyr)1:1 and poly(Glu,Ala,Tyr)6:3:1 were less effective substrates for p60 and p93. The activity of p93 was dependent on Mg2+ or Mn2+, whereas p60 was dependent on Mg2+; however, the activity of p60 was stimulated in a synergistic manner by the presence of both Mg2+ and Mn2+, whereas the activity of p93 was not enhanced further by the combination of divalent ions. Both p60 and p93 were immunoprecipitated by an anti-v-src monoclonal antibody but only p93 was immunoprecipitated by an anti-v-fps/fes antibody. V8 protease digestion of p60 revealed one major proteolytic fragment containing phosphotyrosine, whereas V8 protease digestion of p93 produced two major peptides that were phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. These results suggest that, although p93 and p60 may possess some epitopic similarities, they have distinguishing phosphorylation sites. Moreover, p93, in contrast to p60, appears to be strictly associated with granulocytic/monocytic differentiation and related to the cellular fps/fes protooncogene.","['Yu, G', 'Glazer, R I']","['Yu G', 'Glazer RI']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Chromatography, Affinity', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Isoenzymes/*isolation & purification', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*enzymology', 'Magnesium/pharmacology', 'Manganese/pharmacology', 'Protein-Tyrosine Kinases/*isolation & purification', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*enzymology']",1987/12/25 00:00,1987/12/25 00:01,['1987/12/25 00:00'],"['1987/12/25 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/12/25 00:01 [medline]', '1987/12/25 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1987 Dec 25;262(36):17543-8.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '42Z2K6ZL8P (Manganese)', 'EC 2.7.10.1 (Protein-Tyrosine Kinases)', 'I38ZP9992A (Magnesium)']",['S0021-9258(18)45415-4 [pii]'],,,,,,"['Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, Maryland 20892.']",,

Morphology and cytochemistry lost their prognostic value they had in those patients treated before October 1971. In the children treated in the seventies, the WBC became the most important prognostic factor, followed by infiltrate size and age. (Age was less important than infiltrates for remission duration, but more for survival.) Immunological markers were evaluated in 56 children, since 1974. Because of the small number, no significance as risk factor was found. Those 25% with E+ blasts tended to have only a slightly worse course than ""non-T-non-B""-ALL. Treatment became a highly significant risk factor, because of the improvement in results between those patients treated with CALGB protocol 6801 and those on protocol 7111. Two steps were responsible for this: better treatment strategies, and, most important, CNS-prophylaxis (or ""sanctuary""-treatment) in all patients. Even in the sixties, where IT methotrexate alone was given sporadically, omitting the CNS-prophylaxis represented an important risk factor. Since 1971, most patients received cranial irradiation or intermediate dose methotrexate as second mode of CNS-prophylaxis. This resulted in a significant decrease in the incidence of CNS relapse. CNS-prophylaxis mode therefore represented a significant prognostic factor, although age, WBC and infiltrates had become more important. Evaluation of the clinical and hematological data gave the following limits for an increased or lesser risk: WBC over 30.G/l: high risk, under 10.G/l: favourable. Age: below 1 year and over 10 years: high risk, 1-2 years: probably moderately increased risk. Infiltrates: no palpable hepatosplenomegaly and no lymph nodes: favourable, all palpable infiltrates: ""standard"" or increased risk. Platelets (under 30.G/l) represented a minor good risk factor.

Azurophil granulation of blasts is one of the cardinal features which differentiate acute myeloid from acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. Although such granulation of lymphoblasts has caused diagnostic confusion in the past, we found that the granules could be distinguished from myeloid azurophil granules both morphologically and by their characteristic cytochemical staining reactions. They were negative for peroxidase/sudan black and chloroacetate esterase, but gave coarse scattered granular positivity for both acid phosphatase and alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase. Both the electron microscopic appearance of the granules and their cytochemical staining reactions suggested that they were lysosomes. Granular ALL does not appear to be associated with any morphological subtype or karyotype; but is strongly associated with the common ALL phenotype. Its prognostic significance remains uncertain. It occurs more frequently than the small number of previous reports might suggest and, given the potential for misdiagnosis, should be more widely recognised.","['Hay, C R', 'Barnett, D', 'James, V', 'Woodcock, B W', 'Brown, M J', 'Lawrence, A C']","['Hay CR', 'Barnett D', 'James V', 'Woodcock BW', 'Brown MJ', 'Lawrence AC']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",England,Eur J Haematol,European journal of haematology,8703985,IM,"['Adult', 'Cytoplasmic Granules/*ultrastructure', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/immunology/*pathology', 'Male', 'Microscopy, Electron', 'Middle Aged']",1987/10/01 00:00,1987/10/01 00:01,['1987/10/01 00:00'],"['1987/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Eur J Haematol. 1987 Oct;39(4):299-305. doi: 10.1111/j.1600-0609.1987.tb00773.x.,,['10.1111/j.1600-0609.1987.tb00773.x [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Haematology, Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, U.K.']",,

Peak plasma ADM concentrations after bolus injections were 1640 +/- 470 ng/ml (n = 7).

The final cellular ADM half-life was approximately 85-110 h. After long-term infusion and bolus injection of the same dose, similar areas under the curve for plasma or leukemic blast cell ADM concentrations were attained.

Long-term ADM infusion deserves more attention in the treatment of patients with anthracyclines.","['Speth, P A', 'Linssen, P C', 'Boezeman, J B', 'Wessels, H M', 'Haanen, C']","['Speth PA', 'Linssen PC', 'Boezeman JB', 'Wessels HM', 'Haanen C']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bone Marrow/metabolism', 'Doxorubicin/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1987/01/01 00:00,1987/01/01 00:01,['1987/01/01 00:00'],"['1987/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1987/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1987/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1987;20(4):305-10. doi: 10.1007/BF00262581.,['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)'],['10.1007/BF00262581 [doi]'],,,,,,"['Department of Hematology, St. Radboud University Hospital, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",,

One other patient with plasma cell leukaemia (PCL) was studied during an initial relapse phase and later during the leukaemic terminal phase. PC Ts was 18.8 +/- 3.7 (from 13.3 to 25.0) hr and PC LI was 2.5 +/- 1.8% (from 1.0 to 6.3%). In the case of PCL, circulating PC had a Ts of 14.4 hr and a LI of 3.1. From these experimental measurements, the fractional turnover rate (FTR-percentage of cells produced per unit time) and the potential doubling time (Td) of BMPC were calculated assuming that all BMPC were in a steady-state at the time of the study. BMPC FTR was 3.53 +/- 2.3% cells per day (from 1.2 to 6.72) and BMPC Td was 46.8 +/- 27.5 days (from 15.0 to 75.4). Comparison with results obtained in BM blasts of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) indicated that BMPC had a lower proliferative activity (P less than 0.001), although BMPC Ts was not significantly different. In two patients a tumour doubling time of 6 and 13 months was determined by clinical follow up. Comparison of this parameter with Td showed a cell loss factor of more than 90% in both patients.

Previous studies had shown that ESb-M cells were very similar to ESb cells in terms of cell surface marker expression and invasive capacity in vitro, but studies in vivo revealed that they exerted a decreased metastatic capacity. Syngeneic animals inoculated SC with ESb-M cells developed larger primary tumors and survived much longer than animals inoculated similarly with ESb cells. When using the lectin soybean agglutinin (SBA), distinct differences were observed in the glycosylation of a 220 kDa and a 80 kDa cell surface glycoprotein. Further differences in expression of cell membrane proteins were detected by means of variant-specific monoclonal antibodies. These specific ligands reacted with 65-75 kDa membrane glycoproteins, which were more prominent in ESb-M cells than in ESb cells. Apart from these differences, the two cell lines showed very similar profiles of membrane glycoproteins and lectin staining. Whether the structural differences seen in cell surface proteins can explain the changes in functional behavior (metastatic behavior and plastic-adhesive properties) of the cells remains to be investigated.","['Lang, E', 'Altevogt, P', 'Schirrmacher, V']","['Lang E', 'Altevogt P', 'Schirrmacher V']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer Detect Prev Suppl,"Cancer detection and prevention.

All normal cells investigated were not affected in the concentration range (1-10 micrograms/ml) that was cytotoxic for most tumor cells studied. In vivo, antimalignant and antimetastatic actions have been documented in the Meth A sarcoma, L1210 leukemia, B 16 melanoma and the 3Lewis-lung carcinoma tumor models, respectively.

Of 162 such cases (46.5% of the total population that were screened by MAbs), only 39 (11.2%) remained undetected by PAbs, with values as high as 3-4 ng/ml. CEA PAbs thus enabled a more subtle analysis of values in the lower range, a potentially useful factor in screening. In 18 screenees (5.1%) the values were above 2 SD of the mean by MAbs against 13 by PAbs; values above 3 SD were present in three by MAbs and in none by PAbs. In 14 of 18 cases high CEA values were related to smoking and to chronic gastrointestinal disease. The suggested specificity of CEA MAbs for cancer cells thus could not be confirmed because no cancer was detected in this series. Elevated tissue polypeptide antigen values were observed in 14 individuals and were not correlated with either CEA or smoking.
