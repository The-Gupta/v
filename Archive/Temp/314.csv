Initial clinical features, hemogram, RBC mass, B12 levels, neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP), and therapy given were studied for association with development of acute leukemia. There were 25 males and mean age at diagnosis was 61.4 years. Initial Hg was 18.38 +/- 1.86 g/dl, WBC 16.44 +/- 12.92 (x 1,000/mm3), platelets 632.94 +/- 303.81 (x 1,000/mm3), B12 1,030.93 +/- 445.20 pg/ml, and neutrophil alkaline phosphatase (NAP) score 136.63 +/- 55.14. Twenty-three patients were treated with phlebotomy alone and 25 received additional myelosuppressive therapy as follows--2 received p32 alone, 4 alkylating agents alone, 8 hydroxyurea (HU) alone, and 11 received 2 or more (multiple) of these agents. None of those treated with phlebotomy alone but 6 of 25 (24%) patients given myelosuppressive therapy developed acute leukemia (P = .03) after a mean period of 46.8 months from start of myelosuppressive therapy. Four of the 11 patients (36%) receiving multiple agent therapy developed acute leukemia (P = .019). Initial hemoglobin levels, but not the other clinical parameters, were significantly higher in patients who developed acute leukemia (P = .002), and this difference persisted in various subgroups receiving myelosuppressive therapy. Thus, high initial hemoglobin and use of any myelosuppressive therapy are associated with an increased risk of leukemic transformation in polycythemia vera. This risk becomes substantial with the use of two or more myelosuppressive agents. Since myelosuppressive therapy does not prolong survival, its role in the management of polycythemia vera should be reexamined.","['Nand, S', 'Messmore, H', 'Fisher, S G', 'Bird, M L', 'Schulz, W', 'Fisher, R I']","['Nand S', 'Messmore H', 'Fisher SG', 'Bird ML', 'Schulz W', 'Fisher RI']","['Department of Medicine, Loyola University of Chicago, Stritch School of Medicine, Maywood, Illinois.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyurea/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Polycythemia Vera/*complications/drug therapy', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Risk Factors']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830340108 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1990 May;34(1):32-6. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830340108.,['X6Q56QN5QC (Hydroxyurea)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surface markers were studied by CD34, CD13, CD14, CD15, and CD33 monoclonal antibodies. There was no strict correlation with the FAB typing, but CD34 was expressed only in refractory anemia with excess of blasts (RAEB) or RAEB in transformation (RAEB-t). CD14 was markedly positive in the 4 cases of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Colony-forming cells were assessed by culture in semi-solid medium in the presence of HTB9 as growth factor. Four growth patterns were identified: a) normal growth (6 cases); b) no growth or low plating efficiency (10 cases); c) low colony and high cluster number (15 cases); and d) normal or high colony number with high number of clusters (4 cases). Expression of CD34 was associated with low colony and high cluster number. Finally we studied the proliferation and differentiation capacities in liquid culture without stimulating factor. Fifteen patients had a spontaneous proliferation. This was not correlated with any surface marker. Differentiation assessed by the loss of CD34 and/or the increase of CD15 by more than 20% at day 7 was observed in 21 cases. None of the surface markers or growth patterns was associated with a specific chromosomal abnormality, except the lack of growth in liquid culture observed in all 5q deletion cases. In univariate analysis, RAEB and RAEB-t FAB subtypes, percentage of blasts higher than 5%, staining by CD33 and CD34, and lack of differentiation in liquid culture were significantly associated with progression to leukemia and shorter survival. In multivariate analysis, only CD34 expression (P = .002) and percentage of blasts (P = .05) remained independent significant variables. CD34 was the only significant variable for prediction of survival (P = .05). It is concluded that surface marker analysis at diagnosis and after liquid culture may be a useful tool for the initial evaluation of MDS.","['Guyotat, D', 'Campos, L', 'Thomas, X', 'Vila, L', 'Shi, Z H', 'Charrin, C', 'Gentilhomme, O', 'Fiere, D']","['Guyotat D', 'Campos L', 'Thomas X', 'Vila L', 'Shi ZH', 'Charrin C', 'Gentilhomme O', 'Fiere D']","[""Service d'Hematologie, Hopital Edouard Herriot, Lyon, France.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Hematol,American journal of hematology,7610369,IM,"['Antigens, CD/immunology', 'Antigens, Differentiation/analysis', 'Antigens, Surface/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cell Division', 'Chromosome Aberrations/diagnosis', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Chromosomes/ultrastructure', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/cytology/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/diagnosis/mortality/pathology', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*immunology/pathology/physiopathology']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ajh.2830340107 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Hematol. 1990 May;34(1):26-31. doi: 10.1002/ajh.2830340107.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Antigens, Surface)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Patients who smoked for five or more pack/years within the ten years preceding, or after the diagnosis of CML, were defined as smokers. Adequate smoking histories were obtained on 122 patients. Eighty-seven of these were non-smokers and 35 were smokers by the above criteria. The smoking group had a higher predominance of males, an older median age, and were diagnosed earlier in the course of the 20 year study. Seventy-two patients had died at the time of analysis. All but one, a non-smoker, died from the development of blast crisis. The overall median actuarial survival was significantly reduced for smokers (35 months) as compared to non-smokers (47 months). This was particularly striking for patients who had succumbed to the disease, with a median survival of 30 months in smokers versus 46 months in non-smokers.

Labeling experiments in vitro with [3H]thymidine demonstrated DNA cleavage in erythroid progenitor cells that was accompanied by DNA repair and synthesis.

In the absence of erythropoietin, erythroid progenitor cells accumulated DNA cleavage fragments characteristic of those found in programmed cell death (apoptosis) by 2 to 4 hours and began dying by 16 hours. In the presence of erythropoietin, the progenitor cells survived and differentiated into reticulocytes.

The highest levels of RTVL-H-related RNAs were observed in teratocarcinoma cell line NTera2D1, HeLa cells, two bladder carcinoma cell lines, and normal amniotic tissue. Expression was also observed in normal chorion and in some other cell lines. The RTVL-H transcription pattern varied among the different cell types, but several expressed a unit-length 5.6-kilobase transcript. Characterization of cDNA clones corresponding to transcripts present in NTera2D1 cells indicates that the complex transcription pattern observed in these cells is generated by the following: (i) transcription of both full-length and deleted genomic elements, which is initiated within the 5' long terminal repeat (LTR) and, in all but one case, polyadenylated in the 3' LTR; (ii) the splicing of both unit-length transcripts and transcripts from a deleted element; (iii) transcription involving solo LTR sequences; and (iv) transcription which, in one case, reads through the 3' LTR into flanking cellular sequences. Sequence data obtained from 25 cDNA clones revealed that at least 13 RTVL-H elements are expressed in NTera2D1 cells. The positions of several termination codons within the pol region are the same among nine different elements, indicating that an ancestral RTVL-H element bearing these mutations dispersed within the genome.

The clinical effect and pharmacokinetics of intermediate dose Ara-C therapy in this patient were discussed. A 55-year-old male with acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (M2) achieved complete remission by combination chemotherapy of Behenoyl-ara-C, Daunorubicin, 6-Mercaptopurine and Prednisolone in July, 1985. He subsequently received consolidation and intensification therapy with periodical intrathecal injection of Methotrexate (MTX), but 13 months later he developed his first CNS recurrence which was resistant to the intrathecal administration of Ara-C and MTX. As he also relapsed systemically, Ara-C was administered in intermediate dose (1 g/m2 every 12 hrs for 5 days) and he achieved complete remission both in the CNS and systemic manifestations. Six months later he was diagnosed as having a second CNS recurrence and another systemic relapse. Intermediate dose Ara-C was administered again, and he achieved complete remission in the CNS and partial remission in systemic manifestations. Pharmacokinetic study revealed high peaks of Ara-C concentration in plasma (6.2 microM immediately after the end of the infusion) and high degree of its penetration into the CNS (5.6 microM at 3 hr after the end of the infusion) suggesting the effective and perhaps a uniform level of Ara-C is achieved throughout the CNS by this therapy. In 3 other patients without CNS involvement 0.88 +/- 0.44 microM of Ara-C, which is enough concentrations for its cytostatic effect, was detected at 3 hr after the end of infusion, suggesting the efficacy of the therapy for CNS prophylaxis. In this case the relapse occurred after repeated administration of antileukemic drugs, including Behenoyl-ara-C, an analog of Ara-C, and was resistant to the intrathecal administration of Ara-C. These findings suggest that intermediate dose Ara-C therapy was effective to overcome a resistance to antileukemic drugs, including Ara-C, and also, in some cases, more effective than intrathecal injection of antileukemic drugs for the treatment of CNS leukemia.","['Fukushima, T', 'Ueda, T', 'Kamiya, K', 'Yoshida, W', 'Tsutani, H', 'Uchida, M', 'Nakamura, T', 'Kagawa, D', 'Domae, N']","['Fukushima T', 'Ueda T', 'Kamiya K', 'Yoshida W', 'Tsutani H', 'Uchida M', 'Nakamura T', 'Kagawa D', 'Domae N']","['1st Department of Internal Medicine, Fukui Medical School.']",['jpn'],"['Case Reports', 'English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Nihon Gan Chiryo Gakkai Shi,Nihon Gan Chiryo Gakkai shi,7505713,IM,"['Cytarabine/cerebrospinal fluid/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Middle Aged']",1990/01/20 00:00,1990/01/20 00:01,['1990/01/20 00:00'],"['1990/01/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/20 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/20 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Nihon Gan Chiryo Gakkai Shi. 1990 Jan 20;25(1):126-31.,['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro, GAH caused concentration-dependent inhibition of L1210 cell growth, with complete cell death being reached at 72 hr and at a 500 microM concentration. A minimal incubation time of 38 hr with 500 microM GAH was necessary to obtain complete cell death at 72 hr. During incubation, GAH is metabolized to hydroxylamine. Hydroxylamine acts as the active form of GAH, since the concentration-dependent inhibition of cell growth caused by hydroxylamine is the same as that observed with GAH. The cytotoxic effects of GAH and hydroxylamine on L1210 cells were not reversed or prevented by L-glutamine or L-glutamic acid and purine nucleosides but were prevented or reversed by pyruvate, 2-oxaloacetate and 2-oxoglutarate. In vivo, GAH considerably increased survival of mice bearing L1210 leukemia or a solid tumor, the B16 melanoma. Antitumor activity of GAH against L1210 leukemia and B16 melanoma was schedule-dependent. The administration of GAH 3 times daily was more effective than a twice daily treatment and the maximum ILS was observed using split-dose schedules on days 1 through 3 and 7 through 9 without noticeable toxicity. Under these conditions hydroxylamine is highly toxic, suggesting that in vivo GAH might act as an hydroxylamine releaser in the tumor cells and is not significantly metabolized in the body.","['Vila, J', 'Thomasset, N', 'Navarro, C', 'Dore, J F']","['Vila J', 'Thomasset N', 'Navarro C', 'Dore JF']","['INSERM U.218, Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists', 'Glutamates/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Hydroxamic Acids/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*therapeutic use', 'Hydroxylamine', 'Hydroxylamines/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy/metabolism/mortality', 'Melanoma, Experimental/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/pathology']",1990/04/15 00:00,1990/04/15 00:01,['1990/04/15 00:00'],"['1990/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910450428 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1990 Apr 15;45(4):737-43. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910450428.,"['0 (Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists)', '0 (Glutamates)', '0 (Hydroxamic Acids)', '0 (Hydroxylamines)', '1955-67-5 (glutamate-gamma-hydroxamic acid)', '2FP81O2L9Z (Hydroxylamine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In humans, two mdr genes, mdr1 and mdr3, with approximately 80% nucleotide homology, have been identified. There is increasing evidence that overexpression of the mdr1 gene plays a role in resistance to anticancer agents in specific tumor types. However, currently no data are available on a possible role for mdr3 in drug resistance. Here we report high levels of expression of mdr3 gene sequences in leukemic cells from 6 out of 6 patients with prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL). No mdr1 expression was detected in 5 out of 6 of these samples, whereas a low level of mdr1 expression was found in a sample from one PLL patient in the course of transformation to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Except for this patient, all other PLL cases studied had not received prior chemotherapy. In vitro drug uptake studies showed that daunorubicin accumulation in PLL cells was increased by cyclosporin A. Since cyclosporin A is an inhibitor of the mdr1-encoded P-glycoprotein drug pump, these data suggest that in PLL cells mdr3 also codes for a drug efflux pump. Our findings could partly explain the primary refractoriness of PLL to chemotherapy.","['Nooter, K', 'Sonneveld, P', 'Janssen, A', 'Oostrum, R', 'Boersma, T', 'Herweijer, H', 'Valerio, D', 'Hagemeijer, A', 'Baas, F']","['Nooter K', 'Sonneveld P', 'Janssen A', 'Oostrum R', 'Boersma T', 'Herweijer H', 'Valerio D', 'Hagemeijer A', 'Baas F']","['Radiobiological Institute TNO, Rijswijk, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Cancer,International journal of cancer,0042124,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Cyclosporins/*pharmacology', 'Daunorubicin/metabolism', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Female', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Leukemic', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/*genetics/metabolism', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'RNA, Messenger/*analysis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/*analysis']",1990/04/15 00:00,1990/04/15 00:01,['1990/04/15 00:00'],"['1990/04/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/ijc.2910450409 [doi]'],ppublish,Int J Cancer. 1990 Apr 15;45(4):626-31. doi: 10.1002/ijc.2910450409.,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Blast cells from 16 acute leukemias were stimulated with cytokines as follows: 13 acute myeloid leukemias (AML) and 3 chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in blastic phase (1 lymphoid, 2 myeloid) were treated with recombinant human granulocyte colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF), recombinant human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (rhG-CSF, AMGEN, 500 U/ml each), and recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhIL-3, IMMUNEX, 20 ng/ml), alone and in combination. After 48 h, at the time of maximal DNA synthesis, Ara-C (10(-3) M) was added and cell counts, cytokinetics (DNA/RNA, DNA/bromodeoxyuridine and DNA/Ki67 flow cytometry), and cell viability/clonogenicity (fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide exclusion flow cytometry) were investigated. In all 13 cases of AML recruitment was found; in 6 of these cases over a three fold increase in S phase (P = 0.008) and a significant (P = 0.004) depletion of G0 was demonstrated. In 9 of 13 patients with AML, the effect of Ara-C was investigated, and in 3 of 5 patients with over three fold increase in S phase, Ara-C toxicity was enhanced. None of the patients with less than a three fold increase in S phase and no demonstrable recruitment from G0 had increased Ara-C cytotoxicity. Ara-C cytoreduction was paralled by reduction in clonogenicity as demonstrated by fluorescein diacetate/propidium iodide (FDA/PI) flow cytometry. Four samples of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated with low molecular weight B-cell growth factor (15 kDa) and recruitment of aneuploid cells from G0 to G1 was found in all patients (from 19.3% to 84.9%). These results indicate that recruitment of leukemic cells is inducible by cytokines and that the cytotoxicity of cell cycle-specific drugs such as Ara-C can be increased. This concept is presently being tested in vivo.","['Andreeff, M', 'Tafuri, A', 'Hegewisch-Becker, S']","['Andreeff M', 'Tafuri A', 'Hegewisch-Becker S']","['Leukemia Cell Biology Laboratory, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, Cornell University Medical College New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Haematol Blood Transfus,Haematology and blood transfusion,101169459,IM,"['Adult', 'Blast Crisis/*pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Child', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/*pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-4/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/978-3-642-74643-7_137 [doi]'],ppublish,Haematol Blood Transfus. 1990;33:747-62. doi: 10.1007/978-3-642-74643-7_137.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']","['CA 20194/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 38980/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 41305/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In thirty-three patients who were followed up for more than 3 months, we found that the incidence of moderate to severe acute GVHD (9.1%) and IP (two cases, 4.7%) were low. No VOD occurred in our series.

Maintenance therapy was given for 3 years and consisted of daily 6-mercaptopurine, weekly methotrexate and monthly intrathecal therapy, with drug intensification comprising either vincristine, Adriamycin and l-asparaginase (VAA) or cyclophosphamide, vincristine, cytosine arabinoside and prednisone (COAP). Complete remission (CR) was obtained in 59 patients (69%) and only the French-American-British (FAB) L1 morphology was a significant predictive factor (P = 0.048). Twenty-three patients failed to achieve CR and of these 12 had primary drug resistance. Median follow-up is currently 260 weeks, median predicted survival of all patients is 58 weeks and for those who achieved CR it is 104 weeks. Median duration of CR is 70 weeks. Of the prognostic factors for survival, only FAB L1 subtype was significant. Bone marrow relapses occurred in 29 patients, and of these 9 (31%) achieved CR. There has been CNS relapse in two patients and both have died. Eleven patients continue in CR off therapy, with a median of 152 weeks. This regimen is effective, with acceptable toxicity, and a number of patients are potentially cured.

Mafosfamide is presently used for the purging of bone marrow in autologous bone marrow transplantation in the treatment of acute leukemia. We studied the SCE-inducing effect of mafosfamide on leukemic cells of Philadelphia (Ph)-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) as a model for leukemic cells. Corresponding data from normal bone marrow were analyzed for comparison. A positive linear correlation (r = 0.99, P = 0.0005) was found between the dose of mafosfamide and induced SCE in Ph-positive CML and normal bone marrow. The concentration of mafosfamide used was 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 micrograms/ml. Additionally, we analyzed five cases of CML and six cases of normal bone marrow. A significant difference in the frequency of induced SCE/metaphase was found between CML and normal bone marrow even after addition of 0.8 micrograms/ml mafosfamide. Also, spontaneous SCE was significantly lower in CML.

The optimal sequence of drug administration was tested in a clonogenic assay with the leukemic myeloid cell line K562, and with CFU-GM of normal human bone marrow. The exposure times were 24 h for Ara-C and 1 h for MX with 1 h delay between incubations. Either order of the drugs and a wide range of drug concentrations were tested. Cytotoxicity was quantified by the survival fraction (fs) of colonies scored on day 7 (K562) or day 14 (CFU-GM). Drug synergism was evaluated by a cooperative index (CI). CI less than 1 indicates synergism, CI = 1 summation, and CI greater than 1 antagonism of the cytotoxic drugs. In K562 the sequence Ara-C much greater than MX was significantly more toxic (3.68 logs cell kill, CI = 0.02) than MX much greater than Ara-C (2.64 logs kill, CI = 0.31). The highest synergism was found by adding MX during the last hour of a 24 h Ara-C exposure. For CFU-GM, Ara-C much greater than MX showed higher synergistic toxicity (2.24 log cell kill, CI = 0.23) than MX much greater than Ara-C (1.44 logs, CI = 1.11). The clinical high dose Ara-C/MX protocol was transformed into an in vitro model and tested on K562. The highest synergism was found after the sequence of 3 h Ara-C followed by 0.5 h MX after 8.5 h delay (1.73 logs kill, whole sequence 2.01 logs kill), thus supporting the clinically applied sequence.","['Krehmeier, C', 'Zuhlsdorf, M', 'Buchner, T', 'Hiddemann, W']","['Krehmeier C', 'Zuhlsdorf M', 'Buchner T', 'Hiddemann W']","['Dept.

HL-60 neutrophils are known to respond to several chemotactic compounds, but similar data do not exist for HL-60 eosinophils. We studied the chemotactic capabilities of eosinophil-differentiated HL-60 cells using a blind-well chamber technique. HL-60 eosinophils responded to the specific eosinophilotactic tetrapeptides Ala-Gly-Ser-Glu, Val-Gly-Asp-Glu, and Val-Gly-Ser-Glu; to the formylated tripeptide N-formyl-L-Met-L-Leu-L-Phe (fMLP); and to extracts estrogen-treated rat uteri, which contain an eosinophilotactin. Concentration optima for chemotaxis of HL-60 eosinophils were similar to those for normal human and rodent eosinophils. Neutrophil-differentiated HL-60 cells responded only to fMLP, whereas undifferentiated HL-60s showed no chemotactic ability. The time course of development of chemotactic competence paralleled other developmental changes in HL-60 eosinophilic differentiation, suggesting a common control mechanism. We conclude that the ability to respond to specific eosinophilotactic compounds is a feature of HL-60 cells that have differentiated to eosinophils and that this cell line may be used as a model system in studies of eosinophil chemotaxis.","['Howe, R S', 'Fischkoff, S A', 'Rossi, R M', 'Lyttle, C R']","['Howe RS', 'Fischkoff SA', 'Rossi RM', 'Lyttle CR']","['Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia 19104.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Cell Differentiation', 'Chemotactic Factors/pharmacology', '*Chemotaxis', 'Eosinophils/pathology/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Neutrophils/physiology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/physiology']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 May;18(4):299-303.,['0 (Chemotactic Factors)'],"['HD 06274/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States', 'HD20025/HD/NICHD NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Control donors, patients in remission and patients with active leukaemia were capable of lysing allogeneic leukaemic blast cells. One patient was also capable of lysing autologous leukaemic blast cells. Successful LAK generation was achieved by the use of high dose recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) while combinations of lymphokines did not improve LAK specificity or efficacy. These findings suggest that LAK immunotherapy may be considered for the treatment of patients with acute leukaemia.","['Tratkiewicz, J A', 'Szer, J', 'Boyd, R L']","['Tratkiewicz JA', 'Szer J', 'Boyd RL']","['Alfred Hospital, Prahran, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Clin Exp Immunol,Clinical and experimental immunology,0057202,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic', '*Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*immunology', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2249.1990.tb06447.x [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Exp Immunol. 1990 Apr;80(1):94-9. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2249.1990.tb06447.x.,,,,,,PMC1535230,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, Combretastatin A1, a close structural analogue of A4, showed a high degree of cross-resistance. Combretastatin A1 was also more efficient at increasing intracellular daunorubicin concentrations in both resistant cell lines. Neither agent was capable of altering anthracycline accumulation in the parental (sensitive) cell line. We propose that the cross-resistance to Combretastatin A1 occurs, at least in part, as a result of the increased affinity of the drug-efflux process operative in these resistant cells for Combretastatin A1 vs Combretastatin A4. Hence, Combretastatin A4 may play a role in the treatment of tumours with acquired resistance to the anthracycline antibiotics.","['McGown, A T', 'Fox, B W']","['McGown AT', 'Fox BW']","['Paterson Institute for Cancer Research, Christie Hospital, Withington, Manchester, UK.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic/*pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Daunorubicin/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Leukemia P388/genetics', 'Mice', 'Stilbenes/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects', 'Vinca Alkaloids/pharmacology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02940301 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;26(1):79-81. doi: 10.1007/BF02940301.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic)', '0 (Stilbenes)', '0 (Vinca Alkaloids)', '2222ATS339 (combretastatin A-1)', 'I5590ES2QZ (fosbretabulin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The effect of a triple combination of retinoic acid (RA) + actinomycin D (Act-D) + dimethylformamide (DMF) on differentiation of blasts from 24 AML patients was studied. Non-adherent mononuclear cells were seeded at a concentration of 5 x 10(5) cells/ml in 24-well tissue-culture plates containing RPMI 1640 culture medium with 20% fetal calf serum, 10% autologous serum and 10% 5637-conditioned medium and incubated with 10(-6) M retinoic acid, 5 nM actinomycin D and/or 100 mM dimethylformamide alone and in combination with each other for 6 days at 37 degrees C in a humidified incubator and an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The triple combination of 10(-6) M retinoic acid + 5 nM actinomycin D + 100 mM dimethylformamide induced 90% of the blasts from 22 of the 24 AML patients to differentiate. The combination of N-methylformamide (a compound similar to dimethylformamide) with cyclophosphamide significantly increased the in vivo activity with no concomitant increase in its reversible hepatotoxicity. Since several polar compounds related to dimethyl-formamide, e.g. hexamethylene bisacetamide and N-methylformamide, are currently undergoing phase II clinical trials, it may be feasible to combine one of these with retinoic acid and/or actinomycin D in the treatment of AML patients.","['Hassan, H T', 'Rees, J']","['Hassan HT', 'Rees J']","['Department of Haematological Medicine, University of Cambridge Clinical School, England, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Dactinomycin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Dimethylformamide/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Drug Interactions', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tretinoin/administration & dosage/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02940289 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;26(1):26-30. doi: 10.1007/BF02940289.,"['1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', '8696NH0Y2X (Dimethylformamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Strikingly, the addition of a fully oxidized sulfur atom at the 6 position of sulfenosine produced a purine derivative (sulfonosine) that was remarkably active against experimental leukemia resistant to treatment with either sulfenosine or 6TGR. This slight structural modification also appeared to influence solubility, scheduling capability, and oral activity as well as penetration of the central nervous system (CNS) and the onset of cellular resistance.

Thus, binding affinity for the receptor cannot account for the preferential activity of the 24-homologated compounds in inducing cell differentiation.","['Perlman, K', 'Kutner, A', 'Prahl, J', 'Smith, C', 'Inaba, M', 'Schnoes, H K', 'DeLuca, H F']","['Perlman K', 'Kutner A', 'Prahl J', 'Smith C', 'Inaba M', 'Schnoes HK', 'DeLuca HF']","['Department of Biochemistry, College of Agricultural and Life Sciences, University of Wisconsin, Madison 53706.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcitriol/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/physiology', 'Calcium/metabolism', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'Humans', 'Intestinal Mucosa/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/pathology', 'Male', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/09 00:00,1990/01/09 00:01,['1990/01/09 00:00'],"['1990/01/09 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/09 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/09 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00453a026 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1990 Jan 9;29(1):190-6. doi: 10.1021/bi00453a026.,"['FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)']",['DK-41881/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Infection and secondary primary malignant tumours were the most common complications and also caused most deaths. S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, S. haemolyticus, E. coli and the zoster-varicella virus accounted for most infections and the lungs, skin and urinary tract were the sites affected. Even trivial infections were potentially serious. Haemolytic anaemia and vascular complications were also common. Older patients tended to have a shorter survival than the mean for the group whereas younger patients fared better. The mean survival was 6.2 years. Analysis confirmed the prognostic value of Rai staging. Advancing disease increased the liability to major infection. Light bone marrow infiltration five years post diagnosis indicated a good prognosis and preservation of normal immunoglobulin levels seemed beneficial. Immunoglobulin deficiency is the factor that correlates best with the frequency, severity and pattern of infection. Early stage disease provides a distinct benefit and there may be advantages in prompt diagnosis, regular assessment by immunoglobulin levels and bone marrow pattern and treatment on the first evidence of advancing disease.

Initial neurologic examination showed that the patient's distal weakness was greater than his proximal weakness, with bilateral foot drop and electrophysiologic evidence of denervation in the distal lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spinal cord disclosed no abnormalities. Subsequent neurologic evaluation 8 months later showed a myelopathy, with progression of lower-extremity weakness, spasticity, and flexor spasms, and urinary incontinence, as well as the peripheral neuropathy noted previously. A second magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain showed patchy foci of increased signal intensity in white matter and cortex, with mild generalized cerebral and cerebellar atrophy and no lesions in the spinal cord. Specimens of the patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid contained antibodies to human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Additionally, specimens of his serum and cerebrospinal fluid were tested for antibody to human T-cell leukemia virus type I by Western blotting and radioimmunoprecipitation, and found to be positive for human T-cell leukemia virus type I gag, env, and tax antibodies. The primary cause of severe myelopathy in this patient may be infection with human T-cell leukemia virus type I rather than with human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Treatment with prednisolone resulted in improvement of the lower-extremity weakness, reduction in flexor spasms, and slower but significant improvement in urinary symptoms.

Uptakes of cisplatin by L-1210/DDP and P 388/DDP were significantly decreased, compared with the respective sensitive lines. Glutathione contents in both the resistant lines were 1.7 times more than in the respective sensitive ones. While glutathione contents were reduced to about 10% by incubation of cells with D, L-buthionine-S, R-sulfoximine, sensitivity of the resistant cells remained unchanged. Therefore, glutathione might not relate to the mechanism for resistance in these lines. Cross-resistance patterns of L-1210/DDP and P 388/DDP as well as Colon 26/DDP to cisplatin analogs were investigated. Carrier ligands of the analogs, by which antitumor spectra would be controlled, were different from each other and leaving groups were Cl2, as a rule. As a result, L-1210/DDP showed cross-resistance only to two analogs. In contrast, P 388/DDP did so to all complexes tested. The resistance indices to four analogs were more than 50. Colon 26/DDP also showed cross-resistance to all of them, but the degrees of resistance in this line were lower than those in P 388/DDP. These facts revealed that the pattern of cross-resistance was dependent on each cell line and the completely different patterns were shown between the mouse leukemia resistant lines. It was suggested that in developing a new platinum analog, we should select a carrier ligand to which as many resistant lines would show lack of cross-resistance.","['Tashiro, T']",['Tashiro T'],"['Cancer Chemotherapy Center, Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Exposures of children aged 0-14 years whose incident cancers were diagnosed between 1976 and 1983 and who resided in the Denver, Colorado, Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area were compared with those of controls selected by random digit dialing, matched on age, sex, and telephone exchange area. Parents of 252 cases and 222 controls were interviewed at home about the use of electric appliances by the mother during pregnancy (prenatal exposure) and by the child (postnatal exposure). After adjustment for income, prenatal electric blanket exposure was associated with a small increase in the incidence of childhood cancers (odds ratio (OR) = 1.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7-2.2) that was more pronounced for leukemia (OR = 1.7, 95% CI 0.8-3.6) and brain cancer (OR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.5). Postnatal exposure to electric blankets was also weakly associated with childhood cancer (OR = 1.5, 95% CI 0.6-3.4), with a larger but imprecise association with acute lymphocytic leukemia (OR = 1.9, 95% CI 0.6-6.5). Water beds and bedside electric clocks were unrelated to childhood cancer incidence. Results are limited by nonresponse and imprecision resulting from the rarity of appliance use, especially for subgroups of cases. Nonetheless, electric blankets, one of the principal sources of prolonged magnetic field exposure, were weakly associated with childhood cancer and warrant a more thorough evaluation.","['Savitz, D A', 'John, E M', 'Kleckner, R C']","['Savitz DA', 'John EM', 'Kleckner RC']","['Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Am J Epidemiol,American journal of epidemiology,7910653,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Bedding and Linens', 'Brain Neoplasms/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Colorado', '*Electromagnetic Fields', '*Electromagnetic Phenomena', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Equipment Safety', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Leukemia/epidemiology/*etiology', 'Male', 'Pregnancy', '*Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects', 'Random Allocation', 'Risk Factors', 'Time Factors']",1990/05/01 00:00,1990/05/01 00:01,['1990/05/01 00:00'],"['1990/05/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/05/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/05/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a115566 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Epidemiol. 1990 May;131(5):763-73. doi: 10.1093/oxfordjournals.aje.a115566.,,,['Am J Epidemiol. 1990 May;131(5):774-5.

It allows for parallel morphologic examination with Romanovski-type stains and is capable of generating multivariate, quantitative, immunophenotypic data useful in the diagnosis of leukemia and lymphoma.","['Pihan, G A', 'Woda, B A']","['Pihan GA', 'Woda BA']","['Department of Pathology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Am J Clin Pathol,American journal of clinical pathology,0370470,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'B-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Biopsy, Needle', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/*pathology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Flow Cytometry/methods', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/immunology/*pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/ajcp/93.4.545 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Clin Pathol. 1990 Apr;93(4):545-8. doi: 10.1093/ajcp/93.4.545.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All cases were previously classified according to the French-American-British (FAB) Co-operative Group, and cases of ALL were immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. Results indicated that myeloid-associated antibodies (Mac 387, KP 1 [CD68], antielastase, antilactoferrin, and antilysozyme) did not react with any case of ALL, M1-AML, or M6-AML, whereas at least one of these antibodies reacted with 20 of 21 (95%) cases of M2, M3, M4, and M5-AML. Anti-glycophorin C marked cases of M6-AML, whereas anti-CD3 labeled T-cell ALL. None of the antibodies tested specifically identified cases of B-cell ALL.

Pneumonia, bleeding, and wound infection were the most common complications, occurring in 9, 8, and 6 patients, respectively. Twelve patients required reoperation, eight for bleeding, two for intra-abdominal abscesses, and one each for pancreatitis and bowel perforation.

Each mycophenolic acid-resistant subclone demonstrated high levels of specific poly(A)+ mRNA for each oncogene. The parent line 32D cl 3 demonstrated similar radiosensitivity at 116 cGy/min (D0 126, n 1.17) compared to 5 cGy/min (D0 123, n 1.65). This pattern was not altered in subclones of 32D cl 3 cells transfected with the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor gene and grown in EGF (at 116 cGy/min D0 104, n 0.998, at 5 cGy/min D0 115, n 1.09), or in 32D cl 3 cells expressing the v-sis oncogene (at 116 cGy/min D0 122.4, n 1.79, at 5 cGy/min D0 135, n 1.43). In contrast, expression of the transfected oncogenes v-erb-B, v-abl, or v-src conferred significant radioresistance at 5 cGy/min dose rate (D0 194, n 1.77; D0 165.5, n 1.56; D0 171, n 1.28, respectively). With the exception of v-sis, oncogene expression resulted in nonautocrine factor independence of 32D cl 3 subclones, and production of donor origin tumors in syngeneic new-born or adult mice. Two rare spontaneous factor-independent subclones of 32D cl 3 were also tested. Nonautocrine clone 32D cl 2 demonstrated significantly increased radioresistance at low dose rate (D0 186, n 1.63), while autocrine (IL-3 producing) subclone 32D cl 4 revealed no significant increase in radioresistance at 5 cGy/min. The parent fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3 showed an intrinsic relative radioresistance at low dose rate (at 5 cGy/min D0 157.3, n 1.81, compared to 116 cGy/min D0 134.3, n 1.57). Expression in NIH/3T3 of transfected oncogenes v-abl, v-fms, v-fos, or H-ras increased radioresistance at low dose rate (D0 208.6, n 1.61; D0 206.6, n 1.51; D0 167.5, n 1.85; and D0 206.8, n 1.08, respectively). Thus expression of each of several oncogenes induces resistance to gamma irradiation at 5 cGy/min in hematopoietic and fibroblast cell lines. These data may help explain the clinical recurrence of oncogene-expressing leukemia and lymphoma cells after marrow stem cell ablative doses of low-dose-rate total-body irradiation.","['FitzGerald, T J', 'Henault, S', 'Sakakeeny, M', 'Santucci, M A', 'Pierce, J H', 'Anklesaria, P', 'Kase, K', 'Das, I', 'Greenberger, J S']","['FitzGerald TJ', 'Henault S', 'Sakakeeny M', 'Santucci MA', 'Pierce JH', 'Anklesaria P', 'Kase K', 'Das I', 'Greenberger JS']","['Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Massachusetts Medical Center, Worcester 01655.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival', '*DNA, Recombinant', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Fibroblasts/radiation effects', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects/*radiation effects', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', '*Oncogenes', '*Radiation Tolerance', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transfection']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1990 Apr;122(1):44-52.,"['0 (DNA, Recombinant)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']","['CA39851/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA40818/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One such difference may be that of receptor-mediated cellular uptake of low density lipoproteins (LDLs). Previous studies have shown that leukemic cells from patients with acute myelogenous leukemia have elevated receptor-mediated uptake and degradation rates of plasma LDL in vitro compared to normal white blood and bone marrow cells, and that plasma cholesterol levels at diagnosis are inversely correlated with the LDL receptor activity of the malignant cells. An important question is whether the uptake of LDL by the leukemic cells is also increased in vivo. To evaluate the in vivo uptake of LDL, 11 adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia received an i.v. injection of [14C]-sucrose-labeled LDL. On degradation of [14C]sucrose-LDL, the radiolabeled sucrose moiety is known to remain trapped in the lysosomal compartment of the cells. After injection, radioactivity accumulated progressively for at least 12 hr in the leukemic cells. The uptake of radioactivity in vivo correlated with the rate of receptor-mediated degradation of 125I-labeled LDL by the leukemic cells assayed in vitro (r = +0.88, P less than 0.001). An inverse correlation between plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations and the in vivo cellular uptake of [14C]sucrose-LDL in whole blood (r = -0.76, P less than 0.01) indicates that the hypocholesterolemia is due to elevated LDL uptake by the leukemic cells. Postmortem biopsies from virtually all tissues were obtained from one patient, and the distribution of radioactivity revealed that the liver and bone marrow had accumulated most radioactivity; the adrenals had the highest uptake of label per gram of tissue weight. The results indicate that LDL may be used as a carrier targeting lipophilic cytotoxic drugs to leukemic cells.","['Vitols, S', 'Angelin, B', 'Ericsson, S', 'Gahrton, G', 'Juliusson, G', 'Masquelier, M', 'Paul, C', 'Peterson, C', 'Rudling, M', 'Soderberg-Reid, K']","['Vitols S', 'Angelin B', 'Ericsson S', 'Gahrton G', 'Juliusson G', 'Masquelier M', 'Paul C', 'Peterson C', 'Rudling M', 'Soderberg-Reid K', 'et al.']","['Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Karolinska Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Adult', 'Biological Transport', 'Cholesterol, LDL/blood', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/drug therapy/metabolism', 'Lipoproteins/*blood', 'Lipoproteins, LDL/*blood/isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Receptors, LDL/metabolism', 'Reference Values', 'Stomach Neoplasms/blood', 'Sucrose/blood']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.87.7.2598 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Apr;87(7):2598-602. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.7.2598.,"['0 (Cholesterol, LDL)', '0 (Lipoproteins)', '0 (Lipoproteins, LDL)', '0 (Receptors, LDL)', '57-50-1 (Sucrose)']",,,,,PMC53737,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nuclear run-on experiments showed no modifications of the transcriptional rate from the first exon. However, a slight decrease (15%) of the transcript elongation from the first exon/first intron boundary was observed in the dexamethasone-treated cells. Using actinomycin D to block gene transcription, we have observed a significant increase in the rate of c-myc RNA specific decay after dexamethasone treatment.

Our data suggest that dexamethasone is able to inhibit human c-myc gene expression primarily at the post-transcriptional level, through the synthesis of hormone-induced regulatory protein(s) controlling c-myc transcript stability.","['Maroder, M', 'Martinotti, S', 'Vacca, A', 'Screpanti, I', 'Petrangeli, E', 'Frati, L', 'Gulino, A']","['Maroder M', 'Martinotti S', 'Vacca A', 'Screpanti I', 'Petrangeli E', 'Frati L', 'Gulino A']","['Department of Experimental Medicine, University La Sapienza, Roma, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Nucleic Acids Res,Nucleic acids research,0411011,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cycloheximide/pharmacology', 'Dexamethasone/*pharmacology', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/*genetics', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', '*Proto-Oncogenes', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis/genetics/metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/03/11 00:00,1990/03/11 00:01,['1990/03/11 00:00'],"['1990/03/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/11 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/11 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/nar/18.5.1153 [doi]'],ppublish,Nucleic Acids Res. 1990 Mar 11;18(5):1153-7. doi: 10.1093/nar/18.5.1153.,"['0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '7S5I7G3JQL (Dexamethasone)', '98600C0908 (Cycloheximide)']",,,,,PMC330429,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have previously shown that GF-1 of both mouse and human origin is a 413-amino-acid polypeptide with two novel zinc-finger domains whose expression is restricted to erythroid cells. Using in situ hybridization of mouse bone marrow cells and northern blot analysis of purified cell populations and permanent cell lines, we show here that GF-1 is expressed in two other hematopoietic lineages, megakaryocytes and bone marrow-derived mast cells. Our findings are consistent with results from hematopoietic progenitor culture which suggest a relationship between erythroid, megakaryocytic and mast cell lineages, and imply that GF-1 is expressed in committed multipotential cells and their progeny. Hence, the mere presence of this transcription factor is unlikely to be sufficient to programme differentiation of a single haematopoietic lineage.

Transcriptional activation of heat shock genes by increased temperature or other cellular stresses is mediated by the binding of a heat shock factor (HSF) to a conserved nucleotide sequence (the heat shock element) present in the promoter of heat-inducible genes. Despite the high degree of conservation of this response, embryonic stages of development are characterized by the absence of a heat shock response. Murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells also lack this response, and we report here a detailed characterization of this defect for one of the most highly conserved of these genes, hsp70. Surprisingly, heat-induced transcriptional activation of this gene does not occur, despite the induction of a protein with the binding specificity of murine HSF. However, the MEL HSF differs slightly in apparent size from the HSF in 3T3 cells, which exhibit a normal heat shock response. These data suggest that activation of mammalian HSF by heat requires at least two separate steps: an alteration of binding activity followed by further modification that activates transcription. MEL cells do not respond to heat shock because they lack the ability to perform this secondary modification. These cells provide a useful system for characterizing heat shock activation in mammals.","['Hensold, J O', 'Hunt, C R', 'Calderwood, S K', 'Housman, D E', 'Kingston, R E']","['Hensold JO', 'Hunt CR', 'Calderwood SK', 'Housman DE', 'Kingston RE']","['Center for Cancer Research, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge 02139.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/*metabolism', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Heat-Shock Proteins/biosynthesis/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Hot Temperature', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute', 'Methylation', 'Mice', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'RNA, Neoplasm/genetics/isolation & purification', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*metabolism']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.10.4.1600-1608.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Apr;10(4):1600-8. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.4.1600-1608.1990.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Heat-Shock Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']","['CA17575/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-01392/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'P30CA-43703/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC362265,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cases were classified by FAB recommendation as followed: 85 refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS); 273 refractory anemia in which 86 were without blasts (RA), 153 were with excess of blasts (RAEB) and 34 were with excess of blasts and in transformation (RAEB-t); 111 chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML); and 34 cases with borderline features. The point date for statistical study was 31 December 1988, and the scoring method of Bournemouth was applied to compare with our findings (62% resulted in death, 18% in leukemic transformation). It was demonstrated that haemoglobin, platelets, and bone marrow-blasts are the best factors to predict survival or leukaemic transformation (LT). But peripheral neutrophils don't affect the survival time excepted when lower than 500 microliters (13 months vs 19.6 months). A scoring system based on haemoglobin (Hb), platelets (Pl), and bone marrow blasts (BMB) may be represented in a three-dimensional space and is a good tool to know the own value of each parameter. This 3-D system shows that BMB and Pl are the most important factors and are correlated with survival, per cent of death, and LT (p less than 0.0001).

DDP-P.HCl diluted in water and administered intraperitoneally (IP) on day 1 and on days 1 and 5 to BDF1 mice bearing P388 leukemic cells produced 33% and 50% cure rates, respectively, at the maximum tolerated dose (16 mg/kg for the single administration and 10 mg/kg given on days 1 and 5). In contrast, under the same conditions, the cure rates obtained with DDP alone (10 mg/kg for the single administration and 8 mg/kg given on days 1 and 5) were 17% and 9%, respectively. Protection from DDP nephrotoxicity seems to be the explanation for the higher doses of DDP that mice can tolerate when DDP is given simultaneously with P.HCl. In fact, the increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels observed 4-7 days following a single IP administration of DDP (8 or 16 mg/kg), as well as the tubular degenerative changes detected by light microscopy, were not observed when the same doses of DDP were given simultaneously with P.HCl. Since DDP nephrotoxicity is known to be reduced when the drug is diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution, we compared the combinations DDP-P.HCl in water, and DDP and DDP-P.HCl in 0.9% NaCl solution. The antitumor activity of DDP diluted in water and administered with P.HCl was similar to that observed in mice treated with DDP alone diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution. However, further improvement of the therapeutic index was achieved after the administration of DDP-P.HCl diluted in 0.9% NaCl solution; this regimen produced a cure rate of 67% (12 of 18 animals). The clinical relevance of these findings is strengthened by the observation that similar results were obtained when P.HCl was given by the intravenous route.","['Esposito, M', 'Fulco, R A', 'Collecchi, P', 'Zicca, A', 'Cadoni, A', 'Merlo, F', 'Rosso, R', 'Sobrero, A']","['Esposito M', 'Fulco RA', 'Collecchi P', 'Zicca A', 'Cadoni A', 'Merlo F', 'Rosso R', 'Sobrero A']","['Department of Pharmacotoxicology, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genoa, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Natl Cancer Inst,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,7503089,IM,"['4-Aminobenzoic Acid/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cisplatin/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Kidney/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred C57BL', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Procaine/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/04/18 00:00,1990/04/18 00:01,['1990/04/18 00:00'],"['1990/04/18 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/18 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/18 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jnci/82.8.677 [doi]'],ppublish,J Natl Cancer Inst. 1990 Apr 18;82(8):677-84. doi: 10.1093/jnci/82.8.677.,"['4Z8Y51M438 (Procaine)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'TL2TJE8QTX (4-Aminobenzoic Acid)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Structure-activity relationships for acridine-linked aniline mustards: consequences of varying the reactivity of the mustard.,1177-86,"A series of DNA-targeted aniline mustards have been prepared, and their chemical reactivity and in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity have been evaluated and compared with that of the corresponding simple aniline mustards. The alkylating groups were anchored to the DNA-intercalating 9-aminoacridine chromophore by an alkyl chain of fixed length attached at the mustard 4-position through a link group X, while the corresponding simple mustards possessed an electronically identical small group at this position. The link group was varied to provide a series of compounds of similar geometry but widely differing mustard reactivity. Variation in biological activity should then largely be a consequence of this varying reactivity. Rates of mustard hydrolysis in the two series related only to the electronic properties of the link group, with attachment of the intercalating chromophore having no effect. The cytotoxicities of the simple mustards correlated well with group electronic properties (with a 200-300-fold range in IC50S). The corresponding DNA-targeted mustards were much more potent (up to 100-fold), but their IC50 values varied much less with linker group electronic properties. Most of the DNA-targeted mustards showed in vivo antitumor activity, being both more active and more dose-potent than either the corresponding untargeted mustards and chlorambucil. These results show that targeting alkylating agents to DNA by attachment to DNA-affinic units may be a useful strategy.","['Gourdie, T A', 'Valu, K K', 'Gravatt, G L', 'Boritzki, T J', 'Baguley, B C', 'Wakelin, L P', 'Wilson, W R', 'Woodgate, P D', 'Denny, W A']","['Gourdie TA', 'Valu KK', 'Gravatt GL', 'Boritzki TJ', 'Baguley BC', 'Wakelin LP', 'Wilson WR', 'Woodgate PD', 'Denny WA']","['Cancer Research Laboratory, School of Medicine, University of Auckland, Private Bag, New Zealand.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Alkylating Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'Alkylation', 'Aniline Mustard/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'Cell Line', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*drug effects', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00166a015 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1990 Apr;33(4):1177-86. doi: 10.1021/jm00166a015.,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', 'CUJ6745Z9J (Aniline Mustard)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fresh rat leukaemia cells were disrupted and the cytosol collected; this extract was known to contain a protein inhibitor of guanidinobenzoatase (GB) associated with leukaemia cells. All the cytosolic proteins were derivatised with Texas red acid chloride. Leukaemia cells with latent GB failed to bind the Texas red inhibitor protein but did so after activation of GB. Competition experiments with 9-amino acridine (a fluorescent marker for the active site of GB) demonstrated that the Texas red-inhibitor protein could only bind to intact leukaemia cells when the active centre of GB was not already occupied by 9-amino acridine. This competition between these two fluorescent inhibitors demonstrated their specificity for GB. The use of intact leukaemia cells and the high molecular weight of the inhibitor protein precludes the possibility of any interaction between GB and inhibitor within the cells.

Induced cells markedly increase their content of cytoplasm and show features of morphological maturation. At the ultrastructural level, PMA-treated cells show increases in cytoplasm, nuclear lobulation and nucleolar content, and free ribosomes. Limited numbers of cells also express alpha-granules and nascent demarcation membrane systems. Functionally, PMA-stimulated HEL cells express increased amounts of the megakaryocyte/platelet proteins: glycoprotein IIb/IIIa, platelet factor 4, von Willebrand factor, glycoprotein Ib, and thrombospondin. No changes are observed in antigenic markers of the erythroid (glycophorin A) or macrophage lineages (MO-1 or MO-2). The increases in antigenic expression are rapid, reaching maximum levels within 3-4 d under serum-free conditions. Treatment with PMA also abruptly (within 1-2 d) inhibits cellular division in these cells. Washout studies indicate that phorbols exert their effect within 18-24 h, the approximate cell cycle time for these cells. Consistent with proliferative arrest, c-myc proto-oncogene transcripts begin to decline within 8 h of PMA treatment, although transcripts of c-myb are unaffected. Importantly, megakaryocyte differentiation is associated with endomitotic DNA synthesis (i.e., continued DNA synthesis in the absence of mitosis and cytokinesis), with HEL cells reaching a DNA content of 3-12 times that of unstimulated cells. Endomitosis is coordinately regulated with changes in antigenic expression and cell size such that those cells having the highest DNA content are the largest and also express the greatest levels of antigen.","['Long, M W', 'Heffner, C H', 'Williams, J L', 'Peters, C', 'Prochownik, E V']","['Long MW', 'Heffner CH', 'Williams JL', 'Peters C', 'Prochownik EV']","['Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor 48109.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Invest,The Journal of clinical investigation,7802877,IM,"['Antigens/analysis', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Fusion', 'Humans', 'Interphase', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Megakaryocytes/analysis/immunology/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/pharmacology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Proto-Oncogene Mas', 'Proto-Oncogenes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1172/JCI114538 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Invest. 1990 Apr;85(4):1072-84. doi: 10.1172/JCI114538.,"['0 (Antigens)', '0 (MAS1 protein, human)', '0 (Proto-Oncogene Mas)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['HL-31568/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL-35225/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC296537,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of these variants express new transplantation antigens which are not present on the original L5178Y tumor cells. In this study, a polyclonal syngeneic antiserum raised to one such variant (L5178Y/DTIC) was employed in immunoprecipitation studies of cell surface and metabolically labeled L5178Y/DTIC cells. One- and two-dimensional electrophoretic analyses of the immunoprecipitates detected a surface antigen of approximately 80 kDa. Additionally, a 45-kDa component was detected in the lysate of [35S]methionine-labeled cells. Anti-xenotropic MuLV gp70 serum precipitated material whose electrophoretic pattern was similar to that of the 80-kDa surface antigen. Sequential immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that the molecules reactive with the variant-specific antiserum were removed by the anti-xenotropic gp70 antibodies, whereas immunodepletion was only partial when the cell extract was first treated with the variant-specific antibodies. After Western blotting, the 80- and 45-kDa antigens precipitated by the variant-specific antibodies were injected intrasplenically into recipient mice. Only the animals sensitized with the 80-kDa antigen developed specific immunity to L5178Y/DTIC cells in that they displayed an increased frequency in CTL precursors (CTLp) to the variant cells.

We have found that retinoic acid-treatment of HL-60 cells over a period of 6-8 days resulted in a progressive increase in the proportion of cells with mature neutrophil morphologies and was closely followed by an increase in the proportion of cells exhibiting the morphological characteristics of apoptosis, the non-pathological mode of cell death. Using Percoll step-density gradients we have demonstrated a marked increase in the buoyant density of these cells and have used this density difference to obtain enriched fractions of cells for more detailed study. Degradation of the nuclear DNA of these cells into integer multiples of about 200 base pairs, indicative of endogenous endonuclease activation a major characteristic of programmed cell death, was also demonstrated. From these observations we conclude that the mode of cell death in cultures of terminally differentiated HL-60 cells is that of apoptosis. These results parallel those of a recent report which has shown apoptosis to be the mode of cell death of ageing peripheral blood neutrophils. Because of this, we believe that our observations further validate the use of the HL-60 cell line as a model system for the study of human granulopoiesis in vitro and further, that this model system may be useful for gaining insight into the underlying mechanisms involved in apoptosis.","['Martin, S J', 'Bradley, J G', 'Cotter, T G']","['Martin SJ', 'Bradley JG', 'Cotter TG']","[""Department of Biology, St Patrick's College, Maynooth, Co.

Extent of heat radiosensitization was then correlated with the level of DNA polymerases alpha and beta in control and heat-shocked cells in order to examine whether there is a positive correlation between the degree of heat radiosensitization and the level of these enzymes. Our results show that human bone marrow CFU-GM have an x-ray response with D0 of 1.56 Gy and a small amount of heat radiosensitization with a thermal enhancement ratio (TER) of 1.2. K562, a human erythroleukemic cell, showed a D0 of 1.32 +/- 0.2 Gy and TER of 1.4. However, in contrast to normal CFU-GM which showed no shoulder in the X-ray survival curve, K562 cells showed a small shoulder with a quasi-threshold dose, (Dq) of 2 Gy and n of 2. K562 cells resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs such as 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine and etoposide (VP-16) showed D0 of 1.47 +/- 0.13, and 1.77 +/- 0.18 Gy; Dq of 4 and 0 Gy; and n of 5 and 1; and TER of 1.6 and 2, respectively. The level of DNA polymerases alpha and beta activity and their respective mRNA levels were approximately the same in all cells. The reduction in the level of DNA polymerase beta after heat treatment however, correlated with the TER obtained for various leukemic cells. These studies indicate that normal CFU-GM and variety of human leukemic cells show only a small amount of heat radiosensitization. However, drug-resistant leukemic cells show a higher amount of heat radiosensitization than their drug-sensitive parent line. This suggests that hyperthermia may be beneficial in eradicating drug-resistant leukemic cells when combined with X-ray. Furthermore, the inactivation of DNA polymerase beta activity results in a higher amount of heat radiosensitization.","['Mivechi, N F', 'Miyachi, H', 'Scanlon, K J']","['Mivechi NF', 'Miyachi H', 'Scanlon KJ']","['Department of Radiation Research, City of Hope National Medical Center, Duarte, California 91010.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cytarabine/pharmacology', 'DNA Polymerase I/*metabolism', 'DNA Polymerase II/*metabolism', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*radiation effects', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'X-Rays']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Apr 1;50(7):2044-8.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase I)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)']",['CA-33572/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We studied the effect of HHT on the clonal proliferation and differentiation of human leukemic cells from cell lines and patients. Dose-response studies found that HHT inhibited colony formation of myeloid cell lines (50% inhibitory dose range, 7 to 12 ng/ml), lymphocytic cell lines (50% inhibitory dose range, 4 to 7 ng/ml), and fresh leukemic cells (50% inhibitory dose range, 2 to 25 ng/ml). Pulse-exposure studies showed that colony formation of HL-60 cells was inhibited 50% by HHT (10 to 20 ng/ml) at 45 h and completely inhibited at 72 h. Radioactive precursor studies using HL-60 cells showed that HHT predominantly inhibited protein synthesis as compared with RNA and DNA synthesis. Taking advantage of this, we have found that the combination of HHT with 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (inhibitor of DNA synthesis) was synergistic in the inhibition of HL-60 clonal growth. HHT (2 to 20 ng/ml) also was found to induce up to 28% of HL-60 cells to differentiate toward macrophage-like cells.","['Zhou, J Y', 'Chen, D L', 'Shen, Z S', 'Koeffler, H P']","['Zhou JY', 'Chen DL', 'Shen ZS', 'Koeffler HP']","['Department of Medicine, UCLA Medical Center 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Alkaloids/*pharmacology', '*Antineoplastic Agents', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/*drug effects', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Dactinomycin/pharmacology', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Harringtonines/*pharmacology', 'Homoharringtonine', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/pathology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Apr 1;50(7):2031-5.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Harringtonines)', '1CC1JFE158 (Dactinomycin)', '6FG8041S5B (Homoharringtonine)']","['CA 26038/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 32737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 33936/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although the exact mechanism for the progression of myelofibrosis in AMKBL is unclear, certain humoral factors from megakaryoblastic cells, the precursors of platelets, may be involved in the enhancement of collagen synthesis by bone marrow fibroblasts. The present study, therefore, is an investigation of the possible pathogenic role of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), known to be a very potent collagen-stimulating factor found in platelets in the myelofibrosis of AMKBL. The results obtained were as follows: (1) Conditioned media from peripheral megakaryoblasts taken from an AMKBL patient and from established megakaryoblast cell lines (MEG-01) had much greater stimulatory effects on collagen synthesis in bone marrow fibroblasts than conditioned media from other leukemic cell types. (2) Based on an assessment of soft agar colony formation, there was greater TGF-beta activity in media that had been conditioned from megakaryoblasts than in media from other leukemic cell types. (3) When compared with other leukemic-cell types, megakaryoblasts showed substantially greater expression of TGF-beta mRNA that was hybridized at 2.5 kb with a TGF-beta cDNA probe, and TGF-beta polypeptides were detected at 13 Kd with anti-TGF-beta antibodies. (4) The addition of the anti-TGF-beta antibody inhibited the stimulatory effects of the megakaryoblast conditioned medium on collagen synthesis in bone marrow fibroblasts. These results clearly suggest that megakaryoblasts produce and secrete an active form of TGF-beta and stimulate collagen synthesis in bone marrow fibroblasts in a paracrine manner.","['Terui, T', 'Niitsu, Y', 'Mahara, K', 'Fujisaki, Y', 'Urushizaki, Y', 'Mogi, Y', 'Kohgo, Y', 'Watanabe, N', 'Ogura, M', 'Saito, H']","['Terui T', 'Niitsu Y', 'Mahara K', 'Fujisaki Y', 'Urushizaki Y', 'Mogi Y', 'Kohgo Y', 'Watanabe N', 'Ogura M', 'Saito H']","['Department of Internal Medicine (Section 4), Sapporo Medical College, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/physiology', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cell Aggregation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Collagen/biosynthesis', 'Fibroblasts/cytology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute/*physiopathology', 'Primary Myelofibrosis/etiology/*physiopathology', 'Proline/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Rats', 'Transforming Growth Factors/*biosynthesis/genetics/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83177-2 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Apr 1;75(7):1540-8.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)', '9007-34-5 (Collagen)', '9DLQ4CIU6V (Proline)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In an attempt to investigate whether this impairment is related to a defect at the target cell binding and/or at the post target cell binding level, we evaluated the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of HCL patients for their ability to: (1) bind and kill K-562 NK-sensitive targets at the single cell binding level; (2) release the NK cytotoxic factor (NKCF) under different in vitro stimuli, including K-562 and phytohemoagglutinin; and (3) kill K-562 targets in a lectin-dependent cellular cytoxicity (LDCC) assay. This study demonstrates that untreated HCL patients' PBMC show a low ability to form conjugates with K-562 targets at the single cell binding level (5.7% +/- 1.0%) with respect to patients studied after treatment (9.3% +/- 1.3%) and controls (15.0% +/- 4.0%); P less than .05 and P less than .001, respectively. A decreased ability to kill the bound target was demonstrated in untreated cases (1.2% +/- 1.1%) versus patients studied after treatment and controls (12.3% +/- 1.6%, 17.0% +/- 3.1% respectively); P less than .001 in both conditions. After activation of effector cells with interleukin-2 (IL-2) in vitro, an increase in the ability of PBMC to form conjugates with K-562 targets and kill the bound target was demonstrated in each group of patients. Moreover, IL-2 was able to increase the cytotoxicity against NK-sensitive targets in all patients tested. Evaluation of NKCF production showed that untreated patients release low levels of NKCF when PBMC were incubated in the presence of K-562 stimulators (1.8% +/- 0.7%) with respect to patients after interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy (7.6% +/- 2.1%) and controls (12.9% +/- 2.2%); P less than .02 and P less than .001, respectively. When the recognition mechanisms were bypassed by triggering the cells with lectins in an LDCC assay, we demonstrated an increase of the lytic activity in both groups of patients with respect to the baseline values. However, the cytotoxic capacity observed in untreated patients was significantly lower than that observed in subjects after IFN-alpha therapy and controls (P less than .001). These findings suggest that the impaired NK activity observed in patients with HCL is related to defects both at the target and posttarget cell binding levels.","['Trentin, L', 'Zambello, R', 'Agostini, C', 'Ambrosetti, A', 'Chisesi, T', 'Raimondi, R', 'Bulian, P', 'Pizzolo, G', 'Semenzato, G']","['Trentin L', 'Zambello R', 'Agostini C', 'Ambrosetti A', 'Chisesi T', 'Raimondi R', 'Bulian P', 'Pizzolo G', 'Semenzato G']","['Padua University School of Medicine, Department of Clinical Medicine, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antigens, CD/*analysis', 'Cell Line', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/*immunology', 'Killer Factors, Yeast', 'Kinetics', 'Lectins', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Proteins/analysis', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Reference Values']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)83175-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Apr 1;75(7):1525-30.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Killer Factors, Yeast)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Proteins)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These cases were either discovered during the first few years of life (i.e. constitutional) and/or were proven to be familial (autosomal dominant transmission). Previous treatments (corticosteroids, immunoglobulins, androgens, immunosuppressor agents, splenectomy) were not effective in any of these cases or in their relatives. A new syndrome can therefore be proposed which can easily be suspected on the basis of platelet kinetic studies performed in cases of early onset, increased platelet volume, failure of corticosteroids or evidence of a familial blood disorder. It can be proved when the autologous platelet life span is demonstrated to be normal in spite of a chronic thrombocytopenia and a normal megakaryocytic count. The recognition of this syndrome will avoid neonatal complications (cephal-haematomas), surgical complications, and the use of expensive and possibly harmful ineffective treatments, both in the propositus and in other abnormal family members. The syndrome is certainly frequent (54 cases are presented here), but the diagnosis is often missed or delayed due to the low risk of haemorrhage. However, it is associated with a certain risk of leukaemia (four cases in three families).","['Najean, Y', 'Lecompte, T']","['Najean Y', 'Lecompte T']","['Department of Nuclear Medicine and Haematology, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Blood Platelets/physiology', 'Child', 'Female', '*Genes, Dominant', 'Humans', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Pedigree', 'Platelet Count', 'Retrospective Studies', 'Syndrome', 'Thrombocytopenia/blood/complications/*genetics']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02566.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Feb;74(2):203-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02566.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This protein is well resolved by analytical 16-BAC----SDS two-dimensional PAGE and was purified from platelets by preparative 16-BAC----SDS PAGE. Polyclonal antibodies were raised to the protein in mice and rabbits. These antisera detected a single protein with the migration of P47 on Western blots of platelet extracts, and the rabbit antisera immunoprecipitated 32P-labelled P47 from platelet cytosol. The presence of P47 in other haematopoietic cells was determined by prelabelling them with 32P and observing increased 32P incorporation into the location of P47 on autoradiographs of 16-BAC----SDS analytical PAGE of cells exposed to phorbol ester. The identity of the phosphoprotein found in this location was further established by probing Western blots of SDS PAGE gels of cultured cell lines with the P47 antisera. P47 was detected in peripheral blood lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes (including the granulocytes of two unrelated patients with X-linked chronic granulomatous disease). P47 was also found in HL-60 promyelocytes (especially after differentiation with retinoic acid), U937 histiocytes, HEL leukaemia cells, and Raji 'B' lymphoblasts. It was not detected in normal erythrocytes, K562 leukaemic cells, MOLT-3 'T' lymphoblasts, or in wide range of non-haematopoietic cell lines. We conclude that P47 is a major target for the action of phorbol ester induced phosphorylation in platelets, normal leucocytes and some haematopoietic cell lines.

For this model of somatic gene therapy, we developed a high-titer, amphotropic retroviral vector designated NTG in which the human GCase gene was driven by the mutant polyoma virus enhancer/herpesvirus thymidine kinase gene (tk) promoter (Py+/Htk). NTG normalized GCase activity in transduced Gaucher fibroblasts and efficiently infected human monocytic and erythroleukemic cell lines. RNA blot-hybridization (Northern blot) analysis of these hematopoietic cell lines showed unexpectedly high-level expression from the Moloney murine leukemia virus long terminal repeat (Mo-MLV LTR) and levels of Py+/Htk enhancer/promoter-initiated human GCase RNA that approximated endogenous GCase RNA levels. Furthermore, NTG efficiently infected human hematopoietic progenitor cells. Detection (by means of the polymerase chain reaction) of the provirus in approximately one-third of NTG-infected progenitor colonies that had not been selected in G418-containing medium indicates that relative resistance to G418 underestimated the actual gene transfer efficiency. Northern blot analysis of NTG-infected, progenitor-derived cells showed expression from both the Mo-MLV LTR and the Py+/Htk enhancer/promoter. NTG-transduced hematopoietic progenitor cells from patients with Gaucher disease generated progeny in which GCase activity had been normalized.","['Fink, J K', 'Correll, P H', 'Perry, L K', 'Brady, R O', 'Karlsson, S']","['Fink JK', 'Correll PH', 'Perry LK', 'Brady RO', 'Karlsson S']","['Molecular and Medical Genetics Section, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology', 'Cell Line', 'Fibroblasts/enzymology', 'Gaucher Disease/enzymology/*genetics', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Glucosidases/*genetics', 'Glucosylceramidase/deficiency/*genetics/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*enzymology', 'Humans', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Reference Values', 'Retroviridae/*genetics', '*Transfection']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.87.6.2334 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Mar;87(6):2334-8. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.6.2334.,"['EC 3.2.1.- (Glucosidases)', 'EC 3.2.1.45 (Glucosylceramidase)']",,,,,PMC53681,,,,,,,,,,,,

Using this differential PCR, we have examined 64 cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) for the loss of the beta 1-interferon gene, a relatively common event in certain human leukemias and lymphomas. Only one patient who was Philadelphia chromosome positive and who was in blast crisis exhibited allelic loss of the beta-interferon gene.

We have identified and separated four nuclear proteins from C81-66-45 cells, an HTLV-I immortalized Tax-expressing human T-lymphocyte line (Salahuddin et al., 1983), that interact with the TRE-DNA, none of which are identical with the Tax-protein. The proteins identified have molecular weights of about 32, 36 to 42, 50 and 110 kD. Four different methods were used to identify the proteins. First, from different cell lines three or all four of the nuclear proteins were specifically cross-linked by UV irradiation to the radioactively labeled TRE-DNA fragment. Second, TRE-DNA binding proteins sedimented through a glycerol density gradient at rates corresponding to proteins of native molecular weights of 35 to 50 kD and 110 kD. Third, only the 50 kD protein was retained on a biotinylated DNA-streptavidin matrix when the DNA fragment contained the TRE-DNA. Fourth, extensive purification by several cycles of TRE-DNA affinity chromatography resulted in the 32, 36 to 42 and 110 kD proteins and to less extent the 50 kD factor. Two abundant proteins of 75 and 80 kD were competed out by poly[d(I-C)] in all reactions. The cAMP-response element CRE, TGACGTCA, present in the 21 base-pair sequence, appears to be essential for specific protein-TRE-DNA interactions because mutation of the two G's destroys this complex. This result suggests that the cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, is involved in the protein-TRE-DNA complex and in mediating the Tax response.","['Beimling, P', 'Moelling, K']","['Beimling P', 'Moelling K']","['Max-Planck-Institut fuer Molekulare Genetik, Berlin, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Nucleus/metabolism', 'Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chromatography, Affinity', 'DNA Probes', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Nuclear Proteins/*metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 Mar;5(3):361-8.,"['0 (DNA Probes)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Trans-Activators)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 1 of 8 patients with allergic reactions titers of specific IgE antibodies were elevated, while there was not detectable activation of the complement system. In conclusion, elevated titers of specific IgE antibodies to L-Asp are frequently detectable prior to L-Asp infusions which are associated with allergic reactions. In addition to activation of the classical complement pathway specific IgE antibodies and mediator release from mast cells may contribute to clinical symptoms.

Total RNA from HDV-infected liver and serum samples was purified and Moloney murine leukaemia virus (M-MLV) reverse transcribed. HDV cDNA was then directly amplified with Taq polymerase using three pairs of specific primers. It was possible to amplify a region of about 1200 bp in three partially overlapping fragments including the whole HDAg-ORF. A DNA fragment of the expected size was repeatedly obtained from an initial sample of less than 0.1 pg of liver RNA and from 10 pl of infected serum. An amplified fragment of 359 bp obtained by PCR from an infected woodchucks' liver was sequenced. The sequence was 91.8% and 98.6% identical to previously published HDV sequences. In addition, amplified and 32P-radiolabelled HDV sequences were shown to hybridize specifically to HDV RNA extracted from HDV-infected liver and serum. In conclusion this technique promises to be of great value in the appraisal of HDV infection, rapid synthesis of HDV probes and analysis of the genetic variability of the virus.","['Zignego, A L', 'Deny, P', 'Feray, C', 'Ponzetto, A', 'Gentilini, P', 'Tiollais, P', 'Brechot, C']","['Zignego AL', 'Deny P', 'Feray C', 'Ponzetto A', 'Gentilini P', 'Tiollais P', 'Brechot C']","['Unite de Recombinaison et Expression Genetique (Inserm U 163/CNRS UA 271), Institut Pasteur, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Mol Cell Probes,Molecular and cellular probes,8709751,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Hepatitis Delta Virus/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Humans', 'Liver/microbiology', 'Marmota', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques', 'Pan troglodytes', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'RNA, Viral/*genetics/isolation & purification']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0890-8508(90)90038-2 [pii]', '10.1016/0890-8508(90)90038-2 [doi]']",ppublish,Mol Cell Probes. 1990 Feb;4(1):43-51. doi: 10.1016/0890-8508(90)90038-2.,"['0 (RNA, Viral)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Salvage treatment consisted of a repetition of the TAD 9 regimen which was already applied as induction protocol at initial diagnosis. All patients were recruited from the multicenter 1982 trial of the German AML Cooperative Group and had thus received a standardized first line treatment. Response at first relapse was significantly related to the duration of the first remission. From 38 patients relapsing within 6 months after successful induction therapy, only 11 (28%) achieved a second complete remission as compared to 58 of 98 (59%) cases with later occurring relapses (p less than 0.01). This difference was due to a significantly higher incidence of persistent leukemia in the former group and not biased by differences in early death rates. No other variable was found predictive for the response to salvage treatment including age, WBC, serum LDH, morphologic subtype, presence or absence of DNA aneuploidy as detected by flow cytometry or maintenance chemotherapy. A low remission rate of 28% was also obtained in the 14 patients at second relapse. These data indicate that patients with a duration of their first remission of more than 6 months cannot be considered as being refractory against standard chemotherapy while patients with early relapses and second recurrences have a response rate of less than 30% due to refractory disease. Hence, the following criteria are proposed for the definition of refractoriness against standard chemotherapy in advanced AML: (a) nonresponse to first-line induction therapy, (b) early relapse within 6 to 12 months of first remission, (c) relapse after 6 to 12 months of first remission and failure on a reinduction attempt with established regimens, (d) second and subsequent relapses. These criteria may provide a useful rationale for the selection of the most appropriate treatment at relapse. They may also serve as eligibility criteria for clinical phase I/II studies and will facilitate interstudy comparisons.","['Hiddemann, W', 'Martin, W R', 'Sauerland, C M', 'Heinecke, A', 'Buchner, T']","['Hiddemann W', 'Martin WR', 'Sauerland CM', 'Heinecke A', 'Buchner T']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Munster, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'Thioguanine/therapeutic use']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Mar;4(3):184-8.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)', 'DAT protocol 1']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphoma cells from all of 26 HCL cases investigated displayed strong surface membrane staining with the MoAb B-ly7, whereas tumor cells from only one of 63 patients with other lymphoproliferative disorders of B cell type reacted with this antibody. The strong reactivity of hairy cells (HCs) with this marker was not altered after therapy as demonstrated on control biopsies taken from patients treated with interferon(IFN)-alpha-2 or 2'deoxycoformycin(DCF) six-64 weeks after start of treatment. This fact as well as the very low number of B-ly7 positive cells found in a series of 13 normal bone marrow biopsies (mean: 0.3% of bone marrow cells, range: 0.0%-1.0%), which could easily be distinguished from HCs by their lower staining intensity and their morphological appearance, provided the basis for the detection of even single HCs. In our hands, in terms of sensitivity the immunohistological detection of HCs using the MoAb B-ly7 was not only superior to classical morphological techniques but also to other immunohistological parameters usually applied for this purpose. Therefore, this MoAb provides a marker for the identification of HCs, hence monitoring disease activity in HCL, and particularly for a critical response evaluation in patients undergoing treatment with IFN-alpha or DCF.","['Thaler, J', 'Dietze, O', 'Faber, V', 'Greil, R', 'Gastl, G', 'Denz, H', 'Ho, A D', 'Huber, H']","['Thaler J', 'Dietze O', 'Faber V', 'Greil R', 'Gastl G', 'Denz H', 'Ho AD', 'Huber H']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Innsbruck, Austria.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Leukemia,Leukemia,8704895,IM,"['*Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*analysis', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/therapeutic use', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*diagnosis/immunology/therapy', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/pathology', 'Pentostatin/therapeutic use']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Leukemia. 1990 Mar;4(3):170-6.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '395575MZO7 (Pentostatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, on physical examination, there was no splenomegaly. CBC showed no immature myeloid cells, and neutrophil alkaline phosphatase was elevated. These manifestations were consistent with so called essential thrombocythemia (ET) with Ph1 chromosome reported by Nissenblatt. To know the megakaryokinetics of this case, we examined the number of colony forming unit-megakaryocyte (CFU-M), platelet glycoprotein (PGP) IIb/IIIa positive cells, cytoplasmic area, and DNA content, comparing with those of normal subjects, CML, and ET. We found a marked increase of CFU-M and PGP IIb/IIIa positive cells, but in contrast, decreased DNA content and cytoplasmic area. This pattern of megakaryokinetics was consistent with that of CML.

The comparison between the 2-chloroethyl sulfides and selenides 1-4 revealed the markedly enhanced nucleophilicity of selenium (Se) over sulfur (S) by two or more orders of magnitude. This finding indicates that a major consideration in the design of antitumor alkylating organoselenides is the reactivity of selenium. A Taft plot of the experimental first-order rate constant, knbp, and sigma* in a series of 2-chloroethylseleno compounds gave a slope of -1.73 (rho*), with the exception of 2-chloroethyl 2-nitrophenyl selenide (10). The anomalous behavior of 10 is explained in terms of the ortho-nitro stabilization effect directly interacting with the selenium atom of ethyleneselenonium ion to form a 5-membered cyclic intermediate. In the same series, a 5000-fold difference in alkylating reactivity offered only a sixfold variation in cytotoxicity against CCRF-CEM cells. Increasing the alkylating chain length from ethlene to propylene units markedly reduced alkylating reactivities. In the CH3Se(CH2)n Cl series, 16 (n = 3) was 1.5 X 10(5) times slower than 2 (n = 2) in NBP alkylation, revealing that 3-chloro-n-propyl selenides are not chemically reactive enough to be biological alkylating agents despite the presence of the highly nucleophilic selenium atom. Replacement of chloride with mesylate in 3-substituted propyl selenides, such as 17 and 20, restored desirable reactivities and cytotoxicities.","['Kang, S I', 'Spears, C P']","['Kang SI', 'Spears CP']","['Department of Medicine, University of Southern California Comprehensive Cancer Center, Los Angeles 90033.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,IM,"['Alkylating Agents/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Animals', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chemical Phenomena', 'Chemistry, Physical', 'Half-Life', 'Humans', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia L1210/pathology', 'Organometallic Compounds/chemical synthesis/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Rats', 'Selenium/*pharmacology/toxicity', 'Structure-Activity Relationship']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3549(15)48146-8 [pii]', '10.1002/jps.2600790114 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 1990 Jan;79(1):57-62. doi: 10.1002/jps.2600790114.,"['0 (Alkylating Agents)', '0 (Organometallic Compounds)', 'H6241UJ22B (Selenium)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eleven patients had undergone splenectomy; four had received prior systemic therapy with chlorambucil and/or steroids. All 15 are evaluable for toxicity and peripheral blood response, while 14 are assessable for bone marrow response. Toxicity was tolerable with grade 3 or 4 nausea and vomiting in three patients, neutropenic fevers in five, transient but significant depression in eight, and localized cutaneous herpes zoster in four. Circulating hairy cells were undetectable by the end of the first month in 10 of 13 patients, and by the end of the second month in the other three. Fourteen patients had bilateral bone marrow biopsies performed at baseline after 6 months of treatment, at the end of treatment (14 months), and at 6-month intervals during follow-up. Before treatment, all patients had hypercellular marrows with hairy cels replacing normal marrow elements; all showed at least a 95% clearing of their hairy cell infiltrate by 6 months of therapy. However, small collections of residual hairy cells could be detected intermittently on at least one side of bilateral samples in all patients. All patients have completed treatment with a median duration of follow-up off therapy of 27 months (range, 15 to 31 months). To date, all peripheral counts and serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL2R) levels remain stable, and no patient has had progression of the hairy cell infiltrate in the bone marrow.

Approximately 40% of these completely responding patients, whether they are treated with intensive chemotherapy, intensive chemotherapy followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation, or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, remain disease-free after 3 years of follow-up. As such, the likelihood for cure for adults with acute leukemia is approximately 25%-30%. At the present time, no new chemotherapeutic agents of significant importance are on the horizon. Furthermore, it seems doubtful that the mere juggling of drug doses will have any measurable effect on treatment outcome. The use of hematopoietic growth factors, either to allow added tolerance of intensive therapy or to synchronize leukemic cells kinetically, is now under study. Perhaps the most promising area of present investigations deals with immune manipulation. The administration of immunotoxins (a drug or a cell poison chemically linked to a leukemia-related monoclonal antibody) has been associated with promising results in eradicating minimal residual disease in animal model systems. Similarly, attempts at harnessing the graft-versus-leukemia effect without the eligibility restrictions and toxicities associated with the allograft procedure, through the use of lymphokines as enhancers of natural killer cell activity, have also proven to be effective in pre-clinical trials. With the availability of hematopoietic growth factors, immunotoxins, and lymphokines, clinical research in acute leukemia in the future will no longer focus on cytotoxic drugs alone but rather on how the addition of biological agents can prolong the duration of complete remission and increase the potential for cure.","['Mayer, R J']",['Mayer RJ'],"['Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*therapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Transplantation, Autologous']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01612646 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1990;116(1):94-6. doi: 10.1007/BF01612646.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Aspirated bone marrow cells from female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats that had been given continuous access to drinking water containing 400 ppm BNU were examined at intervals of 3-5 weeks for colony formation of granulomonocytic cells with or without supplemental colony-stimulating factor (CSF). Granulocytic leukemia was first observed at week 12, and the cumulative incidence reached 80% by week 30. SCs were obtained in 56% of rats in the early stage (3 weeks) and in up to 59% of rats in the late stages (20-25 weeks). However, in the middle stages colony formation was rare, even with the addition of CSF. When adherent cells were removed from the bone marrow cells, the SC-forming activity in the early stage was almost entirely lost, whereas much of that in the late stage remained. It is possible that in the former case, overproduction of endogenous CSF by adherent cells under the influence of BNU treatment could be involved. In contrast, late stage SC formation may be associated with the generation of altered cells, including leukemic or preleukemic elements, which have increased capacity for autonomous growth. The loss of SC-forming activity in the middle stage appeared to be attributable to an extreme reduction in endogenous CSF due to marked devastation of the bone marrow. Technical improvement in adjusting more precisely the level of CSF in the culture medium is required to enable further analysis of leukemogenesis, focused on the colony-forming activity of target cells.","['Takano, Y', 'Kitagawa, T', 'Urano, Y']","['Takano Y', 'Kitagawa T', 'Urano Y']","['Department of Pathology, Cancer Institute, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,7902060,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/*pathology', 'Colony-Stimulating Factors/physiology', 'Female', 'Leukemia, Experimental/chemically induced/*pathology', 'Nitrosourea Compounds', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred Strains', 'Stem Cells/*physiology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01612636 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol. 1990;116(1):24-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01612636.,"['0 (Colony-Stimulating Factors)', '0 (Nitrosourea Compounds)', '869-01-2 (N-nitrosobutylurea)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present studies were designed to address questions about PZDH activity on different treatment schedules, its activity against metastases, and the extent of its cross-resistance with established drugs. Human LOX amelanotic melanoma xenografts in athymic mice were used to explore schedule dependence and activity against natural metastases, and a series of drug-resistant murine leukemias provided an in vivo cross-resistance profile. Single-dose treatment and prolonged treatment provided equivalent therapeutic responses to PZDH by both the i.p. and i.v. routes in the i.p. LOX model. A s.c. LOX model resulting in spontaneous pulmonary metastases was adapted for bioassay and quantitation of the numbers of LOX cells killed by PZDH among both primary and metastatic cell populations. It was demonstrated that PZDH afforded about 2-log10 orders of magnitude greater cell kill among pulmonary metastases than against primary s.c. LOX tumors in the same mouse. Murine leukemias resistant to doxorubicin (ADR), vincristine (VCR), cisplatin (DDPt), methotrexate (MTX), N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea (BCNU), and cyclophosphamide (CPA) were not cross-resistant to PZDH. However, both P388 and L1210 leukemia sublines resistant to melphalan (L-PAM) were cross-resistant to PZDH, suggesting that patients previously treated with L-PAM might have less likelihood of response to PZDH than those who had had no opportunity to develop L-PAM resistance.

Since complete inhibition of DNA synthesis would prevent further incorporation of ara-CTP, ara-C may have a self-limiting effect on its own cytotoxicity, particularly at the high concentrations typical of high-dose ara-C clinical protocols. In this study, the incorporation of [3H]-dThd and [3H]-ara-C into DNA were compared. Within 1 h of exposure of L5178Y cells to ara-C, the rate of [3H]-dThd incorporation into the acid-insoluble fraction was reduced by 98%. Despite this nearly complete block in [3H]-dThd incorporation, DNA synthesis was not completely inhibited since [3H]-ara-C continued to be incorporated for up to 6 h, although a plateau in ara-CDNA synthesis was observed between 2 and 3 h exposure when ara-CTP levels were maximal. The effect of ara-C on [3H]-dThd incorporation into DNA was due in part to an indirect effect of ara-C on the metabolism of intracellular [3H]-dThd to [3H]-dTTP. Within 30 min exposure to 10 microM ara-C, the rate of cellular [3H]-dTTP synthesis was slowed to only 15% of the control rate. This was not due to inhibition of [3H]-dThd transport, since the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of the nucleoside were equal. The effect of ara-C on [3H]-dTTP synthesis resulted from significant changes in deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphate (dNTP) pools. dTTP, dATP, and dGTP levels were increased, whereas the dCTP concentration was decreased. When dThd kinase from L5178Y cells was assayed with increased dTTP levels induced by ara-C vs the dTTP level in control cells, its activity was reduced by 72%. Thus, the [3H]-dThd incorporation experiment overestimated the extent of inhibition of DNA synthesis by ara-C due to increased feedback inhibition of dThd kinase and increased competition for DNA polymerase between the elevated unlabeled dTTP pool and the decreased levels of [3H]-dTTP. In vitro assay of DNA polymerase in the presence of the ara-CTP concentration achieved after 0.5 or 3 h exposure to 10 microM ara-C (60 microM and 200 microM, respectively), plus the mixture of dNTPs found intracellularly at these times, resulted in 57% and 80% inhibition of the polymerase, respectively. This inhibition may account for the plateau in the accumulation of ara-CDNA that was observed at 3 h and suggests that ara-C incorporation may be self-limiting at high cellular concentrations of ara-CTP.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Wang, L M', 'White, J C', 'Capizzi, R L']","['Wang LM', 'White JC', 'Capizzi RL']","['Cancer Center of Wake Forest University, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC 27103.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate/metabolism', 'Cytarabine/metabolism/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/metabolism', 'DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase/metabolism', 'Depression, Chemical', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Ribonucleoside Diphosphate Reductase/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Thymidine Kinase/metabolism', 'Thymine Nucleotides/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00686052 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;25(6):418-24. doi: 10.1007/BF00686052.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Thymine Nucleotides)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '13191-15-6 (Arabinofuranosylcytosine Triphosphate)', 'EC 1.17.4.- (CDP reductase)', 'EC 1.17.4.1 (Ribonucleoside Diphosphate Reductase)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA-Directed DNA Polymerase)', ""QOP4K539MU (thymidine 5'-triphosphate)"", 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",['CA 12197/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For this reason we investigated metallothionein-like proteins ('MTs') in these cells. Soluble protein extracts from cultures treated for 24 h with cis-DDP, zinc sulphate or saline were anaerobically eluted from columns of chemically reduced Sephadex G-75, and the profiles of zinc, copper and platinum were determined along with those for incorporated radioactive cyst(e)ine and tyrosine. Both saline-treated cell lines contained similar levels of 'MTs', which were induced by exposure to a minimally toxic level of zinc (100 microM). Zinc induction of 'MTs' was nearly 4-fold greater in L1210 than in L1210-PDD cells. The levels of mRNA for metallothionein I (MTI) and II (MTII) in uninduced cells were measured by dot-blotting with a cDNA probe. The L1210-PDD cells contained 80% of the MTI and 41% of the MTII compared with L1210 cells, confirming the similar levels in uninduced cells. L1210-PDD cells were 2-fold more sensitive than L1210 cells to cadmium and equally sensitive to zinc. Thus, the resistance of L1210-PDD cells to cis-DDP was not associated with cross-resistance to group IIb metals, whereas their sensitivity to cadmium did reflect the relative inability of the cells to synthesize 'MTs'. The L1210 cells produced 'MTs' when treated with 0.5 and 5.0 microM cis-DDP, but the L1210-PDD cells did not when treated with 5.0-40 microM cis-DDP.

In vitro differentiation of blast cells into granulocytic, erythroid, and megakaryocytic lineages.",1538-44,"A 57-year-old man with essential thrombocythemia (ET) developed myelofibrosis, that progressed to a blastic transformation state. The characteristics of the blastic cells were serially studied both morphologically and phenotypically as well as in cell culture. The blastic cells that were first detected in peripheral blood had features of myeloid stem cells with slight differentiation toward megakaryocytic lineage. However, later in the course, most of the blastic cells were immature. During culture in the presence of human plasma-derived serum (PDS), some blastic cells obtained at the initial stage differentiated, mainly to both granulocytes and macrophages morphologically, but later tended to differentiate into both megakaryocytes and macrophages. Finally the blasts appeared to have lost their ability to differentiate morphologically. However, the blasts formed mixed colonies consisting of erythroblasts, granulocytes, macrophages, and immature blasts when cultured in methylcellulose with PHA-leukocyte conditioned medium. In addition, the blastic cells in suspension culture strongly expressed phenotypic features which are characteristic of erythroblasts, in the presence of both PDS and 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA), whereas they expressed features of megakaryoblasts in the presence of PDS alone. These results suggest that essential thrombocythemia is of myeloid stem cell origin. This is the first case in the literature in which a clonal evolution in ET has been followed closely, essential events were identified serially, and the blastic cells, which appeared as a result of the progression of ET, were found to have the capability to differentiate toward the three myeloid lineages.","['Kimura, A', 'Fujimoto, T', 'Inada, T', 'Imamura, N', 'Oguma, N', 'Kajihara, H', 'Mtasiwa, D M', 'Katoh, O', 'Fujimura, K', 'Kuramoto, A']","['Kimura A', 'Fujimoto T', 'Inada T', 'Imamura N', 'Oguma N', 'Kajihara H', 'Mtasiwa DM', 'Katoh O', 'Fujimura K', 'Kuramoto A']","['Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Hiroshima University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Blast Crisis/immunology/*pathology', 'Cell Differentiation', 'Cytoplasm/ultrastructure', 'Erythrocytes/pathology', 'Granulocytes/pathology', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Megakaryocytes/pathology', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'Thrombocythemia, Essential/genetics/immunology/*pathology']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19900401)65:7<1538::aid-cncr2820650715>3.0.co;2-3 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Apr 1;65(7):1538-44. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900401)65:7<1538::aid-cncr2820650715>3.0.co;2-3.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Donor marrow was depleted of lymphocytes using counterflow centrifugation. Median age of the recipients was 31 years. Pretransplant conditioning consisted of cyclophosphamide and fractionated total body irradiation (TBI) with a low (4.1 +/- 0.3 cGy/min) or high (13.1 +/- 1.6 cGy/min) midline average dose rate. In 43 patients, cytosine-arabinoside or anthracyclines were added to the conditioning regimen. Immunoprophylaxis posttransplant consisted of methotrexate (MTX) alone, cyclosporine A (CsA) in combination with MTX, or CsA alone; two patients received no immunoprophylaxis at all. Graft failure occurred in 4 of 77 evaluable patients (5%). The probability of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) greater than or equal to grade 2 at day 100 after transplantation was 15%. The projected 3-year estimate of extensive chronic GVHD was 12%. Only three patients died of cytomegalovirus-interstitial pneumonitis. The projected 3-year probability of relapse was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], range 8% to 53%) in transplants for AML in first complete remission (CR1), 35% (95% CI, 1% to 69%) after transplantation for ALL in CR1, and 38% (95% CI, 2% to 74%) after transplantation for CML in first chronic phase (CP1). The projected 3-year probability of leukemia-free survival (LFS) was 56% (95% CI, 35% to 77%) after transplantation for AML-CR1, 42% (95% CI, 16% to 69%) in patients transplanted for ALL-CR1, and 49% (95% CI, 18% to 80%) after transplantation for CML-CP1. After transplantation for AML-CR1, ALL-CR1, or CML-CP1, the median follow-up time for leukemia-free survivors was 31+, 30+, and 21+ months, respectively. Probabilities of relapse, survival, and LFS in AML-CR1 and ALL-CR1 transplants were comparable with those reported in recipients of untreated grafts. In patients transplanted for CML-CP1, probability of relapse was higher and probability of LFS was lower than in recipients of untreated grafts. In transplants for leukemia in CR1 and CP1, preparative regimen and immunoprophylaxis posttransplant were not associated significantly with the probability of acute GVHD greater than or equal to grade 2, extensive chronic GVHD, relapse, survival, or LFS.

Forty patients with CML in chronic phase (CP) received cytoreduction followed by BMT with HLA-matched T cell-depleted allogeneic marrow. The remaining 24 patients were transplanted in second chronic, accelerated, or blastic phase, or received T cell-depleted grafts with a dose of T cells added back. The Y chromosome and autosomal heteromorphisms were used to distinguish between donor and host cells. Mixed hematopoietic chimerism (presence of donor and host cells) was identified in 90% of patients in first CP. The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome reappeared in 16 of the 40 first CP CML patients. As expected, patients who had detectable Ph chromosome positive cells at any time during the posttransplant period had a high likelihood of subsequent clinical relapse. Transient disappearance of the Ph positive clone was rarely observed, and was followed by reappearance of the Ph chromosome or clinical relapse. A subset of engrafted patients with greater than 25% host cells within 3 months post-BMT had a significantly shorter survival time free of cytogenetic or clinical relapse compared with other patients. In patients who had received donor T cells added to the T cell-depleted graft, there was a higher proportion of complete chimerism. Clonal progression of Ph positive as well as negative cells was observed and may be the result of radiation induced breakage.

We studied the effects of bryostatin 1 on the growth of human leukemias in vitro. Bryostatin 1 inhibited 1 to 4 logs of clonogenic leukemia cell growth from three of four leukemia cell lines. Bryostatin 1 also inhibited, by at least 1 log, the proliferation of clonogenic acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) cells from 10 to 12 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed ANLL. Maximal inhibition of leukemic growth occurred at 10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L bryostatin 1. Interestingly, bryostatin 1 also inhibited the growth of hematopoietic progenitors from eight patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Leukemia cells exposed to bryostatin 1 for up to 96 hours and then washed, demonstrated no substantial inhibition of clonogenic growth, indicating that the anti-leukemic effect of bryostatin 1 is cytostatic. The phorbol ester 12-0-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) produced more potent inhibition of clonogenic leukemia growth, and this inhibition was blocked by bryostatin 1. Thus, the anti-leukemic activity of bryostatin 1 may be mediated through activation of protein kinase C. Bryostatin 1 inhibits clonogenic leukemia cells at concentrations that stimulate normal hematopoietic progenitors. The differential effects of bryostatin 1 on normal and abnormal hematopoiesis suggest that bryostatin 1 may have value in the treatment of leukemias and MDS.","['Jones, R J', 'Sharkis, S J', 'Miller, C B', 'Rowinsky, E K', 'Burke, P J', 'May, W S']","['Jones RJ', 'Sharkis SJ', 'Miller CB', 'Rowinsky EK', 'Burke PJ', 'May WS']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD 21205.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Bryostatins', 'Cell Line', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Lactones/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia/*pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Prolymphocytic/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/pathology/physiopathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/pathology/physiopathology', 'Macrolides', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/pathology/physiopathology', 'Phorbol Esters/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/03/15 00:00,1990/03/15 00:01,['1990/03/15 00:00'],"['1990/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84422-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Mar 15;75(6):1319-23.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Bryostatins)', '0 (Lactones)', '0 (Macrolides)', '0 (Phorbol Esters)', '37O2X55Y9E (bryostatin 1)']",['CA47993/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A novel action of hydrocortisone (HC), to reduce increased [Ca2+]i and consequently inhibit LTC4 formation is assessed. Half-maximal time for elevation of [Ca2+]i induced by antigen was less than 1 min, and maximal elevation of [Ca2+]i (3-fold increase) was reached within 2-3 min. This high [Ca2+]i level waned gradually by 27% during 20 min of incubation. For induction of LTC4 formation, however, there was a refractory period of about 2 min, and half-maximal elevation was at 11 min. Following pretreatment with HC, the antigen-stimulated increase in [Ca2+]i was stunted by 41% at 2-3 min and by 73% at 20 min. LTC4 formation was almost abolished. There was a lag period of at least 2 h to observe any inhibition in both parameters, and the maximal inhibition was about 4 h. Cycloheximide, and receptor antagonist to glucocorticosteroid (RU486) completely prevented the inhibitory effects of HC on elevated [Ca2+]i and LTC4 formation. Estradiol and aldosterone (each at 2.10(-6) M) were virtually inactive, while another glucocorticosteroid, dexamethasone (2.10(-7) M) markedly suppressed antigen induction in both parameters. It is proposed that the inhibitory effect of HC on the formation of LTC4 could be attributed mainly to its ability to reduce elevated [Ca2+]i.","['Her, E', 'Weissman, B A', 'Zor, U']","['Her E', 'Weissman BA', 'Zor U']","['Department of Hormone Research, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Calcium/*metabolism', 'Cytosol/metabolism', 'Dinitrophenols/pharmacology', 'Drug Antagonism', 'Hydrocortisone/*pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mifepristone/pharmacology', 'Rats', 'SRS-A/*biosynthesis', 'Serum Albumin, Bovine/pharmacology', 'Time Factors', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/02/19 00:00,1990/02/19 00:01,['1990/02/19 00:00'],"['1990/02/19 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/19 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/19 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(90)90195-J [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(90)90195-j [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Feb 19;1051(2):203-6. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(90)90195-j.,"['0 (Dinitrophenols)', '0 (SRS-A)', '0 (dinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin)', '27432CM55Q (Serum Albumin, Bovine)', '320T6RNW1F (Mifepristone)', 'SY7Q814VUP (Calcium)', 'WI4X0X7BPJ (Hydrocortisone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Km values for iron and zinc with mesoporphyrin IX were 3.51 and 3.17 microM, respectively. The purified enzyme showed a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 42,000 daltons (42 kDa) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The rabbit antibody against the purified enzyme markedly inhibited activities of the enzyme from both the kidney and liver. Immunoblot analysis showed that the antibody reacted with the renal as well as the hepatic enzymes showing the same molecular weight. Peptide mapping with trypsin or alpha-chymotrypsin showed that digested peptides of renal enzyme were similar to those of hepatic enzyme. Ferrochelatase activity in mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells increased in parallel with an increase of heme synthesis by treatment with dimethylsulfoxide. Using immunoblotting techniques, the amount of the enzyme in the MEL cells has been shown to increase by the induction, showing a molecular mass of 41 kDa which was the same as that of the mouse hepatic enzyme. Comparative structural analysis of the enzyme of MEL cells and that of mouse liver by peptide mapping showed that the partial digestive peptides of both enzymes exhibited a similar pattern. These results strongly suggest that ferrochelatase in kidney, liver and erythroid cells can be of one type.","['Nakahashi, Y', 'Taketani, S', 'Sameshima, Y', 'Tokunaga, R']","['Nakahashi Y', 'Taketani S', 'Sameshima Y', 'Tokunaga R']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Cattle', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Ferrochelatase/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Immunoblotting', 'Iron/metabolism', 'Kidney/*enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Lyases/*metabolism', 'Mesoporphyrins/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Mitochondria/enzymology', 'Molecular Weight', 'Protoporphyrins/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4838(90)90032-B [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4838(90)90032-b [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Mar 1;1037(3):321-7. doi: 10.1016/0167-4838(90)90032-b.,"['0 (Mesoporphyrins)', '0 (Protoporphyrins)', '493-90-3 (mesoporphyrin IX)', 'C2K325S808 (protoporphyrin IX)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'EC 4.- (Lyases)', 'EC 4.99.1.1 (Ferrochelatase)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Their outcome was compared with that of 35 patients with a median age of 34 years (range 30-39), and a group of patients with age younger than 30 years (median 24; range 16-29) transplanted for the same indications. Donors were human leucocyte antigen (HLA)-identical, mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) negative siblings. All marrow grafts were depleted of lymphocytes by counterflow centrifugation. The estimated event-free survival at 3 years after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation was 60.7% for patients with age greater than 39 years, 57.8% for patients with age less than 30, and 43.0% for the intermediate age group (P greater than 0.3). The estimated transplant-related mortality showed no tendency to increase with older age of recipients.

Chronic GVHD resolved completely in five out of seven patients aged 40 years or more. Reduction of the incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease by physical lymphocyte depletion allows allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for patients aged 40-50 years without increase of transplant-related mortality resulting in similar event-free survival in patients older than 40 years compared to those younger than 40 years.","['Bar, B M', 'De Witte, T', 'Schattenberg, A', 'Boezeman, J', 'Hoogenhout, J']","['Bar BM', 'De Witte T', 'Schattenberg A', 'Boezeman J', 'Hoogenhout J']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University Hospital Nijmegen, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cell Separation/methods', 'Centrifugation/methods', 'Chronic Disease', 'Female', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Postoperative Complications/mortality']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02537.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Jan;74(1):53-60. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02537.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a follow-up study of 94 patients with AISA diagnosed according to FAB criteria for myelodysplastic syndromes we found a striking difference in the risk of leukaemic transformation between PSA and RARS (5 year cumulative rate 1.9% v. 48%). Overall survival was much better in PSA than in RARS (5 year cumulative chance 69% v. 19%). Infections and haemorrhages were frequent causes of death in RARS but not in PSA. Bone marrow culture studies (CFU-GM) were performed on 10 consecutive patients with PSA and RARS, respectively. RARS patients showed grossly impaired colony growth, typical of the myelodysplastic syndromes. Patients with PSA had persisting colony formation, even if moderately decreased in frequency, with numbers of CFU-GM being inversely correlated with the degree of erythroid hyperplasia in the bone marrow. We conclude that on cytomorphological grounds AISA can be divided into pure (dyserythropoietic) sideroblastic anaemia (PSA) and a true myelodysplastic form (RARS), with both types differing considerably in terms of survival, risk of leukaemic transformation and findings on bone marrow culture (CFU-GM).","['Gattermann, N', 'Aul, C', 'Schneider, W']","['Gattermann N', 'Aul C', 'Schneider W']","['Abteilung fur Hamatologie, Onkologie und klinische Immunologie, Medizinische Klinik und Poliklinik der Universitat Dusseldorf.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Sideroblastic/*classification/mortality/pathology', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/pathology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/pathology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/etiology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precancerous Conditions/pathology', 'Prognosis']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02536.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Jan;74(1):45-52. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb02536.x.,,,['Br J Haematol. 1990 Aug;75(4):633-4.

We failed to localize the breakpoint in one patient. The median durations of chronic phase (37 versus 44 months respectively) and of survival (50 versus 51 months respectively) for patients with 5' and 3' breakpoints were not significantly different. When we analysed only patients whose DNA was collected within 4 weeks of diagnosis (5' breakpoints, n = 30; 3' breakpoints, n = 19), there was again no significant difference in duration of chronic phase or survival. The median survivals of patients divided into good, intermediate and poor prognosis categories in accordance with the prognostic index developed by Sokal and colleagues were 54, 50 and 26 months respectively.

PGA1 and di-M-PGA2 did not affect the long-term survival of normal non-infected CBL, whereas they suppressed the proliferation of an established cord-blood derived HTLV-I positive cell line, MT-2. As shown by the number of HTLV-I infected p19+ cells, the block of the selection of immortalised, infected clones by PGAs did not appear to be due to an inhibition of early stages of HTLV-I infection. The possibility that the effect of PGAs could be mediated by an action on the immune response was also examined. PGAs regulated the cell-mediated cytotoxic function of CBL to a different extent when normal non-infected or HTLV-I exposed CBL were compared. In fact, PGAs down-regulated the natural killing and macrophage/lymphocyte cytotoxic response of normal CBL, whereas they did not modify the already depressed immune response of CBL challenged with HTLV-I. These results suggest that the protective effect of PGAs against HTLV-I infection in vitro is mostly related to the direct suppression of the clonal expansion of virus-infected cells, rather than to the anti-viral activity or modulation of the cell-mediated immunity.","[""D'Onofrio, C"", 'Alvino, E', 'Garaci, E', 'Bonmassar, E', 'Santoro, M G']","[""D'Onofrio C"", 'Alvino E', 'Garaci E', 'Bonmassar E', 'Santoro MG']","['Department of Experimental Medicine and Biochemical Sciences, II University of Rome, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Cells, Cultured', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic/drug effects', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Immunologic', 'Fetal Blood/microbiology', 'HTLV-I Infections/*blood', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular/drug effects', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/immunology/microbiology', 'Mitosis/drug effects', 'Prostaglandins A/*pharmacology', 'Prostaglandins A, Synthetic/pharmacology', 'Time Factors']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1990.38 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1990 Feb;61(2):207-14. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1990.38.,"['0 (Prostaglandins A)', '0 (Prostaglandins A, Synthetic)']",,,,,PMC1971418,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, cellular mechanisms that release transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) in an active form have not been fully elucidated. Investigated herein are the effects of L-TGF-beta 1 on various leukemic cell lines. Heat-activated L-TGF-beta 1 inhibited colony formation of U937, KG-1 and HL-60, whereas untreated L-TGF-beta 1 had only a marginal effect on these cells. In contrast, colony formation of human erythroleukemia cell line (HEL) was markedly inhibited by both heat-activated and untreated L-TGF-beta 1. In vitro incubation of L-TGF-beta 1 with HEL cells did not release the active form in the culture supernatants. These results suggest that HEL cells are capable of activating L-TGF-beta 1, but only in a cell-associated manner. Since HEL cells produce L-TGF-beta 1, it may act as an autocrine negative growth factor on these cells.","['Piao, Y F', 'Ichijo, H', 'Miyagawa, K', 'Ohashi, H', 'Takaku, F', 'Miyazono, K']","['Piao YF', 'Ichijo H', 'Miyagawa K', 'Ohashi H', 'Takaku F', 'Miyazono K']","['Third Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochem Biophys Res Commun,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,0372516,IM,"['Animals', 'Carnivora', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Hot Temperature', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*pathology', 'Recombinant Proteins/pharmacology', 'Transforming Growth Factors/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*drug effects']",1990/02/28 00:00,1990/02/28 00:01,['1990/02/28 00:00'],"['1990/02/28 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/28 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/28 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-291X(90)91725-8 [pii]', '10.1016/0006-291x(90)91725-8 [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 1990 Feb 28;167(1):27-32. doi: 10.1016/0006-291x(90)91725-8.,"['0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '76057-06-2 (Transforming Growth Factors)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The predominant effect observed was a significant reduction of the antileukemic action of this compound in old-aged mice. Together with a slight increase in several toxicity parameters this caused a marked reduction of the therapeutic index in 12-month-old mice compared to younger individuals. Furthermore, a general tendency to increased ambazone levels in liver, kidneys and thymus of old-aged mice was observed. Our data therefore provide further evidence that age has to be taken into consideration as one factor that may account for the variety of drug response frequently observed during clinical therapy with anticancer agents.","['Amlacher, R', 'Baumgart, J', 'Hartl, A', 'Weber, H', 'Kuhnel, H J', 'Schulze, W', 'Hoffmann, H']","['Amlacher R', 'Baumgart J', 'Hartl A', 'Weber H', 'Kuhnel HJ', 'Schulze W', 'Hoffmann H']","['Central Institute of Microbiology and Experimental Therapy, Academy of Sciences of the GDR, Jena.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",Germany,Arch Geschwulstforsch,Archiv fur Geschwulstforschung,0372411,IM,"['Aging/*drug effects/physiology', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacokinetics/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation, Preclinical', 'Female', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Mitoguazone/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Tissue Distribution/physiology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Arch Geschwulstforsch. 1990;60(1):11-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', 'BYK4592A3Q (1,4-benzoquinone guanylhydrazone thiosemicarbazone)', 'OD5Q0L447W (Mitoguazone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Three patients could be considered to have either the monosomy 7 syndrome or ""juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia,"" indicating that these two entities are not mutually exclusive. All patients fulfilled the French-American-British (FAB) criteria for a myelodysplastic syndrome. Clonal chromosomal abnormalities were detected in 13 of the 14 patients, and consistently involved either monosomy 7, multiple abnormalities, and/or multiple clones. Hematopoietic progenitor assays of blood and marrow samples obtained from most patients showed abnormal progenitor frequencies, or differentiation patterns in culture (or both), often affecting the erythroid as well as the granulopoietic lineages. In particular, granulopoietic progenitors from four to six patients in the ""juvenile chronic myeloid leukemia"" category generated predominantly abnormal appearing macrophage colonies. Clinical outcomes were poor with rapid transformation to acute myeloid leukemia in most patients. All treated patients responded poorly to conventional chemotherapy, although in two cases remission was achieved with intensive therapy and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Childhood myelodysplasia includes a group of diseases that are clinically heterogeneous, and current terminology is confused and inconsistent.

Patients who remained in continuous complete remission showed no decline in global intelligence quotient (IQ). Patients who experienced CNS relapse had a mean decline of 16 IQ points by 3 years postdiagnosis and the long-term survivors displayed a mean loss of 25 IQ points 5-6 years postdiagnosis. Three of the five long-term survivors of CNS relapse function within the retarded range of mental ability and require special education. The other two have learning problems and display poor academic performance relative to same-age peers. There was no association noted between age at diagnosis and ultimate loss of IQ points.

In all of our studies, in vitro cytotoxicity was determined by clonogenic assay, and drug interaction was quantitated using the multiple drug-effect analysis method. The cells were incubated for one hour (4-HC) and/or 4 hours (cisplatin). We found that the drugs in combination had cytotoxic synergism against human leukemia cell lines (K-562 and Raji). The synergism was sequence-dependent (cells must be exposed to 4-HC first), was present at various molar ratios of the drugs, and most pronounced at high levels of cell kill. We also found that the drugs had cytotoxic synergism against normal human marrow progenitors (CFU-GM). However, the leukemic cells were approximately 55 times more sensitive to the combination than CFU-GM. In a murine system, the drugs were synergistic against L1210 leukemia cells and normal murine CFU-GM, but L1210 cells were at least 130 times more sensitive to the combination than CFU-GM. To determine the ability of L1210 cells to grow in vivo after exposure to the drugs, BDF1 mice were injected with 2 x 10(4) cells which had been incubated with 4-HC and/or cisplatin. The survival time of untreated controls was 13 +/- 2.8 days. For treated groups, the cure rates after 50 days of observation were 33% (4-HC, 40 uM), 0% (cisplatin, 8 uM), and 100% (4-HC + cisplatin). Finally, at concentrations resulting in equivalent toxicity to marrow CFU-GM, cisplatin seemed to be more toxic to murine spleen blast colony forming cells (CFC-BC) than 4-HC. The drugs in combination appeared to have at least additive toxicities against CFC-BC.","['Peters, R H', 'Brandon, C S', 'Avila, L A', 'Gale, G R', 'Stuart, R K']","['Peters RH', 'Brandon CS', 'Avila LA', 'Gale GR', 'Stuart RK']","['Department of Cell and Molecular Pharmacology, Medical University of South Carolina, Veterans Administration Hospital, Charleston, South Carolina 29425.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cisplatin/administration & dosage', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives', 'Drug Synergism', 'Humans', 'Leukemia L1210/therapy', 'Lymphocyte Activation/drug effects', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Spleen/cytology/drug effects', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1990;333:57-68.,"['8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Issues such as maximum storage time and acquisition of consent for marrow disposal need to be addressed before a large inventory is accumulated. Consideration should also be given to using non-infused marrows for research purposes. Eighty-three bone marrow transplant centers were surveyed in an attempt to establish a data base with regard to guidelines for storage of cryopreserved human bone marrow. Fifty-two centers (62.7%) responded to the questionnaire, 5 of which did not have an active cryopreservation program. The remaining 47 centers freeze and store autologous marrow from patients with leukemia, lymphoma, neuroblastoma and a large diversity of other conditions including solid tumors. Twelve centers (25.5%) specify maximum storage times of up to 5 years, but only 9 centers (19.1%) require the donor to sign a specific consent form for marrow disposal if it is not used for transplantation within a given time. Eighty-five percent of the responding centers reinfuse at least half of the marrows they freeze within 12 months of harvesting. It appears that at least 90% of marrows that are being reinfused have been stored for three years or less. However, the storage time of non-infused marrows extends even further, and autologous marrow has been reinfused successfully as long as eight years after storage.","['Areman, E M', 'Sacher, R A', 'Deeg, H J']","['Areman EM', 'Sacher RA', 'Deeg HJ']","['Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, D.C.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', '*Cryopreservation', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/therapy', 'Surveys and Questionnaires', 'Tissue Preservation/*methods']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1990;333:523-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Italian Study Group.,21-36; discussion 37-8,"The success of autologous bone marrow transplantation (ABMT) in acute leukemia (AL) in complete remission (CR) is limited by the high relapse rate. It is generally accepted that minimal residual disease (MRD) plays a major role in determining the relapse of disease. In our study we investigated in adult acute leukemia and in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), the efficacy of ex vivo marrow purging with mafosfamide (an in vitro derivative of cyclophosphamide). We also describe an improved purging approach (""programmed method"") based on the evaluation of sensitivity to the drug measured in each individual patient prior to ABMT. The analysis of clinical data in terms of disease-free survival (DFS) shows that the ""programmed method"" gives significantly better results than those obtained using the standard dose of mafosfamide (80% DFS in 18 AL patients vs. 44% in 33 ANLL patients and 33% in 56 ALL patients). The evaluation of the CR to purging interval in ALL and ANLL shows that a period of greater than 6 months is necessary to obtain longer DFS. Considering pre-transplant regimens, busulfan-cyclophosphamide is more effective in ANLL, and cyclophosphamide-fractionated total body irradiation is the best treatment for ALL. The studies using mafosfamide marrow purging in CML demonstrate that the drug is able to achieve a decrease of the Ph1+ marker. Three patients who showed conversion of this cytogenetic marker have been autografted with interesting clinical results.","['Rizzoli, V', 'Mangoni, L']","['Rizzoli V', 'Mangoni L']","['Department of Hematology, Parma University, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Adult', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/*drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cyclophosphamide/*analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/therapy', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/therapy', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/therapy']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1990;333:21-36; discussion 37-8.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lymphocytes can be efficiently killed in bone marrow buffy coat preparations using the antibody and donor human serum as a means to avoid graft versus host disease (GVHD) (Waldmann et al., 1984). An analysis of 520 matched sibling bone marrow transplants (BMT) for leukaemia demonstrates that T-cell depletion using CAMPATH-1M markedly reduces the incidence and severity of GVHD, but there is an increased risk of graft rejection. In the case of CGL in chronic phase, there is also an associated extra risk of relapse, particularly in patients where engraftment may have been compromised (Hale et al., 1988a). A rat IgG2b antibody of the same specificity as CAMPATH-1 (CAMPATH-1G) was developed which is able to both fix human complement and opsonize lymphocytes in vivo (Dyer et al., 1989). Initial studies for the prophylaxis of bone marrow rejection in 55 mismatched and matched unrelated donor (MUD) BMTs suggest that CAMPATH-1G treatment of the recipient may reduce, but not eliminate, marrow graft rejection. The broad CAMPATH-1 specificity means that it is also ideal for purging a range of lymphoid malignancies prior to autologous BMT, or even for direct serotherapy of leukaemic patients. However, there may be limitations of monoclonal antibody purging using complement or other natural effector mechanisms either in vivo or in vitro; in particular, antigenic modulation and an antiglobulin response. Phase 1 studies of ""in vivo purging"" with a monovalent CD3 antibody (Clark et al., 1989), and also with a genetically engineered humanized IgG1 (CAMPATH-1H) (Hale et al., 1988b) suggest that these limitations can be overcome.","['Cobbold, S P', 'Hale, G', 'Clark, M R', 'Waldmann, H']","['Cobbold SP', 'Hale G', 'Clark MR', 'Waldmann H']","['Department of Pathology, Cambridge University, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Complement System Proteins/*immunology', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'Graft vs Host Disease/prevention & control', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/mortality/therapy', 'Recurrence', 'Survival Rate', 'T-Lymphocytes/immunology', 'Transplantation, Autologous', 'Transplantation, Homologous']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1990;333:139-51; discussion 152-4.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '9007-36-7 (Complement System Proteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These activated cells have the capacity to recognize and kill a wide range of neoplastic cells. The cytotoxic activity of LAK cells does not appear to be directed against normal, non-neoplastic cells and we have recently examined the potential for using LAK cells as a method of purging bone marrow for autologous transplantation in patients with widespread neoplastic diseases. We have utilized an experimental system consisting of the incubation of LAK cells from inbred F344 rats and normal bone marrow and demonstrated that this procedure does not interfere with the ability of the treated bone marrow to reconstitute lethally-conditioned recipients. The frequency and rate of reconstitution is the same in treatment and control groups, including incubation periods that extend up to 18 hours. When RNK-16 leukemia cell line (a spontaneous large granular lymphocyte leukemia that is syngeneic to the F344 strain) is added to the incubation mixture, the LAK cells have the ability in vitro to recognize the neoplastic cells and prevent the transmission of the leukemia to naive animals following bone marrow transplantation. As expected from the in vitro LAK cytotoxic activity, these activated cells are capable of recognizing and eliminating a variety of neoplasms. To date we have tested three different hematopoietic tumor lines derived from the F344 strain and one that was induced in an unrelated BN strain. In each case, the F344 LAK cells demonstrated an ability to prevent the transmission of a fatal leukemia and significantly prolong the survival of animals that had received larger numbers of neoplastic cells. The tumor lines examined included the RNK-16 line (NK cells), the Dunning leukemia (monocyte-lymphoblastic leukemia), a T-lymphocyte lymphoma and the acute myelogenous leukemia of BN rats (BN AML). Comparison of the results of these purging experiments to those seen when control animals are injected with graded doses of the individual tumors indicate that the LAK cells are eliminating approximately 2-3 logs of neoplastic cells. The ability of LAK cells to kill a wide range of tumors without damage to the ability of the recipient stem cells to reconstitute the bone marrow may allow for an important application for this type of purging technique in patients with neoplasms for which specific immunological or chemical therapies do not exist.","['Cramer, D V', 'Long, G S']","['Cramer DV', 'Long GS']","['Department of Pathology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, Pennsylvania 15261.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Prog Clin Biol Res,Progress in clinical and biological research,7605701,IM,"['Animals', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Experimental/immunology', 'Lymphoma/immunology', 'Rats', 'Rats, Inbred F344', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Prog Clin Biol Res. 1990;333:125-35; discussion 136-7.,,['GM 38804/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thus, they would appear to be ideal candidates for marrow purging. In contrast to most anti-cancer drugs, these compounds act on the cell membrane resulting in inhibition of phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. In addition, these compounds inhibit protein kinase C activity and may interfere with signal transmission. In low doses in in vitro systems, they have been shown to induce differentiation in leukemic cell lines. Lethally irradiated Balb/c mice were injected with normal bone marrow cells containing 1-2% leukemic cells (WEHI III-B) to simulate a remission marrow after the cells were incubated in vitro for 24 hours with 0-100 ug/ml of 1-0-octadecyl-2-0-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ALP). All the mice given cells not treated with ALP succumbed to leukemia, whereas there was a dose-response increase in survival in those given ALP treated cells. Similar results were observed when the cells were cryopreserved and thawed before injection. Very little effect of ALP was noted on stem cells as measured by the spleen colony assay. In vitro studies using human marrow progenitor assays (CFU-GEMM) were undertaken in which marrow was mixed with 0.1% HL60 cells and exposed for 1 or 4 hours to ALP at 0, 25 and 50 ug/ml. The cells were plated and assayed for CFU-GEMM and leukemic colonies. At 50 ug/ml, HL60 colonies were eliminated and there was no significant reduction in normal marrow progenitor cells. Clinical trials were initiated. Eleven patients with acute leukemia in remission who were candidates for autologous bone marrow transplantation had marrow harvested, incubated with 50 ug/ml of ALP and cryopreserved. CFU-GEMM assays before and after purging showed no differences. There was a similar significant reduction after cryopreservation regardless of whether marrows were purged. Two patients were transplanted with purged marrow, one in early relapse and one in a marrow remission, but had evidence of CNS leukemia. In both, ablative therapy consisted of cytosine arabinoside, 3 gm/m2 x 12 doses, followed by fractionated TBI to a total of 12 Gy prior to reinfusion of thawed marrow. The patient in early relapse had progression of leukemia by day 28. The patient in marrow remission is disease-free 9 months after transplantation.

These receptors are composed of both alpha and beta chains. Expression of alpha chains and, therefore, expression of high-affinity receptors are critically regulated at the level of transcription initiation. We have further dissected the regulatory elements involved in controlling transcription of the IL-2 receptor alpha-chain (IL-2R alpha) gene. The IL-2R alpha promoter contains a kappa B site and binding sites for additional nuclear factors within a 50-base-pair region (positions -290 to -240 relative to the major transcription start site). These include one upstream of the kappa B site and one similar to the c-fos serum response element (SRE), which is downstream of the kappa B site. Mutation of the kappa B site decreases IL-2R alpha promoter activity in MT-2 cells (a T-cell line that has been transformed with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I), but not in Jurkat cells (a T-cell leukemia line) that have been activated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In contrast, mutation of a region upstream of the kappa B site decreases activity in PMA-induced Jurkat cells but increases activity in MT-2 cells. Mutation of the SRE-like site decreases activity in both cell types but the effect in PMA-induced Jurkat is more pronounced. Thus, these distinct cis-acting elements play different physiological roles in IL-2R alpha gene activation in MT-2 cells and PMA-induced Jurkat T cells. These studies provide direct evidence for a functionally significant SRE-like sequence in a gene other than c-fos and the actin genes and identify other elements that are critical for IL-2R alpha gene expression.","['Toledano, M B', 'Roman, D G', 'Halden, N F', 'Lin, B B', 'Leonard, W J']","['Toledano MB', 'Roman DG', 'Halden NF', 'Lin BB', 'Leonard WJ']","['Cell Biology and Metabolism Branch, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics/metabolism', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Macromolecular Substances', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutation', 'Nuclear Proteins/metabolism', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'T-Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.87.5.1830 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Mar;87(5):1830-4. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.5.1830.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Macromolecular Substances)', '0 (Nuclear Proteins)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)']",,,,,PMC53577,,,,,,,,,,,,

FEC were grown in media containing either Al citrate, transferrin-aluminum (Tf-Al), Tf or no additions. Al accumulation occurring only in cells grown in Tf-Al containing media was detected at 24 hours and increased linearly up to 96 hours after induction. By 96 hours, 200 +/- 36 micrograms Al/liter lysed cells were detected in Tf-Al grown cells versus 5 +/- 1 micrograms Al/liter lysed cells in cells grown in Al citrate (P less than 0.001). Tf-Al inhibited Hb synthesis at 72 hours after induction. At 96 hours 50 +/- 15% cells were benzidine positive when grown in Tf-Al compared to 76 +/- 15% in Al citrate (P less than 0.001). FEC grown in increasing concentrations of Tf-Al (100 to 500 micrograms/ml) showed inhibition of Hb synthesis at lower concentrations of Tf-Al at 100 micrograms/ml than for cell growth at 300 micrograms/ml. Higher concentrations of Tf-Al (greater than 300 micrograms/ml) did not further inhibit Hb synthesis or cell growth. Iron (Fe) and Tf uptake were increased in Al loaded FEC compared to control cells. The increased Tf uptake was probably the result of increased Tf receptor expression on FES since Tf cell cycling time was unchanged. These data indicate that Al utilizes the Tf uptake pathway for entry into erythrocyte precursors. Al is toxic at sites distal to Fe uptake, possibly at the heme and/or globin synthetic pathways, resulting in decreased Hb synthesis and cell growth.","['Abreo, K', 'Glass, J', 'Sella, M']","['Abreo K', 'Glass J', 'Sella M']","['Department of Medicine, Louisiana State University Medical Center, Shreveport.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Kidney Int,Kidney international,0323470,IM,"['Aluminum/pharmacokinetics/*pharmacology', 'Anemia, Macrocytic/chemically induced', 'Brain Diseases/chemically induced', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Hemoglobins/*biosynthesis', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Osteomalacia/chemically induced']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0085-2538(15)34795-5 [pii]', '10.1038/ki.1990.33 [doi]']",ppublish,Kidney Int. 1990 Feb;37(2):677-81. doi: 10.1038/ki.1990.33.,"['0 (Hemoglobins)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",['DK37866/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The relative stability of the complexes is determined by calculating the relative conformational energy of the cis-PtII(DAC)(DNA) complexes with molecular mechanics (MM) and the intrinsic binding or ligation energy with quantum mechanics (QM). The results suggest that the RR and SS isomers of PtII(DAC) adducts with DNA are more stable than the SR/RS isomer by 1.7 kcal/mol relative to the cis-PtII(DAC(H2O)2 aquated species. Calculations on the overall stability of these isomers show that the SS and RR isomers are 6.5-8.2 kcal/mol more stable than the SR/RS isomers when bound to DNA, and this is attributed to differences in the strain energy in the DAC rings. The theoretical analyses of these compounds correlate a small differential activity with the trend in intrinsic binding energies. The RR isomer is more active in B16 melanoma cells, and the SS is most active in L1210 leukemia, and in general the RR and SS isomers are more active than the SR and RS in most cell types. The fact that the activity is DNA dependent suggests that excision or repair mechanisms may be taking place and that additional mechanistic steps beyond molecular modeling and quantum mechanical calculations are required to fully understand the activity. These studies of molecular fit of cis-PtII(DAC) to DNA are used to suggest substituted DAC compounds that may yield similar binding characteristics. Modifications to yield DAC derivatives are recommended in anticipation that they may also exhibit activity.","['Miller, K J', 'McCarthy, S L', 'Krauss, M']","['Miller KJ', 'McCarthy SL', 'Krauss M']","['Department of Chemistry, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York 12180-3590.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/pharmacology', 'Cisplatin/analogs & derivatives/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA/*metabolism', 'Drug Design', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Stereoisomerism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Thermodynamics']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00165a025 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1990 Mar;33(3):1043-6. doi: 10.1021/jm00165a025.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Accordingly, 161 autopsies performed between 1970 and 1985 were reviewed and the diagnoses compared with those listed in the clinical records of the same patients. New diagnoses were grouped into diagnoses of diseases thought to have contributed to the death of the patient, those of diseases thought to have contributed to the morbidity of the patient, those of presumed toxic reactions to drug therapy, and diagnoses of academic interest. The newly diagnosed diseases thought to have contributed to the patient's death either had been totally unsuspected by the clinician or had been suspected but incorrectly diagnosed. The most common revelation was the identification of mycotic infections that were thought by the clinician to have been bacterial in origin. The clinical diagnosis of these kinds of infections progressively improved during the study period. Because the changes in diagnoses and therapy, particularly the increasing use of antimycotic therapy, could be directly attributed to autopsy findings and, more recently, because of the expanding use of more toxic multiagent chemotherapy, we believe that the postmortem examination remains an important procedure, even in clinical situations where much is known about the patient.","['Nigro, J F', 'Gresik, M V', 'Fernbach, D J']","['Nigro JF', 'Gresik MV', 'Fernbach DJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr,The Journal of pediatrics,0375410,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Asparaginase/adverse effects', '*Autopsy', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Evaluation Studies as Topic', 'Humans', 'Infections/diagnosis', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*pathology', 'Pancreatitis/chemically induced', 'Prednisone/adverse effects', 'Retrospective Studies']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3476(05)82819-7 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3476(05)82819-7 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr. 1990 Mar;116(3):350-4. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3476(05)82819-7.,"['EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)']",['CA-03161/32/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],['J Pediatr. 1990 Mar;116(3):394-5.

Thus, despite their putative ""B-cell precursor"" lineage, these leukemias manifest a remarkably high incidence of TCR gene rearrangements. While certain patterns predominate, there is considerable heterogeneity in Ig and TCR genotypes in this disease. No significant associations were found between Ig and TCR genotype and commonly used prognostic factors including age, sex, race, WBC, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, or cytogenetics. However, the lymphoblasts of three of six patients who failed to achieve initial remission had germline patterns of every Ig and TCR gene, a genotype not observed in the leukemic cells from any of the 64 patients who achieved complete remission (p2 = .0007). This study suggests that particular Ig and TCR genotypes may be of clinical relevance in childhood B-cell precursor ALL.

We investigated the production of plasminogen activator (PA) and PA inhibitor by the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. Similar to U937 monoblast-like cells and peripheral blood monocytes (PBM), THP-1 cells produce a PA that is specifically neutralized by anti-uPA antibody and comigrates with human high molecular mass uPA (54 kDa) on casein-plasminogen zymogaphy. PA activity could be dissociated from intact THP-1 cells by brief treatment with a weak acid-glycine buffer, indicating that the uPA is secreted and bound to receptors on the plasma membrane. Regulation of uPA proceeds normally in THP-1 cells, with cell-associated PA activity increasing from 77 +/- 20 to 163 +/- 26 and 325 +/- 30 mPU/10(6) cells in response to PMA and LPS, respectively; parallel increases in steady state levels of uPA mRNA were observed. In contrast to normal expression of uPA activity, functional PAI-2 could not be demonstrated in either the conditioned media or cell lysates of THP-1 under basal or stimulated conditions. Both U937 and PBM secrete low levels of PA inhibitor activity that increase substantially in response to stimulation with PMA and LPS. Immunoreactive PAI-2, measured by ELISA, was undetectable in THP-1 lysates or conditioned medium, but was consistently present in U937 and PBM, paralleling the presence of PA inhibitor activity. THP-1 cells express low levels of an abnormally sized mRNA for PAI-2 and demonstrate a regulatory defect whereby steady state levels of PAI-2 mRNA are markedly reduced upon stimulation with PMA or LPS. By contrast, U937 and PBM respond to identical stimulation with increases in PAI-2 mRNA. We conclude that THP-1 cells express a structurally abnormal species of PAI-2 mRNA, with complete loss of inhibitory activity as well as altered function of PMA- and LPS-responsive regulatory elements.","['Gross, T J', 'Sitrin, R G']","['Gross TJ', 'Sitrin RG']","['Department of Internal Medicine, University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor 48109-0360.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Immunol,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2985117R,IM,"['Blotting, Northern', 'Cross Reactions', 'Gene Expression/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*physiology', 'Plasminogen Inactivators/immunology/*metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator/*biosynthesis/genetics']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,J Immunol. 1990 Mar 1;144(5):1873-9.,"['0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Plasminogen Inactivators)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'EC 3.4.21.73 (Urokinase-Type Plasminogen Activator)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['K08-HL 01332/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01-HL39672/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The former product may be produced by alpha-oxidation of 13-hydroxy-6,9,11-octadecatrienoic acid followed by its decarboxylation. Detection of a 20-carbon metabolite, lacking a double bond at position 5, suggests that an intermediate of beta-oxidation was used as a substrate for chain elongation. When 13-hydroxy-6,9,11-octadecatrienoic acid was used as a substrate, it was indeed possible to detect 3,15-dihydroxy-8,11,13-eicosatrienoic acid as well as 15-hydroxy-8,11,13-eicosatrienoic acid. In addition, 13-hydroxy-6,9,11-octadecatrienoic acid was a precursor for the biosynthesis of both 14-hydroxy-7,10,12-nonadecatrien-1-al and 1,14-dihydroxy-7,10,12-nonadecatriene. These studies with MOLT-4 cells as well as with T-lymphocytes isolated from blood show that products of the 15-lipoxygenase pathway are metabolized with the accumulation of a variety of compounds. Since 15-HETE has been implicated as a modulator of T-cell function, these findings raise the possibility that the newly described metabolites may be involved in regulating lymphocyte function.","['Hadjiagapiou, C', 'Travers, J B', 'Fertel, R H', 'Sprecher, H']","['Hadjiagapiou C', 'Travers JB', 'Fertel RH', 'Sprecher H']","['Department of Physiological Chemistry, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Adult', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Diazomethane/pharmacology', 'Fatty Acids, Unsaturated/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Male', 'Mass Spectrometry', 'Oxidation-Reduction', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/03/15 00:00,1990/03/15 00:01,['1990/03/15 00:00'],"['1990/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)39574-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Mar 15;265(8):4369-73.,"['0 (Fatty Acids, Unsaturated)', '0 (Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids)', '60A625P70P (Diazomethane)', '73945-47-8 (15-hydroxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid)', '74784-20-6 (13-hydroxy-6,9,11-octadecatrienoic acid)']","['DK-18844/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'DK-20387/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For specific staining, a monoclonal antibody against platelet glycoprotein IIIa (Y2/51) was employed which is applicable on routinely fixed and paraffin embedded tissue. In comparison with control specimens from 15 patients, in CML morphometric analysis revealed an increase in the total amount of megakaryocytes per square and cubic millimeter marrow tissue, but particularly in patients with thrombocythemia. Moreover, a non-disorderly expansion of the megakaryocyte precursor pool was recognizable by showing a relative frequency of pro- and megakaryoblasts in congruence with the normal value. In this context a significant correlation between the counts for Y2/51-positive megakaryocytic elements and promegakaryoblasts with the corresponding platelet values was encountered. The more mature stages of megakaryopoiesis (pro- end megakaryocytes) disclosed a relevant shift to smaller cell forms with rounded cell perimeters and a more compact aspect of their nuclei.

Viability was measured using the 3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay, and DNA and membrane damage were assessed. Following a 1-h exposure to AM2, a dose of drug required to give 50% loss of cell viability (53 microM) was obtained in the dark, which was reduced to approximately 2.4 microM following illumination for 2 min (lambda greater than 475 nm), a dose of light that was completely nontoxic to the cells in the absence of drug. A shift in the cell viability curve was also observed for AM1 but, under identical conditions, the dose modification was only 8.9. In contrast, neither ametantrone nor mitoxantrone gave a decreased viability upon illumination. DNA single-strand breaks as measured by alkaline elution correlated with cell viability. Frank DNA single-strand breaks were produced by AM2 and light, suggesting the production of free radicals. The strand breaks produced by AM2 in the dark and by mitoxantrone (with or without illumination) were protein concealed. No evidence of photo-induced membrane damage, as determined by transport of the model amino acid cycloleucine, could be observed even at supralethal doses.","['Hartley, J A', 'Forrow, S M', 'Souhami, R L', 'Reszka, K', 'Lown, J W']","['Hartley JA', 'Forrow SM', 'Souhami RL', 'Reszka K', 'Lown JW']","['Department of Oncology, University College and Middlesex School of Medicine, London, United Kingdom.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*pharmacology', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/radiation effects', '*DNA Damage', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Light', 'Mitoxantrone/*analogs & derivatives/*pharmacology', 'Radiation-Sensitizing Agents/*pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*cytology/drug effects/radiation effects']",1990/03/15 00:00,1990/03/15 00:01,['1990/03/15 00:00'],"['1990/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Mar 15;50(6):1936-40.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Radiation-Sensitizing Agents)', 'BZ114NVM5P (Mitoxantrone)', 'PNT6041ST1 (ametantrone)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Permeation of the MOLT 4 cell membrane by ara-G occurred primarily by means of the NBMPR-sensitive nucleoside transport system. However, a residual transport component accounting for 10-20% of the total transport activity was demonstrated in the presence of NBMPR. This component was inhibited by adenine and hypoxanthine but not by dilazep, dipyridamole, or other nucleosides. In contrast, inhibitors of nucleoside transport readily reversed the cytotoxic effect of 7-deazaadenosine (tubercidin) in both MOLT 4 and CCRF CEM cells. The levels of tubercidin 5'-triphosphate formed from 2.0 microM tubercidin in MOLT 4 cells were reduced by 80% in the presence of 5.0 microM NBMPR.

The tetrazolyl analogues of MTX and AMT were more potent inhibitors of the growth of CCRF-CEM and K562 human leukemia cell lines during continuous (120 h) and 24-h pulse exposure than were the respective parent drugs; only when the exposure time was reduced to 6 h were the parent drugs more potent. These inhibitory effects on growth correlated with the onset of and recovery from inhibition of de novo thymidylate biosynthesis. Growth inhibition by the analogues was protectable by leucovorin. MTX-resistant CCRF-CEM sublines with decreased transport or increased dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) levels were cross-resistant to the analogues. The analogues were as potent as their parent drugs in inhibiting DHFR activity in vitro and at displacing [3H]MTX from intracellular DHFR. Each analogue was more effective than its parent drug at inhibiting uptake of [3H]MTX into CCRF-CEM cells. The tetrazole analogue of AMT was a linear competitive inhibitor (Kis = 50 microM) of CCRF-CEM folylpolyglutamate synthetase, while the tetrazole analogue of MTX, unlike all other inhibitors, was linear noncompetitive (Kis = 51 microM, Kii = 321 microM). The data suggest that, compared with MTX or AMT, the tetrazole substituent, in place of the gamma-carboxyl group, allows more efficient transport into cells via the reduced folate/MTX carrier and the resulting greater uptake of the analogues leads to inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell death at lower extracellular concentrations during long exposures. The mechanism of cell death could involve inhibition at folypolyglutamate synthetase, but DHFR is the primary target. The low potency of the analogues during short exposure is presumably related to the inability to form the poly-gamma-glutamyl metabolites required for intracellular retention.","['McGuire, J J', 'Russell, C A', 'Bolanowska, W E', 'Freitag, C M', 'Jones, C S', 'Kalman, T I']","['McGuire JJ', 'Russell CA', 'Bolanowska WE', 'Freitag CM', 'Jones CS', 'Kalman TI']","['Grace Cancer Drug Center, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Aminopterin/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cell Division/drug effects', '*Folic Acid Antagonists', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/pharmacology', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma', 'Rats', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/*drug effects', 'gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase/antagonists & inhibitors']",1990/03/15 00:00,1990/03/15 00:01,['1990/03/15 00:00'],"['1990/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Mar 15;50(6):1726-31.,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '127105-48-0 (gamma-tetrazole-methotrexate)', '127134-21-8 (gamma-tetrazole-aminopterin)', 'EC 3.4.19.9 (gamma-Glutamyl Hydrolase)', 'JYB41CTM2Q (Aminopterin)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']","['CA24538/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35212/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43500/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 50% effective doses of CPT-11 against KB and L1210 cells were 1100 and 5500 ng/ml, respectively. These values were markedly higher than those of camptothecin (CPT, 0.98 and 3.7 ng/ml) or 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38, 0.37 and 3.6 ng/ml). CPT-11 was found to be converted into SN-38 in mouse serum. In vitro incubation of CPT-11 in mouse serum or tissue homogenate enhanced the growth-inhibitory activity much more than that expected from the concentration of CPT-11. This enhancement of the activity coincided with that expected from the SN-38 concentration in incubated serum or homogenate, though the contribution of CPT-11 could not be refuted. SN-38 is considered to play a major role in the antitumor activity when CPT-11 is incubated in serum or homogenate. The plasma CPT-11 concentration decreased biexponentially after i.v. administration of CPT-11 into mice with a biological half-life of 0.8 to 1.1 h. The area under the plasma CPT-11 concentration-time curve showed dose dependency. The SN-38 concentration decreased for the first 30 min after administration and was then maintained for a few hours at about 0.1 microgram/ml after i.v. administration of 20 and 40 mg/kg of CPT-11 followed by the log-linear terminal phase with a half-life of about 2 h which was independent of the dose.

Concentrations for half-maximal growth of the resistant cells with folate (350 nM) and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (20 nM) were found to be higher by 2.7-fold and 20-fold, respectively, relative to the parent, suggesting that changes had occurred in the transport of these folate compounds. Transport measurements revealed that the resistant cells have lost the capacity to transport methotrexate and other folate compounds via the reduced-folate transport system but that a second previously undescribed transport system is present. Uptake of folate via this second route is energy dependent, exhibits saturation kinetics, can be inhibited by substrate analogues, and is activated by a reduction in pH. The pH effect is substantial since uptake at 5.0 microM folate can be increased 10-fold by decreasing the pH from 7.4 to 6.2. The observed Kt for half-maximal influx of folate at pH 6.8 was 5.2 microM, and the Vmax was 0.55 pmol/min/mg of protein. Ki values for methotrexate, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate were 10.2, 3.2, and 2.7 microM, respectively. Transport activity was not affected by depleting internal stores of folate by growth in folate-free medium, and this same transport system was also present in comparable amounts in wild-type cells. In the latter case, interfering uptake via the reduced-folate transport system was blocked by bromosulfophthalein and thiamine pyrophosphate. Methotrexate and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate were also transported via this alternative, pH-dependent route, whereas little or no uptake of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate could be detected. The results indicate that antifolate resistance in L1210/R81 cells was induced by inactivating the reduced-folate transport system and by utilizating a secondary route which has a low capacity for transporting methotrexate but whose activity is sufficient to permit cell growth in medium supplemented with folate or 5-formyltetrahydrofolate.","['Henderson, G B', 'Strauss, B P']","['Henderson GB', 'Strauss BP']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone/pharmacology', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Folic Acid/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid Antagonists/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism']",1990/03/15 00:00,1990/03/15 00:01,['1990/03/15 00:00'],"['1990/03/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Mar 15;50(6):1709-14.,"['0 (Folic Acid Antagonists)', '555-60-2 (Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['CA 23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One patient was treated with busulfan and cyclophosphamide and one was treated with busulfan and VP-16. Each patient was then transfused with autologous bone marrow that had been harvested previously and treated with two MoAbs, PM-81 and AML-2-23, and rabbit complement.

Median time for initial erythrocyte engraftment, assessed by a flow cytometric reticulocyte assay, was 13 days. Median overall and relapse-free survival of first CR patients was at least 17.4 months post-ABMT and the 2- and 3-year actuarial overall and relapse-free survival was 67% (+/- 19%). Median survival for the 24 patients in second or third CR was 6.8 months post-ABMT and 9.3 months since CR; however, six patients survived disease-free from 16 to 61 months post-ABMT.

Had cytogenetic techniques been used alone, seven cases would have been missed, compared with five if only flow cytometry had been used. For comparative purposes, the 27 cases were divided into three groups: near-haploid (n = 10), hypodiploid 30-40 (n = 9), and hypodiploid 41-44 (n = 8). Blast cells from patients with near-haploid ALL lacked structural chromosomal abnormalities; showed nonrandom retention of two copies of chromosomes 8, 10, 14, 18, 21, and the sex chromosomes; and had a second leukemic line with exactly twice the number of chromosomes or DNA content. Karyotypic analysis of the hypodiploid 30-40 and hypodiploid 41-44 groups disclosed structural abnormalities in the stemline or sideline of most of the well-banded cases; those in the latter group were similar to findings in cases with 45 chromosomes. As in the near-haploid group, chromosome 21 and the sex chromosomes were preferentially retained in the hypodiploid 30-40 and 41-44 cases. Except for a slight excess of female patients in the near-haploid group and an older age at diagnosis in the hypodiploid 30-40 cases, there were no initial clinical features that distinguished these patients from the general ALL population. Despite intensive treatment and short follow-up, 17 of the 27 patients have relapsed. This study suggests that the poor treatment responsiveness of hypodiploid ALL is not limited to the more than 80% of the patients who have 45 chromosomes per leukemic cell and demonstrates that cytogenetic and flow cytometric analyses are complementary in the evaluation of children with ALL.","['Pui, C H', 'Carroll, A J', 'Raimondi, S C', 'Land, V J', 'Crist, W M', 'Shuster, J J', 'Williams, D L', 'Pullen, D J', 'Borowitz, M J', 'Behm, F G']","['Pui CH', 'Carroll AJ', 'Raimondi SC', 'Land VJ', 'Crist WM', 'Shuster JJ', 'Williams DL', 'Pullen DJ', 'Borowitz MJ', 'Behm FG', 'et al.']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Aneuploidy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Haploidy', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Karyotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/diagnosis/*genetics/therapy', 'Survival Analysis']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84451-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Mar 1;75(5):1170-7.,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-31566/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Role of drug efflux and glutathione related enzymes.,723-8,"Energy-dependent drug efflux is a major factor in cellular resistance of P388/R84 mouse leukemic cells to anthracyclines such as doxorubicin (DOX), and blocking of efflux increases sensitivity. However, efflux does not play a significant role in resistance to N-trifluoroacetyladriamycin-14-valerate (AD 32), a DOX analog. Since drug efflux alone cannot account for resistance to anthracyclines, we have, in the present study, measured cellular glutathione (GSH) content and activity of GSH cycle related enzymes to determine their role in resistance. Cellular GSH content was similar in DOX-sensitive and -resistant mouse leukemic cells (P388 and P388/R84). GSH peroxidase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase activities were 1.36-, 1.58- and 1.14-fold higher in P388/R84 cells. Incubation of P388/R84 cells with 100 microM buthionine-S,R-sulfoximine (BSO) for 24 hr reduced cellular GSH content to 6% of control and reduced their resistance to DOX [dose modification factor (DMF) 3.9]. GSH depletion had no significant effect on the cytotoxicity of AD 32 (DMF 1.5). Exposure of P388/R84 cells to BSO (for GSH depletion) and trifluoperazine (for efflux blocking) further reduced their resistance to DOX (DMF 14). These results indicate that DOX resistance in P388/R84 cells is multifactorial and that changes in GSH cycle related enzymes such as GSH peroxidase may also contribute to their resistance.","['Nair, S', 'Singh, S V', 'Samy, T S', 'Krishan, A']","['Nair S', 'Singh SV', 'Samy TS', 'Krishan A']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, University of Miami School of Medicine, FL.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem Pharmacol,Biochemical pharmacology,0101032,IM,"['Animals', 'Antimetabolites', 'Biological Transport, Active', 'Buthionine Sulfoximine', 'Doxorubicin/*metabolism/therapeutic use', 'Drug Resistance', 'Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase/metabolism', 'Glutathione/*metabolism', 'Glutathione Peroxidase/metabolism', 'Glutathione Reductase/metabolism', 'Interphase/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/drug therapy/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Methionine Sulfoximine/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Trifluoperazine/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/02/15 00:00,1990/02/15 00:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']","['0006-2952(90)90151-A [pii]', '10.1016/0006-2952(90)90151-a [doi]']",ppublish,Biochem Pharmacol. 1990 Feb 15;39(4):723-8. doi: 10.1016/0006-2952(90)90151-a.,"['0 (Antimetabolites)', '1982-67-8 (Methionine Sulfoximine)', '214IZI85K3 (Trifluoperazine)', '5072-26-4 (Buthionine Sulfoximine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'EC 1.1.1.49 (Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase)', 'EC 1.11.1.9 (Glutathione Peroxidase)', 'EC 1.8.1.7 (Glutathione Reductase)', 'GAN16C9B8O (Glutathione)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the molecular mechanism of TPA actions, TPA-specific binding proteins in HL-60 were analyzed. Anion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography revealed that HL-60 cells possess TPA-specific binding proteins other than protein kinase C (PKC). One of these TPA-specific binding proteins exists in the cytosolic fraction of HL-60 cells, but translocates into the nuclear fraction of HL-60 cells after the treatment of the cells with TPA. The results suggest that HL-60 cells take up TPA into the nuclei via the TPA-specific binding protein.

Cancer mortality based on the recently revised doses (DS86).",120-41,"The present study, the ninth in a series that began in 1961, extends the time of surveillance 3 more years and covers the period 1950-1985. It is based on the recently revised doses, termed the DS86. The impact of the change from the T65D to the DS86 on the dose-response relationships for cancer mortality was described in the first of this series of reports. Here, the focus is on cancer mortality among the 76,000 A-bomb survivors within the LSS sample for whom DS86 doses have been estimated, with the emphasis on biological issues associated with radiation carcinogenesis. Briefly, the following is found: The excess in leukemia mortality has continued to decline with time, but remains slightly but significantly elevated in 1981-1985 in Hiroshima. For cancers other than leukemia, as a group, excess deaths continue to increase over time in direct proportion to the normal increase in natural cancer mortality with increasing age, and the relative risk seems unchanged over time within age ATB cohorts. The single exception is the cohort under 10 years of age ATB. Within this group of survivors, where the relative risk, although based on relatively few deaths, has been quite high at the higher doses, as judged by deaths before the age of 30, the risk has fallen and has remained fairly constant at a lower level thereafter. Thus the present analysis still supports, in the main, estimation of lifetime risk based on the assumption of a constant relative risk. For the same age ATD, both the relative and absolute risks are higher for younger age ATB cohorts than older ones for cancers other than leukemia. There is no statistically significant difference in excess deaths between males and females except for leukemia, though the relative risk is higher for females than for males, significantly so for cancers of the esophagus and lung, reflecting the higher background cancer rate for males. Significant dose responses are observed for leukemia, cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, lung, breast, ovary, and urinary bladder and multiple myeloma, as previously observed. No significant increase is demonstrable as yet for cancers of the rectum, gallbladder, pancreas, uterus, and prostate and malignant lymphoma. In the present report, cancers of the bone, pharynx, nose, and larynx, and skin except melanoma are also examined, but none of these sites show a significant increase with dose.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Shimizu, Y', 'Kato, H', 'Schull, W J']","['Shimizu Y', 'Kato H', 'Schull WJ']","['Department of Epidemiology, Radiation Effects Research Foundation, Hiroshima, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Radiat Res,Radiation research,0401245,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/*mortality', '*Nuclear Warfare', 'Population Surveillance', 'Sex Factors']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Radiat Res. 1990 Feb;121(2):120-41.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have molecularly cloned F-MuLV host cell DNA junction fragments from an erythroleukemia cell line induced by F-MuLV to identify cellular genes involved in the leukemogenic process. One particular proviral integration site, Fli-1, is rearranged in 75% (9/12) of independently isolated erythroleukemia cell lines derived from either BALB/c or NIH/Swiss mice inoculated at birth with F-MuLV. Other hematopoietic neoplasms induced by F-MuLV, including myeloid (granulocytic) and lymphoid tumors, did not show rearrangements of the Fli-1 locus. Similarly, none of 35 erythroleukemia cell lines induced by the Friend virus complexes (FV-A and FV-P) was rearranged at the Fli-1 locus. In contrast, no rearrangements were detected at the Sfpi-1 locus, a preferred site of integration in either FV-P- or FV-A-induced leukemias.

To determine the incidence, etiology, and outcome of children with cancer who had AMS, the medical records of all children under 18 years of age with systemic cancer (excluding primary central nervous system tumors) who had AMS in our institution during the years 1981 through 1987 were reviewed. AMS developed in 89 of 815 children at risk (11%). The AMS was caused by seizures in 53 (60%), an encephalopathy in 24 (27%), and a stroke syndrome in 12 (13%). AMS occurred in 42 of 305 (14%) with leukemia, 16 of 139 (12%) with lymphoma, 14 of 136 (10%) with sarcoma, 10 of 104 (9%) with neuroblastoma, and 7 of 104 (5%) with other malignancies. Children with acute lymphocytic leukemia were more prone to having seizures (61%), while children with nonacute lymphocytic leukemia were almost equally likely to have encephalopathies, strokes, or seizures. Children with lymphoma were admitted for treatment most often with an encephalopathy (44%). Etiologies for AMS were evaluated vigorously, and one or more etiologies were identified in 80 of 89 (89%) patients. Dependent on the type of tumor, the anticancer treatment used and, timing during the course of illness AMS occurred, specific diagnoses were more likely. Neurologic morbidity and mortality were dependent on the cause of AMS. Children with seizures that were initially difficult to control were more likely to require long-term anticonvulsant therapy.","['DiMario, F J Jr', 'Packer, R J']","['DiMario FJ Jr', 'Packer RJ']","[""Division of Neurology, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatrics,Pediatrics,0376422,IM,"['Acute Disease', 'Brain Diseases/etiology', 'Cerebrovascular Disorders/etiology', 'Child', 'Humans', 'Neoplasms/*complications', 'Neurocognitive Disorders/*etiology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications', 'Seizures/drug therapy/etiology']",1990/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pediatrics. 1990 Mar;85(3):353-60.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This element, termed the beta-globin direct-repeat element (beta DRE), consists of a directly repeated 10-base-pair sequence, 5'-AGGGCAG(G)AGC-3', that lies just upstream from the TATA box of the promoter. The beta DRE motif is highly conserved in all adult mammalian beta-globin promoter sequences known. Mutation of either single repeat alone caused less than a twofold decrease in transcript levels. However, simultaneous mutation of both repeated regions resulted in a ninefold decrease in accumulated transcripts when the gene was transiently transfected into MEL cells. Attachment of the beta DRE to a heterologous promoter had little effect on levels of accumulated transcripts initiated from the promoter in undifferentiated MEL cells but resulted in a threefold increase in transcript levels in induced (differentiated) MEL cells. Similarly, a comparison of the relative effects of mutations in the beta DRE in uninduced and induced MEL cells indicated that the element was more active in induced cells. The increase in beta DRE activity upon MEL cell differentiation and the more pronounced effects of mutations in both repeats of the beta DRE have implications for the mechanism of action of the element in regulating beta-globin transcription and for mutational studies of other repetitive or redundant transcription elements.","['Stuve, L L', 'Myers, R M']","['Stuve LL', 'Myers RM']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, University of California, San Francisco 94143-0444.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Mol Cell Biol,Molecular and cellular biology,8109087,IM,"['Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Differentiation', 'DNA Mutational Analysis', '*Gene Expression Regulation', 'Globins/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/mcb.10.3.972-981.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,Mol Cell Biol. 1990 Mar;10(3):972-81. doi: 10.1128/mcb.10.3.972-981.1990.,['9004-22-2 (Globins)'],,,,,PMC360947,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a murine thymocyte cell line defective in the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, the response of the HTLV-I LTR to cyclic AMP is abolished and the response to tax is substantially diminished. This report shows that a factor present in nuclear extracts of wild-type cells binds to the HTLV-I 21-nucleotide sequence and that this binding activity is missing from the extracts of protein kinase A-defective cells. Treatment of nuclear extracts of protein kinase A-defective cells with the bovine protein kinase A catalytic subunit restores the binding activity, whereas treatment of wild-type nuclear extracts with a protein phosphatase destroys the binding activity. The binding factor is referred to as protein kinase A-dependent factor (PKAF). These results indicate that in murine thymocytes the response of the HTLV-I LTR to cyclic AMP depends upon the binding of a phosphorylated protein to the 21-nucleotide repeat sequence and that the response to tax is partially dependent upon binding of the phosphorylated protein.

In contrast, the 14q- junctions from both patients were diversified by random loss and addition of nucleotides at the translocation site. This asymmetric pattern of junctional diversification is typical of normal Ig/TCR gene rearrangement, and therefore implies that the t(11;14)(p13;q11) translocation arose due to aberrant activity of the Ig/TCR recombinase.","['Cheng, J T', 'Yang, C Y', 'Hernandez, J', 'Embrey, J', 'Baer, R']","['Cheng JT', 'Yang CY', 'Hernandez J', 'Embrey J', 'Baer R']","['Department of Microbiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas 75235.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Adult', 'Base Sequence', 'Blotting, Southern', 'Child, Preschool', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', 'Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*genetics', 'Male', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.171.2.489 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1990 Feb 1;171(2):489-501. doi: 10.1084/jem.171.2.489.,,['CA-46593/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,PMC2187731,,,,,,,,,,,,

As reported previously by others, the inducible clone DS19 lost its ability to grow in soft agar and expressed hemoglobin as judged by benzidine/H2O2 staining after 96 hours of treatment with 1% DMSO or 4 mM HMBA. In addition, its EPM fell by 14%, its semiquinone reductase activity by 40%, and its mean diameter by 10%. The second clone, R1, retained its ability to grow in soft agar and lacked hemoglobin expression after treatment with HMBA and DMSO, characterizing it as noninducible. However, R1 did demonstrate alterations in EPM, semiquinone reductase activity, and cell diameter that closely paralleled those found in DS19. Such responses were not seen in three non-MEL cell lines exposed to HMBA or DMSO, suggesting that clone R1 responded to these inducing agents in a cell-line specific manner but that its ability to complete the sequences necessary for differentiation may be blocked at an unknown point distal to the block characteristic of untreated cells. The data show that while a reduction in EPM, semiquinone reductase activity, and cell diameter accompany induced differentiation in MEL cells, such changes can occur in the absence of a commitment to terminal differentiation.","['Gascoyne, P R', 'Becker, F F']","['Gascoyne PR', 'Becker FF']","['Department of Molecular Pathology, University of Texas M.

II: In vivo radioresponse following fractionated treatment and in vitro/in vivo correlations.,331-45,"Survival in the low-dose region of in vitro radiation survival curves for human tumor cell lines may be correlated with the expected clinical radiocurability of tumors of similar histopathological type. The present investigation examined this hypothesis using a series of transplantable murine solid tumors. The in vivo radioresponse of the tumors following fractionated dose (10 fractions of 2 Gy given at 4 hr intervals) and single dose (20 Gy) radiation treatment was measured by growth delay and tumor cell survival assays. The measurements of tumor cell survival were initiated either immediately or 8 hr after the end of radiation treatment. There was no evidence for repair of potentially lethal damage in vivo in any of the tumors. The measurements of in vivo response were compared to parameters of in vitro radiation survival curves for the same tumor cell lines, which were measured concurrently. The tumor cell survival following 10 fractions of 2 Gy correlated best with the measured in vitro survival at 2 Gy, although good correlations were also observed with two parameters calculated from the in vitro data; the value of alpha from fitting the linear-quadratic (LQ) model and the mean inactivation dose (MID). Correlations were also observed between specific growth delay measured in vivo following 10 fractions of 2 Gy and these in vitro parameters. Despite the correlations observed, the measured survival values following 10 fractions of 2 Gy in vivo did not agree quantitatively with the theoretical values predicted from the in vitro survival data assuming equal effect for each fraction. This discrepancy indicates that other factors also contribute to the overall response of a tumor to fractionated irradiation. Nevertheless, these findings support the idea that intrinsic radiosensitivity plays a significant role in determining the overall response of a tumor to fractionated irradiation and provides strong support for the concept of testing the in vitro radiation sensitivity of biopsy specimens as a predictive assay of clinical radiocurability.","['Bristow, R G', 'Hill, R P']","['Bristow RG', 'Hill RP']","['Physics Division, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/radiation effects', 'Female', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/radiotherapy', 'Male', 'Melanoma, Experimental/radiotherapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*radiotherapy', 'Radiation Tolerance', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/radiation effects']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(90)90098-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(90)90098-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1990 Feb;18(2):331-45. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(90)90098-5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Under these conditions, PBM from 11/23 of the CLL patients produced at least 10-fold less TNF as compared with controls. Monocyte numbers were decreased in percentage, while absolute numbers (normal range 233 +/- 120 X 10(3)/mm3) were decreased only in 2, normal in 17 and increased in 4 patients indicating that the deficiency is not a result of monocytopenia in most patients. Cell separation experiments indicate that after removal of leukemic B cells, percentages of monocytes return to control range and TNF production is improved (7/7). In mixing experiments, we found a suppression of TNF production in control mononuclear cells by CLL cell samples (75 X 10(6) cells/ml) in 5/19 cases, while control cells from thymus exhibited no or little suppression in these conditions. In 2-chamber experiments, leukemic samples suppress TNF production by normal monocytes across a 0.45 micron membrane indicating that a soluble factor is responsible for suppression.

In fact, 657 cases (47% of the estimated number), newly diagnosed during the 2 years January 1986 to December 1987, were registered from 191 general hospitals throughout Japan. Major results obtained from the present survey are as follows: (1) among all ATL cases registered, 51% were from Kyushu and 29% were from metropolitan areas (Kanto, Chubu and Kinki) and most, but not all, patients with ATL in the metropolitan areas had come from the ATL-endemic areas and settled in the metropolitan areas; (2) the estimated annual incidence rates of ATL per million adults were 40.4 in males and 26.4 in females in Kyushu, the overall risk of ATL being 1.5 times as high in males as in females; (3) the age-specific incidence rate in Kyushu increased steeply with age until the age of 70, and then decreased markedly in both sexes; (4) the ratio of T-cell versus non-T-cell lymphomas was 2.9 in Kyushu but 0.5 in other districts of Japan, however, this difference regressed to the average for the whole of Japan if ATL cases were excluded; (5) 26.5% of patients with ATL had a family history of cancer, and among these, 14 (8.2%) were ATL, 21 (12.2%) were lymphoma and 17 (9.9%) were hematopoietic malignancies, the incidence of which was markedly higher than in the general population; (6) with regard to clinicopathological features of ATL, there were more advanced cases in south Kyushu than in other districts, however, these differences were not statistically significant.

Approximately 2%-4% of fetal liver, fetal bone marrow, and adult bone marrow day-7 CFU-GM were resistant to 1.75 mg/ml G418, a dose toxic to cells not expressing the NeoR gene, after infection with the N2 retrovirus. In sharp contrast to the low rate of infectivity of both fetal and adult marrow samples, the mean +/- SD of G418-resistant CFU-GM was 11.7% +/- 14.1% and 14.0% +/- 18.1% for neonatal dog and cat marrow samples, respectively. The neomycin phosphotransferase enzyme activity was detected in G418-resistant CFU-GM, confirming that G418-resistant CFU-GM expressed the NeoR gene. The increased efficiency of retroviral vector-mediated gene transfer into neonatal hematopoietic progenitor cells was not due to an increased fraction of actively dividing cells, as determined by tritiated thymidine suicide. Understanding the basis for increased gene transfer into neonatal hematopoietic progenitor cells may be helpful in designing effective retroviral vectors/gene transfer protocols for gene therapy.","['al-Lebban, Z S', 'Henry, J M', 'Jones, J B', 'Eglitis, M A', 'Anderson, W F', 'Lothrop, C D Jr']","['al-Lebban ZS', 'Henry JM', 'Jones JB', 'Eglitis MA', 'Anderson WF', 'Lothrop CD Jr']","['Department of Environmental Practice, College of Veterinary Medicine University of Tennessee, Knoxville 37901-1071.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Animals', '*Animals, Newborn', '*Bone Marrow Cells', 'Cats', 'Cell Survival', 'Dogs', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Female', '*Gene Expression', '*Genetic Vectors', 'Granulocytes', '*Hematopoietic Stem Cells', 'Liver/cytology/embryology', 'Macrophages', 'Male', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/*genetics', 'Neomycin', '*Transfection']",1990/03/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 Mar;18(3):180-4.,['I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)'],['HL-15647-14/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Moreover, the results of irradiating mixed populations of leukemic and normal cells indicated that phototoxicity of leukemic cells was not affected by the presence of a large excess of normal BM cells, nor was the survival of normal BM cells influenced by the presence of leukemic cells.

A comparison of distribution patterns.,95-8,"In an effort to better understand the epidemiology of cancer in Zaire, a retrospective review of biopsy-proven malignant tumors was undertaken. Of 188 biopsies taken from children aged 0-15 years over a 4.5 year period, 73 (39%) revealed malignancy. Fifty-six percent of patients with malignant tumors were boys. Lymphoma was the most common tumor (28 patients, 15 with Burkitt's Lymphoma). Sarcoma (15 patients), carcinoma (8 patients), Wilms' Tumor (6 patients), and retinoblastoma (5 patients) were also seen. Lymphomas were most heavily represented in the first 5 years of life, while sarcoma and carcinoma accounted for most of the malignancies in children after 10 years of age. Lymphomas and sarcomas are relatively more common in Zaire than in North America and Europe, while leukemia and central nervous system tumors are notably less common in Zaire. In view of current limitations on health care in rural Zaire, cancer care should be directed toward early diagnosis, quick referral for appropriate surgical care, and use of the limited arsenal of chemotherapy.","['Fischer, P R', 'Ahuka, L O', 'Wood, P B', 'Lucas, S']","['Fischer PR', 'Ahuka LO', 'Wood PB', 'Lucas S']","['Department of Pediatrics, Evangelical Medical Center, Nyankunde, Zaire.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Clin Pediatr (Phila),Clinical pediatrics,0372606,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Age Factors', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Democratic Republic of the Congo/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Neoplasms/diagnosis/*epidemiology', 'Rural Population/statistics & numerical data', 'Sex Factors']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1177/000992289002900206 [doi]'],ppublish,Clin Pediatr (Phila). 1990 Feb;29(2):95-8. doi: 10.1177/000992289002900206.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To further examine this process, we have studied early events in the cellular uptake of 67GaTf. Cell surface-bound 67GaTf and 59FeTf displayed similar kinetics during the first 10 min of uptake. Thereafter, approximately 10% of intracellular 67Ga was released by cells while 59Fe internalization continued to increase with time. In pulse-chase studies of 125I-Tf-67Ga uptake, internalized 125I-Tf, but not 67Ga, was chased out of cells by nonradioactive Tf-Ga. Exposure of cells to monensin, a carboxylic ionophore, during initial uptake decreased the internalization of both 125I-Tf and 67Ga. Exposure to monensin at a later time, after cells had incorporated 125I-Tf-67Ga or 59FeTf, caused an increase in the release of 67Ga and 59Fe with a decrease in the release of 125I-Tf. Ammonium chloride inhibited the internalization of both 67Ga and 59Fe. 67GaTf uptake by HL60 cells involves initial internalization into an acidic receptosome. This is followed by dissociation of 67Ga and Tf and subsequent trafficking of each to separate intracellular compartments. Disruption of this process by monensin results in the release of 67Ga from cells.","['Chitambar, C R', 'Zivkovic-Gilgenbach, Z']","['Chitambar CR', 'Zivkovic-Gilgenbach Z']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Gallium Radioisotopes/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*metabolism', 'Monensin/*pharmacology', 'Receptors, Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Time Factors', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Mar 1;50(5):1484-7.,"['0 (Gallium Radioisotopes)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '906O0YJ6ZP (Monensin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",['R01 CA41740/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The present report shows that bromodeoxyuridine induces the early events leading to precommitment. In this course bromodeoxyuridine causes the rapid down regulation of the c-myc protooncogene. The course is similar to other common inducers of HL-60 differentiation including retinoic acid, dimethyl sulfoxide, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and sodium butyrate. HL-60 cells which were initially exponentially proliferating were exposed to 10 microM bromodeoxyuridine for 24 h, a period corresponding to one division cycle in these cells. When the cells were subsequently exposed to either retinoic acid or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, onset of G1/0 specific growth arrest and display of the differentiated phenotype occurred within 24 h. This is in contrast to the 48-h exposure needed for onset of terminal differentiation if either inducer is used singly during continuous exposure, as has been reported previously. Thus bromodeoxyuridine consummated the early events, including the rapid down regulation of c-myc message levels, which occur during the first division cycle of the induced cellular metabolic cascade leading to onset of terminal differentiation. The ability of bromodeoxyuridine to drive events in the metabolic cascade leading to onset of terminal differentiation was specific for early events, inasmuch as it was relatively ineffective at driving late events. Down regulation of c-myc was not in itself sufficient to result in subsequent terminal differentiation, since pulse exposure to bromodeoxyuridine followed by culture in inducer free medium resulted in little G1/0 specific growth arrest or phenotypic differentiation. Continuous exposure to bromodeoxyuridine, in contrast, resulted in significant G1/0 specific growth arrest but little phenotypic differentiation, indicating that the regulation of cell cycle transit and differentiation are separable.","['Yen, A', 'Forbes, M E']","['Yen A', 'Forbes ME']","['Department of Pathology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Bromodeoxyuridine/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/*drug effects', 'Cell Division/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', '*Down-Regulation', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/genetics/*pathology', '*Oncogenes', 'Tretinoin/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/03/01 00:00,1990/03/01 00:01,['1990/03/01 00:00'],"['1990/03/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/03/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/03/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Mar 1;50(5):1411-20.,"['5688UTC01R (Tretinoin)', 'G34N38R2N1 (Bromodeoxyuridine)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Concepts, trials, drugs, and biologics.",625-33,"The effective treatment of systemic cancer began in the 1950s on two fronts, i.e., childhood leukemia and choriocarcinoma. These two diseases were successfully treated as a direct result of the use of antifolate methotrexate. The demonstration of complete durable remissions in these diseases quickly led to development of other anticancer drugs, tested using the prospective clinical trials. In the 1960s as the number of active drugs increased, combination chemotherapy was introduced. Other systemic cancers, such as Hodgkin's, large cell lymphoma, and testicular cancer, became curable in the 1970s. For the common low-growth fraction solid tumors, the curability of systemic disease remained elusive until the introduction of adjuvant therapy to treat micrometastases. The past decade of the 1980s has seen improvement in the outcomes for breast cancer, osteosarcoma, and possible colon cancer utilizing adjunctive chemotherapy. The 1980s also saw the introduction of biologic therapies that have further improved the outcomes of several leukemias and produced consistent responses in patients with renal cell and melanoma. The 1990s will undoubtedly see more improvements as the effects of current drugs will be enhanced not only by improved integration of systemic and local therapies but also by utilizing cytokines and biologic response modifiers in concert with cytotoxics. Moreover, as we understand more about the process of cancer induction, promotion, and progression, more specific anti-cancer approaches will be developed to control cancer even before clinical cancer is diagnosed. Underlying and facilitating the improvement in cancer therapy have been not only the experimental results of many laboratory scientists but also the outcomes from many controlled clinical trials, the laboratory of clinical scientists.","['Carbone, P P']",['Carbone PP'],"['Department of Human Oncology and Medicine, University of Wisconsin Medical School, Madison.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/*therapeutic use', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Breast Neoplasms/therapy', 'Clinical Trials as Topic/*methods', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Medical Oncology/*methods/trends', 'Neoplasms/*therapy']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19900201)65:3+<625::aid-cncr2820651305>3.0.co;2-y [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Feb 1;65(3 Suppl):625-33. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900201)65:3+<625::aid-cncr2820651305>3.0.co;2-y.,['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)'],"['2-P30-CA14520/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', '5-U10-CA21115/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We further investigated the effects of LMW-BCGF on proliferation of leukemic clonogenic (progenitor) and nonclonogenic (progeny) cells from children with BCP-ALL (28 patients) and B-cell ALL (two patients). Patients were either at diagnosis (n = 18) or in relapse (n = 12). Response of leukemic progenitor cells was determined by culturing cells (10(5) cells/mL) in methylcellulose with 0.1 U/mL LMW-BCGF. Colonies (greater than 20 cells) were counted at day 7. The response of the leukemic progeny population was determined by DNA synthesis studies using tritiated-thymidine and by DNA quantitation with propidiumiodide for determination of cell-cycle status. LMW-BCGF supported growth of leukemic progenitor cells from 20 of 28 (71%) BCP-ALL and two of two B-cell ALL patients. Colony numbers ranged from 7 to 2,400 (mean 145, median 45). A dose-response effect in colony growth was noted, with an apparent plateau at approximately 2.0 U/mL LMW-BCGF. Colony cells were primarily of leukemic phenotype (CD19+/CD10+/-). LMW-BCGF also induced significant increases in leukemic progeny cell proliferation as measured by both thymidine incorporation (stimulation indexes of 1.6 to 34) and by cell-cycle assay (percentage S+ G2/M stimulation indexes of 1.6 to 6). LMW-BCGF was more effective in stimulating leukemic proliferation than three recombinant interleukins (rIL-2, rIL-3, rIL-4), although rIL-3 was able to support colony growth in 4 of 11 patients. These results indicate that LMW-BCGF and, to a lesser degree rIL-3, are able to stimulate proliferation of BCP-ALL progenitor and progeny cells, whereas rIL-2 and rIL-4 do not support progenitor cell proliferation and have only marginal effects on leukemic progeny cell proliferation.","['Findley, H W Jr', 'Zhou, M X', 'Davis, R', 'Abdul-Rahim, Y', 'Hnath, R', 'Ragab, A H']","['Findley HW Jr', 'Zhou MX', 'Davis R', 'Abdul-Rahim Y', 'Hnath R', 'Ragab AH']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Bone Marrow/drug effects', 'Bone Marrow Cells', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*blood/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Cycle/drug effects', 'Cell Transformation, Neoplastic/*drug effects', 'DNA/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-3/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Lymphokines/*pharmacology/physiology', 'Stem Cells/drug effects', 'Thymidine/metabolism']",1990/02/15 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85720-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Feb 15;75(4):951-7.,"['0 (Interleukin-2)', '0 (Interleukin-3)', '0 (Lymphokines)', '0 (low molecular weight-B cell growth factor)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)']",['CA20549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Radiolabeled interleukin-2 (IL-2) binding studies demonstrated that treatment with anti-CD3 MoAb resulted in upregulation of the number of p75 intermediate affinity IL-2 receptor sites per cell. Northern blot hybridization analysis showed expression of gamma-interferon gene transcripts 24 to 48 hours after activation.

We analyzed a panel of 15 T-ALL and 15 T-LL selected for their cell surface expression of the CD3 molecules. The results indicated that TcR gamma delta is more frequently used than TcR alpha beta in T-ALL (10 of the 15 patients tested). This is in contrast to the results obtained with T-LL where the vast majority expressed TcR alpha beta (13 of the 15 patients). These findings suggest that the leukemic cells could have a different origin in these two diseases. In addition, analysis of TcR variable regions expressed by the leukemic blasts showed that, in most cases, they had rearranged functional V delta 1 gene segments (8 of 11 patients), whereas in a unique case V delta 2 gene segment was used. Together, these results and those indicating that T-ALL cells coexpress the CD1a, b, and c molecules strengthen the possibility that although these leukemic cells express the CD3-TcR complex at their cell surface, their normal counterparts are not found in peripheral blood.","['Gouttefangeas, C', 'Bensussan, A', 'Boumsell, L']","['Gouttefangeas C', 'Bensussan A', 'Boumsell L']","['INSERM U93, Hopital Saint-Louis, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Antibodies, Monoclonal/immunology', 'Antigens, CD/*immunology/metabolism', 'Cell Membrane/ultrastructure', 'Humans', 'Immunohistochemistry', 'Leukemia/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*immunology', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/*immunology/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes']",1990/02/15 00:00,1990/02/15 00:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85717-6 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Feb 15;75(4):931-4.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A total of 23 patients completed 2 years of treatment and are evaluable for long-term follow-up at a median of 20 months postcompletion of therapy (range 9 to 32 months). Eleven patients (48%) have had progression of their disease at a median of 10 months (range .5 to 25 months) after treatment was discontinued. Statistical analysis of pretreatment patient characteristics did not reveal any factor(s) associated with a high probability of responding to rIFN-alpha 2a; however, analysis of post-treatment variables measured after 2 years of treatment suggested that a low platelet count was associated with a high rate of disease progression. These findings are compared with other published trials using rIFN-alpha 2b, a similar but not identical rIFN preparation. We conclude that while rIFN-alpha 2a has a high overall response incidence, the rate of disease progression after therapy is discontinued approaches 50%, and that a subset of patients can be identified who are at high risk for recurrence after completing 2 years of treatment.","['Berman, E', 'Heller, G', 'Kempin, S', 'Gee, T', 'Tran, L L', 'Clarkson, B']","['Berman E', 'Heller G', 'Kempin S', 'Gee T', 'Tran LL', 'Clarkson B']","['Department of Medicine, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10021.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Antibody Formation', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intramuscular', 'Interferon Type I/immunology/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Interferon alpha-2', 'Interferon-alpha/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*drug therapy/epidemiology/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'Recombinant Proteins']",1990/02/15 00:00,1990/02/15 00:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85705-X [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Feb 15;75(4):839-45.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interferon alpha-2)', '0 (Interferon-alpha)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)']",,"['Blood. 1990 Jun 15;75(12):2465-7.

Of 469 recipients of sibling donor allografts performed at our center between January, 1979 and October, 1987, 197 patients (42%) developed greater than or equal to grade II acute GVHD at a median of 38 days (range 9 to 98 days) post-BMT. After treatment with corticosteroids (n = 160) or other immunosuppressive therapies (n = 37), 72 patients (41% +/- 8%; 95% confidence interval [CI]) achieved complete and continuing resolution of acute GVHD after a median of 21 days of therapy. Sixty-one patients required additional immunosuppressive therapy with high dose methylprednisolone, antithymocyte globulin (ATG)/steroids, or other therapies because of refractory or progressive symptoms of acute GVHD. Seven of these 61 patients eventually obtained complete and continuing remission after 13 to 57 days (median 50) of secondary treatment. The overall rate of chronic GVHD was 70% +/- 16%; 95% CI following grade II to IV acute GVHD. Twenty-five of the 197 patients never developed chronic GVHD, resulting in a Kaplan-Meier projection of 30% +/- 8% (95% CI) cure of moderate/severe acute GVHD. Analysis of clinical features associated with complete response (CR) to acute GVHD therapy identified more favorable responses to therapy in patients without either liver or skin involvement, patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and donor/recipient pairs other than male patients with female donors. Older recipient age was not associated with more resistance to GVHD treatment. CR to GVHD treatment was associated with significantly better 5-year survival: 51% +/- 14% versus 32% +/- 11% for patients with therapy resistant acute GVHD (P = .004). GVHD was a major contributing cause of death in 49 of the 90 patients who died and was often complicated by infection or interstitial pneumonitis.

Implications for the growth of human cells in vitro.,587-91,"Following suggestions that transferrin present in fetal-bovine serum, a common supplement used in tissue-culture media, may not bind well to human cells, we have isolated the protein and investigated its interaction with both human and bovine cells. Bovine transferrin bound to a human cell line, K562, at 4 degrees C with a kd of 590 nM, whereas human transferrin bound with a kd of 3.57 nM, a 165-fold difference. With a bovine cell line, NBL4, bovine transferrin bound with the higher affinity, kd 9.09 nM, whereas human transferrin bound with a kd of 41.7 nM, only a 5-fold difference. These values were reflected in an 8.6-fold difference in the rate of iron delivery by the two proteins to human cells, whereas delivery to bovine cells was the same. Nevertheless, the bovine transferrin was taken up by the human cells by a specific receptor-mediated process. Human cells cultured in bovine diferric transferrin at 40 micrograms/ml, the concentration expected in the presence of 10% fetal-bovine serum, failed to thrive, whereas cells cultured in the presence of human transferrin proliferated normally. These results suggest that growth of human cells in bovine serum could give rise to a cellular iron deficiency, which may in turn lead to the selection of clones of cells adapted for survival with less iron. This has important consequences for the use of such cells as models, since they may have aberrant iron-dependent pathways and perhaps other unknown alterations in cell function.","['Young, S P', 'Garner, C']","['Young SP', 'Garner C']","['Department of Rheumatology, University of Birmingham, U.K.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Cattle', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', 'Chlorides', 'Ferric Compounds/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Iron Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Transferrin/*metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/metabolism']",1990/01/15 00:00,1990/01/15 00:01,['1990/01/15 00:00'],"['1990/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2650587 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1990 Jan 15;265(2):587-91. doi: 10.1042/bj2650587.,"['0 (Chlorides)', '0 (Ferric Compounds)', '0 (Iron Radioisotopes)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)', 'U38V3ZVV3V (ferric chloride)']",,,,,PMC1136924,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this report, we have demonstrated that harringtonine inhibited the growth of human myeloid leukemia cells in vitro at low concentrations. Together with the clinical data in which 28% of the patients could be induced into complete remission only by harringtonine, this agent may be used as a first choice of antileukemia agents in the treatment of myeloid leukemia. The mechanism of the antitumor action of harringtonine is considered to be an effect on protein synthesis and is characterized by breakdown of polysomes to monosomes. The mechanism of action appears to be different from those of the other antileukemia agents, such as cyclophosphamide, daunorubicin, vincristine, or cytosine arabinoside. Harringtonine could be added to the other anti-leukemia agents used routinely in treatment of leukemia, and the combination of harringtonine with the other agents is expected to improve the therapy of myeloid leukemia.","['Piao, Y F', 'Okabe, T', 'Zhang, L J']","['Piao YF', 'Okabe T', 'Zhang LJ']","['Third Dept. of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Japan,Gan To Kagaku Ryoho,Gan to kagaku ryoho.

Evidence for two distinct histological and immunophenotypical patterns.,101-12,"The medium-sized mononuclear cell with plasmacytoid features, formerly known as ""T-associated plasma cell"" or ""plasmacytoid T cell,"" has recently been shown to express several myelomonocyte and monocyte-macrophage associated antigens, suggesting a monocytic origin, and it has been renamed ""plasmacytoid monocyte."" The present study describes the clinical and pathological features of two patients with generalized lymphadenopathy and leukemia (chronic myelomonocytic leukemia in Case 1, and acute non-B, non-T lymphoblastic leukemia in Case 2), and whose lymph node biopsies showed large numbers of plasmacytoid monocytes associated with the leukemic infiltrates. Case 1 was strikingly similar to three previously reported cases of so-called ""plasmacytoid T cell"" lymphoma, all associated with a myeloproliferative disorder. In our case, the destructive growth pattern of the plasmacytoid monocytes and the de novo expression of CD5 on these cells favored their neoplastic nature; the sharing of some markers of plasmacytoid monocytes with the myelomonocytic infiltrate suggested they were part of the tumoral proliferation. In Case 2, plasmacytoid monocytes displayed an immunophenotype guide similar to that reported in reactive conditions and were antigenically unrelated to the leukemic cells; plasmacytoid monocyte clusters occurred also in the lymphoid parenchyma spared by the leukemic infiltrate. These findings led us to interpret the large numbers of plasmacytoid monocytes in this second case as a tumor-associated host reaction.","['Facchetti, F', 'De Wolf-Peeters, C', 'Kennes, C', 'Rossi, G', 'De Vos, R', 'van den Oord, J J', 'Desmet, V J']","['Facchetti F', 'De Wolf-Peeters C', 'Kennes C', 'Rossi G', 'De Vos R', 'van den Oord JJ', 'Desmet VJ']","['Department of Pathology, Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Surg Pathol,The American journal of surgical pathology,7707904,IM,"['Aged', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte/analysis', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/immunology/*pathology', 'Lymph Nodes/*pathology', 'Male', 'Monocytes/*pathology', 'Phenotype', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/immunology/*pathology']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00000478-199002000-00001 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Surg Pathol. 1990 Feb;14(2):101-12. doi: 10.1097/00000478-199002000-00001.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation, T-Lymphocyte)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The labeled protein was treated with Chelex-100 and gel filtration to ensure that 67Cu was tightly bound to the structure. 67CuCp bound specifically to the K-562 cells at 4 degrees C. The binding was linear with protein in the range of 200-800 nM and in the presence of 3% albumin. In this concentration range, 67CuCl2 showed no binding that could be interpreted as specific; 80-90% of the cell-bound 67Cu was removed by washing the cells with acid buffer. When binding was attempted at 37 degrees C, a significant fraction of the 67Cu resisted acid washing and with time accumulated in the cells. Fractionating the cytosolic components on Percoll gradients located the 67Cu in buoyant fractions of densities 1.030-1.05, with a peak at 1.035. Repeating the experiment with 125I-labeled ceruloplasmin failed to localize any 125I label in Percoll fractions; very little 125I was detected in the cytosol. Double-labeled 67Cu-125I-ceruloplasmin confirmed that copper and not the protein moiety of ceruloplasmin was taken up by the cells. The uptake reaction was inhibited by 1 mM bathocuproine sulfonate and by 1 mM sodium iproniazid. Ascorbate (100 microM) strongly stimulated uptake. These studies provide evidence that K-562 cells are able to extract copper atoms from ceruloplasmin and transport the copper to the cytosol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Percival, S S', 'Harris, E D']","['Percival SS', 'Harris ED']","['Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics, Texas A & M University, College Station 77843.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Am J Physiol,The American journal of physiology,0370511,IM,"['Biological Transport', 'Cell Fractionation', 'Cell Line', 'Centrifugation, Density Gradient', 'Ceruloplasmin/*metabolism', 'Copper/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Protein Binding', 'Subcellular Fractions/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1152/ajpcell.1990.258.1.C140 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Physiol. 1990 Jan;258(1 Pt 1):C140-6. doi: 10.1152/ajpcell.1990.258.1.C140.,"['789U1901C5 (Copper)', 'EC 1.16.3.1 (Ceruloplasmin)']",['DK-35940/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A double hybridization protocol was used to reveal the particular chromosomes as distinct spots or clusters of signals within interphase nuclei.

An increased risk of thrombosis has been reported in leukemic patients treated with this agent. We measured fibrinopeptide A (FPA) changes in 14 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia during induction remission treatment with a protocol including L-Asparaginase (10,000 U/m2/daily intravenous for 14 days). At diagnosis, 9/14 patients had FPA level above upper limit of normal range (mean = 4.1 ng/ml). After two days of therapy, FPA rose to 5.2 ng/ml and thereafter showed a slight increase throughout. Antithrombin III, protein C and fibrinogen dropped to its nadir on day 6 and 9. However, the ratio FPA/fibrinogen on a molar basis showed a three-fold increase during this days, demonstrating that the thrombin-dependent consumption of fibrinogen was also increased. In conclusion, our data show that activation of blood coagulation occurs in concomitance with the hemostatic derangement caused by L-Asparaginase. Replacement therapy with the recently available antithrombin III concentrates may be worthy of a clinical trial to test its effectiveness in preventing the thrombotic phenomena reported in these patients.","['Rodeghiero, F', 'Castaman, G', 'Dini, E']","['Rodeghiero F', 'Castaman G', 'Dini E']","['Department of Hematology, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Thromb Res,Thrombosis research,0326377,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Asparaginase/*therapeutic use', 'Biomarkers/blood', 'Blood Coagulation/physiology', 'Child', 'Female', 'Fibrinogen/*metabolism', 'Fibrinopeptide A/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/metabolism/physiopathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Thrombin/metabolism/physiology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0049-3848(90)90193-g [doi]'],ppublish,Thromb Res. 1990 Jan 1;57(1):31-8. doi: 10.1016/0049-3848(90)90193-g.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '25422-31-5 (Fibrinopeptide A)', '9001-32-5 (Fibrinogen)', 'EC 3.4.21.5 (Thrombin)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Transfection experiments showed growth stimulation of NIH 3T3 cells--growing beyond the saturation density and growing in soft agar. Since the pX sequence is known to encode three proteins, Tax, Rex, and p21x, the biological activity of each pX gene was examined separately. The growth-stimulating activity was induced only by the tax gene in NIH 3T3 cells and Rat-1 cells. Furthermore, the tax gene induced tumorigenicity in nude mice when introduced into Rat-1 cells. Thus, a transcriptional transactivator gene of HTLV-I, tax, is clearly identified as a viral oncogene without a cellular homolog. The transforming activity of tax, possibly via a transcriptional deregulation of cell growth control, may play an important role in leukemogenesis of ATL in addition to its aberrant stimulation of the interleukin 2 system.","['Tanaka, A', 'Takahashi, C', 'Yamaoka, S', 'Nosaka, T', 'Maki, M', 'Hatanaka, M']","['Tanaka A', 'Takahashi C', 'Yamaoka S', 'Nosaka T', 'Maki M', 'Hatanaka M']","['Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Division', 'Cell Line', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Genes, Viral', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/microbiology', 'Mice', 'Plasmids', 'Rats', 'Trans-Activators/*genetics', 'Transfection', 'Viral Structural Proteins/*genetics']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.87.3.1071 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Feb;87(3):1071-5. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.3.1071.,"['0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",,,,,PMC53412,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previously we characterized murine GF-1 as a 413-amino acid polypeptide containing two cysteine-cysteine regions reminiscent of zinc-finger DNA-binding domains. By cross-hybridization to the finger domain of murine GF-1 we have isolated cDNA encoding the human homolog. Peptide sequencing of purified human GF-1 confirmed the authenticity of the human cDNA. The predicted primary sequence of human GF-1 is highly similar to that of murine GF-1, particularly in the DNA-binding region. Although the DNA-binding domains of human, murine, and chicken proteins are remarkably conserved, the mammalian polypeptides are strikingly divergent from the avian counterpart in other regions, most likely those responsible for transcriptional activation. By hybridization to panels of human-rodent DNAs we have assigned the human GF-1 locus to Xp21-11. The localization of the gene to the X chromosome has important implications for hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin syndromes unlinked to the beta-globin cluster and for genetic experiments designed to test the role of the factor in erythroid cell gene expression.","['Zon, L I', 'Tsai, S F', 'Burgess, S', 'Matsudaira, P', 'Bruns, G A', 'Orkin, S H']","['Zon LI', 'Tsai SF', 'Burgess S', 'Matsudaira P', 'Bruns GA', 'Orkin SH']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, Children's Hospital, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Base Sequence', 'Cell Line', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Chromosome Mapping', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA, Neoplasm/genetics', 'DNA-Binding Proteins/*genetics/isolation & purification', 'Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors', 'Gene Library', '*Genes', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Peptide Mapping', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription Factors', '*X Chromosome']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.87.2.668 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Jan;87(2):668-72. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.2.668.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (DNA-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Erythroid-Specific DNA-Binding Factors)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Transcription Factors)']",,,,['GENBANK/M30601'],PMC53326,,,,,,,,,,,,

An intensive pretransplantation conditioning regimen and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with CD3-directed T-cell depletion and cyclosporine were employed. Durable engraftment was achieved in 50 of 53 patients who could be evaluated (94 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 83 to 98 percent). Acute GVHD of Grade II to IV developed in 46 percent of the patients (confidence interval, 27 to 66 percent). The incidence and severity of acute GVHD were increased in recipients of HLA-mismatched marrow as compared with recipients of phenotypically matched marrow (incidence of 53 percent [confidence interval, 37 to 68 percent] vs. 17 percent [confidence interval, 5 to 45 percent]; P less than 0.05). Extensive chronic GVHD and deaths not due to relapse also tended to be more frequent when HLA-mismatched marrow was used, but not significantly so. With a median follow-up of more than 19 months (range, greater than 9 to greater than 39), the actuarial disease-free survival of transplant recipients with leukemia and a relatively good prognosis (acute leukemia in first remission and chronic myelogenous leukemia in chronic phase) was 48 percent (confidence interval, 24 to 73 percent), and that of recipients with more aggressive leukemia was 32 percent (confidence interval, 18 to 51 percent); the actuarial survival of recipients with non-neoplastic disease was 63 percent (confidence interval, 31 to 86 percent). We conclude that marrow transplantation with closely HLA-matched unrelated donors can be effective treatment for neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. Although transplants from phenotypically HLA-matched unrelated donors appear to be most effective, transplants with limited HLA disparity can also be successful in some patients.","['Ash, R C', 'Casper, J T', 'Chitambar, C R', 'Hansen, R', 'Bunin, N', 'Truitt, R L', 'Lawton, C', 'Murray, K', 'Hunter, J', 'Baxter-Lowe, L A']","['Ash RC', 'Casper JT', 'Chitambar CR', 'Hansen R', 'Bunin N', 'Truitt RL', 'Lawton C', 'Murray K', 'Hunter J', 'Baxter-Lowe LA', 'et al.']","['Department of Medicine, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,N Engl J Med,The New England journal of medicine,0255562,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/*methods', 'Cause of Death', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Graft Rejection', 'Graft vs Host Disease/*prevention & control', 'HLA Antigens/*analysis', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia/mortality/surgery', 'Lymphocyte Depletion', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Prognosis', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Time Factors', 'Tissue Donors']",1990/02/22 00:00,1990/02/22 00:01,['1990/02/22 00:00'],"['1990/02/22 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/22 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/22 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1056/NEJM199002223220801 [doi]'],ppublish,N Engl J Med. 1990 Feb 22;322(8):485-94. doi: 10.1056/NEJM199002223220801.,"['0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",['HL-30573/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Williams, J. Yon, C. Huxley, and M. Fried, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:3527-3530, 1988) is the tightest gene clustering found in any mammalian genome to date and strongly suggests the possibility of cis-interaction and/or coregulation of gene expression. Thus, we are analyzing the surfeit genes in detail and are defining the extent of the cluster. Here we present the sequence of the entire Surf-4 gene and define the 3' and 5' extents of its mRNAs. The Surf-4 gene has heterogeneous transcriptional start sites, and its 5' end lies in a CpG-rich island. The gene specifies three mRNAs, with the two most abundant mRNAs differing in the locations of their 3' polyadenylation sites. Only the most abundant Surf-4 mRNA would overlap the 3' end of the Surf-2 gene by 133 bp. Two new genes (Surf-5 and Surf-6) have been identified in the surfeit gene cluster by Northern (RNA) blot analysis.

A comparison of naturally occurring Colchicum alkaloids with thio isosters, obtained by replacing the OMe group at C(10) with a SCH3 group, showed the thio ethers to be invariably more potent in these assays. The comparison included 3-demethylthiodemecolcine prepared from 3-demethylthiocolchicine by partial synthesis. Thiation of thiocolchicine with Lawesson's reagent afforded novel thiotropolones which exhibited high antitubulin activity. Their structures are fully secured by spectral data. Colchicine and several of its analogues show good antitumor effect in mice infected with P388 lymphocytic leukemia, and all of them show high affinity for tubulin and inhibit tubulin polymerization at low concentration.

This study demonstrates that for long-term use (greater than 100 days) ports are superior to externalized catheters in children with cancer.","['Mirro, J Jr', 'Rao, B N', 'Kumar, M', 'Rafferty, M', 'Hancock, M', 'Austin, B A', 'Fairclough, D', 'Lobe, T E']","['Mirro J Jr', 'Rao BN', 'Kumar M', 'Rafferty M', 'Hancock M', 'Austin BA', 'Fairclough D', 'Lobe TE']","[""Department of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38101.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pediatr Surg,Journal of pediatric surgery,0052631,IM,"['Bacterial Infections/etiology/prevention & control', 'Catheterization, Central Venous/*adverse effects', 'Catheters, Indwelling/*adverse effects', 'Central Nervous System Diseases/drug therapy', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/drug therapy', 'Lymphoma/drug therapy', 'Neoplasms/*drug therapy', 'Time Factors']",1990/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022346890000094 [pii]', '10.1016/s0022-3468(05)80176-9 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pediatr Surg. 1990 Jan;25(1):120-4. doi: 10.1016/s0022-3468(05)80176-9.,,"['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They were assigned at entry either to a control condition or an intervention condition designed to improve compliance. Compliance with medication was assessed objectively with serial serum drug and metabolite levels, as well as with self-report indices obtained on a monthly basis. Medical records were abstracted to obtain data on the number of appointments kept, treatment given, disease characteristics, and survival. On univariate analyses using the log-rank test, five variables were found to be significantly related to survival. These included compliance with allopurinol (probably acting as a surrogate for self-medication with other chemotherapeutic agents) (P = .007), control versus educational program cohort (P less than .001), disease severity (P = .009), Karnofsky at diagnosis (P = .011), sex (P = .084), and clinic appointments kept (P = .043). In hierarchical proportional hazards models, the following variables were associated with decreased risk of death: disease severity (P less than .025), keeping over 60% of appointments (P less than .05), allopurinol/oxipurinol compliance (P less than .01), and educational program cohort (P less than .05). After controlling for all other variables, three variables were associated with increased survival: high disease severity (relative risk [RR] = 2.48), high compliance with allopurinol (RR = .45), and educational program cohort (RR = .39). We conclude that compliance with oral medication has a significant effect on patient survival. In addition, the use of special educational and supportive programs designed to improve patient compliance are associated with significant prolongation of patient survival due to, as well as independent of their effects on compliance.","['Richardson, J L', 'Shelton, D R', 'Krailo, M', 'Levine, A M']","['Richardson JL', 'Shelton DR', 'Krailo M', 'Levine AM']","['Department of Preventive Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Southern California 90033.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Appointments and Schedules', 'Behavior Therapy', 'Cohort Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*drug therapy/mortality', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Patient Compliance', 'Patient Education as Topic', 'Proportional Hazards Models', 'Prospective Studies', 'Survival Rate']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.2.356 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Feb;8(2):356-64. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.2.356.,,['CA 31151/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of the 65 patients who entered complete remission, 42 were eligible for assessment of response to intensive chemotherapy consisting of four pairs of drugs administered in sequential fashion. Nineteen others with available histocompatibility locus antigen (HLA)-compatible donors were assigned to receive allogeneic bone marrow transplants within 16 weeks from their dates of complete remission. Durations of continuous complete remission (CCR) in the two groups were not significantly different at a median follow-up time of 6 years (P = .30 by log-rank analysis). Kaplan-Meier estimates of CCR probabilities (+/- SE) at 6 years were 43% +/- 13% (transplantation) and 31% +/- 7% (sequential chemotherapy). Postremission failures in the sequential chemotherapy group resulted from bone marrow relapse in 23 of 29 patients (79%), whereas in the transplantation group, failures were equally divided between marrow relapse and transplantation-related complications of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) or infection due to the immunosuppressive effects of ablative chemotherapy. Comparison of hematologic remission curves indicated a significant advantage for marrow transplantation in terms of systemic leukemia control (P = .06). Thus, in programs of intensive chemotherapy of the type described here, allogeneic marrow transplantation should be seriously considered as alternative therapy for patients in first remission who have an HLA-matched sibling donor, provided that effective methods for control of transplant-related complications are available.","['Dahl, G V', 'Kalwinsky, D K', 'Mirro, J Jr', 'Look, A T', 'Pui, C H', 'Murphy, S B', 'Mason, C', 'Ruggiero, M', 'Schell, M', 'Johnson, F L']","['Dahl GV', 'Kalwinsky DK', 'Mirro J Jr', 'Look AT', 'Pui CH', 'Murphy SB', 'Mason C', 'Ruggiero M', 'Schell M', 'Johnson FL', 'et al.']","[""Division of Hematology-Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/*therapeutic use', '*Bone Marrow Transplantation', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/surgery', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage', 'Probability', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1990/02/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.2.295 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Feb;8(2):295-303. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.2.295.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'VAPA protocol']","['CA-20180/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-21765/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Seventy-two patients developed fever associated with neutropenia; 15 developed systemic fungal infections. We reviewed multiple demographic and treatment characteristics of these patients in an attempt to identify potential risk factors for the development of invasive fungal disease (IFD). Risk factors identified in a univariate analysis included duration of neutropenia after first fever (P less than .0001), diagnosis of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) (P = .003), onset of fever and neutropenia within 5 days of starting induction chemotherapy (P = .009), and multiple (greater than one) surveillance culture sites positive for fungal organisms (P = .02). In a multiple logistic regression analysis, duration of neutropenia (P less than .001) remained a significant risk factor. The study group of patients had a significantly higher risk of fungal infections than a matched group of leukemia patients developing fever with neutropenia due to postremission consolidation chemotherapy (P = .003). In the first 48 patients, 14 (29%) developed IFD. In the subsequent patients (n = 24), intravenous miconazole (5 mg/kg every 8 hours) was begun at the time of the first fever. One of the 24 patients (4%) given miconazole developed IFD. The use of miconazole was a negative risk factor for the development of IFD in univariate (P = .01) and multivariate (P = .05) analysis. We conclude that pediatric leukemia patients who develop fever associated with neutropenia during induction chemotherapy are at high risk for developing IFD. The role of intravenous miconazole at the time of the first fever in this group deserves further study.","['Wiley, J M', 'Smith, N', 'Leventhal, B G', 'Graham, M L', 'Strauss, L C', 'Hurwitz, C A', 'Modlin, J', 'Mellits, D', 'Baumgardner, R', 'Corden, B J']","['Wiley JM', 'Smith N', 'Leventhal BG', 'Graham ML', 'Strauss LC', 'Hurwitz CA', 'Modlin J', 'Mellits D', 'Baumgardner R', 'Corden BJ', 'et al.']","['Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Agranulocytosis/*complications', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Fever/*complications', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/complications/*drug therapy', 'Miconazole/therapeutic use', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Mycoses/*etiology/prevention & control', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/*drug therapy', 'Regression Analysis', 'Remission Induction', 'Risk Factors']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.2.280 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Feb;8(2):280-6. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.2.280.,['7NNO0D7S5M (Miconazole)'],"['50RR-05378/RR/NCRR NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 06973/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA 09071-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Forty-one patients received LD ARA-C and 46 received intensive chemotherapy. The number of complete remissions (CRs) but also of early deaths was higher in the intensive chemotherapy group, while partial remissions (PRs) and failures were more frequent in the LD ARA-C group (P less than .001). Infectious complications during induction treatment were more numerous and more severe in the intensive chemotherapy group (P less than .01).

E., Simpson, R. U., and Taylor, J. M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 5570-5575). In this study, the mechanism and significance of vitamin D3-induced changes in protein kinase C levels were investigated. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) resulted in a 2-3-fold increase in phorbol dibutyrate binding at 24 h. This was accompanied by a 4.2-fold increase in steady state mRNA levels for the beta isoenzyme of protein kinase C and by a 3.8-fold increase in its transcriptional rate as determined from nuclear run-off studies. Protein kinase C alpha mRNA, which was approximately 15% of the beta isoenzyme levels, showed similar increases in mRNA and transcriptional rates in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3. Protein kinase C gamma mRNA was not detected. The increases in protein kinase C levels were accompanied by increases in activation of the enzyme by phorbol esters. More importantly, 1,25-(OH)2D3 caused a 1.5-2.0-fold increase in the endogenous phosphorylation of protein kinase C substrates independent of exogenous activators or endogenous formation of diacylglycerol. This is the first report of transcriptional activation of protein kinase C. This mechanism of up-regulation of protein kinase C may explain the increased activity of protein kinase C in vitamin D3-treated HL-60 cells, and may constitute an important mechanism for the long term modulation of the protein kinase C pathway of cell regulation independent of diacylglycerol generation.","['Obeid, L M', 'Okazaki, T', 'Karolak, L A', 'Hannun, Y A']","['Obeid LM', 'Okazaki T', 'Karolak LA', 'Hannun YA']","['Department of Medicine, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['*Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins', 'Calcitriol/*pharmacology', 'Carrier Proteins', 'Cell Line', 'Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic/*drug effects', 'Genes/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase C/*genetics', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Receptors, Drug/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transcription, Genetic/*drug effects', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology']",1990/02/05 00:00,1990/02/05 00:01,['1990/02/05 00:00'],"['1990/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)39986-7 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Feb 5;265(4):2370-4.,"['0 (Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Drug)', '0 (phorbol ester binding protein)', '0 (phorbol ester receptor)', '37558-16-0 (Phorbol 12,13-Dibutyrate)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['ES-00155/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To study the effects of long-term PE treatment on regulation of cellular PKC, we adapted the human leukemic T cell line, Jurkat (JK), to continuous growth in the presence of PE. Such cells (JKPE) displayed loss of CD2 and CD3 cell surface molecules, known to play an important role in agonist-stimulated T cell activation, unresponsiveness to stimuli that induce interleukin 2 (IL2) receptor expression or IL2 production, change in the expression of several cell cycle-regulated genes, and a 6-fold reduction in cellular PKC enzymatic activity. This reduction was accompanied by the disappearance of a major approximately 82-kDa immunoreactive protein in JKPE cytosol when cell extracts were immunoblotted with a polyclonal anti-PKC peptide antibody cross-reactive with the PKC isoenzymes, alpha, beta, and gamma. Analysis with additional anti-peptide antibodies specific for alpha, beta, or gamma PKC indicated that all three types of PKC are expressed in JK cells; however, JKPE cells lost a major approximately 82 kDa immunoreactive cytosolic protein detectable with anti-PKC alpha antibody. In contrast, levels of expression and subcellular distribution of immunoreactive PKC beta and PKC gamma, as well as levels of mRNA specific for the three PKC isoenzymes, were not significantly affected by chronic PE treatment. These results indicate that PE-mediated reduction of PKC in JKPE cells is selective and occurs at the protein, not mRNA, level, and support the notion that distinct isoenzymes encoded by the PKC multigene family may be independently regulated. Moreover, the correlation between phenotypic and functional changes on one hand, and the selective reduction of PKC alpha on the other, raises the possibility that expression of CD2 and/or CD3 and functional activation in JKPE cells are preferentially regulated by PKC alpha.","['Isakov, N', 'McMahon, P', 'Altman, A']","['Isakov N', 'McMahon P', 'Altman A']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Biol Chem,The Journal of biological chemistry,2985121R,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cattle', 'Cell Line', 'Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay', 'Flow Cytometry', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic', '*Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isoenzymes/*genetics/metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Peptide Fragments/chemical synthesis', '*Protein Biosynthesis', 'Protein Kinase C/*genetics/metabolism', 'T-Lymphocytes', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/*pharmacology', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/*enzymology']",1990/02/05 00:00,1990/02/05 00:01,['1990/02/05 00:00'],"['1990/02/05 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/05 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/05 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0021-9258(19)39944-2 [pii]'],ppublish,J Biol Chem. 1990 Feb 5;265(4):2091-7.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', '0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Peptide Fragments)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']","['AR35411/AR/NIAMS NIH HHS/United States', 'CA35299/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, no thermal tolerant plateau was observed in the hyperthermia survival curves of pre-pre-B-ALL/KM-3 B-cell ALL/NAMALWA or T-lineage ALL/MOLT-3 cells. The kinetics of development and decay of thermotolerance was studied for NALM-6 cells. Thermotolerance after a priming heat exposure to 42 degrees C for 30 min was maximum at 8 hr with a maximum thermotolerance ratio of 2.0, and it decayed by 24 hr. These findings extend previous studies on the thermal sensitivity of human leukemia cells and provide new information on the thermal sensitivity and thermotolerance of B-lineage ALL cells.","['Min, W S', 'Song, C W', 'Uckun, F M']","['Min WS', 'Song CW', 'Uckun FM']","['Department of Therapeutic Radiology-Radiation Oncology, Minnesota, Minneapolis 55455.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",7603616,IM,"['B-Lymphocytes', 'Humans', '*Hyperthermia, Induced', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*therapy', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0360-3016(90)90278-R [pii]', '10.1016/0360-3016(90)90278-r [doi]']",ppublish,Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1990 Jan;18(1):147-53. doi: 10.1016/0360-3016(90)90278-r.,,"['P01 CA 21737/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 42633/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'R01 CA 44114/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Receptor density analysis showed that CD46 was of moderately low abundance on PBLs with 7.5 x 10(3) molecules present on each cell. The two chains of CD46 were purified (144,000-fold) by immunoaffinity-chromatography with E4.3 mAb from the plasma membranes of a human spleen infiltrated with chronic myelogenous leukemia cells. Amino acid sequence analysis of the NH2-terminal of both alpha and beta chains yielded the same sequence; XEEPPQ/TFEAMELIGKPKPYYEIGE. Peptide mapping studies confirmed that both CD46 chains were closely related, except for one peptide fragment. This amino acid sequence is identical to that of the NH2-terminal of the recently cloned membrane co-factor protein (MCP), a membrane protein that binds the C3b and C4b fragments of complement and acts as a co-factor for I protein-mediated decay of the complement convertases. CD46 shares a cross-reactive epitope with some primate retroviruses, and this may indicate that some retroviruses mimic the mechanisms used by autologous human cells to evade complement-mediated immune clearance.","['Purcell, D F', 'Deacon, N J', 'Andrew, S M', 'McKenzie, I F']","['Purcell DF', 'Deacon NJ', 'Andrew SM', 'McKenzie IF']","['Department of Pathology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Victoria, Australia.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Immunogenetics,Immunogenetics,0420404,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Antigens, CD/analysis/*isolation & purification', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*analysis/isolation & purification', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Membrane Cofactor Protein', '*Membrane Glycoproteins', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Molecular Weight', 'Peptide Mapping', 'Spleen/analysis']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00702485 [doi]'],ppublish,Immunogenetics. 1990;31(1):21-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00702485.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (CD46 protein, human)', '0 (Membrane Cofactor Protein)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The lowest cholesterol levels were observed in the poorly differentiated FAB subtypes of acute myeloid leukaemia: AMyL(M1) and AMoL(M5a). The results showed that the initial hypocholesterolemia in acute myeloid leukemia is significantly related to the degree of both cytological and cytochemical maturation of leukemic blast cells at diagnosis. The degree of maturation at diagnosis has been shown to be related to prognosis in favour of more differentiated subtypes of acute myeloid leukemia. Also, hypocholesterolemia has been shown in several epidemiological studies to be related to an increased mortality from human cancer. Therefore, the degree of maturation may serve as a link between hypocholesterolemia and the increased mortality from human cancer.","['Zyada, L E', 'Hassan, H T', 'Rees, J K', 'Ragab, M H']","['Zyada LE', 'Hassan HT', 'Rees JK', 'Ragab MH']","['Department of Haematology, University of Alexandria, Egypt.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Hematol Oncol,Hematological oncology,8307268,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cholesterol/*blood', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*blood/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/hon.2900080109 [doi]'],ppublish,Hematol Oncol. 1990 Jan-Feb;8(1):65-9. doi: 10.1002/hon.2900080109.,['97C5T2UQ7J (Cholesterol)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Erythrocytes were sensitized with tetramolecular complexes consisting of rat anti-mouse IgG1 monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) that crosslink two different mouse McAbs. One of the McAbs was directed against glycophorin A, and the other was directed against marker glycoproteins of B cells and their precursors (CD9, CD10, CD19, or CD22). Immunorosettes were formed by addition of the sensitized erythrocytes to the cALL+ cells. After density-gradient separation of immunorosettes from mixtures of cALL+/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-positive (TdT+) leukemic blasts and mononuclear bone marrow cells, nearly a 2-log depletion of leukemic cells was measured by flow cytometry. Clonogenic assays with two cALL+B-cell lines (Ros-17 and Nalm-16) were performed to compare the efficacy of complement-mediated cell lysis, immunorosette depletion, and a combination of both procedures. Complement-mediated cytotoxicity with the three McAbs in combination with baby rabbit complement yielded a 1- to 2-log cell kill. Immunorosette depletion resulted in a 3-log reduction of clonogenic units. Sequential application of the two methods (immunorosette depletion with CD19 McAb followed by a complement lysis with CD9 and CD10 McAbs) led to superior results in causing a 4- to 5-log purging effect. These purging procedures did not cause a loss of normal myeloid (granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units, CFU-GM) or erythroid (erythroid burst-forming units, BFU-e) progenitors from the bone marrow.

Coadministration of Ara-C (20-50 microM) in conjunction with dCyd (50-100 microM) permitted the survival of an average of 9%-57% of day-7 CFU-GM and 32%-65% day-14 CFU-GM, depending upon the relative concentrations of dCyd and Ara-C. In contrast, exposure of leukemic myeloblasts to identical regimens resulted in considerably greater reductions in L-CFU survival, which in general exceeded 90% and in some cases was 100%. In addition, exposure of leukemic myeloblasts to Ara-C and dCyd for 96 h in culture medium lacking PHA-LCM eliminated the secondary plating efficiency (PE2) of leukemic colonies in 11 of 13 samples assayed and reduced values dramatically in the remaining 2. Substantial preservation of CFU-GM formation was also noted when normal bone marrow samples depleted of T cells and marrows obtained from two patients with ANLL in remission were assayed. These studies suggest that in contrast to certain normal committed myeloid progenitor cells, leukemic progenitors, particularly those with self-renewal capacity, are highly vulnerable to a prolonged exposure to Ara-C and dCyd in the absence of an exogenous source of colony-stimulating activity. They also raise the possibility that a combined regimen utilizing chemotherapeutic agents in conjunction with modifications of long-term culture techniques may represent a novel approach to the ex vivo purging of leukemic cells from bone marrow in conjunction with autologous bone marrow transplantation.","['Grant, S', 'Bhalla, K', 'Arlin, Z', 'Howe, C W']","['Grant S', 'Bhalla K', 'Arlin Z', 'Howe CW']","['Division of Hematology/Oncology, Medical College of Virginia, Richmond.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Culture Media', 'Cyclophosphamide/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Cytarabine/*pharmacology', 'Deoxycytidine/*pharmacology', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Neoplastic Stem Cells/*drug effects', 'Phytohemagglutinins/pharmacology', 'Suspensions', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 Jan;18(1):41-8.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Phytohemagglutinins)', '0 (Suspensions)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '0W860991D6 (Deoxycytidine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'U880A4FUDA (perfosfamide)']",['5:R01 CA35601-06/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In untreated ALL the median number of committed megakaryocyte progenitor cells (CFU-Mk) in the bone marrow was 2 (range less than 0.1-8) per 10(5) bone marrow cells instead of 30 (range 14-93) in controls, the impairment being dependent on the degree of leukemic bone marrow infiltration. However, if the number of CFU-Mk was related to residual nonleukemic bone marrow cells only, two-thirds of the children investigated had a frequency of CFU-Mk within the normal range. After 2 weeks of induction therapy the majority of the children had a low number of CFU-Mk in the bone marrow (median 6, range 0.5-40), a fact that could no longer be explained by a dilution of CFU-Mk by leukemic cells. After 4 weeks of chemotherapy (day 29) the frequency of CFU-Mk had risen to 18 (range 3-67) per 10(5) bone marrow cells, a value still significantly (p less than 0.01) below the normal range. In contrast to the changes in the number of CFU-Mk the median cell number per megakaryocyte colony remained constant during induction of remission. After cessation of long-term chemotherapy all children investigated had a normal number of CFU-Mk, suggesting that no permanent chemotherapy-related damage to committed megakaryocyte progenitor cells was induced.","['Hirt, A', 'Schmid, A M', 'Luethy, A R', 'Gugler, E', 'Wagner, H P']","['Hirt A', 'Schmid AM', 'Luethy AR', 'Gugler E', 'Wagner HP']","['Department of Pediatrics (Inselspital), University of Berne, Switzerland.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Netherlands,Exp Hematol,Experimental hematology,0402313,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', '*Hematopoiesis', 'Hematopoietic Stem Cells/physiology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Infant', 'Infant, Newborn', 'Megakaryocytes/*physiology', 'Platelet Count', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*blood/drug therapy', 'Remission Induction']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Exp Hematol. 1990 Jan;18(1):37-40.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper we present evidence that the MC 540-sensitized photoinactivation of leukemia cells is an oxygen-dependent process and that unsaturated plasma membrane lipids are substrates for singlet oxygen and/or other activated oxygen species generated by photoirradiated MC 540. A comparison of the inhibition of clonal growth, the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, and the exclusion of trypan blue by the plasma membrane after exposure to MC 540 and graded doses of light showed that mitochondrial respiration is compromised relatively early in the course of the dye-mediated photoinactivation of cells, well before the plasma membrane loses its capacity to exclude trypan blue.

Sensitivity or resistance to phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and biosynthesis.,31-8,"Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in K562 cells exists in two molecular forms. The major form, an amphiphilic dimer (G2a) which sediments at 5.3 S, and the minor form, an amphiphilic monomer (G1a) which sediments at 3.5 S. Extraction in the presence of the sulfhydryl alkylating agent N-ethylmaleimide was required to preserve the G2a form. In Triton X-100 extracts of the subline K562-243, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PtdIns-PLC) from Bacillus thuringiensis converted most of the G2a AChE into a hydrophilic dimer (G2h), indicating that the G2a form possessed a hydrophobic glycoinositol phospholipid that mediated its attachment to the membrane. Treatment of intact K562-243 cells with PtdIns-PLC released approximately 60% of the total AChE activity and provided an estimate of the externally exposed AChE. The direct conversion from an amphiphilic to a hydrophilic dimeric form by PtdIns-PLC was not obtained in extracts or intact cells of the subline K562-48. Instead, pretreatment with alkaline hydroxylamine was necessary to render the amphiphilic G2 form of this subline susceptible to digestion by the phospholipase. In this respect, the amphiphilic dimer of K562-48 AChE resembles the G2a form of human erythrocyte AChE, which is resistant to PtdIns-PLC because of the direct palmitoylation of an inositol hydroxyl group in the anchor [Roberts et al. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 18766-18775]. Release of this acyl chain by hydroxylamine renders the enzyme susceptible to PtdIns-PLC [Toutant et al. (1989) Eur. J. Biochem. 180, 503-508]. In both K562 sublines, sialidase decreased the migration of the G2a form but not of the G1a form of AChE. G1a forms thus appear to represent an intracellular pool of newly synthesized molecules residing in a compartment proximal to the trans-Golgi apparatus. The sialidase-resistant G1a molecules were also resistant to PtdIns-PLC digestion; possible explanations for this resistance are presented.","['Toutant, J P', 'Richards, M K', 'Krall, J A', 'Rosenberry, T L']","['Toutant JP', 'Richards MK', 'Krall JA', 'Rosenberry TL']","['Department of Pharmacology, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Eur J Biochem,European journal of biochemistry,0107600,IM,"['Acetylcholinesterase/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Cell Line', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes/biosynthesis/isolation & purification/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'Molecular Weight', 'Neuraminidase/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/enzymology', 'Type C Phospholipases/*metabolism']",1990/01/12 00:00,1990/01/12 00:01,['1990/01/12 00:00'],"['1990/01/12 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/12 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/12 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb15274.x [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Biochem. 1990 Jan 12;187(1):31-8. doi: 10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb15274.x.,"['0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 3.1.1.7 (Acetylcholinesterase)', 'EC 3.1.4.- (Type C Phospholipases)', 'EC 3.2.1.18 (Neuraminidase)']","['DK 38181/DK/NIDDK NIH HHS/United States', 'NS-16577/NS/NINDS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tac expression was induced by active phorbol esters (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate [TPA] and 4 beta-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate), which directly activate protein kinase C (PKC), as well as forskolin (FK), a stimulator of adenylate cyclase. A synergistic effect on Tac expression was obtained by simultaneous stimulation with optimal concentrations of phorbol esters and FK. Inactive phorbol esters (4 beta-phorbol, 4 alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate) and the inactive analog of FK (1,9-dideoxyforskolin) had no effect on Tac expression. The active phorbol esters synergized also with interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in Tac expression. Staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of PKC in vitro, inhibited Tac expression marginally in YT cells stimulated with FK, and enhanced Tac expression in cultures treated with TPA, TNF alpha, or IL-1. Based on the assumption that synergistic effects are observed when two agonists use different signaling pathways, these findings provide evidence that IL-1, TNF, and TPA use different pathways/regulatory elements to regulate Tac expression on the cell surface. Synergistic upregulation of Tac expression by simultaneous activation of distinct pathways may be an important mechanism to modulate the immune response.","['Scholz, W']",['Scholz W'],"['Immunetech Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, California 92121.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Adenylyl Cyclases/physiology', 'Alkaloids/pharmacology', 'Colforsin/pharmacology', 'Humans', 'Interleukin-1/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/immunology', 'Leukemia/immunology', 'Protein Kinase C/physiology', 'Receptors, Interleukin-2/*biosynthesis', '*Signal Transduction', 'Staurosporine', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/pharmacology']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(90)90084-5 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(90)90084-5 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1990 Feb;125(2):284-90. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(90)90084-5.,"['0 (Alkaloids)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Receptors, Interleukin-2)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)', '1F7A44V6OU (Colforsin)', 'EC 2.7.11.13 (Protein Kinase C)', 'EC 4.6.1.1 (Adenylyl Cyclases)', 'H88EPA0A3N (Staurosporine)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As observed with the free drug, a reduction in cell growth by the coupled drug correlated with a recruitment of differentiating cells. Treatment of sensitive cells with ADR-microspheres results in 40% of cells containing hemoglobins as determined by benzidine staining at 87% growth inhibition. Similar treatment of ADR-resistant cells produces 24% of benzidine-positive cells at 72% growth inhibition. Furthermore, free and coupled forms of ADR stimulate heme synthesis 12- and 20-fold. Hemoglobin analysis of ADR-polymer induced cells demonstrates additional embryonic (Gower-2, X, Portland) and fetal (F) types of hemoglobin in comparison to uninduced cells which synthesize only small amounts of Gower-1 in sensitive cells and Gower-1 plus hemoglobin X in resistant cells. In addition, free and bound forms of Adriamycin differ markedly in the relative proportion of hemoglobin types that they induce. Free and coupled forms of ADR produce an increase in the gamma-globin mRNA synthesis in sensitive K-562 cells.

Intact cells were treated with the reversible cross-linking agent cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) and the MNDA levels in the isolated protein-DNA complexes were determined. Less than 1% of the total intracellular level of MNDA was cross-linked to DNA in the noninduced proliferating HL-60 cells. Once the cells were induced to differentiate into monocytes, the amount of antigen cross-linked to the DNA increased to over 5% of the total intracellular level. The increased efficiency of cross-linking the MNDA to DNA was specific for monocyte-induced HL-60 differentiation, achieved with three inducers, and was not observed in association with granulocyte-induced differentiation. On a molar basis the phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) was the most effective inducer of monocyte differentiation, followed by 1,25-dihydroxy-16-ene-23-ynecholecalciferol which was more effective than 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol. A cesium chloride gradient analysis of the nucleic acid-protein fraction isolation from cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)-treated, monocyte-induced HL-60 cells documented the authenticity of the association between the MNDA and DNA. The results indicate that a significant level of chromatin reorganization may accompany monocyte-induced differentiation that leads to much higher levels of MNDA-DNA cross-linking to DNA. The expression of the MNDA is restricted to human myeloid cells and the present results indicate that a fraction of this low abundance nuclear protein is specifically located near the DNA [within cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) cross-linking distance] and that this association may be modulated specifically during monocyte differentiation.","['Gaczynski, M', 'Briggs, J A', 'Wedrychowski, A', 'Olinski, R', 'Uskokovic, M', 'Lian, J B', 'Stein, G S', 'Briggs, R C']","['Gaczynski M', 'Briggs JA', 'Wedrychowski A', 'Olinski R', 'Uskokovic M', 'Lian JB', 'Stein GS', 'Briggs RC']","['Department of Biochemistry, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee 37232.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic/*metabolism', 'Calcitriol/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Cisplatin/analysis/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/genetics/*metabolism/pathology', 'Monocytes/cytology/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate']",1990/02/15 00:00,1990/02/15 00:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Feb 15;50(4):1183-8.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', 'FXC9231JVH (Calcitriol)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']","['CA 37097/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'ES 00267/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, they are potent inhibitors of calmodulin and, therefore, might sensitize multidrug-resistant cells to chemotherapeutic agents. We compared the responsiveness of multidrug-resistant cells to the effect of dequalinium with that to trifluoperazine, a potent phenothiazine inhibitor of calmodulin. In addition, we studied the effect of these drugs on the responsiveness of multidrug-resistant cell lines to doxorubicin. The effect of drugs on P388 murine leukemic cells was determined by cell counting, [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA, or soft agar cloning. Drug accumulation was measured by fluorescence spectrophotometry. We found that multidrug-resistant lines were less sensitive than parental cell lines to the intrinsic growth inhibitory effects of dequalinium (IC50, 4.4 versus 0.3 microM in multidrug-resistant and sensitive P388 cells, respectively), whereas they were equally sensitive as the parental line to the effects of trifluoperazine. Following a 3-h exposure of P388/doxorubicin-resistant cells to 0-100 microM doxorubicin with or without either 10 microM dequalinium or 10 microM trifluoperazine, the latter increased the sensitivity to doxorubicin whereas the former had little effect (IC50 values were doxorubicin, 30 microM; doxorubicin plus dequalinium, 25 microM; doxorubicin plus trifluoperazine, 4 microM). Calmodulin prepared from resistant cells were equally sensitive to inhibition by dequalinium and trifluoperazine. P388/doxorubicin-resistant cells accumulated 4.5-fold less dequalinium than P388 cells whereas trifluoperazine was accumulated equally in both. The addition of 4 microM trifluoperazine to resistant cells exposed to 0-100 microM dequalinium completely reversed the alteration in accumulation and resistance to the dequalinium. These studies demonstrate that certain multidrug-resistant lines are cross-resistant to dequalinium and that sensitivity can be completely restored by nontoxic concentrations of trifluoperazine. The resistance appears to be due to changes in drug accumulation and not to be related to an altered sensitivity of calmodulin.","['Hait, W N', 'Pierson, N R']","['Hait WN', 'Pierson NR']","['Department of Medicine, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Calmodulin/antagonists & inhibitors', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects/metabolism', 'Dequalinium/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Doxorubicin/metabolism/pharmacology', 'Drug Resistance', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Phenotype', 'Quinolinium Compounds/*metabolism', 'Trifluoperazine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/metabolism']",1990/02/15 00:00,1990/02/15 00:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Feb 15;50(4):1165-9.,"['0 (Calmodulin)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Quinolinium Compounds)', '214IZI85K3 (Trifluoperazine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', 'E7QC7V26B8 (Dequalinium)']","['CA08341/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA43888/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The appearance of the metalloprotease in the culture medium directly correlates with the timing and extent of cell substrate adhesion over a 24-h period. Anti-Mr 94,000 metalloprotease blocking antibodies were unable to interfere with the HL-60 cell substrate adhesion induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, although they were able to specifically remove the Mr 94,000 gelatin-degrading activity from either HL-60 or U-937 cell-conditioned medium. A purified metalloprotease preparation was found to be predominantly latent and activated by organomercurials, acid treatment (pH 2 to 3.6), or 8 M urea. The activating effect of the latter two denaturing treatments suggests that conformational changes may be the common activating mechanism. The different treatments also caused the appearance of lower molecular weight gelatin-degrading bands (in gelatin zymogram gels) in a manner consistent with the autocatalytic cleavage that occurs with other collagnase proenzymes during activation. Edman degradation of a cyanogen bromide fragment from the Mr 94,000 metalloprotease provided the amino acid sequence [PR(C)GVPD] which is present in type I collagenase, stromelysin, and transin proenzyme sequences and partially conserved (V----N substitution) in the type IV collagenase proenzyme. This sequence has been reported to be important in the maintenance of the latent state of the transin proenzyme (R. Sanchez-Lopez et al., J. Biol. Chem., 263: 1892-11899, 1988) and is a sequence unique to collagenase proenzymes. The N-terminal sequence of the Mr 94,000 metalloprotease (AP-QDQST) is unique and distinct from other collagenases.

Analysis of the subcellular distribution of protein kinase C revealed that the activity of this kinase in the cytosol from HL-60R cells was 30% of that from parental HL-60 cells but that the enzyme activities in the membrane showed similar values in these cells. Treatment of HL-60 cells with 100 nM TPA for 30 min resulted in a 75% decrease in protein kinase C activity in the cytosol and a 300% increase in this activity in the membrane. A minor subcellular redistribution of the enzyme activity was found in HL-60R cells after TPA treatment.

Vincristine was encapsulated inside egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC)/cholesterol (55/45, mol/mol) and distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC)/cholesterol (55/45, mol/mol) vesicles utilizing transmembrane pH gradient (inside acidic) drug uptake processes. Trapping efficiencies approaching 100% were achieved for this procedure using drug:lipid ratios as high as 0.2:1 (w/w). Although both EPC/cholesterol and DSPC/cholesterol liposomal systems yielded high trapping efficiencies, DSPC/cholesterol vesicles exhibited superior drug retention properties. This ability to retain entrapped vincristine was related to maintenance of the transmembrane pH gradient as well as the membrane permeability properties. Thirty-day dose-response survival studies in mice indicated that vincristine encapsulated in DSPC/cholesterol liposomes was less toxic than free drug. The 50% lethal dose of 1.9 mg/kg in CD-1 mice observed for free vincristine increased to 4.8 mg/kg upon administration of the drug in liposomal form. Liposome encapsulation of vincristine also enhanced the antitumor activity against murine P388 and L1210 lymphocytic leukemia models. This resulted from increased efficacy for liposomal vincristine at doses equal to free drug (liposomal/free drug median survival times greater than 1.0) as well as the ability to administer increased doses of liposomal vincristine. The combined effects of decreased toxicity and increased antitumor efficacy of liposomal vincristine over free drug suggest significant clinical utility of appropriate liposomal vincristine systems.","['Mayer, L D', 'Bally, M B', 'Loughrey, H', 'Masin, D', 'Cullis, P R']","['Mayer LD', 'Bally MB', 'Loughrey H', 'Masin D', 'Cullis PR']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Hydrogen-Ion Concentration', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*drug therapy', 'Liposomes', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Solubility', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Survival Analysis', 'Vincristine/*administration & dosage/adverse effects']",1990/02/01 00:00,1990/02/01 00:01,['1990/02/01 00:00'],"['1990/02/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Feb 1;50(3):575-9.,"['0 (Liposomes)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The mean age was 30.8 years for 33 children and 115 adults, 80% of patients were under 50 years, and 66% were males. The sex ratio was unbalanced only in adults (p less than 0.05). Morphologic diagnosis was M2 in 92% of patients. Normal and abnormal mitoses were found in 45% of cases. Complex variant translocations involving 8q22, 21q22, and another chromosome had a frequency of 3.4%. In 75% of the cases additional chromosomal abnormalities were observed. Sex chromosome loss was found (73% of additional abnormalities) in 41% of females and 61% of males. Trisomy 8 was the other recurrent numerical abnormality (7.5%). Chromosome 9 was frequently involved in additional abnormalities (11%), mainly in deletions overlapping the region 9q21-22. Deletions or translocations of chromosome 7(q) were observed in 10% of the cases. The order of appearance did not follow a precise pattern. The remission rate was 90.7%. It was similar in males and females, children and adults. The median survival duration from diagnosis was 17.5 months, with a 24% probability of 5 year survival.

Clinical, pathologic, and immunologic features of 78 cases.",971-98,"The clinical, pathologic, and immunologic features of 78 cases of peripheral/post-thymic T-cell lymphomas are described. These neoplasms were extremely heterogeneous and were classified as small lymphocytic, mixed small and large cell, large cell, lymphoepithelioid cell, angiocentric, and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma type. Some cases revealed angioimmunoblastic or Hodgkin's-like features. These neoplasms mainly affected older adults (mean age, 57 years; median age, 60 years). Lymphadenopathy represented the most frequent clinical presentation, although most patients demonstrated both nodal (87%) and extranodal involvement (77%) during the course of disease. Sites of extranodal disease included skin/soft tissue, spleen, lung, liver, bone, gastrointestinal tract, central nervous system, peripheral blood, nasopharynx, and retrovaginal tissue. Splenomegaly at presentation was most frequently observed in lymphoepithelioid cell lymphomas. Angiocentric lymphomas involved lung. A mediastinal presentation was typically observed in young adults and associated with a poor prognosis. Patients with gastrointestinal lymphomas presented with bleeding and/or malabsorption. B symptoms were present in most cases (65%). Hypercalcemia occurred in four patients. Phenotypic studies of T-cell antigens demonstrated the loss of one or more pan-T-cell markers in eight of 47 cases evaluated. Assessment of T-cell subsets revealed a helper/inducer phenotype for nearly all immunoreactive cases. For the overall series, 32 patients died of disease (median survival time, 11.5 mo). There was a statistical difference between the combined groups of small lymphocytic and lymphoepithelioid cell types as compared with mixed and large cell types, with a poorer survival for the latter group. Angiocentric and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma were associated with poor survival. This series of T-cell lymphomas further documents the marked heterogeneity of this group of neoplasms as well as the poor prognosis observed for certain histologic types.","['Pinkus, G S', ""O'Hara, C J"", 'Said, J W']","['Pinkus GS', ""O'Hara CJ"", 'Said JW']","[""Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, Massachusetts 02115.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer,Cancer,0374236,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Lymphoma/classification/complications/immunology/mortality/*pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Phenotype', 'Prognosis', 'Retrospective Studies', '*T-Lymphocytes']",1990/02/15 00:00,1990/02/15 00:01,['1990/02/15 00:00'],"['1990/02/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/02/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/02/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/1097-0142(19900215)65:4<971::aid-cncr2820650425>3.0.co;2-b [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer. 1990 Feb 15;65(4):971-98. doi: 10.1002/1097-0142(19900215)65:4<971::aid-cncr2820650425>3.0.co;2-b.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The total amount of antibody of either IgG1 or IgG2 isotype that would adhere to microbeads linked with either type of antibody, as revealed by secondary binding with 125I rabbit antimouse Ig, was identical, suggesting that similar numbers of antibody binding sites were available. In cell depletion studies, it was found that if IgG1 isotype monoclonal antibodies were employed as binding intermediaries between the target cells and the microbeads, the efficiency of target cell depletion was superior with the anti-mouse-IgG1(Fc)-coated beads, even if the amount of MoAb coating the target cells was suboptimal.

The most potent inhibitor was prostaglandin A1, which reduced efflux by 50% at a concentration of 0.10 microM. Half-maximal inhibition by vincristine occurred at 4.8 microM. The maximum extent of inhibition with most of the inhibitors was 95%, although a lower value was observed with bromosulfophthalein (85%). When cholate efflux was compared with the efflux of methotrexate, both processes responded similarly to changes in the metabolic state of the cell. Moreover, the various inhibitors of cholate efflux also inhibited the efflux of methotrexate and the same concentration of each inhibitor was required for half-maximal inhibition of both processes. The efflux of folate and urate also proceeded via outwardly directed, unidirectional processes which were sensitive to bromosulfophthalein and probenecid. The results suggest that L1210 cells have the capacity for the unidirectional extrusion of cholate, methotrexate and probably other large, structurally dissimilar organic anions and that this efflux occurs via two or more very similar transport systems with a broad anion specificity. The function of an organic anion efflux system in vivo may be to facilitate the extrusion of cytotoxic metabolic anions which are too large to exit via the general anion-exchange carrier of these cells. Similarities in inhibitor specificity were also apparent between unidirectional anion efflux in L1210 cells and the drug efflux pump which is over-produced in cells with multidrug resistance.","['Henderson, G B', 'Tsuji, J M']","['Henderson GB', 'Tsuji JM']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation, La Jolla, CA 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Biological Transport', 'Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone/pharmacology', 'Cholic Acids/antagonists & inhibitors/*metabolism', 'Cytochalasin B/pharmacology', 'Folic Acid/metabolism', 'Glucose/pharmacology', 'Leukemia L1210/*metabolism', 'Methotrexate/antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Probenecid/pharmacology', 'Substrate Specificity', 'Sulfobromophthalein/pharmacology', 'Temperature', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism', 'Uric Acid/metabolism', 'Vincristine/pharmacology']",1990/01/23 00:00,1990/01/23 00:01,['1990/01/23 00:00'],"['1990/01/23 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/23 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/23 00:00 [entrez]']","['0167-4889(90)90174-C [pii]', '10.1016/0167-4889(90)90174-c [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Jan 23;1051(1):60-70. doi: 10.1016/0167-4889(90)90174-c.,"['0 (Cholic Acids)', '0C2P5QKL36 (Sulfobromophthalein)', '268B43MJ25 (Uric Acid)', '3CHI920QS7 (Cytochalasin B)', '555-60-2 (Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '935E97BOY8 (Folic Acid)', 'IY9XDZ35W2 (Glucose)', 'PO572Z7917 (Probenecid)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['CA23970/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was used to map the protein profiles of the various cell lines. The resistant lines were obtained by intermittent exposure of the KBM-3 cells to the highest tolerated concentration of m-AMSA so that the culture would be repopulated only by the most resistant subpopulation after each exposure. Two distinct phases were apparent during the development of resistance. During the first 14 months of intermittent exposure to maximally tolerated concentrations of m-AMSA, the cells developed low-degree m-AMSA resistance (5-7-fold as compared with the parent line, as measured by cell survival). This low-degree resistance was characterised by a somewhat suppressed level of DNA strand breakage and no measurable change in cellular protein levels. Subsequently, a single escalation of the m-AMSA retreatment concentration resulted in a cell population that was approximately 100-fold resistant, as assessed by cloning. This rapid phenotypic change temporally coincided with the acquisition of an almost complete refractoriness to m-AMSA-induced DNA strand breakage and the loss of a cellular 76 kDa protein. We suggest that the loss of this protein is important for the development of a highly m-AMSA resistant phenotype.","['Skinner, W L', 'Murray, D', 'Kohli, V', 'Beran, M', 'McCredie, K B', 'Freireich, E J', 'Andersson, B S']","['Skinner WL', 'Murray D', 'Kohli V', 'Beran M', 'McCredie KB', 'Freireich EJ', 'Andersson BS']","['Department of Hematology, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston 77030.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Amsacrine/*therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'DNA Damage', 'DNA, Neoplasm/drug effects', 'Drug Resistance', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*drug therapy/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/analysis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1990.11 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1990 Jan;61(1):51-5. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1990.11.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '00DPD30SOY (Amsacrine)']","['CA-28153/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA-39809/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC1971335,,,,,,,,,,,,

With standard response surface modelling methods, finding the optimum combination with as few as 10 variables entails testing over 1,000 combinations, so these methods do not provide a feasible approach to such problems. However, they may be tackled by direct search methods (DSM), i.e. stepwise searches of the response surface. Experiments were carried out in advanced L1210 leukaemia treated with combinations of adriamycin with cyclophosphamide, isophosphamide with acetylcysteine and methotrexate with leucovorin. Two established DSM (Nelder-Mead and Box) were used, and a new method was designed to find consistent search paths in spite of wide biological variation. With methotrexate and leucovorin, DSM located combinations prolonging mean survival to 40-50 days (compared with 10.4 in controls) and giving high proportions of long-term survivors. These results were achieved with single injections of drugs given 7 days after injection of 10(6) leukaemic cells, i.e. 2-3 days before deaths began in untreated mice, and appear to be unprecedented with these agents. Searching for optimal combinations of established agents may be at least as rewarding as searching for new agents, and thus DSM may prove a powerful tool for improving the results of combination cancer chemotherapy.","['Berenbaum, M C']",['Berenbaum MC'],"[""Department of Experimental Pathology, St Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, UK.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Br J Cancer,British journal of cancer,0370635,IM,"['Acetylcysteine/administration & dosage', 'Animals', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Drug Evaluation/methods', 'Female', 'Ifosfamide/administration & dosage', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy/mortality', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mice', 'Time Factors']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1038/bjc.1990.22 [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Cancer. 1990 Jan;61(1):101-9. doi: 10.1038/bjc.1990.22.,"['80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'UM20QQM95Y (Ifosfamide)', 'WYQ7N0BPYC (Acetylcysteine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,PMC1971319,,,['Br J Cancer 1990 May;61(5):788'],,,,,,,,,

Fluorescence microscopy demonstrates that Ditercalinium and the mitochondrial-staining fluorophore DiOC2(5) are concentrated in the same cellular organelles of L1210 cells. Electron microscopy of Ditercalinium-treated cells reveals extensive and progressive swelling of mitochondria, with no other ultrastructural changes observed. Ditercalinium uptake and toxicity are in part related to mitochondrial membrane potential. However, drug accumulation itself does not immediately alter the mitochondrial membrane potential. Cellular ATP pool levels and the rate of respiration fall progressively after drug treatment. Nucleotide pools in DC3F cells, measured between drug treatment and death, show marked drops in pyrimidine levels while purine nucleotide levels decline more slowly. Addition of uridine or cytidine partially rescues Ditercalinium-treated cells, while toxicity is increased in the presence of 2-deoxyglucose.

Basic amino acid (lysine and ornithine) polymers were employed as carriers for increasing the uptake of folate analogs by human leukemia cell lines.

The growth inhibitory effects of the polymers or MTX-conjugates were not reversed by simultaneous inclusion of leucovorin, while those of MTX were reversed. In contrast, the nonlymphocytic K562 line showed toxicity by the MTX-conjugates at nontoxic levels of the polymers during continuous, but not pulse, exposures. During continuous exposure the conjugates were only 10-fold less toxic than unconjugated MTX. Toxicities of the MTX-conjugates for the K562 line under continuous exposure conditions were reversed by the simultaneous presence of leucovorin or the lysosomotropic agent leupeptin and thus appeared to be a true antifolate effect which required uptake and lysosomal degradation.

Two types of reactions were used: a single step amplification with 5' and 3' primers, and a double step PCR in which products of the first amplification were reamplified using nested primers. The latter procedure was highly sensitive and capable of detecting one abnormal cell in 10(7) cells. At the time of PCR analysis, all 14 patients were in hematological remission, and 13 were in cytogenetic remission. PCR analysis revealed rearranged bcr-abl mRNA in five patients. The interval from transplant in those five patients ranged from 3 to 63 months. Two of the five positive patients were reexamined after 3 months and were found negative by double step PCR. Our findings suggest that after non-T cell depleted BMT the eradication of the leukemic clone probably occurs in some patients. Other patients, however, proved to have a small number of abnormal cells even at long intervals after BMT, although these cells could only be detected transiently in some patients.

Previously, it had been shown that the temperature-sensitive defect resided in the env gene. At the restrictive temperature, the envelope precursor polyprotein, gPr80env, is inefficiently processed intracellularly into two cleavage products, gp70 and Prp15E. This inefficient processing of gPr80env is correlated with neurovirulence. In this study, it was shown that a single amino acid substitution, Val-25----Ile in gPr80env, is responsible for the temperature sensitivity, inefficient processing of gPr80env at the restrictive temperature, and neurovirulence of ts1. At the restrictive temperature, a steady-state level of nonprocessed, endoglycosidase H-sensitive gPr80env remained in the endoplasmic reticulum of cells infected by ts1, but no endoglycosidase H-resistant gPr80env and only trace amounts of gp70 were detected in the infected cells. Since the host cell-encoded processing protease resides in the cis cisternae of the Golgi apparatus, inefficient processing of gPr80env at the restrictive temperature is most likely due to inefficient transport of gPr80env from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cis cisternae of the Golgi apparatus rather than due to misfolded gPr80env being a poor substrate for the processing protease at the restrictive temperature.","['Szurek, P F', 'Yuen, P H', 'Ball, J K', 'Wong, P K']","['Szurek PF', 'Yuen PH', 'Ball JK', 'Wong PK']","['University of Texas M.

We now show that monoalkylation by C-10 (carbamate group) can occur for mitosene analogues that have no reactive C-1 functionality. Sodium dithionite reduction of 2,7-diaminomitosene or 2,7-diamino-1-hydroxymitosene in the presence of calf thymus DNA resulted in alkylation of the DNA to the extent of one molecule per 14 and 11 bases, respectively, although no covalent binding was observed on catalytic reduction. Reduction of each of these mitosenes by sodium dithionite in the presence of 2'-deoxyguanosine gave monoalkylation on the 2-amino group of this nucleotide. The 2,7-diaminomitosenes inhibited L-1210 leukemia cell colony formation in vitro at concentrations 3-4-fold greater (less potent) than mitomycin C. DNA single-strand breaks were also produced by each mitosene, but these lesions did not correlate with cytotoxicity and were less prominent than breaks produced by another monofunctional alkylating agent, methyl methanesulfonate. Mitosene-induced DNA strand breaks are probably due to excission-repair endonuclease activity and not from oxygen free radicals produced by redox cycling of the quinone moiety. There was no evidence of DNA-DNA cross-links by either 2,7-diaminomitosene.","['Iyengar, B S', 'Dorr, R T', 'Shipp, N G', 'Remers, W A']","['Iyengar BS', 'Dorr RT', 'Shipp NG', 'Remers WA']","['Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Arizona, Tucson 85721.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,J Med Chem,Journal of medicinal chemistry,9716531,IM,"['Alkylation', 'Animals', 'DNA/*drug effects/metabolism', 'DNA Damage', 'Deoxyguanosine', 'Leukemia L1210/drug therapy', 'Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy', '*Mitomycins/metabolism/*pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'Molecular Structure', 'Spectrophotometry', 'Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/jm00163a042 [doi]'],ppublish,J Med Chem. 1990 Jan;33(1):253-7. doi: 10.1021/jm00163a042.,"['0 (Mitomycins)', '78598-43-3 (2,7-diaminomitosene)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'G9481N71RO (Deoxyguanosine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we report on the leukemic cell karyotypes of 155 children with ANLL who were treated from 1980 to 1987 in consecutive programs of chemotherapy at this institution. Of 121 cases with adequate banding, 20% were normal, 30% had miscellaneous clonal abnormalities, and 50% were classified into known cytogenetic subgroups: inv(16)/del(16q) (n = 15), t(8; 21) (n = 14), t(15;17) (n = 9), t(9;11) (n = 9), t(11;V)/del(11q) (n = 7) and -7/del(7q) (n = 6). The inv(16)/del(16q) cases showed a nearly equal distribution of myelocytic and monocytic French-American-British (FAB) subtypes; only four of these patients presented with M4Eo morphology. Despite a 100% remission induction rate, patients with inv(16)/del(16q)-positive ANLL fared no better overall than the entire group; only 40% of this subgroup were event-free survivors at 2 years from diagnosis (P = .23). Patients with inv(16)/del(16q) frequently had CNS involvement at diagnosis (eight of 15) or initially relapsed in this site (three of eight). Event-free survival (EFS) was clearly superior for young patients with FAB M5 leukemia and the t(9;11) (P = .041). These patients were clinically indistinguishable from others with the FAB disease subtype, yet their responses to etoposide-containing therapies were noteworthy. By contrast, children with structural abnormalities involving 11q23, other than t(9;11), were infants (median age, 6 months) with FAB M4 or M5 leukemia, hyperleukocytosis, and frequent coagulation abnormalities.

Of the 494 boys entered on study, 255 (51.6%) were in complete continuous remission (CCR) 3 years after entering remission and an additional eight were in CCR 3 years after localized extramedullary relapse and retreatment; 263 boys were eligible for testicular biopsy. Elective testicular biopsy was performed on 235 (89.4%) boys. Of the 204 (86.8%) boys with negative biopsies, 175 (85.8%) remained in CCR 10 to 12 years after diagnosis and 25 (12.3%) relapsed, 11 (44%) of whom died. Isolated overt TL occurred in four (2.0%) and all remained in CCR 22+ to 60+ months after re-treatment. Of the 26 boys with occult TL, 16 (62%) remained in CCR. Ten (38%) relapsed despite local testicular irradiation and systemic re-treatment; six of the 10 died. Of the 26 boys who did not undergo biopsy, 21 (80.8%) remained in CCR; two (7.7%) developed isolated overt TL. DFS after testicular biopsy was significantly better in boys without occult TL (P = .001). Occult TL after 3 years of CCR represents aggressive minimal-residual disease and carries a worse prognosis than absence of TL. Initial treatment should be directed at obviating occult and overt testicular relapse. Conventional therapy as used in this study was suboptimal in preventing subsequent bone marrow (BM) relapse and death. If occult TR is identified during or at the end of planned therapy, a higher salvage rate may require intensified alternate therapy. As such, testicular biopsies may be clinically useful. Further investigation is limited by the relative rarity of, and the lack of identifying features in boys with occult TL.","['Miller, D R', 'Leikin, S L', 'Albo, V C', 'Palmer, N F', 'Sather, H N', 'Hammond, G D']","['Miller DR', 'Leikin SL', 'Albo VC', 'Palmer NF', 'Sather HN', 'Hammond GD']","[""Lutheran General Children's Medical Center, Park Ridge, IL.""]",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Clin Oncol,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology,8309333,IM,"['Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/therapeutic use', 'Asparaginase/administration & dosage', 'Biopsy', 'Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/secondary', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/mortality/*pathology', 'Prednisone/administration & dosage', 'Prognosis', 'Radiotherapy Dosage', 'Remission Induction', 'Testicular Neoplasms/drug therapy/mortality/pathology/secondary', 'Testis/*pathology', 'Time Factors', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1200/JCO.1990.8.1.57 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Oncol. 1990 Jan;8(1):57-66. doi: 10.1200/JCO.1990.8.1.57.,"['5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'VB0R961HZT (Prednisone)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Natural and adaptive immune surveillance and mutant frequency to 6-thioguanine resistance in circulating T-lymphocytes were studied in five patients with xeroderma pigmentosum, two with Cockayne's syndrome, and one with trichothiodystrophy. Forty-eight-hour cutaneous hypersensitivity responses to recall antigens excluded anergy and circulating CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD16+ cell numbers were within normal limits in all patients tested, as were proliferative lymphocyte responses to PHA, except in the trichothiodystrophy patient. Proliferative responses to recall antigens (PPD, SKSD, and Candida) showed that all patients responded to one or more antigens. Direct natural killer cytotoxicity measured against the human erythromyeloid leukaemia cell line K562 using a 4-h 51Cr release assay was significantly reduced in xeroderma pigmentosum (specific cytotoxicity less than mean +/- SD greater than 17.4 +/- 9.4 per cent, with effector:target cell ratio of 50:1) compared to normal controls (45.8 +/- 17.8), but normal in Cockayne's syndrome and trichothiodystrophy. Generation of lymphokine activated killer cell activity was normal in the two xeroderma pigmentosum lines tested. The mutant frequency in the xeroderma pigmentosum donors was significantly increased (p less than 0.01) and was elevated in the two Cockayne's syndrome donors, taking age into account. No mutants were observed from the single trichothiodystrophy donor.

Using a serum-free biologic assay, PDGF-like biological activity was found in cell lysates and conditioned medium of both Rauscher cells and phenylhydrazine-treated mouse erythroid cells. Subcellular localization experiments revealed the biological activity to be concentrated in the cytosolic fraction.

Workers occupationally exposed to benzene exhibit increased frequencies of both structural and numerical chromosomal aberrations in their peripheral blood lymphocytes. The metabolite(s) responsible for these chromosomal aberrations has not yet been identified. Using a modified micronucleus assay, we have examined the ability of the metabolites of benzene to induce chromosomal damage in human lymphocytes. An antikinetochore antibody was used to distinguish micronuclei that have a high probability of containing a whole chromosome (kinetochore positive) from those containing acentric fragments (kinetochore negative). In vitro treatments with the benzene metabolites hydroquinone, 1,4-benzoquinone, phenol, and catechol resulted in significant increases in micronuclei formation. Phenol, catechol, and 1,4-benzoquinone treatments resulted in moderate (2- to 5-fold) increases in micronuclei, whereas hydroquinone treatments resulted in a larger (11-fold) increase in micronuclei. Significant dose-related increases in kinetochore-positive micronucleated cells were not observed following 1,4-benzoquinone treatment but were observed following treatment with phenol, catechol, and hydroquinone. The higher efficacy of hydroquinone in inducing both total micronuclei and kinetochore-positive micronucleated cells when compared with catechol, phenol, and 1,4-benzoquinone suggests that hydroquinone is a major contributor to the clastogenicity and aneuploidy observed in the lymphocytes of benzene-exposed workers. Other metabolites may also contribute, however, to the genotoxic effects of benzene. Since consistent chromosomal aberrations are often observed in human leukemias, the ability of the phenolic metabolites of benzene to induce chromosomal damage in human cells also implicates them in benzene-induced leukemia.","['Yager, J W', 'Eastmond, D A', 'Robertson, M L', 'Paradisin, W M', 'Smith, M T']","['Yager JW', 'Eastmond DA', 'Robertson ML', 'Paradisin WM', 'Smith MT']","['Department of Biomedical and Environmental Health Sciences, University of California, Berkeley 94720.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Adult', 'Benzene/metabolism/*toxicity', '*Benzoquinones', 'Catechols/toxicity', 'Cells, Cultured', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Humans', 'Hydroquinones/toxicity', 'Lymphocytes/*drug effects/ultrastructure', 'Male', 'Micronuclei, Chromosome-Defective/*drug effects', 'Micronucleus Tests', 'Phenol', 'Phenols/toxicity', 'Quinones/toxicity']",1990/01/15 00:00,1990/01/15 00:01,['1990/01/15 00:00'],"['1990/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jan 15;50(2):393-9.,"['0 (Benzoquinones)', '0 (Catechols)', '0 (Hydroquinones)', '0 (Phenols)', '0 (Quinones)', '339NCG44TV (Phenol)', '3T006GV98U (quinone)', 'J64922108F (Benzene)', 'LF3AJ089DQ (catechol)', 'XV74C1N1AE (hydroquinone)']","['P42 ES004705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P30ES01896/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States', 'P42ES04705/ES/NIEHS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the lines that lacks the IFNA genes entirely but has one copy of the IFNB gene has a rearrangement near the IFNB gene that is most easily interpreted as an insertion of a large segment of DNA (at least 50 kilobases) the 3' end of which is less than 1.3 kilobases 5' to the known regulatory sequences of the IFNB gene. In spite of the rearrangement, IFNB-specific RNA is highly inducible in this line by poly(I)-poly(C).

As for the acute and lymphoma types of ATLL, no significant difference was observed in survival between patients with and those without CNS involvement.

In one patient, withdrawal of drug and administration of platelet transfusions restored platelet counts to near normal levels (approximately 100 x 10(9)/L), however, subsequent challenge with vancomycin due to recurring infection again precipitated severe thrombocytopenia (platelets less than 10 x 10(9)/L) and life-threatening hemorrhagic symptoms. Potent vancomycin-dependent antiplatelet antibodies were detected in the serum of both patients during the refractory period using staphylococcal protein A rosette formation. Employing a monoclonal antibody-antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the patients were found to have vancomycin-dependent IgG antibodies that bound specifically to platelet glycoproteins (GP) IIb and/or IIIa. One of these antibodies failed to react with platelets deficient in GPIIb/IIIa obtained from an individual with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia.

We tried to prevent alloimmunization in these patients by systematic use of leukocyte-free blood components with less than one million of contaminating leukocytes per unit of platelets or red cells. Our study group comprised 26 patients with a minimum of 10 platelet transfusions per patient. These patients were compared with a historical reference group of 21 patients who had received standard blood products. In the leukocyte-free group none developed platelet refractoriness, in contrast to the reference group where 11 of the 21 patients became refractory to random platelets. The median corrected platelet increment for random pooled platelets was significantly higher in the leukocyte-free group compared with the reference group. The increasing number of transfusions did not correlate with the development of platelet refractoriness; instead we propose that the lower limit of antigenic exposure is important. We conclude that systematic use of leukocyte-free blood components effectively prevents development of platelet refractoriness and contributes to optimal supportive care of children with cancer.","['Saarinen, U M', 'Kekomaki, R', 'Siimes, M A', 'Myllyla, G']","['Saarinen UM', 'Kekomaki R', 'Siimes MA', 'Myllyla G']","[""Children's Hospital, University of Helsinki, Finland.""]",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Blood Platelets/immunology', 'Child', '*Erythrocyte Transfusion', 'HLA Antigens/analysis', 'Histocompatibility', 'Humans', 'Immunization', 'Leukocyte Transfusion', 'Pancytopenia/*therapy', 'Platelet Count', '*Platelet Transfusion']",1990/01/15 00:00,1990/01/15 00:01,['1990/01/15 00:00'],"['1990/01/15 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/15 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/15 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85802-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Jan 15;75(2):512-7.,['0 (HLA Antigens)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kinetics of cell growth, antigenic phenotype, and lytic activity of the generated effector cells were further analyzed in this study. BM cells from ALL patients with active disease and in complete remission (CR) were cultured with a combination of LMW-BCGF and rIL-2. Monoclonal antibodies (anti-CD3 and anti-Leu 19) and immunomagnetic beads were used to separate LAK cells into three subsets: CD3+/Leu 19-, CD3+/Leu 19+, and CD3-/Leu 19+. Cytotoxicity assays with different subsets were performed versus K562, Raji, and autologous leukemic cells, using a 3-hour 51Cr release test. There was a significant cell expansion of 54-fold (mean value) for CD3+ cells and 15-fold for Leu 19+ cells in culture with LMW-BCGF plus rIL-2 for 7 to 14 days, whereas no cell expansion was observed in culture with rIL-2 alone. Although NK activity (K562) was generated from leukemic BM cells in culture with rIL-2 alone, it is only about one third of that generated in culture with rIL-2 plus LMW-BCGF. Analysis of lytic activity of cells generated in the latter cultures demonstrated that CD3-/Leu 19+ cells expressed highest lytic activity against NK-sensitive K562 cells as well as against NK-resistant Raji cells. CD3+/Leu 19+ cells showed median cytotoxicity, and CD3+Leu 19- cells mediated only minimal cytotoxic activity. Also, lytic activity of CD3-/Leu 19+ cells against autologous leukemic blasts was noted in patients with active disease. Our results demonstrate that LAK activity generated from BM cells by LMW-BCGF and r-IL2 is mediated mainly by two types of Leu 19+ cells: CD3-/Leu 19+ NK cells and CD3-/Leu 19+ T cells. Although CD3+ T cells (both Leu 19+ and Leu 19-) mediated less antitumor cytotoxicity than CD3-/Leu 19+ cells, the former cells were the major expanding cell population in culture with LMW-BCGF and rIL-2. The new culture system may be effective in generation of cells with LAK activity for therapeutic use.","['Zhou, M X', 'Findley, H W Jr', 'Davis, R', 'Ragab, A H']","['Zhou MX', 'Findley HW Jr', 'Davis R', 'Ragab AH']","['Division of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology/pathology', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'HLA-DR Antigens/analysis', 'Humans', 'Immunity, Cellular', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-4/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/*immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*immunology/pathology']",1990/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)85832-7 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Jan 1;75(1):160-5.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)', '0 (HLA-DR Antigens)', '0 (Interleukin-2)', '207137-56-2 (Interleukin-4)']",['CA-20549/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There were no operative deaths, no reoperations for bleeding, and 30 of 33 (91%) patients had a functioning splenic remnant documented by a postoperative radionuclide spleen scan. One patient developed neutropenia without evidence of viral infection that required temporary cessation of azathioprine and the patient with thalassemia major had only transient improvement in transfusion requirements.

The aims of this study were (1) to test, in an independent population, the prognostic reproducibility of these staging systems; and (2) to develop a synthesis staging system that could be easily applied in clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 406 patients with newly diagnosed Ph-positive CML were evaluated by the four published staging systems of Tura, Cervantes, Sokal, and our group. The proposed synthesis staging system was developed based on the most consistent prognostic characteristics, and the presence or absence of accelerated disease features at diagnosis. The staging systems were compared according to survival outcome, as well as by looking for differences of survival outcomes within a specific stage of a defined system, when patients in this stage were subclassified by a second staging system. RESULTS: Whereas the staging system of Cervantes et al identified only two prognostic groups (median survivals of 49 versus 40 months; p = 0.01), the remaining three staging systems were able to segregate patients into stage 1, 2, and 3 risk groups with respective median survivals of 56 to 57, 41 to 42, and 28 to 36 months, respectively (p less than 0.001 to p less than 0.002). The new proposed staging system, based on the existence of zero to one (stage 1), two (stage 2), or three or more unfavorable (stage 3) characteristics, or the presence of accelerated disease features (stage 4), categorized patients into four prognostic groups with median survivals of 56, 45, 30, and 30 months, respectively (p less than 0.001), the latter stage (stage 4) being associated with a higher one-year mortality rate (29%). The synthesis staging system was also able to subclassify patients within most of Tura's and Sokal's stages into significantly different prognostic groups by survival outcome. CONCLUSION: The predictive prognostic capacity of three of the four published staging systems was confirmed in this independent or test population. The new proposed staging system was superior to the staging systems of Tura and Sokal in identifying different prognostic subgroups.","['Kantarjian, H M', 'Keating, M J', 'Smith, T L', 'Talpaz, M', 'McCredie, K B']","['Kantarjian HM', 'Keating MJ', 'Smith TL', 'Talpaz M', 'McCredie KB']","['Department of Hematology, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,Am J Med,The American journal of medicine,0267200,IM,"['Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/mortality/*pathology', 'Neoplasm Staging/*methods', 'Philadelphia Chromosome', 'Prognosis']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0002-9343(90)90119-X [pii]', '10.1016/0002-9343(90)90119-x [doi]']",ppublish,Am J Med. 1990 Jan;88(1):1-8. doi: 10.1016/0002-9343(90)90119-x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have examined the reversion of a mutant Moloney murine leukemia virus with a deletion in the protease domain of the pol gene after infection of NIH/3T3 cells. In this system revertants arise quickly, only 2 weeks after infection. Analysis of DNA clones of the revertant viral genomes showed that they were derived by recombination with a long sequence of gag and pol exhibiting 95% sequence identity to Moloney virus. One such cloned recombinant was fully infectious, indicating that the repertoire of viral sequences in the NIH/3T3 genome must include substantial stretches of functional viral genes. Examination of the viral DNAs very early in the infection revealed the presence of defective genomes, formed by nonhomologous crossovers between the two parental sequences.

Previous studies have shown that PAF stimulates interleukin 1 (IL-1) release by human monocytes. IL-1 and other cytokines produced in response to PAF may be important to the long-term effects of this short-lived lipid. The THP-1 human monocytic leukemia cell line, was used to study the mechanism by which PAF stimulates IL-1 release. PAF stimulates the release of IL-1 beta activity into THP-1 cell supernatants with a multiphasic dose-response curve very similar to that for monocytes. When THP-1 cells are treated with PAF and LPS in combination, these two stimuli interact synergistically to greatly increase the release of IL-1 activity. To assess the effect of PAF on IL-1 beta synthesis, THP-1 cell pellet proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted, and immunostained to detect IL-1 beta. Immunostaining revealed that PAF increases intracellular IL-1 beta precursor and that the combination of PAF and LPS increases IL-1 beta precursor synergistically. PAF increases IL-1 beta release mainly by increasing IL-1 beta synthesis.","['Barthelson, R A', 'Potter, T', 'Valone, F H']","['Barthelson RA', 'Potter T', 'Valone FH']","['Department of Medicine, Veterans Administration Medical Center, San Francisco, California 94121.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Netherlands,Cell Immunol,Cellular immunology,1246405,IM,"['Blotting, Western', 'Cell Line', 'Dinoprostone/biosynthesis', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Synergism', 'Endotoxins/*pharmacology', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interleukin-1/*biosynthesis', 'Lipopolysaccharides/pharmacology', 'Monocytes/*metabolism', 'Platelet Activating Factor/*pharmacology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0008-8749(90)90069-4 [pii]', '10.1016/0008-8749(90)90069-4 [doi]']",ppublish,Cell Immunol. 1990 Jan;125(1):142-50. doi: 10.1016/0008-8749(90)90069-4.,"['0 (Endotoxins)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Lipopolysaccharides)', '0 (Platelet Activating Factor)', 'K7Q1JQR04M (Dinoprostone)']","['AI19784/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI22141/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Twenty-eight patients had refractory anemia (RA), 14 had refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts (RARS), 45 had refractory anemia with blast excess (RAEB), 19 had refractory anemia with blast excess in transformation (RAEB-t), and 14 had chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMMoL). Fifty patients (42%) had clonal chromosome anomalies at initial analysis. The most common cytogenetic anomalies were: 5q- (11 patients), trisomy 8 (nine patients), -7/7q- (6 patients), 12p- (five patients), followed by structural anomalies of chromosome 17 (four patients), and loss of Y chromosome (three patients). The prognostic value of chromosome anomalies was examined by comparison of the significance of single chromosome anomalies (34 patients) versus multiple cytogenetic changes (16 patients). Patients with multiple anomalies had a shorter survival (8 months) than patients with single anomalies (18 months) or those with a normal karyotype (36 months). All these differences were significant. The incidence of multiple anomalies was higher in patients with RAEB and RAEB-t than in those with RA, RARS, and CMMOL (p less than 0.05). However, no chromosome anomaly was specifically associated with any group of FAB classification. Transformation to acute leukemia was observed in 25% of patients with normal karyotype, 41% of patients with single anomalies, and 50% of patients with multiple changes. The incidence of leukemic transformation was significantly higher in patients with multiple anomalies than in those with a normal karyotype (p less than 0.05). Thus, in the present study, FAB classification and chromosome anomalies were of independent prognostic significance. Sequential cytogenetic studies were performed in 23 patients to correlate the cytogenetic and clinical findings during the course of the disease. Six of seven patients with transformation to acute leukemia showed a karyotypic evolution. These findings agree with the view that an unstable karyotype can be associated with a poor prognosis.","['Suciu, S', 'Kuse, R', 'Weh, H J', 'Hossfeld, D K']","['Suciu S', 'Kuse R', 'Weh HJ', 'Hossfeld DK']","['Department of Oncology/Hematology, Medical University Clinic, Hamburg, Germany.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Aged, 80 and over', 'Anemia, Refractory/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Anemia, Refractory, with Excess of Blasts/genetics/mortality/pathology', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelomonocytic, Chronic/genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*genetics/mortality/pathology', 'Prognosis']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(90)90193-E [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(90)90193-e [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1990 Jan;44(1):15-26. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(90)90193-e.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The phenotypes of mutant viruses, i.e., infectivity, cytopathogenicity, transactivation of gene expression controlled by a long terminal repeat, and viral RNA and protein syntheses, were examined by transfection and infection experiments. Three structural (gag, pol, and env) and two regulatory (tat and rev) gene mutants were not infectious, whereas vif, vpx, and nef were dispensable for infectivity and mutant viruses were highly cytopathic. In transient transfection assays, a rev mutant produced mainly small mRNA species and no detectable virus protein and particles. The transactivation potential of a tat mutant was about 10-fold less than that of wild-type DNA, generating small amounts of virus.","['Shibata, R', 'Miura, T', 'Hayami, M', 'Sakai, H', 'Ogawa, K', 'Kiyomasu, T', 'Ishimoto, A', 'Adachi, A']","['Shibata R', 'Miura T', 'Hayami M', 'Sakai H', 'Ogawa K', 'Kiyomasu T', 'Ishimoto A', 'Adachi A']","['Department of Viral Oncology, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Animals', 'CD4 Antigens/immunology', 'Cell Line', 'Cercopithecus/*microbiology', 'Chlorocebus aethiops/*microbiology', 'Cloning, Molecular/*methods', 'DNA, Viral/*genetics', 'Genes, Regulator', 'Genes, Viral', 'Humans', '*Mutation', 'RNA, Messenger/genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Simian Immunodeficiency Virus/*genetics/immunology/isolation & purification', 'Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Viral Proteins/genetics', 'Viral Structural Proteins/genetics']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.64.1.307-312.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Jan;64(1):307-12. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.1.307-312.1990.,"['0 (CD4 Antigens)', '0 (DNA, Viral)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Viral Proteins)', '0 (Viral Structural Proteins)']",,,,,PMC249103,,,,,,,,,,,,

Expression of the Tax protein activates a number of cellular genes, such as those coding for the alpha chain of the high-affinity interleukin-2 receptor and interleukin-2. These findings indicate that the Tax protein is involved in the unregulated T-cell growth associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type I infection. Higher levels of vimentin mRNA were expressed in two human T-cell leukemia virus type I-transformed T cell lines, C91/PL and C81-66/45, when compared with that in Jurkat T cells. We demonstrate that this activation is conferred by the vimentin upstream flanking sequences. Indeed, enhanced activity was detected when constructs with the vimentin promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene were transfected in HeLa cells and in two cell lines of hematopoietic origin (Jurkat T lymphoblastoid cells and U937 promonocytic cells) together with a Tax expression plasmid. By introducing a series of deletions in the vimentin promoter, we further restrict these sequences to 30 base pairs, located between 241 and 210 base pairs upstream of the mRNA cap site. A 40-base-pair oligonucleotide containing this regulatory region proved sufficient to confer Tax inducibility upon a heterologous promoter linked to chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Importantly, this segment includes an 11-base-pair promoter segment that has homology with the binding site for the NF-kappa B transactivating factor. Our findings indicate that constitutive expression of the vimentin gene under the control of the Tax protein may be relevant in understanding the progression of the lymphoproliferative process associated with human T-cell leukemia virus type I infection.","['Lilienbaum, A', 'Duc Dodon, M', 'Alexandre, C', 'Gazzolo, L', 'Paulin, D']","['Lilienbaum A', 'Duc Dodon M', 'Alexandre C', 'Gazzolo L', 'Paulin D']","['Universite Paris 7, Institut Pasteur, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Base Sequence', '*Cell Transformation, Viral', 'Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase/genetics', 'Cloning, Molecular', '*Gene Expression Regulation', '*Genes', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Oligonucleotide Probes', 'Plasmids', '*Promoter Regions, Genetic', 'Regulatory Sequences, Nucleic Acid', 'Trans-Activators/*metabolism', 'Vimentin/*genetics']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.64.1.256-263.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Jan;64(1):256-63. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.1.256-263.1990.,"['0 (Oligonucleotide Probes)', '0 (Trans-Activators)', '0 (Vimentin)', 'EC 2.3.1.28 (Chloramphenicol O-Acetyltransferase)']",,,,,PMC249098,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore, we attempted to quantitate the relationship between HIV infection and CD4 expression on human cell lines before and after introduction of the CD4 gene by using a retrovirus vector. Prior to introduction of the CD4 expression vector, low levels of HIV infection were detected by a sensitive focal immunoassay on all three cell types studied. With several HIV strains in clones of human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells expressing different levels of CD4, HIV titer increased with increasing CD4 expression. In contrast, in squamous cell carcinoma cells (SCL1) and astroglial cells (U87MG), even high levels of CD4 expression failed to augment HIV infection. The CD4 protein expressed in these two cell lines had the expected molecular weight and was capable of binding HIV virions. However, in contrast to CD4-positive HeLa cells, CD4-positive U87MG and SCL1 cells were unable to form syncytia when cultured with cells expressing HIV envelope protein. Thus, the inability of HIV to infect these cells appeared to be due to lack of fusion between HIV virion envelope proteins and CD4-positive cell membranes. This block is infectivity was overcome when cells were infected with HIV which was pseudotyped with the envelope protein of amphotropic murine leukemia virus. Thus, in addition to CD4, other cell surface molecules appear to be required for successful HIV entry into and infection of these two human cell lines.","['Chesebro, B', 'Buller, R', 'Portis, J', 'Wehrly, K']","['Chesebro B', 'Buller R', 'Portis J', 'Wehrly K']","['National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Rocky Mountain Laboratories, Hamilton, Montana 59840.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article']",United States,J Virol,Journal of virology,0113724,IM,"['Astrocytoma', 'Brain Neoplasms', 'CD4 Antigens/analysis/*immunology', 'Carcinoma, Squamous Cell', 'Cell Line', 'HIV/immunology/*pathogenicity', 'HeLa Cells/immunology/microbiology', 'Humans', 'Skin Neoplasms', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/*immunology/microbiology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1128/JVI.64.1.215-221.1990 [doi]'],ppublish,J Virol. 1990 Jan;64(1):215-21. doi: 10.1128/JVI.64.1.215-221.1990.,['0 (CD4 Antigens)'],,,,,PMC249089,,,,,,,,,,,,

SN1 and SN2 are directed toward two unique human T-leukemia-associated cell surface antigens, TALLA and GP37, respectively. As the tumor model, we used nude mice bearing ascitic tumors of Ichikawa, a human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line. In initial studies, we investigated the effect of the IT injection schedule on the efficacy of ITs in the in vivo suppression of the ascitic tumors. Four doses of 20 micrograms each of SN1-RA and SN2-RA completely suppress the tumor growth in 100% of the treated mice when the IT treatment is initiated either 1 or 2 days after tumor inoculation of 1.6 x 10(7) Ichikawa cells into the mice. Subsequently, we investigated the potentiating effects of IFN and DNR on the in vivo antitumor activity of ITs. To this end, we chose to initiate the treatment 4 days after the tumor inoculation when IT treatment alone is only partially effective. ITs (10 micrograms each of SN1-RA and SN2-RA) plus IFN (2 x 10(5) IU) or ITs plus IFN plus DNR (5 micrograms) completely suppress tumor growth in 100% of the treated mice while similar treatment with any one of the three agents is only partially effective. Similar treatment with ITs plus DNR or IFN plus DNR results in complete suppression of tumor growth in 80% of the treated mice. These results were reproducible in a repeated experiment. To gain information about the mechanisms involving the IFN potentiation of IT activity, we carried out several experiments. The cell surface expression of TALLA and GP37 was slightly augmented by the in vitro incubation of Ichikawa cells with IFN as measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The degree of the increase in either TALLA or GP37 was significantly smaller than that of HLA class I antigens in the same experiment. In in vitro experiments, IFN did not show any significant cytotoxic activity against Ichikawa cells or augment the cytotoxic activity of ITs against Ichikawa cells. On the other hand, injections of IFN into nude mice augmented activity of macrophages and NK cells; however, Ichikawa leukemia cells were rather resistant to the NK cell lysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Yokota, S', 'Hara, H', 'Luo, Y', 'Seon, B K']","['Yokota S', 'Hara H', 'Luo Y', 'Seon BK']","['Department of Molecular Immunology, Roswell Park Memorial Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Cell Line', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Daunorubicin/*therapeutic use', 'Drug Synergism', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunotoxins/*therapeutic use', 'Interferon Type I/*therapeutic use', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/immunology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/drug therapy/immunology/*therapy', 'Macrophages/drug effects/immunology', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Nude', 'Neoplasm Transplantation', 'Recombinant Proteins', 'Ricin/therapeutic use']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jan 1;50(1):32-7.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Immunotoxins)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Recombinant Proteins)', '9009-86-3 (Ricin)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",['P01 CA42683/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cells were incubated 3 to 24 h with 10 nM to 50 microM 6-MP. Nucleotides were extracted with perchloric acid, and the 6-thiopurine nucleotides were isolated on mercurial cellulose. The endogenous ribonucleotides in the perchloric acid extracts as well as 6-thiopurine nucleotides were separated and quantified with anion exchange high-performance liquid chromatography. The concentration of 6-thioinosinate (6-TIMP) and 6-thioxantinate (6-TXMP) increased with an increasing 6-MP dose. The concentration of the 6-thioguanosine nucleotides (6-TGN) increased with 6-MP concentrations between 10 nM and 1 microM. However, further increase in 6-MP concentration led to a decrease in the formation of 6-TGN. At 50 microM 6-MP, the concentration of 6-thioguanosine 5'-triphosphate was one fifth of that seen at 1 microM. The incorporation of 6-[35S]mercaptopurine into DNA was also slightly higher at 1 microM compared with 50 microM. The cytocidal effect on clonogenic cells was one log greater at 1 microM 6-MP compared with 50 microM 6-MP. The decrease of 6-TGN was accompanied not only by an increased 6-TIMP concentration but also by an inhibition of the purine de novo synthesis and consequently by a decrease of the cellular ATP concentration. The ATP concentration in the cells treated with 1 microM 6-MP could be reduced to the level seen in cells treated with 50 microM 6-MP by simultaneous incubation with 0.3 microM antimycin A. This decrease of ATP concentration was accompanied by a reduction of 6-TGN and to a lesser extent of 6-TXMP. These experiments suggest that the ""self-limiting"" phenomenon in the metabolism of 6-MP might be caused by a depletion of ATP by inhibition of purine de novo synthesis presumably by 6-TIMP.","['Liliemark, J', 'Pettersson, B', 'Engberg, B', 'Lafolie, P', 'Masquelier, M', 'Peterson, C']","['Liliemark J', 'Pettersson B', 'Engberg B', 'Lafolie P', 'Masquelier M', 'Peterson C']","['Department of Medicine, Karolinska Institute at Huddinge Hospital, Sweden.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Res,Cancer research,2984705R,IM,"['Animals', 'Biotransformation', 'Carbon Radioisotopes', 'Cell Line', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Experimental/*metabolism', 'Mercaptopurine/*metabolism/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/cytology/drug effects/metabolism', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Res. 1990 Jan 1;50(1):108-12.,"['0 (Carbon Radioisotopes)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The variation in risk with the duration of employment, age and the calendar time when diagnostic radiological work began indicates that the elevated incidence of leukemia is attributable to occupational exposure to X-rays.","['Wang, J', 'Boice, J D Jr', 'Inskip, P D', 'Li, B', 'Zhang, J', 'Fraumeni, J F Jr']","['Wang J', 'Boice JD Jr', 'Inskip PD', 'Li B', 'Zhang J', 'Fraumeni JF Jr']","['Institute of Radiation Medicine, CAMS, Tianjin.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],China,Proc Chin Acad Med Sci Peking Union Med Coll,"Proceedings of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and the Peking Union Medical College = Chung-kuo i hsueh k'o hsueh yuan, Chung-kuo hsieh ho i k'o ta hsueh hsueh pao",8712086,IM,"['Adult', 'China/epidemiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Incidence', 'Leukemia, Lymphoid/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/*epidemiology', 'Male', 'Occupational Diseases/*epidemiology', 'Radiography/*adverse effects', 'Risk Factors']",1990/01/01 00:00,2001/03/28 10:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '2001/03/28 10:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Proc Chin Acad Med Sci Peking Union Med Coll. 1990;5(4):194-9.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With time, these appeared as distinct zones of contact where intervening distances were less than or equal to 50 nm. Large dense-cored granules suggested localization of peptidergic neurotransmitters. Encircling of neurite profiles by RBL resembled intimate nerve-MC relationships in vivo.

Sixty-four episodes of fever were studied in a high risk population of 42 patients mostly undergoing intensive chemotherapy for leukaemia. Ciprofloxacin achieved clinical responses as follows: completely successful in 39%, partially successful in 20%, and unsuccessful in 41%. Infections were microbiologically documented in 37 (58%), with Gram-positive bacteria (of which 37% were coagulase negative staphylococci and 34% were streptococci) accounting for 81% of all organisms cultured. Responses in documented infections were as follows; completely successful in 32%, partially successful in 27%, and unsuccessful in 41%. One infection-related death occurred 30 h after starting ciprofloxacin, and a further three patients died before the resolution of neutropenia. The early death was caused by fulminant infection with a ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No other ciprofloxacin resistance was seen amongst eight Gram-negative isolates. There was no evidence of emerging ciprofloxacin resistance during the course of the study. Ciprofloxacin was associated with a low incidence of adverse events with skin rash (five cases) and nausea (one case) being reported as possibly or probably related to ciprofloxacin. We conclude that high-dose intravenous ciprofloxacin may be safely employed as monotherapy in the empirical treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients. It has the additional advantages of twice daily administration, the availability of intravenous and oral presentations, and absence of cross-allergy in beta-lactam antibiotic hypersensitive patients.","['Johnson, P R', 'Yin, J A', 'Tooth, J A']","['Johnson PR', 'Yin JA', 'Tooth JA']","['Department of Clinical Haematology, Manchester Royal Infirmary, UK.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Bacterial Infections/*drug therapy/microbiology', 'Ciprofloxacin/*administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Female', 'Fever/drug therapy/etiology', '*Gram-Negative Bacteria', 'Humans', 'Injections, Intravenous', 'Leukemia/complications', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Remission Induction', 'Superinfection/drug therapy']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jac/26.suppl_f.101 [doi]'],ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 1990 Dec;26 Suppl F:101-7. doi: 10.1093/jac/26.suppl_f.101.,['5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition, we tested the effect of host sensitization with the immunogenic, retrovirus-related proteins that are precipitated from the surface of L5178Y/DTIC cells by means of specific antibody. Our results indicated that the novel determinants induced by DTIC treatment on L5178Y cells do not act as helper determinants for the generation of tumor-specific cytotoxic responses.

The undifferentiated U937 leukemia cells contain very low amounts of vimentin, but express a conspicuous IF network when exposed to phorbol myristate acetate. In parallel, they acquire functional properties typical of cells of the monocyte lineage. These concomitant variations suggest that vimentin IFs could play a role in the process of differentiation. However, we observed that all-trans-retinoic acid and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 confer monocyte-like properties upon U937 cells without inducing vimentin expression. We obtained increased phenotypic changes, yet in the absence of a vimentin network, by combining the effects of both inducers.

By S1 nuclease analysis we found that there is 8 times more P2- than P1-initiated RNA in total RNA from HL60 cells. The half-lives of P1- and P2-initiated transcripts are 26 and 18 min, respectively, so the difference in the relative abundance of the mRNAs is not due to differences in their stabilities. The relative rates of transcription from the P1 and P2 promoters, estimated by in vitro nuclear run-on analysis, were found to differ by about 10-fold, sufficient to account for the difference in the steady-state levels of the two mRNAs.

Dimethyl sulphoxide causes a very rapid reduction in total c-myc mRNA, while with phorbol ester a transient increase occurs followed by a more gradual decline.

Four of the patients had been treated with high-dose cytosine arabinoside as part of the cytostatic regimen, six had a central venous line and four patients had oral lesions prior to the infection. Selective gut decontamination consisted of co-trimoxazole/colistin in five patients and quinolones in three patients. The first three patients died, either due to interstitial pneumonia with the adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or due to infection-triggered disseminated intravascular coagulation despite prompt empiric antibiotic therapy including vancomycin. The other patients improved after empiric supplementation of penicillin G (30 Mega/day) to the antibiotic regimen. Beginning ARDS in two of these patients dramatically responded to high-dose steroids. We conclude that St. mitis is a major pathogen in neutropenic leukemic patients. Infection appears to occur independently of acute leukemic cell type, regimen of selective gut decontamination, venous access, visible oral lesions or treatment with high-dose cytosine arabinoside. The clinical course of our patients raises questions about the value of commonly recommended empiric antibiotic regimens, which were clearly ineffective to control infections with St. mitis in this patient group. Our data indicate that immediate antibiotic therapy with penicillin G is indicated and may be life-saving for suspected St. mitis infections in neutropenic leukemic patients.","['Arning, M', 'Gehrt, A', 'Aul, C', 'Runde, V', 'Hadding, U', 'Schneider, W']","['Arning M', 'Gehrt A', 'Aul C', 'Runde V', 'Hadding U', 'Schneider W']","['Department of Internal Medicine, Heinrich-Heine-University, Dusseldorf, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,IM,"['Adult', 'Cytarabine/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*complications/drug therapy', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Neutropenia/chemically induced/*complications', 'Penicillin G/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications/drug therapy', 'Quinolines/adverse effects/therapeutic use', 'Respiratory Distress Syndrome/etiology', 'Sepsis/drug therapy/*etiology', 'Streptococcal Infections/drug therapy/*etiology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01738551 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1990 Dec;61(6):364-8. doi: 10.1007/BF01738551.,"['0 (Quinolines)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', 'Q42T66VG0C (Penicillin G)']",,,,,PMC7101690,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the recovery phase of the postnatal anaemia, a peak in plasma ESF occurs in both strains. In young adult mice of both strains another peak in plasma ESF occurs at 70-110 days of age, associated with an increased number of bone marrow CFU-E, in a period when packed cell volume (PCV) remains stable. As the animals grow older PCV decreases, whereas plasma ESF and bone marrow CFU-E concentration increase. These results, together with in vitro dose-response studies, suggest reduced sensitivity to erythropoietin (Epo) of the ageing erythron. Throughout, the AKR/O strain has higher levels of plasma ESF and bone marrow CFU-E concentrations than the WLO strain, indicating both a reduced Epo responsiveness and some degree of ineffective erythropoiesis in the AKR/O strain. At all ages the AKR/O strain has a high concentration of Epo independent bone marrow CFU-E, possibly caused by the virus infection of precursor cells.","['Hellebostad, M', 'Sanengen, T', 'Halvorsen, S']","['Hellebostad M', 'Sanengen T', 'Halvorsen S']","['Department of Paediatrics, Ulleval Hospital, Oslo, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Blut,Blut,0173401,IM,"['Aging', 'Animals', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Erythroid Precursor Cells/pathology', '*Erythropoiesis', 'Erythropoietin/blood', 'Female', 'Hematocrit', 'Leukemia, Experimental/blood/*pathology', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred AKR', 'Spleen/pathology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF01738550 [doi]'],ppublish,Blut. 1990 Dec;61(6):358-63. doi: 10.1007/BF01738550.,['11096-26-7 (Erythropoietin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The biological target-cell spectrum of IL-3 is broad and includes progenitor cells of various hematopoietic lineages as well as multiple stages of stem cell differentiation. IL-3 also induces growth of most primitive hemopoietic progenitors (CFU-blast). Synergistic effects on growth of myeloid cells (i.e. macrophages, eosinophils and blood basophils) are obtained by sequential use of IL-3 and later-acting myelopoietic cytokines. In addition, IL-3 supports terminal maturation, prolongs survival and enhances the functional properties of myeloid cells through high-affinity binding sites. In vivo administration of IL-3 is followed by an increase in peripheral white blood cell counts as well as by an increase in the number of circulating progenitor cells giving rise to mature hemopoietic cells in response to more lineage-restricted growth factors. IL-3 also regulates growth of leukemic cells and primes them to become more sensitive to cell cycle specific cytotoxic drugs. IL-3 apparently represents a novel and unique hemopoietic growth factor. Its clinical use should offer new strategies in the treatment of cytopenia, leukemic disease and in stem cell transplantation.","['Valent, P', 'Geissler, K', 'Sillaber, C', 'Lechner, K', 'Bettelheim, P']","['Valent P', 'Geissler K', 'Sillaber C', 'Lechner K', 'Bettelheim P']","['I.

Mice reconstituted with virus-infected bone marrow cells showed long-term tissue-specific expression of human beta-globin RNA and protein. Recently, we have redesigned the retroviral vector to improve the efficiency of stem cell infection and to raise the level of globin expression obtained from the virally transduced gene. Removal of a portion of the second intron of the beta-globin gene resulted in the accumulation of a higher level of full-length viral RNA in retrovirus packaging cell lines, and these cell lines produced beta-globin virus particles at substantially higher titers. Addition of fragments from the locus activation region (LAR) of the beta-like globin gene cluster to the retroviral vectors increased beta-globin expression in infected murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells. Fragments from the -18 and -10.9 kbp DNase I-hypersensitive sites of the LAR increased human beta-globin RNA levels to 35% and 132% of the endogenous mouse beta maj-globin RNA level, respectively. Increased expression was also found for neomycin phosphotransferase RNA, which was transcribed from the retroviral long terminal repeat (LTR), showing that the LAR fragments also activated expression from a nearby heterologous promoter.

Wild-type virus may be produced through recombinational events between the helper virus and a retroviral vector. We have constructed an ecotropic packaging cell line, GP + E-86, and an amphotropic packaging cell line, GP + envAm12, in which the viral gag and pol genes are on one plasmid and the viral env gene is on another plasmid. Both plasmids contain deletions of the packaging sequence and the 3' LTR. The fragmented helper virus genomes, when introduced into 3T3 cells, produce titers of retrovirus which are comparable to the titers produced from packaging cells containing the helper virus genome on a single plasmid. We have found no evidence for the generation of wild-type retrovirus using the GP + E-86 and GP + envAm12 packaging lines, either alone or in combination with the N2 retroviral vector. We also show that these packaging cell lines can be used to transfer the neoR gene of the N2 vector into mouse hematopoietic cells, followed by successful (48-52%), long-term (up to 200 days) transplantation into irradiated recipients. These results indicate that these packaging lines are safe and efficient for use in experiments designed for murine (using GP + E-86) and human (using GP + envAm12) gene therapy.","['Markowitz, D', 'Hesdorffer, C', 'Ward, M', 'Goff, S', 'Bank, A']","['Markowitz D', 'Hesdorffer C', 'Ward M', 'Goff S', 'Bank A']","['Department of Genetics, Columbia University, College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York, New York 10032.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Ann N Y Acad Sci,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,7506858,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Mice', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Retroviridae/genetics', '*Transfection']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1749-6632.1990.tb24328.x [doi]'],ppublish,Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1990;612:407-14. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1990.tb24328.x.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Correctly initiated gamma-neo or beta-neo transcripts were detected with an S1 nuclease protection assay that was internally controlled for transfection efficiency and RNA content. We first optimized the conditions for electroporation and then determined that a gamma-globin promoter fragment extending from -299 and +36 was active in the assay but that a beta-globin promoter extending from -375 to +46 was inactive. Deletion of the gamma-globin promoter to -199 did not affect promoter function, but deletion to -160 reduced promoter strength to 70% of that of control. Additional deletion to position -130 reduced promoter strength to 19% of the control value, and to position -61, 8.7% of the control value. Three gamma-globin promoters containing mutations associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH), -202 C----G, -196 C----T and -117 G----A, were not overexpressed in K562 cells, consistent with the hypothesis that these promoters are not overexpressed in fetal erythroblasts, only in adult red cells. When the beta-globin locus activating region (LAR) was added to a wild-type or an HPFH gamma-neo plasmid, the abundance of correctly initiated gamma-neo transcripts increased dramatically. However, beta-neo expression could not be activated by the LAR in K562 cells.

Immunophenotypic studies confirmed B-cell origin of the lymphoproliferation in the seven patients. Small lymphocytes with mature appearance predominated in three of these cases, presenting as: a) the only cell population (with immunophenotype RR+, FMC7-, CD5+), b) along with a significant amount of prolymphocytes (RR+, CD5+, FMC7+), c) accompanying a population of cells with lymphoplasmacytoid differentiation (RR-, CD5-, CD38+, associated to serum monoclonal IgM). Those data strongly suggested that these three lymphoproliferative syndromes corresponded, respectively, to a classic B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a chronic lymphocytic leukaemia with prolymphocytes, and an immunocytoma. In three other cases the morphology of the proliferating cells was intermediate between prolymphocytes and hairy cells (i.e., variant hairy cells) and they strongly reacted with monoclonal antibodies FMC7 and LeuM5 (CD11c), showing low positivity with antigens CD5 and CD25, in the absence of receptors for mouse red blood cells. The remaining B-cell lymphoproliferative syndrome studied had small centrocytes in peripheral blood, their phenotype being RR-, CD5+, FMC7+/-, CD10+ and CD38+, which suggested a centrofollicular lymphoma with leukaemic expression.

Chromosomal alterations appeared in 64% of the patients with M-4 morphology, in 43% of M-5, 40% of those with M-1, 33% of the M-2, and in 14% of the cases with M-3 morphology.

Structural alterations were commonest amongst the patients with abnormal karyotype. Such alterations included t(8; 21), t(9; 22); t(7; 22), del 11q23, inv 16 (p13;q22), plus multiple major abnormalities in the M-6 patients. A strikingly low incidence of t(15; 17) was found in the acute promyelocytic leukaemia cases. Two chromosomal alterations not previously reported in AML were found in this series, namely, inv 13 (p11;q32) and t(21;1) (q22;q22). The finding of an abnormal karyotype had no unfavourable influence on the complete remission (CR) rate, which reached 65% of the patients with normal karyotype and 81% of those with abnormal karyotype.

Type-2 macro CK (mitochondrial creatine kinase) was detected, with no statistical difference in cirrhosis (14%), hepatocarcinoma (16%), metastatic liver tumor (31%), breast cancer (5%) and other tumors (6%). It was not detected in any patient with leukemia or lymphoma. The presence of type-2 macro CK was unrelated to the stage of either cirrhosis or hepatocarcinoma, according to Child and Okuda, respectively, nor was it correlated to serum cytolytic enzyme levels or to gamma-globulin levels. In cirrhotics, type-2 macro CK was not linked to serum levels of the following tumor markers: alpha-fetoprotein, pseudouridine and gamma-glutamyltransferase isoenzymes complexed to low-density lipoprotein. In addition, the atypical band persisted in several patients with cirrhosis monitored for six months who did not show any evidence of evolution toward hepatocarcinoma. Thus, type-2 macro CK has poor diagnostic sensitivity for neoplastic diseases, and lacks prognostic value both in cirrhosis and neoplastic diseases.","['Castaldo, G', 'Salvatore, F', 'Sacchetti, L']","['Castaldo G', 'Salvatore F', 'Sacchetti L']","['Dipartimento di Biochimica e Biotecnologie Mediche, II Facolta di Medicina e Chirurgia, Universita di Napoli Federico II, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Clin Biochem,Clinical biochemistry,0133660,IM,"['Biomarkers/blood', 'Biomarkers, Tumor/*blood', 'Creatine Kinase/*blood', 'Diagnosis, Differential', 'Humans', 'Isoenzymes', 'Liver Cirrhosis/*blood', 'Predictive Value of Tests', 'Prognosis', 'Severity of Illness Index']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0009-9120(90)80043-I [pii]', '10.1016/0009-9120(90)80043-i [doi]']",ppublish,Clin Biochem. 1990 Dec;23(6):523-7. doi: 10.1016/0009-9120(90)80043-i.,"['0 (Biomarkers)', '0 (Biomarkers, Tumor)', '0 (Isoenzymes)', 'EC 2.7.3.2 (Creatine Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the relative resistance of the leukemic cells from these patients to autologous or allogeneic LAK lysis is not affected by this treatment. In an attempt to render CML cells more susceptible to lysis or cytostasis, they were precultured in serum-free medium with or without recombinant growth factors. In eight patients studied, interleukin-3 (IL-3) significantly enhanced the spontaneous short-term (6-day) proliferation of CML cells, with retention of ability to form colonies in methylcellulose. Culture in either medium alone or IL-3 led to a significant enrichment of CD14+ and CD33+ cells but to a reduction in CD34+ cells. In contrast, culture of the same cells in IL-2 (to generate autologous LAK activity) resulted in a loss of CD14+ and CD33+ as well as CD34+ cells but in a significant increase in CD3+ and CD56+ cells. Despite similarities in their phenotypes, IL-3 cultured cells but not those cultured in medium alone acquired susceptibility to lysis by the IL-2-cultured autologous LAK cells.

This model mimics the human clinical condition when autologous bone marrow was purged ex vivo of leukaemia with mafosfamide or was not purged, and stored in liquid nitrogen before transplantation. Animals with minimal residual disease were prepared with marrow-ablative but leukaemia-noncurative doses of cyclophosphamide (CY) and total body irradiation followed by bone marrow transplantation. The next day after transplantation the recipients were injected with splenocytes immunized against the leukaemia cells (Imm-SPL) or monoclonal antibody (mAb). All the control mice died from leukaemia relapse, but 51% of purged bone marrow recipients, which received Imm-SPL, were cured. In similar conditions mAb did not exert a therapeutic effect. Imm-SPL were not able to eradicate minimal residual disease in the recipients of nonpurged bone marrow.

In especially AMMoL and AMoL, PA activity had discrepancy between euglobulin lysis time and amidolytic assay using chromogenic substrate. As PA inhibitor (PAI)-II was markedly increased in them. PAI might effect the PA assay. PA activity of leukemic cells homogenate was similar to that without t-PA stimulator and leukemic cells homogenate significantly stimulated t-PA. As both PA activity and antigen were statistically increased in leukemic cells homogenate of patient with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), PA and PA stimulator in leukemic cell might play an important role in hypofibrinogenemia or DIC.","['Wada, H', 'Ogasawara, Z', 'Kumeda, Y', 'Tamaki, S', 'Tanigawa, M', 'Takagi, M', 'Iwasaki, E', 'Mori, Y', 'Deguchi, A', 'Tsukada, T']","['Wada H', 'Ogasawara Z', 'Kumeda Y', 'Tamaki S', 'Tanigawa M', 'Takagi M', 'Iwasaki E', 'Mori Y', 'Deguchi A', 'Tsukada T', 'et al.']","['2nd Department of Internal Medicine, Mie University School of Medicine.']",['jpn'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Japan,Rinsho Ketsueki,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2984782R,IM,"['Afibrinogenemia/etiology', 'Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation/etiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*blood/complications', 'Plasminogen Activators/*blood', 'Plasminogen Inactivators/*blood']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rinsho Ketsueki. 1990 Nov;31(11):1794-9.,"['0 (Plasminogen Inactivators)', 'EC 3.4.21.- (Plasminogen Activators)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results for 59 patients (median age 47 years, range 21-72) included 88 episodes of neutropenia, each associated with a course of cytotoxic therapy. The main factor measured was the time elapsed from the beginning of neutropenia (neutrophils less than 500/microliter) until the first infectious febrile episode. The median time for the period was 12 days (range 1-56) for the cotrimoxazole/colistin group, 15 days (range 1-38) for the ofloxacin group and 20 days (range 1-36) for the ciprofloxacin group (differences not significant). Microbiologically proven major infections occurred in 10/27 treatment courses with co-trimoxazole/colistin 7/31 courses with ofloxacin and 7/30 courses with ciprofloxacin (P not significant). These were mostly due to Gram-positive cocci. There were no Gram-negative infections in the quinolone groups compared with one major Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the co-trimoxazole/colistin group. No Pneumocystis carinii infections were encountered. Adverse reactions associated with co-trimoxazole/colistin required discontinuation of medication in 11/27 treatment courses because of compliance problems, skin reactions or gastrointestinal intolerance. There were significantly fewer discontinuations in the ofloxacin (n = 2) and in the ciprofloxacin groups (n = 3). Major side effects of the quinolones included persistent icterus in one patient receiving ofloxacin and psychiatric symptoms in one patient receiving ciprofloxacin. It is concluded from these data that there were no statistically significant differences between the three treatment groups in respect of the prevention of infection.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Arning, M', 'Wolf, H H', 'Aul, C', 'Heyll, A', 'Scharf, R E', 'Scheider, W']","['Arning M', 'Wolf HH', 'Aul C', 'Heyll A', 'Scharf RE', 'Scheider W']","['Heinrich-Heine-University Medical Center, Department of Medicine, Dusseldorf, FRG.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,J Antimicrob Chemother,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,7513617,IM,"['Bacterial Infections/*prevention & control', 'Ciprofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Colistin/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Neutropenia/*complications', 'Ofloxacin/*therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*complications', 'Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination/*therapeutic use']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/jac/26.suppl_d.137 [doi]'],ppublish,J Antimicrob Chemother. 1990 Nov;26 Suppl D:137-42. doi: 10.1093/jac/26.suppl_d.137.,"['5E8K9I0O4U (Ciprofloxacin)', '8064-90-2 (Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination)', 'A4P49JAZ9H (Ofloxacin)', 'Z67X93HJG1 (Colistin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In both instances, the immunogenicity of the transfected tumour cells is greatly enhanced and results in their rejection in vivo. More importantly, these 'modified' tumour cells, which are positive for class I MHC molecules, can simultaneously generate an immunity against the 'wild-type' tumour cells which do not express these molecules.

One should consider whether the simultaneous meningeal and testicular lymphoblastic leukaemia in this patient was the result of blastic transformation at two independent sites, or whether the testes were seeded from the meninges without identifiable spread to blood and bone marrow.","['Carlsen, N L', 'Erichsen, G', 'Lisse, I']","['Carlsen NL', 'Erichsen G', 'Lisse I']","['Department of Paediatrics, State University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Case Reports', 'Journal Article']",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Antigens, CD/analysis', 'Blast Crisis', 'Bone Marrow/pathology', '*Cell Transformation, Neoplastic', 'Child, Preschool', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/genetics/*pathology', 'Male', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/*pathology', 'Testicular Neoplasms/*pathology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1990 Nov-Dec;10(6):1739-41.,"['0 (Antigens, CD)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tumor-bearing mice received 8 or 16 mg/Kg of DDP dissolved in NS or distilled water (DW) intraperitoneally. Control animals were treated with DW or NS alone. The administration of 8 mg/Kg of DDP+NS produced a significantly better survival (P less than 0.05) compared to that observed in mice receiving DDP+DW. The proportion of long-term survivors was 3.5 times higher in the DDP+NS group (39%) compared to the DDP+DW group (11%). The administration of 16 mg/kg DDP+DW was highly toxic, resulting in early deaths (MST = 5 days) and no long-term survivors. NS protected from DDP toxicity without further improving the survival achieved following the injection of 8 mg/kg DDP+NS. Investigation of platinum pharmacokinetics showed that NS significantly decreases both plasma and tissue concentrations of total platinum, mainly through a decrease in the amount of platinum bound to high molecular weight plasma proteins. HPLC studies indicated that mice receiving 8 mg/kg DDP+NS or DDP+DW fail to show clear differences both in the total ultrafilterable platinum and unchanged DDP in plasma ultrafiltrate. Conversely, mice treated with DDP+NS had higher concentrations of platinum-species in plasma ultrafiltrate than mice receiving DDP+DW. These latter results, together with the observation that NS decreases the amount of platinum bound to plasma proteins, suggest that the effect of NS does not solely depend in vivo on the ability of the chloride ion concentration to stabilize the DDP molecule and suppress the formation of DDP metabolites, but also on its ability to prevent DDP toxicity by reducing the protein binding of DDP aquated products.","['Fulco, R A', 'Vannozzi, M', 'Collecchi, P', 'Merlo, F', 'Parodi, B', 'Civalleri, D', 'Esposito, M']","['Fulco RA', 'Vannozzi M', 'Collecchi P', 'Merlo F', 'Parodi B', 'Civalleri D', 'Esposito M']","['Servizio di Farmacologia Tossicologica, Istituto Nazionale per la Ricerca sul Cancro, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Cisplatin/*pharmacokinetics/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Female', 'Lethal Dose 50', 'Leukemia P388/*drug therapy', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Platinum/analysis', 'Sodium Chloride/*pharmacology', 'Tissue Distribution']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1990 Nov-Dec;10(6):1603-10.,"['451W47IQ8X (Sodium Chloride)', '49DFR088MY (Platinum)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The stimulation of both PMN and HL-60 cells depended on incubation time and temperature, and was significantly suppressed by myeloperoxidase inhibitors. Among chemically defined natural polyphenols, condensed tannins (epicatechin gallate oligomers) and monomeric and oligomeric hydrolyzable tannins potently stimulated PMN iodination, whereas polyphenols of lower molecular weight (gallic acid, alkyl gallates, epicatechin, epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin, caffeic acid derivatives and licorice flavonoids) had much less activity. Various synthetic polyphenolic compounds structurally unrelated to tannins also stimulated PMN iodination depending upon their molecular weight, but to a slightly lesser extent. The results suggest that the stimulation activity of tannins and related polyphenols might depend more on their molecular weights than the number of hydroxyl groups on each benzene ring in the molecule, or the presence of sugars or hexahydroxydiphenoyl groups.","['Sakagami, H', 'Hatano, T', 'Yoshida, T', 'Tanuma, S', 'Hata, N', 'Misawa, Y', 'Ishii, N', 'Tsutsumi, T', 'Okuda, T']","['Sakagami H', 'Hatano T', 'Yoshida T', 'Tanuma S', 'Hata N', 'Misawa Y', 'Ishii N', 'Tsutsumi T', 'Okuda T']","['First Department of Biochemistry, School of Medicine, Showa University, Tokyo, Japan.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Greece,Anticancer Res,Anticancer research,8102988,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Granulocytes/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Iodides/*metabolism', 'Iodine Radioisotopes', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute', 'Molecular Structure', 'Neutrophils/drug effects/*metabolism', 'Structure-Activity Relationship', 'Tannins/*pharmacology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Anticancer Res. 1990 Nov-Dec;10(6):1523-31.,"['0 (Iodides)', '0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)', '0 (Tannins)']",['U01 AI27280/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We present in this preliminary report the early results of therapy for refractory leukemia with an intensive preparative regimen for bone marrow transplantation including etoposide, cytosine arabinoside, cyclophosphamide, and fractionated total body irradiation. Transplantation was done in twenty-three patients with refractory leukemia. Projected survival at 917 days after transplantation in these patients is 43.4% +/- 11%. The survival of these patients so far is similar to the survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia transplanted in second remission.

Subjects were followed up for an average of 15.4 years after diagnosis and were a mean of 22.87 years old at assessment. A sample of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma survivors served as a comparison group. Patients completed standardized measures of well-being, stress reaction, vocational satisfaction, and a questionnaire assessing defensiveness regarding their history of cancer treatment, experienced job discrimination, and social involvement. Overall, the subjects appeared to be well-adjusted; female subjects, however, exhibited an increased tendency to experience anxiety in stressful situations. Vocational discrimination did not appear to be a significant problem for this group of survivors, and subjects exhibited levels of vocational satisfaction that did not differ from population norms. Greater defensiveness regarding a history of cancer treatment was associated with lower levels of well-being and heightened stress reaction. Survivors who received CNS prophylaxis that included cranial irradiation had lower well-being scores than did those survivors receiving only intrathecal methotrexate.","['Zevon, M A', 'Neubauer, N A', 'Green, D M']","['Zevon MA', 'Neubauer NA', 'Green DM']","['Department of Psychology, Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, New York 14263.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"['Adaptation, Psychological/physiology', 'Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Defense Mechanisms', 'Family/psychology', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', '*Job Satisfaction', 'Male', 'Marriage/psychology', 'Personality Inventory', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*psychology/therapy', '*Social Adjustment', 'Stress, Psychological/psychology', 'Surveys and Questionnaires']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199024000-00009 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1990 Winter;12(4):454-61. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199024000-00009.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the etiology of aplastic anemia, it is not known whether these processes are primary factors (causative), perpetuating factors (following other causative factors), or merely epiphenomena. Response to immunosuppressive therapy would suggest a causative or perpetuating role for autoimmunity in development of this disease. We have reviewed trials of immunosuppressive therapy, including the use of antilymphocyte globulin, cyclophosphamide, high-dose corticosteroids, cyclosporine, and apheresis, as well as combinations of these agents, for treatment of aplastic anemia. Responses occur in 40-70% of patients who receive various preparations of antilymphocyte globulin. Responses to other immunosuppressive regimens have been less frequent. Responses to all immunosuppressive regimens are usually incomplete, and late complications, such as relapse, paroxymal noctural hemoglobinuria, or leukemia, are being reported with increasing frequency. For all treatments, potential mechanisms of action other than immune suppression are possible. HLA-matched sibling-donor bone marrow transplantation is the treatment of choice for children with severe aplastic anemia. For children without a matched sibling, antilymphocyte globulin is the best current therapy. No treatment has been shown to alter the long-term course of mild aplastic anemia. Other immunosuppressive agents and transplant regimens should be considered experimental. The therapeutic value of these modalities can only be established by well-monitored trials performed at centers with special clinical and laboratory expertise.","['Camitta, B M', 'Doney, K']","['Camitta BM', 'Doney K']","['Department of Pediatrics, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol,The American journal of pediatric hematology/oncology,7908071,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/*therapy', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal/therapeutic use', 'Antilymphocyte Serum/therapeutic use', 'Blood Component Removal', 'Cyclophosphamide/therapeutic use', 'Cyclosporins/therapeutic use', 'Drug Therapy, Combination', 'Humans', 'Immunosuppressive Agents/*therapeutic use']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1097/00043426-199024000-00005 [doi]'],ppublish,Am J Pediatr Hematol Oncol. 1990 Winter;12(4):411-24. doi: 10.1097/00043426-199024000-00005.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antilymphocyte Serum)', '0 (Cyclosporins)', '0 (Immunosuppressive Agents)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)']","['CA15704/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'CA18221/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'HL36444/HL/NHLBI NIH HHS/United States', 'etc.']",,,,,,,,,,64,,,,,,

On the other hand, children with neuroblastoma had no recycling defect after completing the therapy: their maximal recycling capacity value was 5.6 +/- 0.7. Bone marrow cells in ALL were also depressed in their recycling ability at all stages. Interferon-alpha and IL-2 could enhance NK activity and IL-2 could generate lymphokine-activated killer activity at all stages of ALL; however, the recycling defect hardly improved with these treatments. Thus, NK cells in childhood ALL have a recycling defect as a functional characteristic.","['Yabuhara, A', 'Kawai, H']","['Yabuhara A', 'Kawai H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Shinshu University School of Medicine, Matsumoto, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Pediatr Res,Pediatric research,0100714,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/adverse effects', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cytotoxicity, Immunologic', 'Humans', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Interferon Type I/pharmacology', 'Interleukin-2/pharmacology', 'Killer Cells, Lymphokine-Activated/immunology', 'Killer Cells, Natural/drug effects/*immunology', 'Neuroblastoma/immunology', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*immunology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1203/00006450-199012000-00004 [doi]'],ppublish,Pediatr Res. 1990 Dec;28(6):572-8. doi: 10.1203/00006450-199012000-00004.,"['0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-2)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During the period 1980-1987 we have studied No. 6 patients affected with AILD, three of which showed final evolution into Immunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. Cytogenetic studies, carried out on surgical lymphonodal material with histological diagnosis of AILD and leukemic cells obtained from the peripheral blood at the time of diagnosis, were analysed with IBAS 2000 for a computerized analysis, according to ISCA 1978 criteria. We have found similar translocations in three of our patients with AILD and terminal T-cell immunoblastic lymphoma, occurring between chromosomes 7 and 14 with breakpoints at 7q35 and 14q11. The arising of T-cell lymphoma in patients with AILD seems to be related to the presence of clonal cells with abnormal 7:14 translocation, which represent a very sensible marker of clonality desides of T-cell maturational lineage. In our opinion, the forms of AILD with these cytogenetic aberrations are pre-lymphomatous lesions. On the contrary, the lack of such rearrangements is indicative of non-neoplastic patterns.","['Cosimi, M F', 'Casagranda, I', 'Ghiazza, G', 'Rossi, G', 'Galvani, P']","['Cosimi MF', 'Casagranda I', 'Ghiazza G', 'Rossi G', 'Galvani P']","['Servizio di istologia e di anatomia patologica, Ospedale Civile (USSL 70) di Alessandria.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Italy,Pathologica,Pathologica,0401123,IM,"['*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 7', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Immunoblastic Lymphadenopathy/*genetics/pathology', 'Karyotyping', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*genetics/pathology', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Pathologica. 1990 Jul-Aug;82(1080):391-7.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cytogenetic analysis of this cell line showed 14q+, 18q-, and 8p+q+ marker chromosomes in the absence of t(14;18). Genomic Southern blot analysis showed juxtaposition of the immunoglobulin heavy chain joining region (JH) with chromosome 18 near the minor breakpoint cluster region (mcr) of the bcl-2 gene. There was also a rearranged c-myc gene detectable with a 5' c-myc probe. Molecular cloning studies showed that the c-myc gene was joined to chromosome 18 DNA. Nucleotide sequence analysis of cloned breakpoint DNA revealed that the crossover between chromosomes 8 and 18 occurred at the 3' end of the bcl-2 gene resulting in replacement of the bcl-2 gene on the 14q+ chromosome with the c-myc gene. As a result of this translocation the SU-DUL5 cell line contains no detectable bcl-2 mRNA or protein but has abundant levels of c-myc mRNA.

Treatment with C18PCA (100 mg kg-1, orally) and Ara-C (40 mg kg-1, subcutaneously) was administered on days 1, 3 and 5 after tumor inoculation. The percentage increase in lifespans of the mice treated with C18PCA or Ara-C were 84.4% and 53.9%, respectively. The determination of the plasma Ara-C concentration revealed that the plasma concentration of Ara-C was retained much longer in mice which orally received C18PCA than in those which received Ara-C. By using high-performance liquid chromatography, it was revealed that the deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pools increased gradually but Ara-CTP concentration once increased, then decreased rapidly when Ara-C was administered subcutaneously. On the other hand, both the intracellular deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools and Ara-CTP level increased gradually after oral administration of C18PCA.

The recent discovery of interpatient differences in P450 profile has provided a plausible explanation for heterogeneous dosing requirements for some individual drugs. The heterogeneity in P450 profiles appears to also account for some ""idiosyncratic"" drug reactions, especially hepatotoxicity. An important challenge for the future is the development of safe and noninvasive tests capable of determining patients' P450 profiles. It is likely that such tests will greatly facilitate individualization of dosing of many drugs in the future. In addition, such tests should be useful in identifying patients likely to develop ""idiosyncratic"" toxicity to specific drugs. Finally, it seems likely that interpatient differences in P450 profile may at least in part explain interpatient differences in susceptibility to environmental diseases. For example, it may in the future be possible to identify individuals with P450 profiles that render them susceptible to leukemia from xenobiotics such as benzene. Such individuals could be advised not to work in an environment containing these chemicals or, alternatively, to take a medication which reduces their risk by appropriately altering their P450 profile. Identification and in vitro characterization of human P450s is now well underway and may be largely completed within the next decade.

The technique was effective in detecting changes in mRNA levels in small numbers of HEL cells. Hemin stimulation of HEL cells results in an early increase in myb and c-myc expression and a decrease in c-fos mRNA, while increased PBG-D and alpha-globin expression is not seen until 8 h after hemin treatment. Blast-like cells display expression of c-myc, alpha-globin and PBG-D, while the more differentiated cells give a positive response to both c-fos and myb. During HEL cell differentiation, the mechanism of hemin stimulation appears to be through the up regulation of myb and c-myc mRNA and down regulation of c-fos.

The markers were a unique rearrangement of T-cell receptors, the integration sites of the retrovirus and rearrangements in the Pim-1 oncogene. A mixture of two cell lines (1:1) injected into intact Balb/C mice usually produced a monoclonal tumor originating from one cell line. In most cases, the cell lines that were aggressive in vivo were also dominant in mixing experiments in vitro. In some lines, we could correlate the aggressiveness of the tumor to its superior growth rate and lower requirement for serum factors in vitro.

Tamoxifen, an oestrogen antagonist, has been given in some patients with CLL and Hodgkin's disease, with dramatic response in single cases. Until now, ER status has been assessed using a steroid binding assay (SBA) which has many inherent problems. Recently, the development of monoclonal antibodies directed against ER has been applied to the study of breast carcinomas and results obtained show good correlation with the quantitative SBA. We studied 49 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) using immunostaining of cytospin preparations. In 30 of these cases ER enzyme immunoassay (ER-EIA) was also performed. Cultured MCF-7 cells, derived from a pleural effusion of a breast cancer patient, known to contain high levels of ER were used as a positive control (40-48% ER positive cells by immunocytochemistry; 200 fmol/mg protein by EIA). All of the CLL cases except two (96%) were negative for ER (less than 1% staining; less than 4 fmol/mg protein). The two positive cases expressed granular ER staining over the nucleus (9.2 and 12.1% positive cells) and were positive by EIA and SBA. It is concluded that (i) patients with CLL rarely express ER and (ii) immunocytochemical staining of cytospin preparations is a valid technique for the measurement of ER.

Antibodies to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibited the differentiation-stimulating activity of CM, indicating that this activity is due to the presence of TNF in CM. TNF added to non-conditioned medium was as effective as CM in stimulating ML-1 cell differentiation. In the presence of a low (0.12 ng/ml) concentration of TPA, TNF-induced maturation was synergistically increased and Type I macrophages were formed. With higher (1-10 ng/ml) TPA concentrations, Type II macrophages were also obtained. As the TNF/TPA concentration increased, ML-1 cell differentiation was increasingly inhibited. Mature cells derived from ML-1 cells were found to secrete TNF at concentrations ranging from less than 2 U/ml to greater than 180 U/ml, the amount depending upon the number of cells and the stage of cell maturation. These results indicate that TNF participates in the regulation of precursor cell maturation. Low concentrations of TNF produced by small numbers of mature cells stimulate differentiation, whereas high concentrations of TNF generated by elevated numbers of macrophages inhibit the maturation process, possibly in combination with other cytokines. Because TNF serves as a competence factor for ML-1 cells, (Guan X.-P., Takuma T., Hromchak R. & Bloch A. (1990) Competence and progression in cell differentiation. Proc. Am. Assoc.

An alternative hypothesis is proposed which assumes that, for childhood cases of ALL, infections are competing causes of death and for juvenile myeloid leukemia (JML) the principal competitor is the sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The SIDS association is the result of JML originating in undifferentiated (erythro-myeloid) stem cells and having faulty erythropoiesis as a side effect.

These data suggest that the nucleobases compete with 6-thiopurines for the ribose-phosphate donor, 5'-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate, thus preventing the formation of active metabolites of 6-thiopurines.","['Hashimoto, H', 'Kubota, M', 'Shimizu, T', 'Takimoto, T', 'Kitoh, T', 'Akiyama, Y', 'Mikawa, H']","['Hashimoto H', 'Kubota M', 'Shimizu T', 'Takimoto T', 'Kitoh T', 'Akiyama Y', 'Mikawa H']","['Department of Pediatrics, Kyoto University, Japan.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Leuk Res,Leukemia research,7706787,IM,"['2-Aminopurine/analogs & derivatives/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Adenine/*pharmacology', 'Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency', 'Antineoplastic Agents/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/deficiency', 'Hypoxanthines/*pharmacology', 'Inosine Monophosphate/analogs & derivatives/biosynthesis', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/enzymology/metabolism/*pathology', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/enzymology/metabolism/pathology', 'Mercaptopurine/*antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Thioguanine/antagonists & inhibitors/pharmacokinetics', 'Thionucleotides/biosynthesis', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/enzymology/metabolism']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/0145-2126(90)90120-x [doi]'],ppublish,Leuk Res. 1990;14(11-12):1061-6. doi: 10.1016/0145-2126(90)90120-x.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Hypoxanthines)', '0 (Thionucleotides)', '131-99-7 (Inosine Monophosphate)', '2TN51YD919 (Hypoxanthine)', '452-06-2 (2-Aminopurine)', '49P95BAU4Z (2,6-diaminopurine)', '76CK4YA5ZP (thioinosinic acid)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.4.2.7 (Adenine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'JAC85A2161 (Adenine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We have analyzed biochemical properties of p53 in two different cell lines derived from patients with ALL or ANLL. p53 was found in elevated levels in both leukemic cell lines compared to unstimulated or stimulated normal lymphocytes. High levels of p53 in these cell lines are due to an extended stability of p53 protein rather than to different rates of synthesis. p53 from both cell lines formed low- and high-molecular weight oligomers which revealed that p53 exists in a heterogenous population in these tumor cells. The presence of immunologically different subsets of p53 was demonstrated by sequential immunoprecipitation experiments with different p53 specific monoclonal antibodies. Our results showed structural and immunological variabilities of p53 in cell lines derived from human tumors and may thus provide an insight into the role p53 may play in human malignancies.,"['Kraiss, S', 'Espig, R', 'Vetter, U', 'Hartmann, W', 'Montenarh, M']","['Kraiss S', 'Espig R', 'Vetter U', 'Hartmann W', 'Montenarh M']","['Department of Biochemistry, University of Ulm, F.R.

The canine PBLs rapidly produced the active oxygen in parallel with the number of cells when PBLs were cocultured with canine leukemia-derived CL-1 cells as target cells. Cytolysis of the target cells and active oxygen production were inhibited linearly by the addition of benzoic acid and n-propyl gallate as hydroxyl radical scavenger. However, superoxide dismutase and tiron which are scavengers of superoxide anion did not inhibit the cytotoxicity so much at low concentrations that inhibited the induction of luminol-dependent chemiluminescence.

The parent compound, cDDP, preferentially inhibited DNA synthesis. The RNA synthesis was elevated, whereas protein synthesis was unaffected after two or three daily ip doses. Radiolabeled drug studies demonstrated cellular uptake and binding of cDDP derivatives to the DNA molecule. cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cDDP) treatment resulted in DNA strand scission after a single dose, but caused cross-linking of DNA strands after two or three ip doses. There was an accumulation of deoxynucleoside triphosphates [d(NTP)s] on day 2 and 3, indicating that incorporation of nucleotides into the DNA strand had been blocked. Thymidine kinase, thymidine monophosphate kinase, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, and aspartate transcarbamoylase activities were inhibited in vivo after three doses of cDDP at 1.5 mg/kg/day. However, only the inhibition of a cytoplasmic preparation of DNA polymerase alpha by cDDP appeared to be directly related to the inhibition of DNA synthesis and the accumulation of d(NTP) pool levels. Thus, the primary target for cDDP appears to be DNA itself, although direct inhibition of DNA polymerase alpha may play a minor role in the inhibition of DNA replication by cDDP.","['Oswald, C B', 'Chaney, S G', 'Hall, I H']","['Oswald CB', 'Chaney SG', 'Hall IH']","['Division of Medicinal Chemistry and Natural Products, School of Pharmacy, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 27599.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,J Pharm Sci,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2985195R,IM,"['Animals', 'Cisplatin/analogs & derivatives/metabolism/*pharmacology', 'DNA Polymerase II/metabolism', 'DNA, Neoplasm/*biosynthesis/drug effects', 'Leukemia P388/*metabolism', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Neoplasm Proteins/biosynthesis', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Subcellular Fractions/enzymology/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured/drug effects/metabolism']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['S0022-3549(15)48368-6 [pii]', '10.1002/jps.2600791006 [doi]']",ppublish,J Pharm Sci. 1990 Oct;79(10):875-80. doi: 10.1002/jps.2600791006.,"['0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', 'EC 2.7.7.7 (DNA Polymerase II)', 'Q20Q21Q62J (Cisplatin)']",['CA34082/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The results demonstrated that, in the majority of patients who failed to respond to alpha-IFN, HC showed an immunological phenotype characterized by positivity with the CD5 monoclonal antibody which is usually absent on HC and characteristically expressed on B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. In fact, among the 10 HCL patients who presented with this phenotype, only 5 partial remissions (PR) and 5 minor responses (MR) were achieved, as opposed to the 3 complete remissions (CR), 19 PR and 3 MR observed in the 25 CD5-negative patients.

Preliminary results.,29-31,"Since December 1987, 115 patients with HCL have been enrolled in a prospective multicenter study to evaluate the role of splenectomy after an induction therapy with alpha interferon. The group of patients was divided into two categories: those younger and those older than 65 years. The schedule of treatment with IFN was, respectively, 1.8 MU/sm/daily and 1.0 MU/daily, 33 patients were treated with r-alpha-2a, 34 with r-alpha-2b, and 25 with alpha-Ly. To date, 92 patients are fully evaluable. The response was assessed every 3 months by bone marrow trephine biopsy. Patients in CR continued IFN therapy for 3 months and, if they were still in CR, could undergo an optional splenectomy. Patients in PR continued therapy for 12 months and subsequently were randomized for splenectomy or observation only. In these preliminary results of an ongoing protocol, CR was obtained in 5 cases (6%), PR in 59 (64%), MR in 25 (27%), NR in 3 (3%). Only 2 of the 5 patients in CR underwent splenectomy and are still in CR. Of the 59 patients in PR, only 15 completed 12 months of therapy. 9 patients in Group A were randomized, 4 were splenectomized and 5 were in the observation arm. All patients were splenectomized safely and no complications occurred. These preliminary results suggest that splenectomy could be effective in consolidating the response obtained with IFN.","['Damasio, E E', 'Federico, M', 'Frassoldati, A', 'Lamparelli, T', 'Annino, L', 'Bernasconi, C', 'Chisesi, T', 'Foa, R', 'Lauria, F', 'Pagnucco, G']","['Damasio EE', 'Federico M', 'Frassoldati A', 'Lamparelli T', 'Annino L', 'Bernasconi C', 'Chisesi T', 'Foa R', 'Lauria F', 'Pagnucco G', 'et al.']","['Divisione Ematologia I, Ospedale San Martino, Genova, Italy.']",['eng'],"['Clinical Trial', 'Journal Article', 'Multicenter Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",England,Eur J Haematol Suppl,European journal of haematology.

Diffuse changes of the background activity were observed in 64% of the children at the time of diagnosis. During induction and reinduction treatment with vincristine and L-asparaginase, and with some delay after CNS irradiation, a marked slowing developed in up to 65% of patients. Children who had not been irradiated showed transient disturbances during treatment with medium-dose-methotrexate. Reinduction induced more abnormal EEGs in the children who had been irradiated. At the end of maintenance therapy, only slight EEG changes were found. No differences between the irradiated and non-irradiated group were then seen. Children with CNS leukaemia or seizures differed from those with an uncomplicated treatment in that they more often showed focal and persistent disturbances. In 39 patients who stayed in first remission for at least 18 months after the termination of treatment, a follow up investigation was performed. From the EEG examination, including power spectral analysis, no differences were found between irradiated and non-irradiated patients. Slowing of the dominant frequency was seen in the patients with more severe leukaemia and in those whose EEG had been markedly abnormal at diagnosis. The visually evoked potentials were normal in all groups of patients. In the brainstem auditory evoked potential, a prolongation of the latency of wave I and a decrease of the I-V interval was found in irradiated patients. We conclude that the diffuse EEG changes frequently emerging during treatment are reversible. Persistent or lateralized changes can indicate a neurological complication.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Korinthenberg, R', 'Igel, B']","['Korinthenberg R', 'Igel B']","['Universitatskinderklinik, Fakultat fur Klinische Medizin Mannheim, Universitat Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],Germany,Eur J Pediatr,European journal of pediatrics,7603873,IM,"['Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Cranial Irradiation', '*Electroencephalography', '*Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem', '*Evoked Potentials, Visual', 'Female', 'Follow-Up Studies', 'Humans', 'Male', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*physiopathology/radiotherapy']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF02072055 [doi]'],ppublish,Eur J Pediatr. 1990 Dec;150(2):127-31. doi: 10.1007/BF02072055.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Translocation breakpoints in APL patients provide physical landmarks that suggest an approach to isolating the APL gene(s). Genetic and physical maps constructed for the APL breakpoint region on chromosome 17 have indicated that two fully-linked DNA markers, defining loci for THRA1 and D17S80, map to opposite sides of an APL breakpoint yet reside on a common 350-kb Clal fragment. Cosmid-walking experiments to clone this APL breakpoint have revealed a 38-kilobase deletion on chromosome 17.

This expression is associated with terminal cell differentiation because incubation of HL-60 cells with an agent or condition that causes suppression of growth but not induction of differentiation does not result in expression of the PC. At concentrations of 5-15 nM, the purified PC inhibited the growth of HL-60 cells and THP-1 cells, as well as other cell types belonging to different cell lineages. This growth inhibition was preceded by a reduction in [32P]phosphate incorporation and, at the higher PC concentrations, was associated with a reduction in [3H]thymidine, [3H]uridine, and [32S]methionine incorporation. The specific expression pattern and growth-inhibitory character of the PC suggests that the complex may have a role in suppressing cell growth during monomyelocytic terminal differentiation induced by specific chemical stimuli and during physiological and pathological events associated with monomyelocytic cell functions.","['Murao, S', 'Collart, F', 'Huberman, E']","['Murao S', 'Collart F', 'Huberman E']","['Biological and Medical Research Division, Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois 60439.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",United States,Cell Growth Differ,Cell growth & differentiation : the molecular biology journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,9100024,IM,"['Calcium-Binding Proteins/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Calgranulin A', 'Calgranulin B', 'Casein Kinases', 'Cell Differentiation/physiology', 'DNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis', 'Growth Inhibitors/*biosynthesis', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*metabolism', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*metabolism', 'Methionine/metabolism', 'Neoplasm Proteins/*biosynthesis/physiology', 'Phosphates/metabolism', 'Protein Kinase Inhibitors', 'RNA, Neoplasm/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Ribonucleotides/metabolism', 'Thymidine/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured', 'Uridine/metabolism']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cell Growth Differ. 1990 Oct;1(10):447-54.,"['0 (Calcium-Binding Proteins)', '0 (Calgranulin A)', '0 (Calgranulin B)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Growth Inhibitors)', '0 (Neoplasm Proteins)', '0 (Phosphates)', '0 (Protein Kinase Inhibitors)', '0 (RNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Ribonucleotides)', 'AE28F7PNPL (Methionine)', 'EC 2.7.11.1 (Casein Kinases)', 'VC2W18DGKR (Thymidine)', 'WHI7HQ7H85 (Uridine)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present work it has been shown that in AH-130 hepatoma and K562 leukemia cells the antibiotic, at low concentration, decreases ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) levels. The change depends on two summative effects of the drug, impairment of overall protein synthesis and inhibition of enzyme activity. Some analogs of calvatic acid have been tested in order to gain more insight into the structure-activity relationship. The decarboxylated derivative phenylazoxycyanide proved to be more effective in reducing protein synthesis and ODC activity in the whole tumor cells. The rapidly growing K562 cells displayed high sensitivity to this compound.

The risk of nasal cancer associated with exposure to leather dust, which had already been stressed at the beginning of the 1970's, was confirmed in recent studies. However, a decreasing trend of RR was observed among shoe industry workers. The excess of leukemia among shoe workers, which was mainly based on the description of numerous cases of acute myeloblastic leukemia, has also been confirmed by two cohort studies carried out in Italy and the U.K. In addition to the evident increase in these two diseases, there are indications of an excess of cancer of other sites among leather and shoe workers, particularly bladder cancer, both among workers assigned to leather finishing operations and in leather goods and shoe production workers. Another interesting result is the excess of lung cancer among tannery workers. This evidence is unanimous in the studies carried out in Italy but is not supported by the majority of studies performed in other countries. For this reason, we consider it extremely important to carry out a multicentric study in Italy, with particular attention to the definition of occupational exposures to carcinogens. There are also other isolated reports of excesses of other cancers in the shoe and leather industries but in our opinion they are of dubious interpretation.","['Seniori Costantini, A', 'Merler, E', 'Saracci, R']","['Seniori Costantini A', 'Merler E', 'Saracci R']","['Centro per lo Studio e la Prevenzione Oncologica U.O.

Tax does not bind DNA specifically but, rather, acts in a more indirect manner. Tax activation of the HTLV-I LTR is mediated through constitutively expressed cellular factors that bind to cAMP response elements (CREs) present within the 21-bp enhancers of the LTR. In contrast, Tax transactivation of the interleukin-2 receptor-alpha gene (IL-2R alpha) and LTR of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) involves the induced nuclear expression of NF-kappa B. We now report the identification of missense mutations within the tax gene that functionally segregate these two pathways of trans-activation. Additionally, we demonstrate that the carboxyl terminus of the Tax protein, despite its acidic and predicted alpha-helical structure, is completely dispensable for trans-activation through either of these transcription factor pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that mutations within a putative zinc finger domain disrupt the nuclear localization of Tax and abolish trans-activation. These results demonstrate that Tax trans-activation of viral and cellular promoters involves at least two mechanisms of host transcription factor activation and suggest that this activation is likely mediated through distinct functional domains.","['Smith, M R', 'Greene, W C']","['Smith MR', 'Greene WC']","['Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Department of Medicine, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina 27710.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Genes Dev,Genes & development,8711660,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Cell Line', 'Enhancer Elements, Genetic', 'Exons', 'Fluorescent Antibody Technique', 'Gene Products, tax/analysis/*genetics', '*Genes, pX', 'Human T-lymphotropic virus 1/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Mutagenesis, Site-Directed', 'Phenotype', '*Repetitive Sequences, Nucleic Acid', '*Transcription, Genetic', 'Transcriptional Activation', 'Transfection', 'Zinc Fingers']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1101/gad.4.11.1875 [doi]'],ppublish,Genes Dev. 1990 Nov;4(11):1875-85. doi: 10.1101/gad.4.11.1875.,"['0 (Gene Products, tax)']",,,,,,,,"['Genes Dev 1991 Jan;5(1):150', 'Genes Dev 1995 Sep 15;9(18):2324']",,,,,,,,,

Treatment of undifferentiated HL-60 cells with microtubule-disrupting agents alone was found to induce apoptosis en masse in these cells. In contrast, disruption of microfilaments did not induce apoptosis; instead these cells underwent necrosis, the pathological mode of cell death. Apoptosis in response to microtubule disruption in HL-60 cells was characterized by cell shape changes, nuclear condensation followed by fragmentation and the separation of the cell into numerous intact fragments, termed apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis of these cells was further confirmed by DNA analysis, which demonstrated the activation of an endogenous endonuclease which cleaved the DNA of these cells into oligonucleosomal fragments. Microtubule disrupting agents were found to exert these effects over a wide range of doses. Apoptosis was also inducible in HL-60 cells, in a dose-dependent manner, by the calcium ionophore A23187. Since microtubules are known to be highly sensitive to intracellular calcium fluctuations, this suggests that calcium influx could act at the microtubule level in effecting apoptosis.","['Martin, S J', 'Cotter, T G']","['Martin SJ', 'Cotter TG']","[""Department of Biology, St Patrick's College, Kildare, Ireland.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Cell Tissue Kinet,Cell and tissue kinetics,0174107,IM,"['Actin Cytoskeleton/drug effects', 'Calcimycin/pharmacology', 'Cell Survival/drug effects/*physiology', 'DNA Damage', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/pathology', 'Microtubules/drug effects/*physiology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2184.1990.tb01345.x [doi]'],ppublish,Cell Tissue Kinet. 1990 Nov;23(6):545-59. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2184.1990.tb01345.x.,['37H9VM9WZL (Calcimycin)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Laboratory investigations have shown responsiveness of enriched haemopoietic precursors in vitro to the proliferative and granulocytic differentiative stimuli of G-CSF, generally without increased clonal regeneration. To date, five short-term phase I/II clinical trials using GM-CSF have demonstrated that 38 of 45 treated patients had improvements in neutrophil counts, 14 had increased reticulocyte counts, with three of these patients having decreased red blood cell transfusion requirements, and eight had a transient increase in platelets. In 12 patients an increase in marrow and/or peripheral blood blasts was noted. Seven patients progressed to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), particularly patients with greater than 15% marrow blasts. In a longer term study, five patients received GM-CSF for two to nine weeks, although only one maintained increased neutrophil counts, one developed antibodies to GM-CSF and one's condition evolved into AML. Eighteen patients have been treated for two months in phase I/II clinical trials with G-CSF, 16 of whom had normalization of neutrophil counts with improved marrow maturation, five had increased reticulocyte counts with three having decreased transfusion requirements, four had transient increases in blasts and no substantial changes in platelet counts were noted. Eleven patients have received maintenance therapy with G-CSF for 6-16 months and 10 had persistent increases in neutrophil counts with enhanced marrow myeloid maturation. Decreased infectious episodes were noted in these patients at times at neutrophil improvements. Four of the 18 patients have subsequently developed AML after 6-16 months. Both CSFs were well tolerated, although the incidence of fever, myalgias and bone pain was more prominent in patients receiving GM-CSF at higher doses. In vitro correlates with these in vivo results were demonstrated as laboratory studies showed that G-CSF had greater myeloid differentiative and less proliferative effects for MDS marrow than did GM-CSF. Marrow cytogenetic studies after treatment generally indicated persistence of the initial normal and/or abnormal clones. These studies have demonstrated that both G-CSF and GM-CSF improve neutrophil counts in a high proportion of patients with MDS and that chronic administration of G-CSF elicits persistent neutrophil responses and may decrease infections. Phase III controlled trials are required to determine whether the natural history of this disorder will be altered by use of colony stimulating factors.","['Greenberg, P L', 'Negrin, R', 'Nagler, A']","['Greenberg PL', 'Negrin R', 'Nagler A']","['Hematology Division, Stanford University School of Medicine, CA 94305.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S."", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S."", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,IM,"['Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/*therapy']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1990;9(1):199-212.,['0 (Hematopoietic Cell Growth Factors)'],['CA36915/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,34,,,,,,

Haemopoiesis in AML is clonal; a characteristic cell population (blast cells) has been identified and can be grown in culture. The population is organized as a hierarchy, headed by self-renewing stem cells. Several control mechanisms affect the behaviour of these stem cells. Two classes of regulatory receptors are identified that act by ligand-receptor interaction; in one class the receptors are intracellular, in the other they are in the cell membrane. It is proposed that the many regulatory signals received by blast cells contribute to a genetically determined regulatory milieu that sets the probabilities of blast stem cell renewal and differentiation. Interactions have been identified between regulatory mechanisms and the responses of blast stem cells to chemotherapeutic agents. It is suggested that new therapeutic options are emerging, based on the exploitation of regulatory mechanisms in conjunction with chemotherapy.","['McCulloch, E A', 'Minden, M D', 'Curtis, J E']","['McCulloch EA', 'Minden MD', 'Curtis JE']","['Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",United States,Cancer Surv,Cancer surveys,8218015,IM,"['Antineoplastic Agents/therapeutic use', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Growth Substances/physiology/*therapeutic use', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/physiopathology/*therapy']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Surv. 1990;9(1):169-98.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Growth Substances)']",,,,,,,,,,,166,,,,,,

We studied the procoagulant activity (PCA) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and some components of the plasma fibrinolytic system in 10 children with ALL undergoing remission induction therapy which includes L-asp. Mononuclear cells obtained 14 days after starting L-asp treatment generated significantly higher amounts of PCA (identified as tissue factor) than cells isolated before the first dose of L-asp and 7 days after the cessation of L-asp administration (p less than 0.01). Augmented PCA coincided with an increase in the plasma D-dimer. The plasma levels of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor were found significantly elevated during L-asp therapy (p less than 0.05), whereas plasminogen levels were markedly decreased (p less than 0.05). These findings suggest that, during the course of L-asp treatment, the coagulation-fibrinolysis balance is shifted towards promotion of fibrin formation and deposition.

To model the stepwise mutation or loss of both p53 alleles during tumorigenesis, a human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, was used that completely lacked endogenous p53. Single copies of exogenous p53 genes were then introduced by infecting cells with recombinant retroviruses containing either point-mutated or wild-type versions of the p53 cDNA sequence. Expression of wild-type p53 suppressed the neoplastic phenotype of Saos-2 cells, whereas expression of mutated p53 conferred a limited growth advantage to cells in the absence of wild-type p53. Wild-type p53 was phenotypically dominant to mutated p53 in a two-allele configuration. These results suggest that, as with the retinoblastoma gene, mutation of both alleles of the p53 gene is essential for its role in oncogenesis.","['Chen, P L', 'Chen, Y M', 'Bookstein, R', 'Lee, W H']","['Chen PL', 'Chen YM', 'Bookstein R', 'Lee WH']","['Department of Pathology, School of Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla 92093-0612.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Science,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",0404511,IM,"['Alleles', 'Base Sequence', '*Cinnamates', 'Cloning, Molecular', 'DNA/genetics', 'Drug Resistance/genetics', 'Genes, p53/*genetics', 'Genetic Vectors', 'Humans', 'Hygromycin B/analogs & derivatives', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Moloney murine leukemia virus/genetics', 'Mutation', 'Neomycin', 'Osteosarcoma/*genetics', 'Plasmids', 'Transfection', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/12/14 00:00,1990/12/14 00:01,['1990/12/14 00:00'],"['1990/12/14 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/14 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/14 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1126/science.2274789 [doi]'],ppublish,Science. 1990 Dec 14;250(4987):1576-80. doi: 10.1126/science.2274789.,"['0 (Cinnamates)', '3XQ2233B0B (Hygromycin B)', '3YJY415DDI (hygromycin A)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'I16QD7X297 (Neomycin)']","['CA51495/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY00278/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States', 'EY05758/EY/NEI NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is an active hemorheological agent used for the treatment of defective microcirculation. The use of the anticancer agent vincristine is limited by its toxicity to normal body tissues. The data presented in the present paper show that it is possible to achieve greater cell-kill by using vincristine in combination with pentoxifylline. The effect of pentoxifylline alone and in combination with vincristine was studied using membrane filtration technique in P388 leukemia (P388) and its subline P388/DOX resistant to doxorubicin and cross-resistant to vincristine. Pentoxifylline (100 mumol/l) had minimal inhibitory effect on DNA biosynthesis in P388 leukemia cells. Vincristine, at the concentration employed in this study did not show significant inhibition of DNA biosynthesis confirming multidrug resistant nature of P388/DOX cells. Pentoxifylline had a dose-sparing effect, wherein it enhanced the antiproliferative activity of vincristine at a clinically achievable concentration. The studies on reversibility of inhibition of DNA biosynthesis in P388/DOX cells pretreated with vincristine and pentoxifylline showed the irreversible nature of the effect of combination of vincristine and pentoxifylline.

The studies reported here were aimed at more effectively coupling proliferation-arrest and differentiation-induction in a human myeloblastic leukemia cell line (ML-1). This was accomplished by using reduced serum conditions in conjunction with a differentiation-inducing agent: cells were first incubated in reduced serum [0.3% fetal bovine serum (FBS)] instead of standard conditions (7.5% FBS) and, second, exposed to 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA). The effects of this protocol were as follows: first, cell proliferation was slowed and cells accumulated in G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle; this occurred with only a minimal decrease in viability [to approximately 88-92% (0.3% FBS) from greater than or equal to 96% (7.5% FBS)]. Second, the induction of differentiation was accelerated; this allowed the time of exposure to TPA to be decreased. Acceleration of induction was very pronounced when cells were maintained in 0.3% FBS both before and during exposure to TPA, with TPA at concentrations above the minimum sufficient for induction but below those causing significant cytotoxicity; as little as 1 hour of TPA exposure resulted in near-maximal induction (approximately 80%) with this protocol, compared to the greater than or equal to 1 day required with previous standard protocols. In sum, conditions that slow ML-1 cell proliferation (0.3% FBS) enhance TPA-induced differentiation, substantially narrowing the time frame of induction; these conditions should be useful for studying the molecular mechanisms that underlie the induction process.","['Kozopas, K M', 'Buchan, H L', 'Craig, R W']","['Kozopas KM', 'Buchan HL', 'Craig RW']","['Department of Physiology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Cell Physiol,Journal of cellular physiology,0050222,IM,"['Cell Cycle', '*Cell Differentiation/drug effects', '*Cell Division/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Culture Media', 'DNA, Neoplasm/analysis', 'Gene Expression', 'Humans', 'Insulin/pharmacology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Transferrin/pharmacology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1002/jcp.1041450326 [doi]'],ppublish,J Cell Physiol. 1990 Dec;145(3):575-86. doi: 10.1002/jcp.1041450326.,"['0 (Culture Media)', '0 (DNA, Neoplasm)', '0 (Insulin)', '0 (Transferrin)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This cell line will not grow long term in any other cytokine although it responds slightly to IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, and interferon-gamma. We have used the M-07e subline to develop a quantitative bioassay for the measurement of levels of either GM-CSF or IL-3. This assay is as sensitive to either factor as the human bone marrow colony assay (CFU-GM) or the chronic myelogeneous leukemic (CML) blast cell proliferation assay for these factors and is much more convenient and reliable than either. With this assay, as little as 25-50 pg/ml of either IL-3 or GM-CSF can be detected, a level that should render the assay useful for analysis of these molecules in samples from patients undergoing colony-stimulating factor therapy and from conditioned media from natural sources of the factors. In these cases, neutralizing antisera to each cytokine are required to demonstrate the specificity of the assay.

Several associations have been found with consistency: paternal exposures in hydrocarbon-associated occupations, the petroleum and chemical industries, and especially paint exposures have been associated with brain cancer; paint exposures have also been linked to leukemias. Maternal exposures have received much less attention, but studies have yielded strongly suggestive results linking a variety of occupational exposures to leukemia and brain cancer.

In contrast, the translocation breakpoints on the Ph1 chromosome are scattered in ALL, so that other methods such as PFGE and PCR are necessary to detect the Ph1 chromosome.

The modified PCR (using cDNA from mRNA) can be used to detect the Ph1 chromosome and to define which of the molecular subtypes are present.

Genetic studies have progressed from karyotyping to detection of genetic changes within genes. The methods described in this chapter are still at an early stage of development and, so far, have provided relatively little in the way of an extension of available diagnostic information. Sometimes the methods provide extensions to existing techniques, for example by the detection of bcr rearrangements in patients who have CML or ALL but do not have a detectable Philadelphia chromosome. Another example is retrospective diagnosis of gene rearrangements using DNA from slide preparations. However, it should be noted that it has only very recently been shown that there is likely to be a causal relationship between the Ph chromosome and leukaemia. Daley et al (1990) induced CML in mice by bone marrow transplantation of cells infected with a retrovirus encoding P210bcr/abl and Heisterkamp et al (1990) produced mice transgenic for a BCR/ABL P190 DNA construct and showed that the progeny died of acute leukaemia (mostly ALL). We have not summarized studies of the incidence of activated oncogenes such as RAS in leukaemia and myelodysplasia. Such oncogenes appear to be involved in many tumours and may well indicate either a predisposition to cancer or a particular stage of malignancy, but their analysis does not at present help in making a diagnosis.

The aberrations are either primary, meaning that they contribute to the establishment of the neoplasm, or secondary, in which case they are acquired during the clonal evolution and malignization of the neoplastic cells. The abnormalities are non-randomly distributed; the aberration pattern differs from disease to disease and sometimes is so characteristic that individual rearrangements may be virtually pathognomonic for particular neoplasms. The cytogenetic characterization of haematological malignancies is of two-fold importance. First, the recurrent aberrations provide us with an insight into the pathogenetic mechanisms that are operative. They pinpoint those areas of the human genome that carry genes or regulatory sequences whose function is disturbed in leukaemias and lymphomas. Using DNA recombinant techniques in addition to chromosome-level investigations of these cancer-associated rearrangements, the molecular pathology of leukaemias and lymphomas is now gradually being unravelled. Second, even before the long-term goal of a more fundamental understanding of the neoplastic process is reached, the cytogenetic aberrations have a direct clinical importance. The finding of an acquired, clonal chromosome abnormality in haematopoietic cells (-Y in old men is an exception) means that the patient has a neoplastic disease. Often, but by no means always, the type of aberration is also informative as to which type of neoplasm is present. During therapy, remission and relapse can be monitored by cytogenetic analyses. Finally, the karyotypic pattern influences prognosis and may thus be taken into account when the choice of therapy is made.","['Heim, S']",['Heim S'],,['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",England,Baillieres Clin Haematol,Bailliere's clinical haematology,8800474,IM,"['Chromosome Aberrations', 'Chromosome Disorders', 'Hematologic Diseases/*genetics', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/genetics', 'Lymphoma/genetics', 'Myelodysplastic Syndromes/genetics', 'Myeloproliferative Disorders/genetics']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80141-6 [doi]'],ppublish,Baillieres Clin Haematol. 1990 Oct;3(4):921-48. doi: 10.1016/s0950-3536(05)80141-6.,,,,,,,,,,,,102,,,,,,

N4-OH-dCMP was not a substrate (no dihydrofolate produced; no tritium released with 5-3H-labeled molecule), and its inactivation of TS was methylenetetrahydrofolate-dependent, hence mechanism-based, with arrest of a step posterior to addition of cofactor and blocking abstraction of the C(5) hydrogen. Ki values for N4-OH-dCMP and its 5-fluoro analogue were in the range 10(-7) - 10(-8) M, 2-3 orders of magnitude higher for the corresponding N4-OMe analogues. The 5-methyl analogue of N4-OH-dCMP was 10(4)-fold less potent, pointing to the anti rotamer of the imino form of exocyclic N4-OH, relative to the ring N(3), as the active species. This is consistent with weaker slow-binding inhibition of the altered enzyme from 5-FdUrd-resistant, relative to parent, L1210 cells by both FdUMP and N4-OH-dCMP, suggesting interaction of both N4-OH and C(5)-F groups with the same region of the active center. Kinetic studies with purified enzyme from five sources, viz., Ehrlich carcinoma, L1210 parental, and 5-FdUrd-resistant cells, regenerating rat liver, and the tapeworm Hymenolepis diminuta, demonstrated that addition of a 5-fluoro substituent to N4-OH-dCMP increased its affinity from 2- to 20-fold for the enzyme from different sources.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","['Rode, W', 'Zielinski, Z', 'Dzik, J M', 'Kulikowski, T', 'Bretner, M', 'Kierdaszuk, B', 'Ciesla, J', 'Shugar, D']","['Rode W', 'Zielinski Z', 'Dzik JM', 'Kulikowski T', 'Bretner M', 'Kierdaszuk B', 'Ciesla J', 'Shugar D']","['Nencki Institute of Experimental Biology, Academy of Sciences, Warszawa, Poland.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Binding Sites', 'Binding, Competitive', 'Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor/enzymology', 'Deoxycytidine Monophosphate/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology', 'Deoxyuracil Nucleotides/pharmacology', 'Fluorodeoxyuridylate/pharmacology', 'Hymenolepis/enzymology', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210/enzymology', 'Liver/enzymology', 'Liver Regeneration', 'Mice', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*enzymology', 'Rats', 'Thymidylate Synthase/*antagonists & inhibitors/metabolism', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/12/04 00:00,1990/12/04 00:01,['1990/12/04 00:00'],"['1990/12/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/04 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00500a017 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1990 Dec 4;29(48):10835-42. doi: 10.1021/bi00500a017.,"['0 (Deoxyuracil Nucleotides)', '1032-65-1 (Deoxycytidine Monophosphate)', '114333-22-1 (N(4)-hydroxy-5-fluorodeoxycytidine monophosphate)', '134-46-3 (Fluorodeoxyuridylate)', ""2277-58-9 (N-4-hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidylic acid)"", ""964-26-1 (2'-deoxyuridylic acid)"", 'EC 2.1.1.45 (Thymidylate Synthase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was identified by HPLC (C18 reversed-phase silica gel; acetic acid/CH3OH) as the slower of two closely spaced components in DL,L-MTX-Ala prepared previously by a different route [Kuefner et al. (1989) Biochemistry 28, 2288-2297]. The L,L diastereomer was hydrolyzed by pancreatic carboxypeptidase A (to yield MTX and Ala) twice as rapidly as the DL,L mixture. Analysis of the latter by HPLC established that the slower component was hydrolyzed to MTX and that the unreactive, faster component was D,L-MTX-Ala. DL,L-MTX-Arg was resolved by HPLC (NH4OAc/CH3CN) into two closely spaced components, and the diastereomers were partially separated by chromatography on DEAE-Trisacryl (H2O----2% NH4HCO3). Serum carboxypeptidase N hydrolyzed only the slower HPLC component (to yield MTX and Arg), thereby identifying it as the L,L diastereomer. When tested for cytotoxicity against L1210 cells, L,L-MTX-Arg (ID50 = 1.6 X 10(-8) M) was more effective than the D,L diastereomer (ID50 = 2.2 X 10(-7) M). Treatment of MTX with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), followed by hydrolysis of the NHS ester, led to racemization in the L-glutamate moiety of MTX as shown by the fact that the product was hydrolyzed by carboxypeptidase G2 (at the pteroate-Glu bond) only to the extent of ca. 50% compared to the untreated control. These observations have a broad significance, since coupling agents are employed extensively in the derivatization of MTX for attachment to affinity supports and monoclonal antibodies.","['Kuefner, U', 'Esswein, A', 'Lohrmann, U', 'Montejano, Y', 'Vitols, K S', 'Huennekens, F M']","['Kuefner U', 'Esswein A', 'Lohrmann U', 'Montejano Y', 'Vitols KS', 'Huennekens FM']","['Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, Research Institute of Scripps Clinic, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Animals', 'Antineoplastic Agents/*chemical synthesis', 'Cell Survival/drug effects', 'Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid', 'Hydrolysis', 'Indicators and Reagents', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia L1210', 'Methotrexate/*analogs & derivatives/chemical synthesis/chemistry/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Stereoisomerism']",1990/11/20 00:00,1990/11/20 00:01,['1990/11/20 00:00'],"['1990/11/20 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/20 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/20 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00498a017 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1990 Nov 20;29(46):10540-5. doi: 10.1021/bi00498a017.,"['0 (Antineoplastic Agents)', '0 (Indicators and Reagents)', '116819-28-4 (methotrexate-alpha-alanine)', '129921-89-7 (methotrexate-alpha-arginine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",['CA-39836/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Almost 50% of five year survivors of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia died of recurrent disease during the corresponding 15 years, a large proportion of deaths being due to central nervous system relapse in an era before central nervous system prophylaxis was routinely given. Comparison of the mortality observed with that expected from mortality rates in the general population indicated three times the expected number of deaths from non-neoplastic causes. Five times the expected number of deaths from cardiovascular causes were observed, these were predominantly myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular accidents. There was no evidence of an excess in the number of suicides observed, but there were three times the expected number of deaths from accidents observed after central nervous system tumours. Two groups of patients were identified whose deaths were potentially avoidable. Seven patients with craniopharyngioma and panhypopituitarism presented with addisonian crises during periods of stress not adequately covered by exogenous corticosteroids. In the other group were children who received radiotherapy and later developed problems related to radiation fibrosis. We emphasize that our investigation relates to patients diagnosed with childhood cancer before 1971. The pattern of mortality that will emerge after recent treatment regimens, in which chemotherapy is being used more extensively, is likely to be different from that observed in our study.","['Hawkins, M M', 'Kingston, J E', 'Kinnier Wilson, L M']","['Hawkins MM', 'Kingston JE', 'Kinnier Wilson LM']","['Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Arch Dis Child,Archives of disease in childhood,0372434,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Adult', 'Cardiovascular Diseases/mortality', 'Cause of Death', 'Humans', 'Neoplasm Metastasis', 'Neoplasms/*mortality/therapy', 'Neoplasms, Multiple Primary/mortality', 'Time Factors', 'United Kingdom/epidemiology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/adc.65.12.1356 [doi]'],ppublish,Arch Dis Child. 1990 Dec;65(12):1356-63. doi: 10.1136/adc.65.12.1356.,,,,,,PMC1793098,,,,,,,,,,,,

With respect to the course of disease during and after immunotherapy, the in vitro findings may very well explain the in vivo observations in the two patients (D.E.F., B.O.R.) with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL) who were treated with MoAb anti-id. After initial tumour reduction, there was a recurrence of tumour cells with altered functional and phenotypic properties. In both cases the recurring tumour cells still expressed the same idiotype. In one patient (D.E.F.) the phenotypic changes (a surface Ig change from IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgD to weakly positive IgM and IgD) and functional changes (a 10-fold increase in [3H]thymidine uptake and a decreased idiotype secretion in vitro), together with the in vivo findings with respect to the course of disease--at relapse an impressive tumour regrowth rate with constant serum idiotype level--suggest that immunoselection might have taken place favouring the survival and relapse of a less mature, more aggressive tumour cell population with a lower idiotype expression. In the second patient (B.O.R.), the phenotypic changes (an isotype change from IgM and IgD to IgM with the loss of IgD, and a gradual decrease in expression of CD19 and CD24) and functional changes (a 10-fold increase of idiotype secretion in vitro), together with the in vivo finding that the serum idiotype level had increased 25-fold compared with the preimmunotherapy serum level with comparable tumour load, strongly suggest an immunotherapy-induced differentiation of the malignant B cell. We also describe an increased expression of CD74, detected by MoAb BoM22, on the recurring tumour cells of patient B.O.R., whereas the expression of HLA-DP, -DQ and -DR did not change.

The present investigation is mainly a methodological study focusing on some of the major issues and uncertainties involved in calculating such excess lifetime risks and related risk projection methods. The age-constant relative risk model used in the recent analyses of the cancer mortality that was observed in the follow-up of the cohort of A-bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is used to describe the effect of the exposure on the cancer mortality. In this type of model the excess relative risk is constant in age-at-risk, but depends on the age-at-exposure. Calculation of excess lifetime risks usually requires rather complicated life-table computations. In this paper we propose a simple approximation to the excess lifetime risk; the validity of the approximation for low levels of exposure is justified empirically as well as theoretically. This approximation provides important guidance in understanding the influence of the various factors involved in risk projections. Among the further topics considered are the influence of a latent period, the additional problems involved in calculations of site-specific excess lifetime cancer risks, the consequences of a leveling off or a plateau in the excess relative risk, and the uncertainties involved in transferring results from one population to another. The main part of this study relates to the situation with a single, instantaneous exposure, but a brief discussion is also given of the problem with a continuous exposure at a low-dose rate.","['Vaeth, M', 'Pierce, D A']","['Vaeth M', 'Pierce DA']","['Aarhus Universitet, Afdeling for Teoretisk Statistik, Denmark.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Environ Health Perspect,Environmental health perspectives,0330411,IM,"['Age Factors', 'Cause of Death', 'Cohort Studies', 'Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Japan/epidemiology', 'Leukemia, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Life Expectancy', 'Life Tables', 'Male', 'Neoplasms, Radiation-Induced/mortality', 'Radiation Injuries/mortality', '*Risk']",1990/07/01 00:00,1990/07/01 00:01,['1990/07/01 00:00'],"['1990/07/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/07/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/07/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1289/ehp.908783 [doi]'],ppublish,Environ Health Perspect. 1990 Jul;87:83-94. doi: 10.1289/ehp.908783.,,,,,,PMC1567825,,,,,,,,,,,,

(2) Protein having thymosin activity (F5) was isolated from thymic cytosols after heat inactivation, salt fractionation and desalting on Sephadex G25. Molecular weights of all the proteins were determined on SDS-PAGE. Biological activity of thymic proteins was studied by in vitro and in vivo assays, using synthetic thymosin alpha 1 as the standard. Thymocytes treated with different thymic proteins showed maximum stimulation at 16 h of incubation period. Preincubation of the thymocytes with the thymic proteins and subsequent incubation with Con-A decreased the stimulation index. Incubation of spleen lymphocytes with thymic proteins increased the percentage of Tdt+ cells. The antitumor effects of thymic proteins carried out on animals having leukemia, showed statistically significant results.

The original LBN AML is sensitive to the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide (CY). Recently, a CY-resistant cell line of LBN AML has been established. To characterize this animal model of human leukemia better, we analyzed and compared the chromosomal makeup of both the CY-sensitive and CY-resistant LBN AML lines. The CY-sensitive LBN AML cultures contained two cell lines--line I (88%): 41,XX,-1,-2,-9,del(12)(q16), + der(1)t(1;?8)(p13;q31), + der(2)t(2;9)(p11;q11); and line II (12%): 41,XX,-1,-2,-9,del(12),del(20)(q13) + der(1)t(1;?8)(p13;q31), + der(2)t(2;9)(p11;q11).

Recent studies have shown that the 19p13 genes E2A and LYLl, both of which encode helix-loop-helix proteins, lie at two different translocation breakpoints in acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). The E2A gene is involved by the t(1;19)(q23;p13) in acute pre-B-cell leukemias and the LYL1 gene is structurally altered by a t(7;19)(q34;p13) in T-cell ALL. To assess the role of these genes in other leukemia-associated translocations we mapped their locations with respect to the t(11;19)(q23;p13) and t(4;19)(q21;p13) translocation breakpoints carried by T-ALL cell lines SUP-T13 and SUP-T8a, respectively. In situ hybridization studies indicated that the E2A and LYL1 genes are physically distinct from the t(4;19) and t(11;19) breakpoints. Using these and other 19p13 translocation breakpoints as landmarks, we established a partial physical map of 19p: 19pter-E2A-INSR-LYL1-[t(4;19)]-19cen.

The inhibition was greater than that produced by a similar quantity of Fe-transferrin. Preincubation of cells for 6 h with either Al-transferrin or Fe-transferrin diminished the number of surface transferrin receptors by about 40% compared with cells preincubated with apo-transferrin. Al-transferrin did not compete significantly with Fe-transferrin for transferrin receptors and, when cells were preincubated for 15 min instead of 6 h, the inhibitory effect of Al-transferrin on receptor expression was lost. Both forms of transferrin also decreased the level of transferrin receptor mRNA by about 50%, suggesting a common regulatory mechanism. Aluminium citrate had no effect on iron uptake or transferrin-receptor expression. AlCl3 also had no effect on transferrin-receptor expression, but at high concentration it caused an increase in iron uptake by an unknown, possibly non-specific, mechanism. Neither Al-transferrin nor AlCl3 caused a significant change in cell proliferation. It is proposed that aluminium, when bound to transferrin, inhibits iron uptake partly by down-regulating transferrin-receptor expression and partly by interfering with intracellular release of iron from transferrin.","['McGregor, S J', 'Naves, M L', 'Oria, R', 'Vass, J K', 'Brock, J H']","['McGregor SJ', 'Naves ML', 'Oria R', 'Vass JK', 'Brock JH']","['University Department of Bacteriology and Immunology, Western Infirmary, Glasgow, Scotland, U.K.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Biochem J,The Biochemical journal,2984726R,IM,"['Aluminum/*pharmacology', 'Biological Transport/drug effects', 'Cell Line', 'Humans', 'Iron/*metabolism', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive', 'RNA, Messenger/drug effects/*genetics', 'Receptors, Transferrin/drug effects/*genetics', 'Transferrin/*metabolism/*pharmacology']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1042/bj2720377 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochem J. 1990 Dec 1;272(2):377-82. doi: 10.1042/bj2720377.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Receptors, Transferrin)', '0 (Transferrin)', '0 (aluminum-transferrin)', 'CPD4NFA903 (Aluminum)', 'E1UOL152H7 (Iron)']",,,,,PMC1149710,,,,,,,,,,,,

The magnitude of maintenance chemotherapy as a prognostic factor in the survival of patients with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia].,81-7,"In previous papers we have shown that malnutrition is an adverse prognostic factor in the outcome of treatment in patients with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The reason why undernourished children do poorly as compared with well nourished children is that malnourishment leads to a diminished bone marrow reserve thus making necessary to delivery of suboptimal doses of maintenance chemotherapy (less than that calculated according to body surface). Undernourished children receive less 6-MP and MTX and relapse more frequently in the bone marrow, finally reflecting a 5 yr disease-free survival of 26% as compared with 83% in well-nourished children (p less than 0.001). In this paper we have analyzed the impact of the variable delivery of sub-optimal doses of maintenance chemotherapy in a group of 43 pediatric patient with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The 5 year disease free survival of children receiving suboptimal maintenance chemotherapy was 7% as compared with 65% for those receiving full doses of both 6-MP and MTX (p less than 0.001), and more frequent relapse involving the bone marrow in children receiving low doses (71% versus 3%, p = 0.000005). The impact of the variable suboptimal doses of chemotherapy was present in children with both normal and deficient nourishment status. It is concluded that the delivery of suboptimal doses of maintenance chemotherapy, due to bone marrow toxicity related to an abnormal myelopoietic reserve, is an adverse prognostic factor in the outcome to treatment of patients with lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Lobato-Mendizabal, E', 'Ruiz-Arguelles, G J']","['Lobato-Mendizabal E', 'Ruiz-Arguelles GJ']","['Hospital Universitario de Puebla, Mexico.']",['spa'],['Journal Article'],Mexico,Rev Invest Clin,Revista de investigacion clinica; organo del Hospital de Enfermedades de la Nutricion,9421552,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/administration & dosage/adverse effects/*therapeutic use', 'Bone Marrow Diseases/etiology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Infant', 'Male', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Mexico/epidemiology', 'Nutrition Disorders/*complications', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/complications/drug therapy/*mortality', 'Prognosis', 'Prospective Studies', 'Remission Induction', 'Survival Rate']",1990/04/01 00:00,1990/04/01 00:01,['1990/04/01 00:00'],"['1990/04/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/04/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/04/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Rev Invest Clin. 1990 Apr-Jun;42(2):81-7.,"['E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)']",,,Leucemia y desnutricion.

Recently, evidence pointing to a role for the Rb gene in the differentiation of certain human cell types has been presented. We have studied three mouse cell lineages to determine whether there is a correlation between Rb gene expression and differentiation. We find that induction of mouse erythroleukemia cell differentiation with either dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) or hexamethylene bisacetamide (HMBA) leads to increased expression of Rb mRNA. Increased expression of Rb mRNA was also found in S2 myoblasts induced by mitogen depletion to become differentiated myotubes. In the B-cell lineage, Rb expression is low in pre-B and B cell lines but high in plasmacytomas, which represent late stages of B cell differentiation. Thus, in all three lineages (erythroid, muscle, and B-cell) late stages of differentiation are associated with increased amounts of Rb mRNA.","['Coppola, J A', 'Lewis, B A', 'Cole, M D']","['Coppola JA', 'Lewis BA', 'Cole MD']","['Department of Biology, Princeton University, New Jersey 08544-1014.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,Oncogene,Oncogene,8711562,IM,"['Acetamides/pharmacology', 'Animals', 'B-Lymphocytes/metabolism/pathology', 'Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Dimethyl Sulfoxide/pharmacology', 'Embryo, Mammalian', '*Gene Expression', 'Genes, Retinoblastoma/*genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/metabolism/pathology', 'Mice', 'Muscles/cytology/metabolism', 'Phosphorylation', 'Plasmacytoma/metabolism', 'RNA, Messenger/biosynthesis/genetics', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Oncogene. 1990 Nov;5(11):1731-3.,"['0 (Acetamides)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', 'LA133J59VU (hexamethylene bisacetamide)', 'YOW8V9698H (Dimethyl Sulfoxide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We identify five hypersensitive (HS) sites within the abnormal BCR/ABL allele in K562 cells in a pattern different from the normal BCR. The pattern of hypersensitivity is modified when the cells undergo hemin induced differentiation. These results indicate that the normal BCR has a chromatin configuration consistent with active transcription and that the BCR/ABL fusion gene chromatin is different.

We have proposed that unphosphorylated Op18 plays a role in cellular proliferation, and that its phosphorylated forms, namely Op18a and Op18b, are associated with diminished cell proliferation. In this study, we report that in neuroblastoma tumors, the phosphorylation of Op18 was substantially diminished with increasing N-myc gene copy number. Treatment of the neuroblastoma cell line SMS-KCNR, which contains 75 copies of the N-myc gene, with retinoic acid for ten days resulted in an increase in Op18 phosphorylation.

Nurses, as health professionals, must understand helpful coping methods for mothers who have chronically ill children. Based on this knowledge, nurses can develop appropriate nursing intervention strategies, and so help the mothers to develop effective ways of coping and give support to mothers with chronically ill children in process of coping with this grief. The research questions guiding this research were: 1. what type of grief does the mother have at the time of child's diagnosis and at present? 2. what are the problems confronting the mother? 3. what are the coping patterns of the mother? 4. is there a difference according to child's diagnosis in the mother's grief and coping pattern? Ths subject for this study were obtained by taking a convenience sample of 120 mothers with a chronically ill child. Interviews took place in four medical school hospitals and one medical center in Seoul from March 19th to May 16th 1990. The tools used in this study were Mcfarlan's (1983), Grief contents, Folkman & Lazarus (1983), Ways of Coping and Hymovich's (1983) the Chronicity Impact and Coping Instrument. The findings were as follows; 1. Grief items had a maximum score of three points. The highest item scores at the time of diagnosis, were in order, heart broken, talkative, and could not do anything, at the present, 'talkative', 'heart broken' and 'busy myself with other things'. 2. The problems confronting the mothers were 'worry about ill child's future', 'her responsibilities in taking care of the ill child.' 3. Most of the mothers used similar ways of coping, that is 'problem focused coping', 'detachment', 'wishful thinking', 'seeking social support' and 'focusing on the positive and hardly any of them used 'tension reduction'. 4. There was a significant difference in coping methods according to the child's diagnosis, leukemia, cancer hemophillia and nephrotic syndrome. The most frequently used coping method was detachment, especially for the mother of the child with. 5. At the time of diagnosis there was a positive correlation between the level of grief and the coping method of detachment and seeking social support.","['Han, J S', 'Oh, K']","['Han JS', 'Oh K']",,['kor'],"['English Abstract', 'Journal Article']",Korea (South),Taehan Kanho,Taehan kanho.

VM-26 has been found to be considerably more potent than VP-16 in vitro in a number of investigations. Although the drugs have been known for greater than 20 years, they have not been compared at clearly defined equitoxic doses on an optimal schedule in vivo and it has not been clarified as to whether a therapeutic difference exists between them. A prolonged schedule is optimal for both drugs; accordingly we determined the toxicity in mice using a 5-day schedule. The dose killing 10% of the mice (LD10) was 9.4 mg/kg daily (95% confidence limits, 7.4-11.8) for VP-16 and 3.4 (2.5-4.5) mg/kg daily for VM-26. In vitro, we found VM-26 to be 6-10 times more potent than VP-16 in a clonogenic assay on murine tumors P388 and L1210 leukemia and Ehrlich ascites. This pattern was also demonstrated in a multidrug-resistant subline of Ehrlich selected for resistance to daunorubicin (Ehrlich/DNR+), as it was 30 times less sensitive than Ehrlich cells to both VP-16 and VM-26. Using 90%, 45%, and 22% of the LD10 on the same murine tumors in vivo, we found that the effect of the two drugs was equal as evaluated by both the increase in life span and the number of cures. The drugs were also compared in nude mice inoculated with human small-cell lung cancer lines OC-TOL and CPH-SCCL-123; however, they were more toxic to the nude mice and only a limited therapeutic effect was observed. In conclusion, the complete cross-resistance between the two drugs suggests that they have an identical antineoplastic spectrum. VM-26 was more potent than VP-16 in vitro; however, this was not correlated to a therapeutic advantage for VM-26 over VP-16 in vivo.","['Jensen, P B', 'Roed, H', 'Skovsgaard, T', 'Friche, E', 'Vindelov, L', 'Hansen, H H', 'Spang-Thomsen, M']","['Jensen PB', 'Roed H', 'Skovsgaard T', 'Friche E', 'Vindelov L', 'Hansen HH', 'Spang-Thomsen M']","['Department of Oncology, Finsen Institute, Copenhagen, Denmark.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Animals', 'Drug Evaluation', 'Drug Resistance', 'Etoposide/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Male', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred DBA', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/drug therapy', 'Teniposide/*pharmacology/therapeutic use/toxicity', 'Tumor Stem Cell Assay']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685712 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;27(3):194-8. doi: 10.1007/BF00685712.,"['6PLQ3CP4P3 (Etoposide)', '957E6438QA (Teniposide)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Clonogenic assays showed that the IC50 value for a 1-h exposure to PFM was 4 microM for aerobic cells and 0.5 microM for hypoxic cells. After a 1-h exposure to concentrations of 1, 5, and 10 microM [14C]-PFM, the accumulation of total radioactivity in hypoxic cells was 10 to 20 times that in aerobic cells. The disposition of radioactivity in cells that had been treated for 1 h with 5 microM PFM under aerobic or hypoxic conditions showed that (a) under either condition, internal free-PFM concentration equalled the external drug concentration; (b) DNA-, RNA-, and protein-bound radioactivity were at least 10 times greater in hypoxic cells than in aerobic cells; and (c) known metabolites and unidentified radioactive products were also generated in greater amounts in hypoxic cells than in aerobic cells. Thus, the increased amounts of radioactivity accumulated by hypoxic P388 cells after exposure to [14C]-PFM resulted from the accumulation of nonexchangeable protein and nucleic-acid adducts and metabolites rather than free PFM. Determinations of DNA adducts formed in P388 cells revealed five possible adducts: (1) N2-(2'-deoxyguanosyl)-7-methylaminomitosene, (2) a second monofunctional PFM-guanine adduct, (3) a PFM cross-linked dinucleotide, (4) possibly a nucleoprotein-related adduct, and (5) an unknown.

HL-60 subclones that lack the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) can also be induced to differentiate with purine analogs. Mechanisms by which purine analogs induce differentiation offer unique possibilities for cancer chemotherapy. We have studied the effect of the purine analog 6-ethylmercaptopurine (e6MP) on the growth and induction of differentiation in both wild-type and HGPRT-deficient HL-60 cells. We have previously shown that e6MP inhibits cell growth in both wild-type and HGPRT-deficient HL-60 cells without activation through salvage pathways. In this report we evaluate the effect of e6MP on c-myc mRNA expression. c-Myc mRNA, which is amplified in HL-60 cells, has been shown to play a role in the induction of granulocytic differentiation in HL-60 cells. e6MP transiently down-regulates c-myc mRNA in wild-type cells but has no effect on c-myc mRNA expression in HGPRT-deficient HL-60 cells. Despite the differential effects of e6MP on c-myc mRNA, both wild-type and HGPRT-deficient HL-60 cells appear to engage in terminal differentiation. The morphological changes and nonspecific esterase activity induced by e6MP suggest differentiation down the monocytic pathway. However, early monocytic markers such as the rapid induction of c-fos and the stabilization of c-fms mRNA are not observed. In addition, e6MP inhibits TPA-induced monocytic/macrophage differentiation as characterized by stabilization of c-fms mRNA and cellular adherence.","['French, B T', 'Patrick, D E', 'Grever, M R', 'Trewyn, R W']","['French BT', 'Patrick DE', 'Grever MR', 'Trewyn RW']","['Comprehensive Cancer Center, Ohio State University, Columbus 43210.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",Germany,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol,Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology,7806519,IM,"['Cell Differentiation/drug effects', 'Gene Expression/*drug effects', 'Genes, fms', '*Genes, myc', 'Humans', 'Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase/*deficiency', 'Leukemia, Promyelocytic, Acute/*genetics/pathology', 'Mercaptopurine/*analogs & derivatives/pharmacology/therapeutic use', 'RNA, Messenger/analysis', 'Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate/pharmacology', 'Tumor Cells, Cultured']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1007/BF00685709 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Chemother Pharmacol. 1990;27(3):171-7. doi: 10.1007/BF00685709.,"['0 (RNA, Messenger)', '5417-84-5 (6-ethylthiopurine)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 2.4.2.8 (Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase)', 'NI40JAQ945 (Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate)']",['P30-CA-16058-15/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States'],,,,,,,,,,,['c-myc'],,,,,

The breakpoint, 11q23, coincides with the ets-1 oncogene locus. However, only very few studies have been done to verify the genomic alteration and transposition of ets-1 in the t(11;19) chromosomal rearrangement. In the present study, we identified the t(11;19)(q23;p13) translocation in two acute leukemic cases. One of the cases, biphenotypic leukemia, has been followed thoroughly. An abnormal karyotype was identified in the patient's blood and marrow samples at diagnosis and at relapse, while only normal karyotypes were identified at remission. In situ hybridization of chromosomal preparations with the ets-1 probe pHE5.4 resulted in silver grains nonrandomly localized to 19p13 in the metaphase spreads prepared from the blood sample taken at relapse, while no detectable grains were found on chromosome 19p13 in a sample taken at remission. To determine if genomic alterations of ets-1 are associated with this translocation, Southern blot hybridizations with the pHE5.4 probe were performed on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) isolated from blood or marrow samples of the patient at remission and relapse as well as on DNA from a disease-free normal control. Any DNA digested with AvaII, SstI, XbaI, and Bam HI, followed by hybridization with pHE5.4, demonstrated no genomic alterations or amplification of the ets-1 oncogene. Our study indicates that the ets-1 oncogene is transposed in the t(11;19) translocation without detectable alteration at the DNA level. The absence of ets-1 amplification in t(11;19) and its presence in the t(4,11) and t(9;11) translocations demonstrated by others suggests the possible existence of different molecular mechanisms involving the ets-1 oncogene in the pathogenesis of these leukemias.","['Wang, N', 'Cedrone, E', 'Dry, J', 'Skuse, G R', 'Schwartz, C', 'Terryberry, S']","['Wang N', 'Cedrone E', 'Dry J', 'Skuse GR', 'Schwartz C', 'Terryberry S']","['Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester School of Medicine, NY 14642.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Cancer Genet Cytogenet,Cancer genetics and cytogenetics,7909240,IM,"['Blotting, Southern', 'Child', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11', '*Chromosomes, Human, Pair 19', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Karyotyping', 'Leukemia/*genetics', 'Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute/*genetics', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', '*Proto-Oncogenes', '*Translocation, Genetic']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['0165-4608(90)90180-I [pii]', '10.1016/0165-4608(90)90180-i [doi]']",ppublish,Cancer Genet Cytogenet. 1990 Dec;50(2):199-205. doi: 10.1016/0165-4608(90)90180-i.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leu-13 density, determined by flow cytometry, was upregulated in vitro and in vivo by IFN-alpha on malignant B cells from patients with HCL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and prolymphocytic leukemia. Monoclonal anti-Leu-13 triggered homotypic aggregation of leukemic B cells via an adhesion pathway that was not inhibited by antibodies to leukocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) or intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Moreover, anti-Leu-13 potentiated the inhibitory effects of IFN-alpha on BCGF-stimulated DNA synthesis, assessed by [3H]-thymidine and [3H]-deoxyadenosine incorporation into DNA.

In this paper we describe the purification and characterization of an anionic (p class) form of the enzyme from the peripheral blood of patients with acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myeloid leukaemia, and acute lymphocytic leukaemia and the spleen of a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. We present evidence that the form of enzyme purified closely resembles pi class glutathione S-transferase purified from human placenta. Immunoblotting performed on cytosol from the leukaemic cells from a range of cases of leukaemia at presentation, or on treatment, demonstrated that this form of glutathione S-transferase was the predominant isoenzyme expressed in all cases studied. However, in the limited number of cases studied there was no correlation between the level of expression and response to chemotherapy, suggesting that increased expression of pi class GST is not the sole cause of resistance to bifunctional alkylating agent in human leukaemias.","['Hall, A', 'Foster, S', 'Proctor, S J', 'Cattan, A R']","['Hall A', 'Foster S', 'Proctor SJ', 'Cattan AR']","['University Department of Haematology, Medical School, University of Newcastle upon Tyne.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Aged', 'Drug Resistance/physiology', 'Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel', 'Female', 'Glutathione Transferase/*isolation & purification/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoblotting', 'Isoelectric Focusing', 'Leukemia/drug therapy/*enzymology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07906.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Dec;76(4):494-500. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb07906.x.,['EC 2.5.1.18 (Glutathione Transferase)'],,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

IL-1 also stimulated cell growth in two out of three cases with no evidence of autonomous growth whereas no additional stimulation was observed in two cases with totally autonomous growth. In blast cells stimulated by IL-1, synthesis of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was increased and the proliferative response to IL-1 was inhibited by an antibody to GM-CSF. In all samples with evidence of autonomous growth, blast cell conditioned medium (BCCM) contained IL-1 activity (range 0.7-74.2 units ml) and a polyclonal antibody to IL-1 markedly inhibited autonomous growth in four samples. BCCM from three of these four samples contained GM-CSF, the synthesis of which was suppressed when BCCM was prepared in the presence of anti-IL-1.

These are due to an excessive osteoclastic resorption in association with a low bone formation, as demonstrated by bone histomorphometry. Conversely, B-cell malignancies other than MM are rarely associated with lytic bone lesion and/or hypercalcaemia. In this study we have analysed quantitative bone histology in 65 patients with B-cell malignancies other than MM at diagnosis: chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL, n = 20), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 25), Waldenstrom's disease (WD, n = 14), hairy cell leukaemia (HCL, n = 6). Fifty patients presented no clinical evidence of increased bone resorption, including no lytic bone lesions radiologically detectable and/or no hypercalcaemia. 80% of these patients (40/50) had increased bone resorption parameter using quantitative bone histology, including 19/29 (65.5%) patients with CLL or WD and 21/21 (100%) patients with NHL or HCL (P less than 0.01). As a control group, seven patients lacking bone marrow involvement on bone sample presented no excessive bone resorption. However, eight patients presented lytic bone lesions and/or hypercalcaemia. All of these patients had increased resorption parameters with high numbers of osteoclasts per surface trabecular bone (mean = 35.3), as opposed to the patients lacking lytic bone lesions and/or hypercalcaemia (mean = 6.6, n = 28) and to normal individuals (mean +/- SD = 3.8 +/- 1.7 and 6.3 +/- 2.6, respectively before and after 60 years). In all the cases, excessive histologic bone resorption was mediated by mononuclear small osteoclasts (mean osteoclast length +/- SD = 27.3 +/- 4.1 as compared to normal range = 35.0 +/- 1.0, P less than 0.001). In different in vitro models, these small mononuclear osteoclasts are considered as progenitors.

The kinetic measurements using DNA alkaline elution methodology were obtained in mouse L1210 cells treated with mechlorethamine (HN2), phenylalanine mustard (L-PAM), uracil mustard (UM), 6-methyl-UM, and quinacrine mustard (QM). The ISC or DPC challenge delivered to cells was gauged on the basis of the kinetics as either total ISC or DPC produced, or as the area under the lesions versus time curve (AUC). By either measure (excepting QM), ISC correlated well with loss of colony survival, whereas DPC did not. The ISC/DPC ratio may therefore be a useful index of lesion selectivity. This ratio was significantly greater for 6-methyl-UM than for HN2. The ratio was also greater for L-PAM than for HN2 but only when gauged by AUC; this was attributable to an unusually slow rate for ISC removal in the case of L-PAM. The preferential reaction of UM at some 5'-GC-3' sites in purified DNA had suggested that UM might produce ISC with increased efficacy. UM, however, was somewhat less efficacious in ISC production than was 6-methyl-UM, which lacked selectivity for alkylation at 5'-GC-3'. QM was the only compound that produced detectable SSB, and the SSB were so numerous that ISC could not be quantitated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","[""O'Connor, P M"", 'Kohn, K W']","[""O'Connor PM"", 'Kohn KW']","['Division of Cancer Treatment, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],United States,Cancer Commun,Cancer communications,8916730,IM,"['Animals', 'Colony-Forming Units Assay', 'Computer Simulation', '*Crossing Over, Genetic', '*DNA Damage', 'In Vitro Techniques', 'Leukemia L1210/*drug therapy', 'Mechlorethamine/pharmacology', 'Melphalan/pharmacology', 'Mice', 'Nitrogen Mustard Compounds/*pharmacology', 'Quinacrine Mustard/pharmacology', 'Uracil Mustard/analogs & derivatives/pharmacology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.3727/095535490820873949 [doi]'],ppublish,Cancer Commun. 1990;2(12):387-94. doi: 10.3727/095535490820873949.,"['0 (Nitrogen Mustard Compounds)', '1LY7UH1WUT (chloroethylaminouracil)', '4213-45-0 (Quinacrine Mustard)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', 'Q41OR9510P (Melphalan)', 'W7KQ46GJ8U (Uracil Mustard)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Early invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is responsible for non-specific pneumonia. Thoracic CT scan and fiberoptic bronchoscopy are informative investigations. At recovery of bone marrow aplasia, the occurrence of hemoptysis and the discovery of excavated lesions on roentgenograms are suggestive of the diagnosis. Cerebral aspergillosis should be routinely considered whenever neurologic symptoms develop in a patient with agranulocytosis, fever, and pneumonia.

Since colony stimulating factors (CSFs) play an essential role in hematopoietic cell growth, toxicity from CAP metabolites could also involve interaction with CSF or CSF-producing cells. In the present study, we found that increasing concentrations of rhGM-CSF or rhG-CSF completely reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP (2 x 10(-4) M) on human CFU-GM growth and on the growth of KG-1 cells. GM-CSF also reversed the inhibitory effect of CAP on HL-60 cells. Inhibition by DH-CAP (50% at 5 x 10(-7) M), nitroso-CAP (NO-CAP) (60% at 5 x 10(-6) M) and NPAP (35% at 10(-5) M) was not affected by either CSF. In addition to their inhibitory effect on cell growth, DH-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) and NO-CAP (5 x 10(-6) M) inhibited CSF production by buffy coat cells 50-70% without affecting cell viability. Neither CAP nor NPAP inhibited CSF production. It is suggested that the dual toxic-inhibitory effect of some intestinal metabolites of CAP such as DH-CAP on hematopoietic cell growth on the one hand, and on CSF production on the other, renders them very potent as potential mediators of CAP induced aplastic anemia.","['Jimenez, J J', 'Jimenez, J G', 'Daghistani, D', 'Yunis, A A']","['Jimenez JJ', 'Jimenez JG', 'Daghistani D', 'Yunis AA']","['Dept.

In contrast to the genes encoding the transplantation antigens, the Qa and Tla genes show very little polymorphism. Function(s) of the proteins encoded by the Qa and Tla loci remain an enigma. Recently, the protein products of the Qa and Tla loci, often referred to as class Ib major histocompatibility complex molecules, have been proposed to present antigen to gamma delta T cells. In mice, gamma delta T cells have been found concentrated in several epithelial barriers and in the skin; yet, expression of serologically detectable Tla antigens is believed restricted to thymocytes, activated T lymphocytes, and some T-cell leukemias. Here we report that luminal epithelial cells of the mouse small intestine express the thymus leukemia antigen (TLA). We also find that, unlike T cells in Peyer's patches, a significant fraction of intestinal epithelial lymphocytes also express TLA. RNA prepared from intestinal cells contains transcripts of the T18d gene, which encodes TLA. These data extend the known expression profile of TLA molecules to mature lymphocytes and to nonhematopoietic cells. These data also demonstrate the specific expression of TLA on antigen-presenting cells in a site enriched for T cells that express gamma delta T-cell antigen receptor.","['Hershberg, R', 'Eghtesady, P', 'Sydora, B', 'Brorson, K', 'Cheroutre, H', 'Modlin, R', 'Kronenberg, M']","['Hershberg R', 'Eghtesady P', 'Sydora B', 'Brorson K', 'Cheroutre H', 'Modlin R', 'Kronenberg M']","['Department of Microbiology and Immunology, University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine 90024.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,7505876,IM,"['Animals', 'Antibodies, Monoclonal', 'Antigens, Neoplasm/*genetics', 'Epithelium/immunology', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Gene Expression', 'Intestine, Small/*immunology', 'Major Histocompatibility Complex', 'Membrane Glycoproteins/analysis/*genetics', 'Mice', 'Mice, Inbred BALB C', 'Mice, Inbred Strains', 'Phenotype', 'Polymerase Chain Reaction', 'Thymus Gland/*immunology', 'Transcription, Genetic']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1073/pnas.87.24.9727 [doi]'],ppublish,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 1990 Dec;87(24):9727-31. doi: 10.1073/pnas.87.24.9727.,"['0 (Antibodies, Monoclonal)', '0 (Antigens, Neoplasm)', '0 (Membrane Glycoproteins)', '0 (thymus-leukemia antigens)']","['CA 45956/CA/NCI NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 07198/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States', 'GM 08042/GM/NIGMS NIH HHS/United States']",,,,PMC55246,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the present paper, we compare the analysis of induced small-colony TK mutants with gross aberration analysis (the more classical approach to analyzing chromosomal damage). Data are presented for 34 mutagens. As expected, we find that while the induction of gross aberrations and the induction of small-colony TK mutants is correlated, there is no simple mathematical relationship between the two endpoints. The two markers evaluate different subpopulations of chromosome mutations. While either endpoint can be used to detect chromosomal mutations, it should be remembered that the small-colony TK mutants represent genetic events which are compatible with cell viability. Only those alterations compatible with cell viability are a significant risk for human carcinogenicity or mutagenicity.","['Moore, M M', 'Doerr, C L']","['Moore MM', 'Doerr CL']","['Genetic Toxicology Division, US Environmental Protection Agency, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.""]",England,Mutagenesis,Mutagenesis,8707812,IM,"['Animals', 'Cell Line', '*Chromosome Aberrations', 'Leukemia L5178/enzymology/genetics', 'Lymphoma/enzymology/genetics', 'Mice', 'Mutagenicity Tests', 'Mutagens/*pharmacology', '*Mutation', 'Thymidine Kinase/deficiency/*genetics']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1093/mutage/5.6.609 [doi]'],ppublish,Mutagenesis. 1990 Nov;5(6):609-14. doi: 10.1093/mutage/5.6.609.,"['0 (Mutagens)', 'EC 2.7.1.21 (Thymidine Kinase)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In spite of direct inhibition against the catalytic domain of protein kinase C, cytotoxicity of UCN-01 was much lower than that of staurosporine. In addition, UCN-01 showed more selective inhibitory activity against protein kinase C than did staurosporine because of the sole structural difference at C-7.

Frozen sections of trephine biopsy specimens from iliac crests were stained for endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity, endogenous acid phosphatase activity, and, using immunocytochemical methods, for endothelial cells (anti-factor-VIII related antigen) and macrophages and related cells (EBM/11). In granulocytic malignancies, whether acute or chronic, alkaline phosphatase positive reticulum cells (AL-RC) and vascular endothelial cells were generally increased. In lymphoid malignancies, the numbers of AL-RC were generally reduced. Numbers of vascular endothelial cells seemed to be normal in ALL but reduced in foci of NHL. Macrophages are numerous in normal marrow, and their numbers seemed to be normal in granulocytic lesions but were more variable and sometimes reduced in ALL and NHL. Lymphoid malignancies, therefore, have a destructive effect on some stromal elements; granulocytic malignancies are associated with normal or increased numbers of stromal cells. A possible consequence of depleted stromal cells might be slower reconstitution of normal haemopoiesis after treatment. The large numbers in granulocytic malignancies raises the possibility of synergistic stimulation between stromal and neoplastic cells.","['Dilly, S A', 'Jagger, C J']","['Dilly SA', 'Jagger CJ']","[""Department of Histopathology, St George's Hospital Medical School, London.""]",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",England,J Clin Pathol,Journal of clinical pathology,0376601,IM,"['Acid Phosphatase/analysis', 'Adult', 'Aged', 'Alkaline Phosphatase/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/enzymology/*pathology', 'Cell Count', 'Endothelium, Vascular/pathology', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/pathology', 'Leukemia, Myeloid/*pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*pathology', 'Macrophages/pathology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*pathology']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1136/jcp.43.11.942 [doi]'],ppublish,J Clin Pathol. 1990 Nov;43(11):942-6. doi: 10.1136/jcp.43.11.942.,"['EC 3.1.3.1 (Alkaline Phosphatase)', 'EC 3.1.3.2 (Acid Phosphatase)']",,,,,PMC502908,,,,,,,,,,,,

Review of 20 years of research and current recommendations.,951-69,"By use of prophylactic CNS therapy, the incidence of meningeal relapse has been dramatically reduced and the length of the initial bone marrow remission has been greatly prolonged in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Pinkel performed a controlled study in which 94 patients were randomized to one of two regimens of presymptomatic CNS therapy, or received no prophylactic CNS therapy. This crucial study showed that prophylactic CNS therapy was very useful both in preventing meningeal relapse and in prolonging the duration of complete remission. Then, many additional regimens for prophylactic CNS therapy were tried on thousands of children worldwide in an effort to improve upon these results. Among the many CNS therapy regimens that were tried, none gave results better than the original St. Jude regimen. Our knowledge of CNS leukemia in general has greatly increased, but the last 20 years have brought us no further significant progress as to improved results in preventing meningeal leukemia. The many novel and innovative CNS therapy regimens that have been tried have yielded essentially the same results as to prevention of meningeal leukemia and as to duration of disease-free survival. Five to ten percent, or fewer in patients at low risk, still show meningeal relapse, and nearly one half of children with ALL still have hematologic relapse within the first 5 years following initiation of therapy. The goal now is to reduce neurotoxicity. Thus, progress has been stymied and we now await some new addition to therapy that will dramatically improve our results. Nonetheless, there are still many promising avenues of research yet to be explored. Meningeal leukemia remains a fascinating and satisfying field of clinical research.","['Pochedly, C']",['Pochedly C'],"[""Section of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, Wyler Children's Hospital.""]",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,IM,"['Child', 'Combined Modality Therapy', 'Humans', 'Meningeal Neoplasms/drug therapy/*prevention & control/radiotherapy', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/drug therapy/*prevention & control/radiotherapy']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1990 Oct;4(5):951-69.,,,,,,,,,,,,43,,,,,,

The principles of this ""standard"" therapy were derived from empiric clinical trials. Thus, it is not surprising that the therapy that had the greatest impact on survival in the group as a whole would be found to be most successful for the most common subset of patients. T-cell malignant lymphoblasts share many biologic features that set them apart from the more common B-lineage lymphoblasts. Some of these biologic features suggest therapeutic approaches that should be particularly successful in treating patients with T-cell leukemia. The use of aggressive, multiple-agent ""pulse"" chemotherapy has been shown through empiric trials to have relative efficacy in T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia, presumably because of the rapid generation time and high growth fraction. Future studies will (1) determine the optimal dose and schedule of cytosine arabinoside needed to exploit the increased Ara-CTP accumulation in T-cell blasts, (2) determine the efficacy of a new agent, deoxycoformycin, an inhibitor of adenosine deaminase, to exploit the biochemical phenotype of T-cell blasts, and (3) assess the ability of conjugated anti-T monoclonal antibodies to deliver a cytotoxic agent, thus exploiting unique antigenic determinants at the cell surface. As more is learned about the biology of T-cell malignancies, further treatment strategies may be suggested to exploit the new features that are discovered. Similarly, it is hoped that the unique features of the B-lineage leukemias will suggest treatment strategies that will improve survival in those patients as well. Certainly, improved survival has already been achieved in the case of the B-cell leukemias and Burkitt's lymphomas, and improvement may also be possible for the pre-B and early pre-B phenotypes of lymphoblastic leukemia.","['Amylon, M D']",['Amylon MD'],"['Bone Marrow Transplant Program, Stanford University School of Medicine, California.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",United States,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am,Hematology/oncology clinics of North America,8709473,IM,"['Child', 'Humans', 'Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell/*drug therapy/physiopathology']",1990/10/01 00:00,1990/10/01 00:01,['1990/10/01 00:00'],"['1990/10/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/10/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/10/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 1990 Oct;4(5):937-49.,,,,,,,,,,,,71,,,,,,

Patients differ from children with ALL of T-cell lineage in that they tend to be younger, less predominantly male, and less likely to have a mediastinal mass or CNS leukemia at diagnosis, and they have a lower leukocyte count. Leukemic blasts from these children are more likely to be hyperdiploid. However, B cell-lineage ALL is not homogeneous either. It includes infants, children, and adolescents; it includes patients with leukemic blasts that either express or fail to express CD10, CD24, and cytoplasmic immunoglobulin. B cell-lineage ALL includes patients with blasts showing hyperdiploidy and patients with blasts with translocations such as t(4;11), t(1;19), and t(9;22). In general, outcome for patients with B cell-lineage ALL is superior to the outcome of those with T cell-lineage ALL in univariate analysis. However, when comparisons are stratified by age and leukocyte count, any apparent prognostic advantage for children with B cell-lineage ALL is diminished. The addition of effective CNS prophylaxis to effective systemic chemotherapy made cure a reality for about one half of children with ALL. Subsequent work has made it possible to omit cranial irradiation and its sequelae for most children with ALL. At least three regimens have offered an unambiguous improvement over the original St. Jude prophylactic CNS therapy regimen. These regimens are the BFM 76/79 regimen, the New York regimen, and the Dana-Farber regimen. Cure appears possible for 70% of children. These regimens differ markedly in detail, but appear to benefit similar subsets of patients. Identification of their critical therapeutic elements is one challenge for the future. A second challenge is the early identification of patients likely to do poorly on these effective regimens, whether by age under 1 year, specific blast morphology, cytochemical findings, immunophenotype, cytogenetic findings, drug pharmacokinetic features, or early response to antileukemic therapy. The third challenge is continued awareness of the acute morbidity of therapy and its impact on the lives of children and their families, together with a heightened vigilance for likely long-term sequelae.

Analyses adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics of study tracts (population density and income) gave similar results; data on other risk factors were unavailable. Conventional risk models would not predict a detectable increase in childhood cancer from background gamma radiation, particularly not an increase of this magnitude.

A decision analytic perspective.,741-60,"Adjuvant therapy with ablative radioiodine after surgical resection of apparently localized thyroid carcinoma remains controversial because of the favorable prognosis of thyroid carcinoma and the risk of leukemia from the radioiodine. No controlled trials have been performed to examine this issue. We constructed a decision analytic model to examine whether patients with apparently localized thyroid carcinoma should receive radioiodine. Our analysis suggests that radioiodine modestly improves life expectancy by 2 to 15 months, depending on the patient's age and sex. This model predicts that the benefit of a reduction in the likelihood of recurrence outweighs the risk of leukemia from radioiodine.","['Wong, J B', 'Kaplan, M M', 'Meyer, K B', 'Pauker, S G']","['Wong JB', 'Kaplan MM', 'Meyer KB', 'Pauker SG']","['Department of Medicine, New England Medical Center, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am,Endocrinology and metabolism clinics of North America,8800104,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Iodine Radioisotopes/*therapeutic use', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Models, Biological', 'Neoplasm Recurrence, Local/epidemiology', 'Risk', 'Survival Analysis', 'Thyroid Neoplasms/*radiotherapy']",1990/09/01 00:00,1990/09/01 00:01,['1990/09/01 00:00'],"['1990/09/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Endocrinol Metab Clin North Am. 1990 Sep;19(3):741-60.,['0 (Iodine Radioisotopes)'],"['LM 4493/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States', 'LM 7044/LM/NLM NIH HHS/United States']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The proteinase-resistant secretory granule proteoglycan (serglycin; Ref. 14), is the most prevalent and best characterised of these proteoglycans. Although its complete pattern of distribution in the haemopoietic system is unknown, serglycin has been identified in the mast cells, basophils and NK cells, in which secretion is regulated, and in HL-60 cells and a monocytoid cell line (Kolset, S.O., unpublished data) in which secretion is constitutive. Proteinase-resistant proteoglycans have been detected in human T-lymphocytes and murine stem cells (FDCP-mix) and the core proteins may be closely related to serglycin. A variety of glycosaminoglycan chains are assembled on the serglycin protein and it is likely that this class of proteoglycan can carry out a wide variety of functions in haemopoietic cells including the regulation of immune responses, inflammatory reactions and blood coagulation. There is strong evidence that in mast cells, NK cells and platelets, the proteoglycans are complexed to basic proteins (including enzymes and cytolytic agents) and amines in secretory granules and such complexes may dissociate following secretion from the cell. The stability of the complexes may be regulated by the ambient pH which may be acidic in the granules and neutral or above in the external medium. However, proteinase-proteoglycan complexes in mast cell granules seem to remain stable after secretion and it has been proposed that the proteoglycan regulates activity of proteinases released into the pericellular domain. The functions of proteoglycans which are constitutively secreted from cells are less clear. If cells have no requirement for storage of basic proteins why do they utilise the same design of proteoglycan as cells which accumulate secretory material prior to regulated release? We should stress that the so-called constitutive secretory pathway has been identified in haemopoietic cells in culture, which are usually maintained and grown in the presence of mitogenic factors (e.g., IL-2, IL-3). the cells are therefore activated and it has not been established that continuous proteoglycan secretion occurs in quiescent cells circulating in the peripheral blood. It is possible that lymphocytes, monocytes and macrophages, in which the constitutive secretion pathway operates in vitro, may store proteoglycan in vivo unless stimulated by mitogens or other activating agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)","['Kolset, S O', 'Gallagher, J T']","['Kolset SO', 'Gallagher JT']","['Institute of Medical Biology, University of Tromso, Norway.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't"", 'Review']",Netherlands,Biochim Biophys Acta,Biochimica et biophysica acta,0217513,IM,"['Animals', 'Blood Platelets/metabolism', 'Glycosaminoglycans/physiology', 'Granulocytes/metabolism', 'Hematopoietic System/*physiology', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, Myelogenous, Chronic, BCR-ABL Positive/metabolism', 'Lymphocytes/metabolism', 'Mammals', 'Mast Cells/metabolism', 'Monocytes/metabolism', 'Proteoglycans/*physiology']",1990/12/11 00:00,1990/12/11 00:01,['1990/12/11 00:00'],"['1990/12/11 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/11 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/11 00:00 [entrez]']","['0304-419X(90)90004-K [pii]', '10.1016/0304-419x(90)90004-k [doi]']",ppublish,Biochim Biophys Acta. 1990 Dec 11;1032(2-3):191-211. doi: 10.1016/0304-419x(90)90004-k.,"['0 (Glycosaminoglycans)', '0 (Proteoglycans)']",,,,,,,,,,,170,,,,,,

It is now known to be a beta-galactoside-binding lectin equivalent to carbohydrate-binding protein 35 (CBP 35). More recently, its identity to Mac-2, a macrophage cell-surface protein, has been established. cDNA coding for human epsilon BP has been cloned from a human HeLa cell cDNA library and contains an open reading frame of 750 base pairs encoding a 250 amino acid protein. Like the rat and murine counterparts, the human epsilon BP amino acid sequence can be divided into two domains with the amino-terminal domain consisting of a highly conserved repetitive sequence (YPGXXXPGA) and the carboxyl-terminal domain containing sequences shared by other S-type lectins. The human epsilon BP sequence exhibits extensive homology to murine and rat epsilon BP with 84% and 82% identity, respectively. The homology is particularly striking in the carboxyl-terminal domain where 95% identity is found between human and murine sequences in a stretch of over 70 amino acids. A survey of epsilon BP mRNA expression from several lymphocyte cell lines revealed that the level of epsilon BP transcription may reflect a relationship between cell differentiation and epsilon BP expression. Finally, human epsilon BP was purified from several human cell lines and shown to possess lactose-binding characteristics and cross-species reactivity to murine IgE. Surprisingly, three different human myeloma IgE proteins did not show reactivity to human epsilon BP. However, after neuraminidase treatment of each human IgE, pronounced binding to epsilon BP was observed, thereby indicating that only specific IgE glycoforms can be recognized by epsilon BP.","['Robertson, M W', 'Albrandt, K', 'Keller, D', 'Liu, F T']","['Robertson MW', 'Albrandt K', 'Keller D', 'Liu FT']","['Medical Biology Institute, Division of Molecular Biology, La Jolla, California 92037.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.""]",United States,Biochemistry,Biochemistry,0370623,IM,"['Amino Acid Sequence', 'Animals', 'Antigens, Differentiation/*genetics/metabolism', 'Base Sequence', 'Carrier Proteins/*genetics/metabolism', 'DNA/genetics', 'Galactose/metabolism', 'Galectin 3', 'HeLa Cells/chemistry', 'Hemagglutinins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Humans', 'Immunoglobulin E/*metabolism', 'Lectins/*genetics/metabolism', 'Mice', 'Molecular Sequence Data', 'Myeloma Proteins/metabolism', 'Organ Specificity', 'Rats', 'Sequence Alignment', 'Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid', 'Species Specificity']",1990/09/04 00:00,1990/09/04 00:01,['1990/09/04 00:00'],"['1990/09/04 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/09/04 00:01 [medline]', '1990/09/04 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1021/bi00487a015 [doi]'],ppublish,Biochemistry. 1990 Sep 4;29(35):8093-100. doi: 10.1021/bi00487a015.,"['0 (Antigens, Differentiation)', '0 (Carrier Proteins)', '0 (Galectin 3)', '0 (Hemagglutinins)', '0 (Lectins)', '0 (Myeloma Proteins)', '37341-29-0 (Immunoglobulin E)', '9007-49-2 (DNA)', 'X2RN3Q8DNE (Galactose)']","['AI-19747/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States', 'AI-20958/AI/NIAID NIH HHS/United States']",,,"['GENBANK/J02921', 'GENBANK/M57710']",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Formalin-fixed slides were stained by the immunoalkaline phosphatase procedure (APAAP). In normal subjects, ferritin could be found only in bone marrow smears and appeared to be largely confined to erythroid precursors and reticuloendothelial cells. The more immature erythroid precursors contained higher concentrations of cellular ferritin. Although evaluation could be only semiquantitative, erythroblast ferritin appeared to be more reactive with the monoclonal 2A4 (15 +/- 7% positive erythroblasts) than with the monoclonal LO3 (6 +/- 5% positive erythroblasts), indicating that H-type ferritin was predominant, particularly in proerythroblasts and basophilic erythroblasts. By contrast, the ferritin present in reticuloendothelial cells appeared to be predominantly of L-type. Patients with iron deficiency showed low levels of positive erythroblast, whereas the reverse was true in patients with transfusional iron overload. Intense positivity for reticuloendothelial cell ferritin was found in patients with anaemia of chronic disease. In myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), ferritin positivity was generally very strong at any stage of erythroblast development, particularly with the monoclonal antibody 2A4. Perls-positive perinuclear granules of ring sideroblasts were not stained, confirming that mitochondrial iron deposition is not in the form of ferritin. In AML and myelodysplastic syndromes with excess of blasts, ferritin could be detected also in immature myeloid cells.

This is presumed to be due to pretransplant blood transfusions which sensitize the recipient's immune system to non-HLA antigens expressed on donor marrow cells. To test this hypothesis, we estimated in the peripheral blood of 18 SAA patients, the frequencies of alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocyte precursors (CTL-p) directed against mononuclear cells from syngeneic twins, HLA-identical siblings or HLA-matched unrelated individuals. The results were compared with the frequencies of CTL-p in 13 healthy subjects or leukaemia patients who had not been transfused. Pretransfused patients with SAA had significantly higher frequencies of CTL-p directed against HLA-identical siblings (P = 0.002), and against HLA-matched unrelated individuals (P = 0.004), than did untransfused individuals. In contrast, the frequency of CTL-p in two pretransfused patients against syngeneic mononuclear cells was very low. We propose that the increased numbers of CTL-p in the blood of pretransfused SAA patients are directed against non-HLA antigens on target cells and may be the result of prior blood transfusion.","['Kaminski, E R', 'Hows, J M', 'Goldman, J M', 'Batchelor, J R']","['Kaminski ER', 'Hows JM', 'Goldman JM', 'Batchelor JR']","['Department of Immunology, Royal Postgraduate Medical School, Hammersmith Hospital, London.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Anemia, Aplastic/blood/*immunology', 'Antibodies/analysis', 'Bone Marrow/immunology', 'Bone Marrow Transplantation/immunology', 'Diseases in Twins', 'Female', 'Graft Rejection/immunology', 'HLA Antigens/*immunology', 'Histocompatibility Testing', 'Humans', 'Male', 'T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic/*immunology', 'Transfusion Reaction']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb06375.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Nov;76(3):401-5. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb06375.x.,"['0 (Antibodies)', '0 (HLA Antigens)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

United Kingdom Children's Cancer Study Group (UKCCSG).,359-64,"An intensive 6-month schedule of drugs was devised with both systemic and central nervous system activity, known by the acronym 'MACHO', to treat 24 newly and consecutively diagnosed children, 13 with stage IV B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (B-NHL) and 11 with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (B-ALL). There were three deaths from complications of chemotherapy (two infective, one biochemical). Five children with central nervous system disease at diagnosis (CNS+) received planned additional megatherapy/bone marrow transplants. Event-free survival (EFS) at 1 year for the 11 cases of B-ALL is 64% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 31-89%) and of 13 stage IV B-NHL cases is 50% (95% CI 19-75%). Patients with bulky abdominal disease had a 32% EFS at 1 year (CI 13-68%) compared with 76% (CI 39-94%) for those without bulky abdominal disease. Overall EFS for eight CNS+ patients is 73% at 1 year (95% CI 34-97%) compared with 48% (95% 24-74%) for those without CNS disease (CNS-). However, only two of the CNS+ cases had bulky abdominal disease (patients 10 and 12) and the difference is not significant (P less than 0.5). A score of 1 was given for each of the following potential prognostic features: bulky abdominal disease, pleural effusion and severe renal dysfunction within 48 h of presentation. Patients who scored 0 or 1 fared significantly better than those who scored 2 or 3 (EFS at 1 year 78% [CI 49-95%] versus 24% [6-65%], P less than 0.04). Two patients with a score of 2 survived past 6 months and another is currently well, but has not regenerated his marrow following autologous transplantation. This protocol is relatively effective for patients who have B-ALL, but those patients who have bulky abdominal disease, often associated with severe renal dysfunction, and those with CNS disease, do not fare so well and require new approaches to therapy.","['Hann, I M', 'Eden, O B', 'Barnes, J', 'Pinkerton, C R']","['Hann IM', 'Eden OB', 'Barnes J', 'Pinkerton CR']","['Department of Haematology and Oncology, Hospitals for Sick Children, London.']",['eng'],['Journal Article'],England,Br J Haematol,British journal of haematology,0372544,IM,"['Adolescent', 'Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols/*therapeutic use', 'Burkitt Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Child', 'Child, Preschool', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage', 'Doxorubicin/administration & dosage', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Leucovorin/administration & dosage', 'Lymphoma, B-Cell/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Male', 'Methotrexate/administration & dosage', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy/mortality/pathology', 'Remission Induction', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage']",1990/11/01 00:00,1990/11/01 00:01,['1990/11/01 00:00'],"['1990/11/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/11/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/11/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb06368.x [doi]'],ppublish,Br J Haematol. 1990 Nov;76(3):359-64. doi: 10.1111/j.1365-2141.1990.tb06368.x.,"['04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '80168379AG (Doxorubicin)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', 'Q573I9DVLP (Leucovorin)', 'YL5FZ2Y5U1 (Methotrexate)', 'MACHO protocol']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In human long-term bone marrow cultures (LTBMC), VLA-1 and 3 were present respectively on 35% and 40% of the adherent cells which included fibroblasts and endothelial cells, as shown by double-labelling experiments; VLA-2 was expressed only on a subpopulation of fibroblasts. beta 2/LeuCAM molecules were absent from platelets, megakaryocytes and HLA-DR+/myeloperoxidase- early myeloid precursors, and appeared progressively during maturation in both lymphoid and myeloid cells.

The malignancies were acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (n = 8), acute lymphocytic leukemia (n = 5), osteosarcoma (n = 7), neuroblastoma (n = 6), brain tumor (n = 5), rhabdomyosarcoma (n = 4), retinoblastoma (n = 3), Ewing's sarcoma (n = 3), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (n = 2), malignant histiocytosis (n = 1), hepatoblastoma (n = 1), malignant melanoma (n = 1) and malignant neuroepithelioma (n = 1). Conditioning regimens for solid tumors were multi-agent high-dose chemotherapy, mainly consisted of cyclophosphamide (CY) 120 mg/kg or melphalan 180mg/m2 and that for hematological malignancies were CY with fractionated total body irradiation (12 Gy). In vitro purging by 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide was performed in 12 leukemia patients and 5 solid tumor patients. Of the 13 patients with acute leukemia, 1 died from relapse 1 year after the unpurged marrow transplantation and 1 relapsed in the testis. Remaining 11 patients are alive in continuous complete remission with a median follow up of 30 months (range, 2 to 65 months) after transplantation. The disease-free survival rate of them was 78%. Of the 34 patients with solid tumor, 21 patients died, their cause of death were relapse in 18 and each one of infection, graft failure and brain hemorrhage. Thirteen patients are alive without disease with a median follow up of 28 months (range, 2 to 107 months) posttransplant. The longest survivor is a brain tumor girl, and there are 5 other long survivors; 2 of them are osteosarcoma and each one of rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma and malignant histiocytosis. The disease-free survival rate of total 34 solid tumor patients is 29%, but that of 17 patients who received ABMT in responsive and minimum tumor residue (MTR) period was 69%.

Eight footprints were discovered, distributed over 600 base pairs of DNA. Three of these contain a consensus binding site for the erythroid specific factor GATA-I. Each of these GATA-1 sites had an enhancer activity when inserted into a reporter plasmid and tested in human erythroleukemia cells. Other footprints within the enhancer contained consensus binding sequences for the ubiquitous, positive regulatory proteins AP2 and CBP-1. An Sp1-like recognition sequence was also identified. Synthetic oligonucleotides encompassing two of the footprints generated a slowly migrating complex in gel mobility shift assays. The same complex forms on a fragment of the human gamma globin gene promoter extending from -260 to -200. The DNaseI footprint of this protein complex with the enhancer overlapped a sequence, AGGAGGA, found within the binding site for a protein that interacts with the chicken beta globin promoter and enhancer, termed the stage selector element.

Conditions for the spontaneous dimerization of a MuLV RNA fragment encompassing the Psi domain have been investigated. The rate of spontaneous MuLV RNA dimer formation is dependent upon RNA, NaCl and MgCl2 concentrations as well as temperature. Thermal denaturation of in vitro generated dimer RNA of 350 nt, from positions 215 to 565, gave a Tm of about 58 degrees C in 100 mM NaCl. This Tm value is very close to that found for RNA corresponding to the 5' 755 nt and to the genomic 70 S RNA isolated from virions.

Inhibition of the transformation was achieved at a much lower concentration of AZT than the suppression of cell growth. Seven newborn F1 hybrids were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1 x 10(7) F647a cells and then were given AZT intraperitoneally, either at a high dose (300 mg/kg/day) or a low dose (30 mg/kg/day) for three weeks.

Examinations carried out three weeks after cell inoculation revealed the following: the HTLV-I provirus was not or hardly detected by the polymerase chain reaction in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of animals given a high dose of AZT, whereas the provirus was detected in all untreated control animals as well as in two animals given a low dose of AZT. In addition, lymphocytic infiltration was not observed in the major organs of the former animals, but was observed in those of the latter animals.

If such malignancies depend on these autocrine growth loops for survival, their interruption may be therapeutically valuable. Interferon alpha (IFN-alpha) abrogates TNF- or IL-6-induced proliferation of HCL and B-CLL cells in vitro and has therapeutic activity in these diseases. We have investigated the possibility that IFN-alpha may act by interrupting autocrine growth factor loops. If purified B-CLL or HCL cells are cultured in the presence of TNF, there is induction of mRNA for TNF, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6. However, culture in the presence of IFN-alpha in addition to TNF reduced the level of mRNA for all these cytokines, compared with cells cultured in TNF alone. While cytokine mRNA levels were diminished, levels of mRNA for the ribonuclease activator 2-5A synthetase were increased. Analysis of the kinetics of cytokine mRNA production showed that levels fall shortly after the rise of 2-5A synthetase mRNA. IFN-alpha may produce these effects by shortening the half-life of cytokine mRNA, since TNF mRNA half-life in B-CLL and HCL cells is substantially reduced when the cells are cultured with IFN-alpha. These data suggest that IFN-alpha may mediate its therapeutic effects in these malignancies by blocking autocrine growth factor loops.","['Heslop, H E', 'Bianchi, A C', 'Cordingley, F T', 'Turner, M', 'Chandima, W', 'De Mel, C P', 'Hoffbrand, A V', 'Brenner, M K']","['Heslop HE', 'Bianchi AC', 'Cordingley FT', 'Turner M', 'Chandima W', 'De Mel CP', 'Hoffbrand AV', 'Brenner MK']","['Department of Haematology, Royal Free Hospital, London, UK.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,J Exp Med,The Journal of experimental medicine,2985109R,IM,"['Adult', 'Aged', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Cytokines/*genetics', 'Female', 'Humans', 'Interferon Type I/genetics', 'Interleukin-1/genetics', 'Interleukin-6/genetics', 'Kinetics', 'Leukemia, Hairy Cell/*immunology', 'Leukemia, Lymphocytic, Chronic, B-Cell/*immunology', 'Lymphocytes/*immunology', 'Male', 'Middle Aged', 'Phenotype', 'RNA, Messenger/*genetics', 'Restriction Mapping', 'Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha/genetics']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['10.1084/jem.172.6.1729 [doi]'],ppublish,J Exp Med. 1990 Dec 1;172(6):1729-34. doi: 10.1084/jem.172.6.1729.,"['0 (Cytokines)', '0 (Interferon Type I)', '0 (Interleukin-1)', '0 (Interleukin-6)', '0 (RNA, Messenger)', '0 (Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha)']",['Wellcome Trust/United Kingdom'],,,,PMC2188757,,,,,,,,,,,,

By using the fluorescence sandwich-ELISA elevated levels of sIL-2R beta were measured in culture supernatants of human T cell leukemia virus I positive T cell lines. In addition to this constitutive production of sIL-2R beta, normal PBMC could release low levels of IL-2R beta by stimulation with PHA. In contrast, this was not found in certain human T cell leukemia virus I negative T cell, B cell and macrophage lines. Immunoprecipitation of the soluble protein with IL-2R beta-specific mAb characterized it as an apparent 50- to 55-kDa molecule that is distinct from the 45-kDa soluble IL-2R alpha.

These results have to be adjusted with other risk factors such as age, sex mismatch, disease status, CMV serology, and GVH. The use of donors different from a genotypically matched related donor is currently under investigation. Mismatched related transplants give disappointing results except in the case of one HLA mismatch. Unrelated HLA matched donor panels have been recently established in various countries with 200 transplants performed with a DFS of approximately 40%. Current research tries to reduce the risk of relapse by intensifying the conditioning or using the GVL effect of allogeneic T cells, to reduce GVH by the use of monoclonal antibodies and to improve the engraftment by the use of growth factors.","['Gluckman, E']",['Gluckman E'],"['Unite Fontionelle de Greffe de Moelle, Paris, France.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",England,Cancer Detect Prev,Cancer detection and prevention,7704778,IM,"['Bone Marrow Transplantation/*trends', 'Forecasting', 'Hematologic Diseases/*therapy', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/therapy', 'Tissue Donors']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']",,ppublish,Cancer Detect Prev. 1990;14(6):675-8.,,,,,,,,,,,,43,,,,,,

This is because of the lack of a suitable in vitro drug sensitivity assay, which is in part due to low in vitro ALL cell survival. We recently adapted the highly efficient 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay to test cells from ALL patients and showed that its results were comparable with those of the DiSC assay, up to now the most valid but laborious assay. In this study, in vitro drug sensitivity was assessed in cells from 82 children with leukemia, 79 of whom had ALL, with the MTT assay. Dose response curves were obtained for 6-mercaptopurine, 6-thioguanine (6-TG), prednisolone (Pred), daunorubicin (DNR), vincristine (VCR), cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), L-asparaginase (L-Asp), mafosfamide, and mustine. A cytotoxic effect of methotrexate could be detected in only a few cases. Large interindividual differences in drug sensitivity were detected. Compared with leukemia cells from newly diagnosed patients, leukemia cells from relapsed patients were significantly more in vitro resistant to 6-TG, Pred, Ara-C, mafosfamide and mustine but not to DNR, VCR, and L-Asp. Improvements of culture medium and methods to increase MTT reduction were studied. From 10 components tested, addition of insulin and bovine serum albumin to serum-containing medium improved ALL cell survival. Addition of succinate did not increase the amount of MTT reduction. We conclude that the in vitro MTT assay highly facilitates large-scale studies on drug resistance of ALL patients that can lead to rational improvements in existing treatment protocols.","['Pieters, R', 'Loonen, A H', 'Huismans, D R', 'Broekema, G J', 'Dirven, M W', 'Heyenbrok, M W', 'Hahlen, K', 'Veerman, A J']","['Pieters R', 'Loonen AH', 'Huismans DR', 'Broekema GJ', 'Dirven MW', 'Heyenbrok MW', 'Hahlen K', 'Veerman AJ']","['Department of Pediatrics, Free University Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.']",['eng'],"['Comparative Study', 'Journal Article', ""Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't""]",United States,Blood,Blood,7603509,IM,"['Asparaginase/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Cells, Cultured', 'Child', 'Coloring Agents', 'Culture Media', 'Cyclophosphamide/administration & dosage/analogs & derivatives/therapeutic use', 'Cytarabine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Daunorubicin/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Dose-Response Relationship, Drug', 'Drug Resistance', 'Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor/*methods', 'Humans', 'Mechlorethamine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Mercaptopurine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma/*drug therapy', 'Prednisolone/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', '*Tetrazolium Salts', '*Thiazoles', 'Thioguanine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use', 'Vincristine/administration & dosage/therapeutic use']",1990/12/01 00:00,1990/12/01 00:01,['1990/12/01 00:00'],"['1990/12/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/12/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/12/01 00:00 [entrez]']",['S0006-4971(20)84859-9 [pii]'],ppublish,Blood. 1990 Dec 1;76(11):2327-36.,"['0 (Coloring Agents)', '0 (Culture Media)', '0 (Tetrazolium Salts)', '0 (Thiazoles)', '04079A1RDZ (Cytarabine)', '50D9XSG0VR (Mechlorethamine)', '5970HH9923 (mafosfamide)', '5J49Q6B70F (Vincristine)', '8N3DW7272P (Cyclophosphamide)', '9PHQ9Y1OLM (Prednisolone)', 'E7WED276I5 (Mercaptopurine)', 'EC 3.5.1.1 (Asparaginase)', 'EUY85H477I (thiazolyl blue)', 'FTK8U1GZNX (Thioguanine)', 'ZS7284E0ZP (Daunorubicin)']",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thirteen patients in total developed PNH (among which 10 had clinical symptoms including 2 deaths, and 3 exhibited only biologic abnormalities). Few long-term side effects of androgens could be noticed. Adult height was normal in patients treated during childhood and so was young women's fertility. No malignant hepatoma occurred.

Our studies in mice have shown that daily oral doses of benzylacyclouridine (BAU), an inhibitor of Urd breakdown, also reduces AZT hematologic toxicity, presumably by elevating the plasma concentration of Urd. We now extend these murine studies and report the effect of various doses of exogenous Urd, various doses of BAU, or the combination of BAU and Urd, administered daily, on AZT-induced toxicity. In mice receiving concomitant AZT, daily doses of Urd of 1,000 to 2,000 mg/kg increase peripheral reticulocytes and slightly reduce AZT-induced hematologic toxicity. However, the range of effective doses is narrow, and higher doses of Urd (greater than 3,000 mg/kg/d) significantly enhance hematologic toxicity. At its most effective dose, (2,000 mg/kg/d), Urd produces 28% mortality. In contrast, BAU doses up to 300 mg/kg/d reduced AZT-related hematologic toxicity in a dose-dependent manner without mortality. Higher daily doses of BAU and the combination of BAU with low doses of Urd were not more effective. Studies conducted in mice infected with the Rauscher murine leukemia virus (RLV) indicate that BAU does not impair the antiretroviral effect of AZT when administered at doses that reduce AZT-induced anemia and leukopenia.

Large body size and fatness, as measured by adult stature, body weight and body mass indices, are positively related to a variety of cancers, including breast, colorectum, prostate, endometrium, kidney, and ovary, as well as to total cancer incidence or mortality in many investigations, although conflicting reports exist. Adult weight gain has also been specifically implicated in a few etiologic studies of breast and large bowel cancer. Furthermore, increased birthweight and childhood stature have been linked to increased risk of leukemia, lymphoma, osteogenic sarcoma, and central nervous system malignancies between infancy and young adulthood. Greater body weight also adversely affects breast cancer survival. These findings are complementary and support a role for positive energy balance in promoting human carcinogenesis.

Gene rearrangement analysis is a highly sensitive and reproducible tool which is useful in the diagnosis and classification of malignant lymphoma/leukemia. Although clonality can often be determined among B cell neoplasms by virtue of immunoglobulin isotype analysis, no such phenotypic marker of clonality exists for T cells. Therefore, clonality of T lymphoproliferative processes is most readily determined by rearrangement analysis of the T cell antigen receptor genes. The alpha, beta, gamma, and delta genes of the T cell receptor gene family encode heterodimeric surface antigen receptors and undergo rearrangement early in T cell differentiation. Identification of rearrangement of T cell antigen receptor genes provides valuable diagnostic information concerning cellular lineage, clonality and classification of T cell neoplasms. This molecular approach is applicable to the diagnosis of occult disease, relapse, and resolution of diagnostic dilemmas in any type of tissue sample including fluids and needle aspirations.","['Cossman, J', 'Uppenkamp, M', 'Andrade, R', 'Medeiros, L J']","['Cossman J', 'Uppenkamp M', 'Andrade R', 'Medeiros LJ']","['Laboratory of Pathology, National Cancer Institute, N.I.H., Bethesda, MD 20892.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Gene Rearrangement, T-Lymphocyte/*genetics', 'Genome, Human', 'Humans', 'Leukemia, T-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Lymphoma, T-Cell/diagnosis/*genetics', 'Lymphoproliferative Disorders/genetics', 'Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell/chemistry/genetics/physiology']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1040-8428(90)90035-Q [pii]', '10.1016/1040-8428(90)90035-q [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1990;10(3):267-81. doi: 10.1016/1040-8428(90)90035-q.,"['0 (Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell)']",,,,,,,,,,,223,,,,,,

Animal models have been and continue to be important to this process. This review will focus in on work by ourselves and others that have used murine models assessing the effects in vivo of the Friend virus complex (FVC, composed of a spleen focus forming virus and a murine leukemia helper virus) and solid tumors with metastatic potential in order to evaluate new and innovative therapies. These therapies include radiation, hyperthermia, and newly recognized naturally occurring biomolecules termed cytokines. These cytokines include, but are not limited to, the interferons, the tumor necrosis factors, the interleukins, the hematopoietic colony stimulating factors, lactoferrin and E-type prostaglandins. For example, it has been found that lactoferrin, when administered early enough, prolongs the survival of mice injected, but not yet infected, with the FVC. Of even greater potential usefulness is that mice already infected with the FVC can be completely rescued from death by treatment with split low dosage (150 cGy) total body irradiation. Irradiation treatment was associated with restoration of the T helper to T suppressor cell ratio, natural killer cell activity and marrow proliferative responses to the mitogens PHA and con A which were compromised by the FVC. More recent studies in our laboratory have demonstrated the potential of the interleukins and colony stimulating factors to decrease the metastatic potential of the B16 melanoma and the Lewis Lung Carcinoma cell lines. The cytokines can act in greater than additive fashion and combinations of therapies are possible. This review is meant to increase the awareness of these investigative animal models and the new types of combination therapies that can then be used as the basis for future clinical trials evaluating therapeutic efficacy.","['Shen, R N', 'Lu, L', 'Broxmeyer, H E']","['Shen RN', 'Lu L', 'Broxmeyer HE']","['Department of Radiation Oncology/Medicine, Walther Oncology Center, Indiana School of Medicine, Indianapolis.']",['eng'],"['Journal Article', 'Review']",Netherlands,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,8916049,IM,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome/*therapy', 'Animals', '*Disease Models, Animal', 'Humans', 'Leukemia/*therapy', 'Leukemia, Erythroblastic, Acute/therapy', 'Mice', 'Neoplasm Metastasis/prevention & control', 'Neoplasms/*therapy', 'Neoplasms, Experimental/*therapy', 'Virus Diseases/*therapy']",1990/01/01 00:00,1990/01/01 00:01,['1990/01/01 00:00'],"['1990/01/01 00:00 [pubmed]', '1990/01/01 00:01 [medline]', '1990/01/01 00:00 [entrez]']","['1040-8428(90)90034-P [pii]', '10.1016/1040-8428(90)90034-p [doi]']",ppublish,Crit Rev Oncol Hematol. 1990;10(3):253-65. doi: 10.1016/1040-8428(90)90034-p.,,,,,,,,,,,,166,,,,,,
